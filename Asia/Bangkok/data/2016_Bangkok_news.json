Instead, government officials seized the land and refused to hear the villagers\u2019 objections.  Could a newly agreed global framework support this community and others fighting injustice? Of the 17 global goals for sustainable development that come into effect on 1 January, goal 16 commits to \u201caccess to justice for all\u201d. The goal, which covers peace, justice and strong institutions, was contentious. Many governments said development should be a technical, economic undertaking, and that justice was too political to be included. The passage of goal 16 at the UN in September was therefore a milestone, a recognition that people cannot improve their lives without the power to exercise their rights.    Related: Justice and peace \u2013 why we can't have one without the other | Will Bennett and Thomas Wheeler    But some countries are now taking the wind out of the goal by choosing a narrow set of indicators by which to measure progress.  At an October meeting in Bangkok, the expert group tasked with developing a monitoring framework for the new sustainable development agenda rushed through discussion of the 16th goal in what many viewed as an attempt to avoid public debate. Governments that had championed goal 16 at the UN general assembly just months earlier suddenly muted their support. The experts focused on what state agencies already measure, rather than what they could or should measure.  The draft indicators focus exclusively on criminal justice, including pre-trial detention times and crime reporting rates. Those numbers matter, but justice is bigger than police and prisons. Justice requires that every organ of the state treat citizens fairly.   If governments and the UN are serious about providing access to justice for all, global indicators must go beyond any one set of institutions. Measurement should instead focus on whether people faced with injustice are able to achieve a fair remedy.  In Raniyala, local women trained by the Haryana-based SM Sehgal Foundation supported community members to demand the return of land that was rightfully theirs. They formed collectives and gathered evidence, camping in government offices when refused a meeting. After five years, their efforts were rewarded. Seventy-six families now have decent homes. The whole community has benefited from the legal skills learned by the female advocates along the way. The women mediate local disputes, monitor and demand better health and education services, and have trained more than 22,000 people in legal literacy. Raniyala is one town, but these women are part of a global movement of grassroots legal advocates who tackle injustice every day.  At the Bangkok meeting, the UK representative questioned the feasibility of measuring citizen perceptions of justice, a concern quickly echoed around the room. Yet it was the UK that pioneered a citizen-focused approach with the Paths to Justice survey that has been used to shape policy since 1996. Today, the World Justice project collects data on how people interact with the law in more than 100 countries. Drawing on that experience, we support two global indicators. The first (pdf) focuses on the proportion of people, from all those who faced an injustice in the past year, who tried to resolve it using any institutional channel \u2013 the courts, but also administrative and customary institutions \u2013 and felt the outcome was just. The second asks how many citizens can access independent legal support that they find helpful. These two indicators would anchor goal 16 in real experiences. The first focuses on how injustices are resolved. The second challenges governments to give legal empowerment efforts \u2013 the work of the advocates in Raniyala and their counterparts around the world \u2013 the space, recognition and even some of the financing that they need, while respecting their independence.  We know that justice requires not just investment in state institutions but organisation and engagement by the people themselves. It is empowered citizens that create responsive governments. What if we lose this battle? Amartya Sen told heads of state in September that reducing goal 16 to anaemic indicators \u201cis like trying to cancel the French Revolution because libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9 and fraternit\u00e9 couldn\u2019t be precisely measured\u201d. The global movement for justice, which made goal 16 a reality in the first place, is greater than any set of metrics. Already, civil society groups in Kenya and the Philippines have used goal 16 to press for progressive changes: a legal aid bill in Kenya, and a section on access to justice in the Philippines\u2019 national development plan. And each country will choose national indicators to complement the global ones.  Goal 16 belongs to the people, and the people won\u2019t relinquish it easily. \u2022 Stacey Cram and Vivek Maru work with Namati, which is dedicated to placing the power of law in the hands of people", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01T07:00:25Z", "tags": ["Sustainable development goals", "Environmental sustainability", "Social protection", "Global development", "Law", "World news", "United Nations", "India"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/01/access-to-justice-for-all-sustainable-development-goal-16-indicators", "title": "Access to justice for all?

It was provoked by the wars of 1978-79 between communist \u201cbrothers\u201d, Vietnam, Cambodia and China, and highlighted the failure of Marxist analyses to explain the nationalism that repeatedly defeated socialist internationalist ideals. The book challenged earlier European narratives by locating the pioneers of nationalism in 18th-century Latin America. It gave currency to such concepts as \u201cprint capitalism\u201d (communities forming around newspapers and journals with a common language) and the official nationalism of states, which Anderson, who has died aged 79, saw as the negative kind. Son of Veronica (nee Bigham) and Shaemas Anderson, he was born in Kunming, China. His father served in the Chinese Maritime Customs service, and was descended from Scottish Andersons and Irish O\u2019Gormans, one of whom, Richard O\u2019Gorman, who had taken part in the \u201cYoung Irelander\u201d rebellion of 1848, provided Benedict\u2019s middle names. He wrote: \u201cThough I was educated in England [at Eton] from the age of 11, it was difficult to imagine myself English.\u201d He gained a first in classics at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, but found himself politicised on the side of the underdog in a demonstration by chiefly south Asian students against Britain\u2019s 1956 invasion of Suez. The following year, he escaped this background, through an invitation to become a teaching assistant in the department of government at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. This came during the department\u2019s heyday as the centre for George Kahin\u2019s model of exploring new south-east Asian nationalisms. Abandoning earlier thoughts of India, Anderson became the most brilliant of Kahin\u2019s graduate students on Indonesian politics, and his eventual successor at Cornell. The \u201cgovernment\u201d label of the Cornell department proved congenial to Anderson\u2019s historical-cultural approach, and he did not disguise his contempt for what he saw as the scientific delusions of American political science. After seemingly effortlessly acquiring Indonesian, Dutch and some Japanese, Anderson plunged into what he later labelled \u201ca sort of love affair with \u2018traditional Javanese culture\u2019\u201d, during two and a half years of fieldwork (1961-64) into the revolutionary struggle against Dutch colonialism. The thesis that eventually became Java in a Time of Revolution: Occupation and Resistance, 1944-1946 (1972) sensitively explored the youth movement, radicalism, and the cultural styles of Dutch, Japanese and Javanese rulers. Anderson had by the time of its publication become a dominant figure in the understanding of Indonesia, through his cultural analyses, his powerful response to the 1965 trauma, and his founding of the Cornell journal Indonesia (1966). His pamphlet Mythology and the Tolerance of the Javanese (1965) explored Java\u2019s shadow theatre (wayang) as a fundamental means of understanding and normalising difference. In The Idea of Power in Javanese Culture (1972), he sought to show \u201cthat traditional Javanese culture did have a political theory that offered a systematic and logical explanation of political behaviour\u201d in complete contrast to that of modern political science. Brilliant demonstrations of how culture matters in politics, these immediately entered the debates in social theory. Later much disillusioned, he would concede that his brother Perry, for many years editor of the New Left Review, had convinced him that \u201cIndonesians were, after all, part of the human species, and could not possibly be incomparable and unique as I had nationalistically insisted.\u201d Disillusion had come with the Jakarta coup of 30 September 1965, overtly led by Lt Col Untung, one of President Sukarno\u2019s palace guards, against a rightist Council of Generals. Suharto, the most strategically placed general to escape murder in the coup, insisted that it was a communist-inspired betrayal, and used it relentlessly to justify the elimination of the Indonesian left through incalculable massacres and arrests. Anderson later explained his response: \u201cIt felt like discovering that a loved one is a murderer.\u201d Anderson, with his Cornell colleague Ruth McVey, sought to make sense of these events through a provisional report on the coup that became known as the \u201cCornell paper\u201d, circulated to friends in January 1966. It was inevitably leaked to wider circles, became a source of controversy and caricature, and was published unchanged to put the record straight in 1971. Its detailed analysis was valuable to all, but its premature release trapped its authors into standing by one of several possible explanations \u2013 that the coup was what it claimed to be, an internal army affair. Anderson was banned from his beloved Indonesia from 1972 until after the fall of Suharto in 1998. Once the Suharto regime\u2019s permanence became clear, Anderson added Thai, Spanish and Tagalog to his languages and produced a range of revisionist essays on Thai and Philippine history. He continued to teach at Cornell until 2002 (when he was appointed professor emeritus of international studies), and in retirement he established an alternative home in Bangkok. His approach required the hard route of acquiring the language before he presumed to have anything important to say about the political culture. Everything Anderson wrote was boldly original, challenging assumptions by uncovering a neglected or suppressed voice. He was never content to tell an audience what they wanted to hear. He is survived by his brother and by a sister, Melanie. \u2022 Benedict Richard O\u2019Gorman Anderson, historian and political scholar, born 26 August 1936; died 13 December 2015", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01T19:04:21Z", "tags": ["History", "Books", "Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/01/benedict-anderson", "title": "Benedict Anderson obituary", "sentences": ["He continued to teach at Cornell until 2002 (when he was appointed professor emeritus of international studies), and in retirement he established an alternative home in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The record-breaker Three weekends along on Star Wars: The Force Awakens, we\u2019re in a much better position to place bets on its final box-office tally. Unpredecented US grosses for weekends one, two and three mean that Avatar\u2019s all-time US record of $760.8m (unadjusted for inflation) is as good as toast, probably by tomorrow or Wednesday. And this will have happened in about a quarter of the time James Cameron\u2019s blockbuster took to reach that point. The pace is astonishing, particularly for the normally sedate December period, but the reason is searingly obvious: being the latest in the world\u2019s most-vaunted film franchise would always be in its favour. Just more so than we expected. What\u2019s worth digging deeper into is its overseas performance, slightly fogged by the fact that Disney for some reason won\u2019t confirm exactly how many territories it\u2019s playing in. Is this defensiveness due to it looking increasingly likely that The Force Awakens won\u2019t pass Avatar ($2.8bn) for the all-time worldwide crown? Taking $900m-1bn in the US and a national-record-high $400m-plus haul in China, where it opens on 9 January, would put it in with a shot. But the fact remains that its American stronghold is not displaying the indefatigable stamina shown by Avatar; overseas, this weekend\u2019s take is already under $100m, a figure the Cameron film exceeded for six consecutive frames.  We looked at possible reasons for Avatar\u2019s unparalleled success a fortnight ago when The Force Awakens opened. Now that the latter has shown its hand, one thing that stands out is that where it is rock-solid in the western heartlands (the UK, $145m running total; Germany, $81.4m; France, $67.4m; Australia, $50.7m \u2013 four territories that consistently placed second to fifth for George Lucas\u2019s prequels), the one big change is Japan. Top territory for Episodes I-III, it has now slipped to fourth place ($52.9m). Is it possible the Japanese respond to Star Wars primarily as a forward-looking sci-fi franchise and that Episode VII\u2019s swooning yet carefully calculated nostalgia, gathering around western actors, is less appealing there? That might also explain why box office in other developing territories (Mexico, $24.5m; South Korea, $23.1m; Russia, $22.9m; Brazil, $21.2m) is good but not the overwhelming victory you might expect from a Star Wars franchise. Barring a galactic take in China, that could decide things in Avatar\u2019s favour. The Tarantino film            The Weinstein Company was cranking up its damage-limitation machine this weekend, insisting to Variety that the omnipotent The Force Awakens was responsible for Quentin Tarantino\u2019s The Hateful Eight only making $16.2m on its US wide release. Adjusted for inflation, it\u2019s his worst wide opening ever. The Weinsteins are probably correct, but the responsibility is theirs for choosing to open against the Disney behemoth. Like everyone, they probably underestimated how much air the blockbuster was going to suck out of the market, believing the Tarantino western could function as effective counter-programming. But even coupled with a set of reviews with a weary-sounding undertone, Tarantino doesn\u2019t need to fret too much. He\u2019s sure to pick up fanboy stragglers who\u2019ve hitherto only had eyes for Star Wars, giving The Hateful Eight legs. The film is, at $62m, his cheapest for a while \u2013 less risky than the $100m Django Unchained, which, with a $30m debut, didn\u2019t fly out of the gate either. In truth, Tarantino has never been the biggest opener, but that doesn\u2019t stop him accumulating impressive box office. Such is his reputation, and his ability to finish pulp material with an auteurish gloss, that he now commands almost blockbuster-size grosses \u2013 these days because he almost always hits the mark internationally, too. Both Django and Inglourious Basterds did over $200m overseas, taking them to $425.4m and $321.5m respectively. The Hateful Eight starts the fightback in over 20 countries this weekend. The kids\u2019 films            All the talk is of how the game-changing The Force Awakens is going to change the game for future December releases. In many ways, though, the monumental scale of its box office apart, it continues the trend of recent years: the monopolisation of the Christmas period by blockbuster-grade material (previously the Hobbit films). That has made life tough for that other seasonal staple: children\u2019s entertainment. The fourth Alvin and the Chipmunks (The Road Chip), currently on $91.6m globally, looks to be continuing a pattern of franchise fall-off; Fox\u2019s well-reviewed The Peanuts Movie is just about starting to pull its weight overseas ($77.1m of a $205.9m total take) without dazzling anyone. There hasn\u2019t, though, been a December-dominating kids\u2019-targeted release since The Chronicles of Narnia in 2005 and Night at the Museum in 2006. It feels as if the studios have started to neglect the Christmas children\u2019s market, happy to fling endless sequels down the pipe rather than develop original material. Harry Potter \u2013 usually released in November \u2013 credibly filled the slot for a decade, but since then we\u2019ve only had the third instalments of Alvin and the Chipmunks (Chipwrecked, 2011) and Night at the Museum (Secret of the Tomb, 2014). And no major children\u2019s releases in 2012 and 2013. Both aforementioned threequels made well over $300m, so the market is obviously still there. The quality, though, less so. Beyond Hollywood            One person holding off The Force Awakens\u2019 death march is toothy Italian comedy star Checco Zalone. His Quo Vado?, about a southern dosser desperate to hold on to a cushy bureaucratic job, opened to $24.2m (higher than Rentrak\u2019s initial estimate below) \u2013 a debut record for the country and better than The Force Awakens\u2019 entire-three-week take. Zalone, working with director Gennaro Nunziante, has monstered Italian box office in recent years: Che Bella Giornata and Sole a Catinelle, the duo\u2019s second and third films, were local champions in 2011 and 2013 respectively. Quo Vado? looks nailed down to beat the latter\u2019s record for homegrown films ($69.9m) and possibly Avatar\u2019s overall one ($71.5m), too. Elsewhere, this week mostly saw a barrage of local Chinese hits making merry pre-Star Wars. Comedy megastar Wang Baoqiang (of 2012\u2019s indie breakout Lost in Thailand) obviously has a thing for Bangkok, returning to it for this week\u2019s caper Detective Chinatown. In second place globally with $45m, the film suggests that Thailand is becoming to China what Las Vegas is to America: anything goes. Already on release, drag-racing action-comedy Mr Six and tomb-raiding thriller Mojin continued to hold their own in the global top 10, the latter now the fifth most successful film in China with $230.8m so far. Lower down the worldwide chart, animation Little Door Gods \u2013 about out-of-favour deities canvassing the mortal world for new followers \u2013 entered at 16th place with $10m; rising actors Shen Teng and Ma Li managed 19th with $7m for comedy Heart for Heaven, following up Goodbye Mr Loser, their September hit; Donnie Yen, playing the much-chronicled Bruce Lee trainer Ip Man for a third time, struck a $5m blow for 21st on the chart. Not listed, as ever with Bollywood releases, were India\u2019s two Christmas biggies. The execrable reviews for Shah Rukh Khan vehicle Dilwale have begun to count against it: the film has dropped back to R138 crore ($20.7m) against lavish extramarital period drama Bajirao Mastani\u2019s R150 crore. Star Wars, just to give you some idea of the cultural odds stacked against it, was hovering somewhere near the R15 crore mark. The future Disney must be feeling pretty smug, but The Force Awakens\u2019 Chinese bow on Saturday \u2013 with Star Wars a little-known quantity in the country \u2013 will give the conglomerate a stronger idea of how aggressive its expansion strategy will have to be as the extended franchise develops over the next decade. It has, to be fair, been busting a gut in China over the last few weeks \u2013 roping in singer-actor Lu Han to act as \u201cStar Wars\u201d ambassador. (Though, presumably, at 25 years old, he\u2019s in need of just as much education as the rest of the country\u2019s youth demographic.) Other than that, very little of worldwide import is happening \u2013 apart from The Hateful Eight starting out on the international trail, already mentioned above.

The stomping boots belong to forest rangers on a counter-poaching tactics course. They are training with Hasadin, a team of elite rangers formed in June 2015, whose mission is to stop the Siamese rosewood tree from being driven to extinction by poachers.  \u201cThe poachers don\u2019t care if we\u2019re rangers ... if they meet us and they have weapons in their hands, they shoot immediately without warning,\u201d says Piroon Pilaphop, leader of Hasadin\u2019s Dong Yai wildlife sanctuary team.   Siamese rosewood is a hardwood species confined to the remaining forested areas of just four countries in the Mekong region \u2013 Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. Renowned for its blood-red colour, the highly coveted endangered species is illegally logged in Thailand and smuggled through mainland south-east Asia to luxury \u201chongmu\u201d furniture markets in China.  Conservationists have warned that with rates of illegal logging increasing by 850% in recent years, Thailand\u2019s Siamese rosewood trees could be extinct within a decade.  Large trees in protected forests have become so scarce that their plunder is more akin to wildlife poaching. Increasingly large groups of illegal loggers cross the Thai-Cambodian border with weapons and are willing to engage in firefights in order to get the highly valuable \u201cblood wood\u201d.     Rosewood logs from trees likely several hundred years old. Photograph: EIA/Mongabay/Mongabay    \u201cRosewood is becoming harder and harder to find. The last big rosewood trees are in the deep forest, so the smugglers are moving deeper and deeper into Thailand,\u201d says Khajornsak Anantuk, a sergeant major with the Ta Phraya border police, who is helping to train the rangers. In the war against rosewood poaching, rangers train in self defence, patrol, conducting raids, making arrests, weapons and explosives identification. In the classroom they study poachers\u2019 rights, GPS mapping, forest law and species identification.  The poachers have increasing safety in numbers - vastly outnumbering the rangers - and in the deep forests the rosewood has to be carried out on foot. \u201cIf they want 60 pieces of wood, they have to bring more than 60 people because it\u2019s one piece for one person. They also bring guards and front scouts,\u201d says Booncherd Jaroensuk, head of Ta Phraya national park.  Seven forest rangers died in 2015 in relation to violent Siamese rosewood crime, according to the Freeland Foundation, an organisation based in Bangkok working to improve ranger training in Thailand.  Most loggers previously came from the border region with Cambodia, but some are now allegedly brought in from as far as the Cambodian-Vietnam border by traffickers. \u201cThe people along the border have got wise to how dangerous it is, so the middlemen are bringing people from over on the Vietnam border who don\u2019t know anything ... sometimes they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s a protected forest,\u201d says Tim Redford, training coordinator at Freeland.  In September last year, 23 Cambodian would-be loggers fled their traffickers upon discovery that Siamese rosewood was their target, and handed themselves over to the Thai police, according to the Cambodia Daily. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of human trafficking \u2026 they are being tricked into it ... there have been two cases recently where Cambodians have been taken into the forest and told that they were going to be working on legal timber projects or on construction work,\u201d says Redford.     A bed made from Siamese rosewood reportedly sold for US$1m in Shanghai in 2011. Photograph: EIA/Paul Redman    \u201cI wish they would just arrest the big guys so the problem will finally stop,\u201d says Hasadin ranger Piroon, referring to the catalogue of corrupt officials, businessmen, and brokers involved in the clandestine transnational trade that carves its murky way throughout south-east Asia. The lucrative trade saw $1.2bn worth of Siamese rosewood imported to China between 2000 and 2014, according to the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). Sold for 200 baht (\u00a33.60) a kilo on the forest floor, it currently fetches more than \u00a330,000 per tonne (\u00a330/kilo) in China\u2019s wholesale markets. EIA reported a bed made from Siamese rosewood being sold for US$1m in Shanghai in 2011.  Siamese rosewood was listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in 2013 in an attempt to curb the decimation of south-east Asia\u2019s remaining stocks. The listing should have prohibited the international trade in logs, sawn timber and veneers, but an annotation allowing for the legal trade in \u201csemi-finished\u201d products of Siamese rosewood has provided a catastrophic loophole.  \u201cThe biggest problem is the demand ... without that, there wouldn\u2019t be the tsunami of cash entering these badly governed countries which then exacerbates corruption, undermines the rule of law, and provides incentives for loggers to risk their lives,\u201d says Jago Wadley, senior forest campaigner at EIA.", "publicationDate": "2016-01-05T07:00:03Z", "tags": ["Trees and forests", "Conservation", "National parks", "Thailand", "Laos", "Vietnam", "Cambodia", "Asia Pacific", "Environment", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/05/thailands-forest-rangers-step-up-training-in-violent-blood-wood-war", "title": "Thailand's forest rangers step up training in violent 'blood wood' war", "sentences": ["Seven forest rangers died in 2015 in relation to violent Siamese rosewood crime, according to the Freeland Foundation, an organisation based in Bangkok working to improve ranger training in Thailand."]}, {"article": "The hacking collective Anonymous has declared war on the Thai police, taking down multiple websites in protest against what it said was the scapegoating of two Burmese men convicting of killing two British backpackers on Koh Tao island.

It added that Anonymous dissuades foreigners from visiting the south-east Asian nation until \u201cThai police make many changes in the way they handle rape and murder cases involving foreigners or migrants and show more respect to deceased victims.\u201d Police spokesman Dechnarong Suticharnbancha told the local Khaosod news website that the police were working to track down the hackers. \u201cEven if the source of attack was from abroad, they will be convicted eventually,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. Thai police are excellent.\u201d The defence team plans to apply to the appeals court to commute the sentence and, if they are unsuccessful, can take their case to the supreme court. The verdict sparked protests outside the Thai embassy in the Myanmar city of Yangon. Miller\u2019s family said after the sentencing they believed the police investigation and forensic work \u201cwas not the so-called shambles it was made out to be\u201d and said justice was delivered. The Witheridge family neither supported nor condemned the sentencing. They said in a statement at the time: \u201cWe have had to endure a lot of painful and confusing information. We now need time, as a family, to digest the outcome of the trial and figure out the most appropriate way to tell our story.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-01-06T04:28:47Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Anonymous", "Asia Pacific", "Hacking", "World news", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/anonymous-hacks-thai-police-sites-over-burmese-jailings-for-british-backpacker-murders", "title": "Anonymous hacks Thai police sites over Burmese jailings for British backpacker murders", "sentences": ["The cyber activist group posted links to 15 Thai police websites, including the Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau, and published several Thai police email addresses, asking its members to hack them."]}, {"article": "Airbnb has released data showing the city neighbourhoods experiencing the biggest boom in interest from travellers. By analysing the travel patterns of more than 40 million people who stayed in homes posted on Airbnb in 2015, the site has put together a list of the areas that have seen the greatest growth in bookings. The list is dominated by neighbourhoods in Asia, with areas in Japan, Thailand and Malaysia in the top three places.   Related: Bangkok\u2019s best street food: a guide to dishes and districts    First is Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in Osaka, Japan\u2019s second city, known for its 15th-century castle, as well being a popular shopping district, which saw a 7,000% increase in guests staying in property listed on Airbnb in the past year. Second is Banglamphu in Bangkok, home to famous backpacker hub Khaosan Road and some of the city\u2019s most popular sights, which experienced 1,230% growth. This is closely followed by the traditionally residential neighbourhood of Brickfields in Kuala Lumpur, which saw an increase of 1,200%. Other neighbourhoods that have shown strong rise in incoming guests over the past year include Capucins, in the city of Bordeaux, Koukaki in Athens, and Roma Sur in Mexico City. Airbnb says that 74% of its listings are outside traditional central districts \u2013 and the site has always been popular with travellers eager to immerse themselves in the \u201clocal\u201d neighbourhoods of a city.

Photograph: Sean Pavone/Alamy Stock Photo    Sean Davies, an artist from the UK who lives in Osaka, says there has definitely been a rise in tourism in over the past few years, especially from Chinese visitors, leading to an increase in tax free shops for tourists. \u201cWe actually rented out a room of our sharehouse on Airbnb and we had a mix of guests, predominantly from neighbouring Asian countries,\u201d he says. \u201cJapanese people I have spoken to on the other hand are generally not familiar with the service.\u201d Bangkok food blogger Chawadee Nualkhair says Banglamphu has always been home to a selection of the city\u2019s most interesting attractions and famous dining establishments, but is now starting to attract a different kind of visitor.    Related: Fashion designer Wakako Kishimoto on Osaka    \u201cUntil recently, the only tourists it catered to were the backpackers who stayed in the hostels on Khaosan Road,\u201d she says. \u201cThai foodies started exploring the places where their parents and grandparents went as teens, sparking a wave of interest in the area among visitors. The realisation that people with money \u2013 both tourists and Thais \u2013 would want to come back has spawned bars, more upscale hotels, and much better restaurants.\u201d Nualkhair adds that even chains such as Starbucks have been making inroads. \u201cWhen the subway stop to Chinatown is completed, the ubiquitous malls and condos are likely to take root there as well,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd Banglamphu could become like every other neighborhood in the city.\u201d     Diners outside a cafe in Melbourne\u2019s Richmond district    Ling Low, a writer based in Kuala Lumpur, says that Brickfields has not traditionally been a tourist centre, though in 2014 a major new shopping centre with international shops and restaurant chains opened in the area. \u201cMy guess is that the convenience of the mall has increased the appeal for Airbnb renters looking for modcons and public transport,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause Brickfields is not in the commercial centre of the city (near the Twin Towers) it\u2019s also probably a more affordable option.\u201d   Related: Malaysia road trip: from Kuala Lumpur to the east coast    \u201cHopefully, tourists will take the time to venture into Brickfields itself, a neighbourhood with quite a few overlooked gems, such as the Sri Kandaswamy Temple, the Vivekananda Ashram and the Temple of Fine Arts,\u201d she says. In its trends report, Airbnb highlighted themes across the neighbourhoods that made the list. Unsurprisingly, areas that feature galleries and art spaces, good food scenes and independent shops feature prominently. According to Airbnb, the site has a positive economic impact on areas, with 42% of guests spending money in the neighbourhoods where they stayed. It also says the site allows local people to supplement their incomes by sharing their homes, with half being low-to-moderate earners. However, the site has been the focus of protests in some cities, such as Barcelona, where residents have blamed Airbnb for causing an increase in tourist population \u2013 and rowdy behaviour \u2013 in traditionally residential areas.  The site also made the news last week after several Airbnb hosts reported that guests had used their rented homes to throw impromptu New Year\u2019s Eve parties.

That\u2019s one more than in the latest Isle of Thanet Gazette; likewise the other local paper I read, the Haringey Independent, whose births, deaths and marriages column is full of ads for funeral directors. But romance is not dead elsewhere. Barely a week goes by without A-listers taking to the Times classifieds to tell us they\u2019re off the market. That\u2019s how Benedict Cumberbatch did it. And Eddie Redmayne. And David Mitchell and Victoria Coren. And Tom Daley. And now Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall. All are famous. All are highly desirable \u2013 to some, at least. And all are familiar with the art of the press release.   Related: Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall announce engagement \u2013 in classifieds    So why do they choose this route instead? When did it become fashionable for recently engaged celebs to make like they\u2019re in Thames Ditton in 1976? In part, it\u2019s the humblebrag. You thought you were being discreet! But somehow somebody saw it and other outlets ran with it \u2013 and what can you do? The Times\u2019s Register section is the classy Twitter: a mode of self-publishing that doesn\u2019t invite comparisons to the Kardashians \u2013 or people to weigh in below the notice about your choice. It is intentionally elitist. But the wider effect is more insidious. Sixty years ago, classifieds were the cheap way of letting people know Gran was dead or the twins had been born, or to save the date for the wedding. Now we do this for free, constantly. We inform people of even the smallest change in our family circumstance \u2013 in grisly detail, with pics. Hence the need to distinguish yourself from the pack, to announce your intentions in a forum not just anyone can access. The noticeboard has been ringfenced; a rarified space apart from the global village.Plus, of course, if you have the cash, even a Times classified is thriftier than a press conference. A few lines of text costs less than \u00a3100; add a black border and you\u2019re only looking at \u00a3300. Still, every penny counts if you have an impending wedding \u2013 and Murdoch did not splash out on an upgrade, despite his position as proprietor of the paper presumably meaning he\u2019s entitled to mates\u2019 rates. Murdoch and Hall have been courting for just four months. But on the evidence of that decision, he has not lost his head. Putting a ring on it is one thing, a box round it quite another. How DVDs outwit CDs   An official sticker on the new James Bond DVD collection flags three key selling points. \u201cAll 23 Bond films\u201d are included, plus \u201ctwo all-new featurettes\u201d, not to mention \u201cspace reserved for Spectre\u201d. \u201cSpace\u201d means an empty sleeve you can one day fill, if you shell out another tenner. That DVD sales have held up so much better than CDs is perhaps attributable to this sort of ingenuity. I recently bought an Alan Partridge boxset for someone unfamiliar with the show, forgetting that to access the actual sitcom you need to know that you have to say \u201cyes\u201d to watching Bangkok Chick Boys, lest you get lost in a maze of Linton Travel Tavern in-jokes. Once you\u2019re a fan, of course, all this is much appreciated \u2013 and the sort of peripheral creativity that\u2019ll be missed when the format finally dies. Bowie in the \u2019burbs Now is the season of the underwhelming David Bowie anecdote. The Croydon Advertiser prints the memories of a Coulsdon milkman who met Bowie in 1969 (he was \u201ca nice man\u201d). Here\u2019s mine: I saw him buy some soya sauce in a convenience store in Earls Court in 2002. It felt apt: for all Bowie\u2019s otherworldly genius, he was still strangely suburban, even approachable (I didn\u2019t, though). That disparity was brilliantly mined in the BBC comedy Stella Street, in which Phil Cornwell and John Sessions played various megastars who had moved to Surbiton. In one episode, Bowie takes over the corner shop run by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. True to form, he wants to innovate. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be some ch-ch-ch-ch-changes,\u201d he says, as he dances down the aisle, past the beans and the scourers and the soya sauce.", "publicationDate": "2016-01-12T18:57:39Z", "tags": ["Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/rupert-murdoch-jerry-hall-celebrity-humblebrag-times", "title": "Rupert and Jerry, and the art of the celebrity humblebrag | Catherine Shoard", "sentences": ["I recently bought an Alan Partridge boxset for someone unfamiliar with the show, forgetting that to access the actual sitcom you need to know that you have to say \u201cyes\u201d to watching Bangkok Chick Boys, lest you get lost in a maze of Linton Travel Tavern in-jokes."]}, {"article": "10. \u201cOne\u201d \u2013 Nilsson (1968)            By a large margin, the most common number used in song titles is 1. One Fine Day, One of These Nights, One Way Out, One Headlight, One Way or Another, One Love, One of a Kind Love Affair, One After 909, One Night in Bangkok, One Tin Solider (Theme From Billy Jack) \u2013 the list goes on and on. The number turns up in so many figures of speech\u2014 in one-horse towns, on one-way streets\u2014that it looms over its numerical brethren like the monolith from 2001, which it kind of resembles. Songs of this ilk are legion, but most are not about one, or 1, or even oneness; they concern a single headlight, a tin soldier, a night in Bangkok. Songs that truly address the essence of one are far less common. Of that group, I see only one choice, and no, it\u2019s not by U2. \u201cOne,\u201d as in \u201cthe loneliest number,\u201d homes in on a vital meaning of \u201cone\u201d\u2014one person, the self\u2014and the longing to be two. Three Dog Night first assaulted the pop charts with a melodramatic cover of this divine Harry Nilsson song, and Aimee Mann resurrected it with subtlety some 25 years later. Whichever version you choose, \u201cOne\u201d embodies number songdom in all its glory. It\u2019s firmly concerned with the number itself and the distinct meaning of 1 in our lives. Making its case through an insinuating melody, \u201cOne\u201d has the precision of an elegant equation solved.  9. 19th Nervous Breakdown \u2013 The Rolling Stones (1966)            19th Nervous Breakdown comes from a particularly fertile streak of Stones singles produced by Andrew Loog Oldham in the mid-\u201960s, as the group transitioned from scruffy American blues obsessives into the self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s greatest rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band.\u201d The number 19 means nothing here, and it doesn\u2019t have to. \u201cI thought of the title first\u2014it just sounded good,\u201d said Mick Jagger at the time, asserting a basic truth about numbers in songs. Sometimes they are there for purely sonic pleasure, providing necessary sinew to the roar of rock. Here, the alliteration of the two N\u2019s mimics the aggression in Jagger\u2019s lyrics, like the \u201cnah-nah\u201d of a schoolyard taunt. \u201cNineteenth\u201d gives Mick something he can really lean in to. Think how anemic \u201c15th nervous breakdown\u201d would sound.  8. I\u2019m 28 \u2013 Toni Basil (1966)            Before she became famous singing \u201cAnyway you want to do it/I\u2019ll take it like a man,\u201d Toni Basil had acted with Jack Nicholson in Five Easy Pieces, danced with Davy Jones in the Monkees cult favorite Head, and choreographed a Talking Heads video. Still, the Philadelphia-born performer is best remembered as a grown woman in a cheerleader costume doing stiff-armed poses in the \u201cMickey\u201d video. Ms. Basil was in her late teens when she started working as a dancer and choreographer. At 23, embarked on a music career, the former Ms. Basilotta had earned the right to sing a worldly lament like \u201cI\u2019m 28.\u201d Written by Graham Gouldman, this powerhouse torch ballad\u2019s chorus is built squarely around the title phrase (\u201cI\u2019m 28/it\u2019s getting late/ what have I got to do?\u201d), and Basil belts it out with anguished urgency. A song in which the number is front and centre this way always makes a powerful statement, and there\u2019s nothing in the #28 zone that\u2019s nearly as strong (although \u201c28 Oldham Street\u201d by Durutti Column is a heavenly instrumental). In a kinder and wiser alternate universe, Toni Basil would be more famous for \u201cI\u2019m 28\u201d than the rah-rah, mutton-dressed-as-lamb paean to anal that is \u201cMickey.\u201d What a pity. 7. 31 Flavors \u2013 The Shirelles (1963)            In Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s story siseneG, the sci-fi master required 31 words to conjure, and then dispense with, all existence. Yet 31 in the world of song has nothing approaching universe-size ambitions. The numeral suffers, as all numbers ending in 1 do, when compared with its flashy, zero-ending predecessor. So we should be thankful for the existence of 31 Flavors by the Shirelles\u2014which may lack the depth of the Shirelles\u2019 best, but as infectious trifles go, it\u2019s pretty hard to beat. I am putty in its hands from the trilled syllables that herald its arrival: \u201cAhhhh\u2014yah yah yah yaaaah \u2026\u201d The Baskin-Robbins ice cream company came up with the \u201c31 Flavors\u201d slogan in 1953, to distinguish itself from Howard Johnson, which was proud of having 28. But 31 flavors is just right; it\u2019s an amount that suggests a multiplicity of colors, textures, and tastes, but not so many as to completely boggle the mind with choices. And a love object named Ice Cream Joe who can kiss in 31 flavors suits the notion of kissing just right, in a way that, say, Belle &amp; Sebastian\u2019s \u201cString Bean Jean\u201d never could. 6. 39-21-46 - the Showmen \u2013 (1963)            No doubt, the Showmen\u2019s 39-21-46 lacks the ideal configuration for the #46 slot. It certainly makes more sense as a #39 song, but Queen wrote a great song called \u201939, and in this game you have to know when to hold \u2019em and know when to fold \u2019em. The rules state that a number is legit if it stands alone in the title. (Hence, Prince\u2019s 1999, as great as it is, does not count as a #19 song.) Here, though, the 46 does stand alone, albeit in an inauspicious position for a #46 song. But #46 songs must be sniffed out like truffles. When you find one as smile inducing as this one, you grab it with both hands. This ranks high among my favorites for a few reasons, not least the record company chicanery that led to the title\u2019s inclusion of the natural number following 45 and preceding 47 in the first place (the singer clearly sings \u201c40 shape,\u201d not \u201c46\u201d in the chorus). Additionally, this slot was as tough to fill as any in this quest. I was seriously considering \u201cForty Six &amp; Two,\u201d Tool\u2019s mini-opus about mankind\u2019s ascendancy to a higher level of existence via two extra chromosomes. Finding not just a bona fide #46 song but an absolute beauty renewed my faith that this endeavor had legs.  5. 50 Ft. Queenie \u2013 PJ Harvey (1993)            I know what you\u2019re thinking: Where\u2019s 50 Ways to Lose Your Lover? Paul Simon\u2019s 1975 hit single is indeed the gorilla in the room of #50 songs. But despite its impeccable craft, 50 Ways lacks something essential: credibility. Now wait\u2014lest you think I\u2019m about to hurl accusations of cultural piracy (the Graceland kind) at the man, I assure you it\u2019s nothing like that. This is purely about mathematics. To wit:  Slip out the back, Jack (Way1) Make a new plan, Stan (Way2) You don\u2019t need to be coy, Roy (A) (A=Advice) Just get yourself free (A) Hop on the bus, Gus (Way3) You don\u2019t need to discuss much (A) Just drop off the key, Lee (Way4) And get yourself free (A)  Simon posits 50 and doesn\u2019t even get into double digits. That is unacceptable. How many other male names would lend themselves to Paul\u2019s clever escape scenarios? Just hop off the ledge, Reg? I\u2019m betting not nearly 50. On the other hand, PJ Harvey\u2019s 50 Ft. Queenie is 100 percent believable. I realize Ms. Harvey is roughly the same height as Paul Simon, but when that opening guitar figure\u2014a swamp blues lick with its tail tied in a knot\u2014gives way to mountains of guitar and she starts to unleash, I truly believe Polly Jean is 50 feet tall\u2014at least. Certainly big enough to send Paul Simon\u2019s overburdened lothario scurrying to a more secure location. 4. Route 66 \u2013 Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole (1946)            A handsomely curved configuration resembling two amply nostriled noses in profile, or two spoons poised to dig into some steaming porridge, 66 casts a long shadow on the numerical landscape. To those with a sense of musical perspective, 66 denotes an American pop standard that dominates the competition all but completely.  Route 66 has been covered by everyone from to Asleep at the Wheel to Buckwheat Zydeco, by rock bands and goth bands, big bands and hardcore bands, by crooners and the Cramps. And though it\u2019s a wonderfully word-happy tune, the number has pride of place in the title phrase, which songwriter Bobby Troup and his then-wife, Cynthia Hare, chanced upon while stopping for lunch during a cross-country drive. Originally she suggested Route 40 for a song subject, but when Troup mentioned they\u2019d be driving on the route John Steinbeck dubbed the Mother Road, she came out with, \u201cGet your kicks on Route 66.\u201d He said, \u201cGod, that\u2019s a marvelous idea for a song.\u201d  3. 74-75 \u2013 The Connells (1993)            Invoking a number for its pre-existing associations is all well and good, but occasionally songwriters find a quality in a given number that no one has sensed before. Think of Simple Minds, and the gorgeous chant of \u201c81, 82, 83, 84,\u201d lending a succession of crooked numbers a sort of majesty in \u201cNew Gold Dream.\u201d  The Connells did something similar with 74-75, a massive hit all over Europe in 1993, but only a modest one in the States. The disparity makes sense though; you don\u2019t need to understand English to be transported by the sound of those magic syllables. Despite conjecture to the contrary, songwriter Mike Connell chose the numbers not to commemorate particular years but only for the sake of cadence.  Not long ago, in this paper, a writer offered a somewhat sheepish appreciation of the song, calling the Connells \u201can inoffensive guitar band who wear inoffensive shirts.\u201d Shirts aside, the haunting acoustic intimacy of 74-75, its touches of Celtic folk and monastic-style background vocals in the chorus add up to a song that is haunting and indelible. The band never capitalized on the promise of 74-75, but the 9.7 million+ YouTube views for the video are proof of its lingering presence in the collective memory.  2. 88 \u2013 Anna Domino (1988)            This project started nine years ago with a song called 88 by English art-pop chanteuse Anna Domino. To put it glibly, 88 is a bit like the greatest Kate Bush song that Kate Bush never wrote. It has high drama, spooky electronic textures, an entrancing melody, and an eerily beautiful melodica solo\u2014and it slew me from the first time a friend slipped it onto a mixtape. When I played it for a bartender/music-nerd pal of mine, who was similarly knocked out, I was moved to opine that it had to be \u201cthe greatest #88 song ever written.\u201d That\u2019s when we started naming every number song we could think of. I left the bar that evening with a handful of damp napkins\u2014marked up with names of songs by people named Iggy and Alice and Jimi\u2014and the seeds of what would soon be dubbed \u201crock numerology.\u201d When it came to write about Chapter 88, I faced a conundrum. Rocket 88, a 1951 hit by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, is often called the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song and had to be considered heavily as the ultimate #88 song. But its praises had been sung and its story told many times already. 88 was well below the radar. Still, I was on the fence. In the midst of ruminating, I came across the existence of a butterfly known as Anna\u2019s Eighty-eight (Diaethria anna), a black, white, and red arthropod that looks as if its wings have been graffiti-tagged \u201c88\u201d in bubble letters. I\u2019d paid attention to vague portents before, but the equation Anna + 88 + made by God was all the sign I needed.  1. \u201c96 Tears\u201d \u2013 ? and the Mysterians (1966)             If forced to name my ultimate number song, I would have to say 96 Tears by ? and the Mysterians. My reasoning? Numbers are singular, so the ultimate number song should be singular in every respect. Songs like Eight Days a Week and 19th Nervous Breakdown are pretty fantastic, but no more so than, say, Ticket to Ride or Satisfaction. On the other hand, 96 Tears is the band\u2019s sole, lasting contribution to pop culture, and is huge by any measure. The song is the standard-bearer for first-wave American garage rock, a genre that remains commercially viable today. 96 Tears is one of the first No. 1 songs by a Latino rock band. 96 Tears is unique in taking a number devoid of intrinsic meaning or associations and making it last forever. Try this simple word-association test: Just say \u201c96\u201d to another person and see if the first response isn\u2019t tears. Does any another numeral do that? Now consider the staggering number of cover versions the song has spawned. Certainly it\u2019s the lone point of agreement between Suicide to Thelma Houston. David Bowie never covered it, but he played the song during his 1979 DJ set at BBC Radio 1, between tracks by John Lennon and Edward Elgar. Finally, 96 Tears hammers home one of the Great Truths I\u2019ve learned about numbers in song: mostly it\u2019s a matter of sound. As confirmed by Rudy Martinez, who legally changed his name to ? and wrote and sang lead on 96 Tears, he chose 96 for one simple reason. \u201cBecause it had a magic ring to it.\u201d David Klein is the author of If 6 was 9 And Other Assorted Number Songs From the No 1 Song in Heaven to the 99th Floor  What are your favourite number songs and why?

These are the opening words of his essay Shooting an Elephant, which deftly captures his discomfort, and ultimately disgust, at being part of the British colonial system in its slow death throes. His experiences in the country in the 1920s left him with a hatred of authority and imperialism that can be traced via his work in the 1940s for the Observer to his great novel, 1984. But the young Eric Blair, just 19 years old when he joined the Indian Imperial Police, liked the country itself. The beauty of the landscape fed a passion for the natural world that lasted until his death and inspired this most disciplined of writers into the purple prose of his first novel Burmese Days. I set out for Moulmein \u2013 now Mawlamyine \u2013 to explore the land that marked Orwell and perhaps find a few traces of the writer himself. Tourists have poured into Myanmar since the generals relaxed their decades-long grip on the country. The big sights north of the former capital Yangon \u2013 such as Mandalay, the temples of Bagan and Inle Lake \u2013 are now overrun, but the south is a few years behind.     Tides of time: fishermen on the Salween river. Photograph: Nevada Wier/Corbis    The town of Hpa-An is a day\u2019s drive from Yangon through miles of rubber-tree plantations where drying rectangles of natural rubber are draped over fences like dirty bathmats. The road was quiet but made hazardous by a quirk of Myanmar; it drives on the right-hand side of the road but imports its cars secondhand from left-hand driving Thailand and Japan. Drivers rely on a passenger to give them the all-clear for overtaking, or simply good luck. You can\u2019t move for pagodas in Myanmar. Every hilltop is crowned by a golden example, but I stopped at one of the most dramatic. Kyauk- Kalat is balanced precariously on a limestone pinnacle in the middle of a lake. It\u2019s a working monastery, but shoe-free visitors are allowed. A monk broke off from texting long enough to slip his phone inside his robes and give me a blessing.    A monk broke off from texting long enough to slip his phone inside his robes and give me a blessing    Hpa-An was sleepy but charming and lay on the Thanlyin river, my route to Mawlamyine. The perfect spot to watch the sun set after a long day on the road was the pretty pagoda of Shweyinhmyaw Paya, which looks out across the river towards the distinctive limestone peak of Mount HparPu. The stupa of the pagoda burned golden until the sun fell rapidly into the jungle. I ate mohinga, a catfish soup with rice vermicelli, lemongrass, chilli and lime, for breakfast in the market the next day for about 15p, swerved past the stinking vats of ngapi, a potent fish paste, and bought bein moun, pancakes smeared with jaggery syrup, for my ferry ride. The boat was a Bangkok longtail on steroids, its engine blasting away any attempts at conversation among the passengers for the three-hour trip. Instead we slumped in plastic garden chairs to doze and eye river life. Children from the waterside villages stopped their somersaults into the river to squeal at us. We passed giant bamboo rafts; a local guide later told us that illegally logged teak was often hidden beneath them. Mawlamyine appeared around a bend, below a ridge of pagoda-topped hills. Burma was one of the least popular postings in the police force, but Orwell chose it because he had family links \u2013 generations of his mother\u2019s family, the Limouzins, had lived in Mawlamyine. Teak made the town wealthy in the 19th century, and there was a large European population at the time.     Mystic river: a view over the Salween bridge towards Mawlamyine. Photograph: Alex Robinson/JAI/Corbis    Much remains of those boom years, and walking the streets it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine a miserable Orwell here, plotting his escape. Crumbling colonial mansions line the main streets and there are churches in varying states of decay. A Christmas concert was in preparation at St Xavier, but all was peaceful at the Baptist church until I carelessly woke a large snake from its slumbers in a kitchen sink. Mawlamyine was in decline by the time Orwell arrived in 1926. I enlisted the help of local history expert Mr Anthony (I never found out his second name), who sent me to the home where Orwell\u2019s mother grew up, but just an impressive iron gate and high walls remained of the building. Mr Anthony explained: \u201cIt was bombed in the war by the British or Japanese. The Limouzins left Burma like all the rest of the Europeans. Mr Collins was the last, but he died last year.\u201d There must be an unwritten rule in Myanmar that there has to be a giant Buddha for every man, woman and child in the country. Buddha fatigue can set in for travel-weary tourists, but I rallied myself to visit Sein Taw Ya, about 14 miles south of Mawlamyine, which is claimed to be the largest reclining Buddha in the world. It\u2019s certainly very big, around 600ft long and 100ft high, but the real fun starts when you get close to it, because visitors can explore the many floors inside the concrete structure. You can quite literally get into the mind of Buddha. Building work has been going on for years but is still far from complete. I walked from the head, with its steel reinforcing bars fashioned into eyelashes, to the toes, trying not to fall down gaping holes in the floors.     Man in uniform: Orwell (back row, third from left) doing his police training in Burma in 1923. Photograph: Georgeorwellnovels.com    A series of dioramas depicting scenes from Buddha\u2019s life and images from Buddhist hell, some extremely gruesome, filled the shell. Small children wandered round looking frankly terrified and clinging ever more tightly to their parents. A massive water slide sat rather incongruously on the valley floor, thankfully well below Buddha\u2019s patient gaze, adding to the feeling that I was in a Buddhist theme park. A new, even bigger reclining Buddha is being built nearby, but the monk who was the driving force behind the whole project died a few days before we visited the area and its future is now uncertain. Orwell devoured Rudyard Kipling\u2019s work as a child and was certainly drawn to Burma by his descriptions of this exotic, faraway land. Indeed his poem Mandalay starts: \u201cBy the old Moulmein Pagoda, lookin\u2019 eastward to the sea\u201d \u2013 a shame then that Kyaikthanlan Pagoda, immortalised in Kipling\u2019s words, actually looks west to the sea, but I guess he and his soldier were distracted by the beauty of his \u201cBurma girl\u201d. I walked down into town from the pagoda and was enveloped in a happy crowd outside a monastery celebrating the full moon. Within seconds I was given plate after plate of free food, my forkfuls punctuated by shy requests for photographs from dozens of locals. Perhaps it was the only time in my life when I was loved by such large numbers of people. Essentials The trip was provided by Intrepid Travel (intrepidtravel.com).

Cutting emissions in cities is critical: they make up only 2% of the world\u2019s total land area, but produce up to 70% of its climate emissions from human activity, according to a 2011 United Nations report. As they work to reduce emissions, governments and public agencies \u2013 which often lack the resources to tackle the weighty global warming problem alone \u2013 are increasingly looking to the private sector for help, says Robert Puentes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program thinktank.  \u201cTackling climate change \u2013 particularly from a transportation perspective \u2013 will require these kinds of partnerships largely because traditional governments and public agencies are underperforming,\u201d Puentes said. \u201cThe public sector often does not have the capacity or expertise to design, finance, execute and sustain policies that work, so these partnerships are helping fill the vacuum with a new kind of problem solving.\u201d In one of the most recent examples, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a consortium of the world\u2019s largest cities, has enlisted an unusual partner to help reduce tailpipe emissions: MasterCard. It\u2019s one of the largest public-private partnerships aimed at fighting climate change so far.   Related: Redesigning transportation: can drivers end their love affair with cars?    The consortium \u2013 which includes more than 80 cities around the world, including London, Bangkok, Cape Town, New York and San Francisco \u2013 says its members collectively emit over 300m tons of carbon dioxide per year from transportation alone, or close to Poland\u2019s total emissions from fossil fuels. The partnership, announced last month, will set up what\u2019s called a mobility management network, which will connect city staff members to each other and to experts to come up with ideas to nudge people to use public transportation more often.  \u201cThese types of measures are all relatively low-cost, compared to investing in a new transport infrastructure, and are therefore of interest to a number of cities,\u201d says Gunjan Parik, director of C40\u2019s Transportation Initiative. \u201cThey also allow money to flow back into city coffers to deliver further improvements to public transit.\u201d Through face-to-face workshops and other events, as well as virtually through webinars, phone calls and a private online forum, cities and transportation experts will have ample opportunities to share their knowledge and brainstorm for answers on topics including parking, ticketing, congestion and integrating different modes of transportation. MasterCard is working with cities to enable commuters to pay for bus and subway fares more easily, instead of needing to buy tickets in a separate step or having to carry cash or exact change. In London, for example, the company has helped create a system in which riders can use contactless bank cards or mobile phones to pay for fares.  \u201cAround 85% of the world\u2019s transactions are still done in cash, which not only weighs as an inconvenience and a cost on our economies, but also facilitates crime,\u201d says Hany Fam, president of MasterCard Enterprise Partnerships. A study by Tuft University found that using cash costs American society about $200bn per year, from fees paid for using ATMs to lost tax revenues from unreported transactions.    Related: Electric cars won't save our cities    C40 officials said their approach to solving transportation problems has achieved success in other initiatives. San Francisco created SFpark programme, which adjusts meter and garage pricing according to demand, helps drivers find available parking spaces quickly and reduces air pollution and congestion in the process. Milan\u2019s Area C programme, which requires each vehicle that enters the city center on weekdays to pay a roughly \u20ac5 ($5.46) congestion charge, reduced the number of cars entering the restricted area by nearly one third this year compared to 2011, before the program was launched. According to Fam, the success of the initiative with MasterCard will be measured over the next three years by looking at the number of lessons shared and adopted between cities and assessing how much these sustainable transportation projects contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions in cities.  \u201cThe biggest thing we can do to truly make a difference in terms of emissions is to get people out of single occupancy vehicles and using whatever combination of bike sharing, walking, shuttles and so on,\u201d said Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, a national, public interest organization which advocates for car- and bike-sharing. \u201cAll of these modes together are enormously more efficient than the private automobile.\u201d While new payment systems can greatly improve the public transportation system, they alone aren\u2019t enough to nudge people to forego driving or owning cars. Finding the right strategies to encourage people to take buses and trains is a big challenge. It remains to be seen whether simpler payments and better communication will make a significant difference. \u201cInformation and technology transfer is very important in the adoption of shared mobility concepts,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, adjunct professor and co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to take many different strategies to accomplish these goals, and we need a vast set of transportation options.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-01-19T22:00:00Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Cities", "Cities", "Climate change", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/19/emissions-cars-united-nations-transport-public-global-warming", "title": "How big cities are finding innovative ways to nudge people to ditch cars", "sentences": ["The consortium \u2013 which includes more than 80 cities around the world, including London, Bangkok, Cape Town, New York and San Francisco \u2013 says its members collectively emit over 300m tons of carbon dioxide per year from transportation alone, or close to Poland\u2019s total emissions from fossil fuels."]}, {"article": "A European Union delegation is in Thailand this week to investigate whether the country has made enough progress in tackling the illegal fishing industry to avoid a ban on seafood products.

Surrounded by thick concrete walls and guarded gates, it is a private enclave of ostentatious wealth \u2013 a paradise for the Vietnamese capital\u2019s expatriate and local elite. Inside the gates, wide roads are flanked by luxury cars, palm trees and giant statues of Greek gods. Across the city, work is under way at Ecopark, a grand, $8bn (\u00a35bn) private development being built on the eastern edge of Hanoi. Set to be completed in 2020, it promises secluded luxury with a private university, purpose-built \u201cold town\u201d and 18-hole golf course among the amenities planned. The first phase of the development, named Palm Springs \u2013 after the California desert resort city famous for hot springs, golf courses and five-star hotels \u2013 has just been completed. Gated communities and vast, privately built and managed \u201cnew towns\u201d like these have spread across southeast Asia over the last 20 years as rising levels of inequality have redefined the region\u2019s cities. Vietnam as a whole has seen a dramatic reduction in poverty over the same period \u2013 but inequality is growing, and becoming increasingly marked in the country\u2019s expanding urban areas. \u201cBefore, most people were poor. Now it\u2019s different,\u201d says Lam, 40, who grew up on what was then the western fringe of Hanoi in the middle of fields of rice and cherry blossoms, kumquat and peach trees. Today he has a small business selling custom-made picture frames out of a shop-front carved from his house. The fields are long gone, and across the road a thick, high concrete wall separates Lam\u2019s side (an unruly mix of motorbikes, plastic chairs set outside small tea shops, and dangling electrical wires) from the Ciputra complex, gated and guarded by 24-hour private security.

Over there, they are rich,\u201d says Mien, 59, who like Lam runs a small business out of her home selling tea, cigarettes and bottles of water and soda. A handful of small plastic stools are scattered on the pavement in front of her one-room house. Between customers she lounges on her bed, a wire frame with no mattress. \u201cOver here we have just enough to live on,\u201d she says. Across Vietnam, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has fallen from nearly 60% to just over 20% in the past 20 years. In 2010, the World Bank reclassified it as a \u201cmiddle-income\u201d country. But as Vietnam has liberalised its economy, so the number of extremely wealthy citizens has skyrocketed. By one estimate, the number of super-rich \u2013 those with assets of more than $30m \u2013 more than tripled in the last 10 years.    Concerns about inequality will grow as more Vietnamese move to cities  Gabriel Demombynes     And while the wealth gap may be largest between the rural poor and the urban elite, it is most noticeable in the cities where rich and poor live side by side. Bicycles compete with Mercedes and Range Rovers, and walls are going up, dividing high-end property developments from the villages, farms and small one-room houses, doubling up as tea shops and mechanics\u2019 workshops. \u201cConcerns about inequality will grow as more Vietnamese move to cities and are exposed to the differences between rich and poor,\u201d warned Gabriel Demombynes, a senior World Bank economist, in 2014. Already eight in 10 urban residents said that they worry about disparities in living standards in Vietnam, according to a survey on perceptions of inequality carried out by the bank and the Vietnamese Institute of Labour Science and Social Affairs. Hanoi\u2019s chasm of inequality Hanoi is an ancient city. In 2010, it celebrated its 1,000th birthday. But now there are plans to gentrify the historic Old Quarter \u2013 where the streets still bear the names of the trades that clustered there: Hang Bac (silver), Hang Gai (silk), Hang Bo (baskets), and so on \u2013 by pushing thousands of people out of the area by 2020. In the suburbs, luxury high-rises are going up and enormous master-planned developments are taking over farms and rice fields. Across the city, former collective housing blocks are being demolished and replaced by private apartment complexes. In the city centre, well-heeled 20-somethings show off their shiny, vintage Vespas while sipping thick Vietnamese coffee at fashionable cafes. Lisa Drummond, an urban studies professor at York University in Toronto, has been studying Hanoi for decades. She says a \u201cchasm has begun to open up\u201d between rich and poor in the city, and that developments such as Ciputra and Ecopark reflect \u2013 and also perpetuate \u2013 these inequalities.      In the last few years luxury brands have surfaced in cities for the new wealthy Vietnamese. Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images    \u201cThey remove a group of people from active everyday engagement in the city,\u201d Drummond says. \u201cThey take that group of people and allow them to withdraw from the city, behind walls; to have their own private facilities in an economically homogenous space \u2013 because, of course, money buys entry to that space, so only those with money can be there.\u201d Beyond Ciputra\u2019s walls, villas painted shades of beige are set amid lush private gardens \u2013 with price-tags of as much as \u00a33,000 a month to rent (25 times the minimum wage). A world unto itself, the complex is a land of Greek revival architecture, tennis courts and amenities including a beauty salon and a post office. The United Nations International School moved there in 2004, followed by two other private schools, and a private kindergarten.

The reality is that these projects are basically out of reach to the majority of the population  Danielle Labb\u00e9     Built in the early 2000s to house up to 50,000 people, Ciputra was Hanoi\u2019s first \u201cintegrated new town development\u201d, and the first overseas project of the Ciputra Group, an Indonesian conglomerate named after its billionaire founder that specialises in large-scale property developments and private townships. Designed so that residents rarely need to leave \u2013 or interact with the world around them \u2013 the company says the Hanoi complex offers \u201cthe very best of living, business, shopping, leisure and entertainment in one premier location\u201d. Today it is one of a growing number of gated communities and large-scale private townships in and around the city. Danielle Labb\u00e9, professor of urban planning at the University of Montreal, has been following the explosion of master-planned \u201cnew urban areas\u201d in Hanoi for years. She estimates there are about 35 of these projects already completed in Hanoi, with as many as 200 more at different stages in the pipeline. Not all of these developments \u2013 where housing, infrastructure and other services are built at the same time \u2013 are physically gated, and most are not as large as Ciputra or Ecopark, says Labb\u00e9. But the projects all share a principal target market: the wealthiest residents in the city. \u201cThe reality is that these projects, the housing and the living environments that are produced, are basically out of reach to the majority of the population,\u201d Labb\u00e9 says, despite there being \u201can enormous demand for urban housing in Vietnam which is not being met\u201d. Enclaves of clean air Real-estate developers and investors around the world have ploughed billions into gated communities and increasingly ambitious master-planned developments. In western India, Lavasa is an audacious $30bn project to build the country\u2019s first entirely private city. From Punta del Este in Uruguay to Bangkok, Thailand, elite enclaves are being carved out of cities on every continent.     Cars are stuck in heavy traffic at a street in Hanoi, Vietnam. Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/EPA    But while security concerns and a fear of urban crime are typically among the motives driving the elite behind walls in cities in South America and sub-Saharan Africa, in Hanoi developments are increasingly being marketed as exclusive enclaves of convenience and clean air, away from the air pollution and traffic congestion of the city. On Hanoi\u2019s worst days, thick smog blankets the city. Street hawkers across the city sell multi-coloured, fabric surgical-style masks, now ubiquitous on its congested roads. Millions of motorbikes and a growing number of cars kick up dust and spew smoke into the air, honking horns and revving engines. Crossing the street can be a dangerous move, particularly for children and the elderly, and fear is spreading about the health impact of the city\u2019s increasingly polluted air.   Related: Inside Lavasa, India's first entirely private city built from scratch    According to Drummond: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion now about how the air in Hanoi is very bad, how the city is very polluted, that it\u2019s full of garbage \u2026 It\u2019s beginning to acquire a bit of a sense of dangerousness, of toxicity.\u201d But, she says, by creating spaces where \u201cthe wealthy can remove themselves from the city\u201d, elite urban developments marketed for their superior environmental qualities \u201cperpetuate the sense of the central city as a space that is to be avoided \u2026 and perpetuate the gap between those who have the wealth to make that move and those who don\u2019t.\u201d  On a late weekday morning, traffic is in full swing outside Ciputra\u2019s gates. But inside the development \u2013 marketed as a \u201cpeaceful oasis among the hustle and bustle of Hanoi\u201d \u2013 it is calm and quiet. Street hawkers are not allowed inside, and the only sound of life is that of children playing in the yard of one of the complex\u2019s elite private schools. Across the city, on the eastern edge of Hanoi, Ecopark similarly advertises a \u201cperfect harmony of humans and nature\u201d, boasting of \u201cvarious open areas where you and your family can go for a walk or simply sit under the shade of a tree for a picnic, and enjoy nature at its best\u201d. Developed by Viet Hung Urban Development and Investment, a joint venture of several Vietnamese property companies, Ecopark is a mammoth 500-hectare master-planned development. Set to be fully developed in 2020, Ecopark is opening in phases, with its first community \u2013 Palm Springs \u2013 already complete and home to 1,500 apartments, 500 villas and 150 shophouses. Eventually, this new \u201ctownship\u201d will have a number of connected but separate areas including a \u201cresort-style community\u201d offering a \u201csanctuary of only the highest standards and services\u201d with swimming pools, tennis courts and \u201cchic outlet shopping\u201d. The private British University Vietnam is also building a $70m campus for up to 7,000 full-time students. On a weekday afternoon, a recently opened neighbourhood in the development is quiet, with more guards patrolling the streets than pedestrians. Beyond the swimming pool and landscaped greens, a shop \u2013 without any customers \u2013 has a floor lamp in the window on sale for \u00a31,200, or more than 10 times the minimum monthly salary for a worker in Vietnam.     Locals protest against the Ecopark development. Photograph: Ian Timberlake/AFP/Getty Images    In a small cafe just inside the complex\u2019s gates, a trio of men who work for one of the development\u2019s contractors, managing a team of construction workers, say they would move to Ecopark if they could afford it. \u201cOf course it is nice to live here,\u201d says Hai, 39. \u201c[It is a] great environment. People are nice here, [there are] good services. We work here and we hope that one day we will earn enough money to buy a house here.\u201d But for most Vietnamese people, living in Ecopark is far out of reach, and the project\u2019s development has been marred by repeated protests from local communities who have lost their rice fields and farmland to its expansion. In 2006, construction was temporarily suspended amid protests by local communities who were losing their land to the project. Protests erupted again in 2009 and 2012. In April 2012, police descended on local villagers armed with stones and molotov cocktails, firing teargas into the crowds, in one of the country\u2019s most violent land disputes in recent memory. Several protesters were arrested and journalists documenting the evictions were reportedly beaten by the police. Across Vietnam, communities have protested against low levels of compensation given for land that has been taken for large-scale industrial and real-estate developments. \u201cThere have been protests, everywhere in the country, in the last few years,\u201d Labb\u00e9 says.  \u201cThey know how much their land is worth,\u201d she adds, and those who lose it are \u201cleft with very few opportunities afterwards. They don\u2019t get jobs in these projects. These new urban zones are not planned to generate very much employment besides domestic services, working as maids, which is not what most villagers are hoping for themselves or their children.\u201d In the area near the Ecopark development, villagers say thousands of families were forced against their will to give up their land, with many former farmers now unemployed and in debt as a result of losing their livelihood. Phu is one of them. The octogenarian former rice farmer lives in Xuan Quang village, a short drive from Ecopark. He says his family lost almost 1,000 sq m of land to the project, for which they received 50m dong (around \u00a31,500). He says this was not enough to compensate for his family\u2019s loss, and that he and his children, who were also farmers, are now without work.

Photograph: Reuters    \u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to sell the land because farmers have to have land, just like factory workers need factories,\u201d said Phu. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve lost the land, what should we do?\u201d At 83, he says he\u2019s too old to change careers. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do now.\u201d Ciputra and Ecopark did not respond to questions about their developments and how they impact local communities and the wider city. Providing for the wealthy There is a lot of money to be made in Hanoi\u2019s gated communities, private townships and luxury property developments, and catering to the urban elite has made some of Vietnam\u2019s wealthy even wealthier. When Forbes Vietnam launched in 2014, one of its earliest issues profiled the country\u2019s first billionaire, Pham Nhat Vuong \u2013 sometimes described as \u201cthe Vietnamese Donald Trump\u201d. His estimated $1.9bn net worth draws on his majority stake in Vingroup, one of the country\u2019s largest developers of shopping malls and high-end housing developments. In Hanoi, Vingroup\u2019s portfolio includes a massive underground complex south of the city centre, complete with a year-round ice skating rink. And it\u2019s not just the capital that\u2019s being transformed. Across the country construction is under way. Singaporean property giants Keppel Land and Banyan Tree Holdings are major investors, along with the South Korean firm Lotte and Hong Kong\u2019s Sun Wah Group. With Vung Ro Petroleum, a Vietnamese company, the US-based Rose Rock Group, an investment firm founded by members of the Rockefeller family, is developing a massive $2.5bn real estate complex along the south-eastern coast.   Related: Punta del Este: is Uruguay's elitest 'gated city' a glimpse of all our urban futures?    Labb\u00e9 says this development boom was spurred on by two key pieces of legislation: a new land law in 2003, and a decree in 2007 that transferred power to redevelop land to local authorities (previously, decisions had to be taken by the prime minister). Last year, Vietnam also loosened its long-standing restrictions on foreign ownership of companies and property in the country \u2013 adopting new policies to boost overseas investment in real estate that could further fuel these trends. Back on the border with Ciputra, Lam says he occasionally gets business from people who live in the gated community. On his desk, propped up against the wall, are three bright paintings, elegantly framed in simple dark wood, for clients in Ciputra. But he says such commissions are rare, with little of the wealth from inside the complex trickling down. \u201cRich people and foreigners will go to big, fancy shopping malls. We are nearby but not many people come here,\u201d he says. \u201cI have enough to live on, so I don\u2019t really think about it much.

Li Xin was last heard from before boarding a train en route to Laos. His disappearance follows other cases where critics of Beijing have gone missing or been deported by Thailand\u2019s China-allied junta. Li, a former writer for the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper, had been trying unsuccessfully for months to claim political asylum in a western country, his wife, Shi Sanmei, told the Guardian. She said Li had fled to New Delhi last October after Chinese state security tried to blackmail him into spying on other activists, threatening him with spying charges if he did not comply. \u201cHe was recruited to be a source before. But he left to seek political asylum,\u201d Shi said by phone from China. \u201cI think he was brought back by the Communist party.\u201d   Related: Gui Minhai: the strange disappearance of a publisher who riled China's elite    Once in India, Li leaked documents from his work at the newspaper, including a government-written list of topics that were off-limits to journalists. India would not accept his application and he was also rejected by the US embassy after applying for a tourist visa, Radio Free Asia reported. Li travelled this year to Thailand, a long-time hub for Chinese fugitives trying to make it to the west, where he boarded a train to the north-eastern border to enter Laos. His wife has since been unable to reach him. \u201cHe got on a train from Bangkok to Nong Khai at 8.36pm on 10 January. We had been in touch those days. The next day, around 7.40am, we lost contact,\u201d Shi said.  \u201cThe [Chinese] authorities said they can arrest him at any time and charge him for endangering state security and for being a spy. He is scared. He couldn\u2019t stay in China any more. He has been trying to get out from China.\u201d  Thailand\u2019s coup leaders, who took power in 2014, have bolstered ties with China, including signing an agreement to increase joint military engagement. In October, a Hong Kong publisher, Gui Minhai, who wrote gossip books on China\u2019s rulers, went missing in Thailand and reappeared last week tearfully \u201cconfessing\u201d on Chinese state television to a hit-and-run crime. Several officials from Thailand\u2019s office of the prime minister have recently visited the Pattaya apartment owned by Gui to gather information on the days before he vanished, a source with knowledge of the visit said on condition of anonymity. While it was not clear what the officials did exactly, the move marks the first visit to the apartment from police or authorities, despite requests from Sweden, where he holds citizenship. Friends and family of Gui believe Chinese security agents abducted him and accuse Thai authorities of complicity or at least overlooking his alleged kidnapping. In November, two Chinese men who were officially registered as refugees with the United Nations were arrested and repatriated by Thai authorities, infuriating the UN refugee agency. Thailand also forcefully deported about 100 ethnic Uighur Muslims back to China in July. The UNHCR said at the time that the expulsion was \u201ca flagrant violation of international law\u201d. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of the Turkic-speaking minority have fled unrest and persecution in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region, where hundreds of people have been killed.

Hall answers my questions calmly. The human rights defender doesn\u2019t seem like a man carrying the weight of multiple prosecutions and the possibility of seven years in a Thai prison.   Related: 'It's a noble struggle': the human rights lawyers taking on big corporations    But this week Hall was officially indicted by the Thai court on criminal defamation and computer crimes charges, relating to a report that alleged abuses against migrant workers at a pineapple processing factory. A lengthy legal drama that\u2019s gone on for three years, the next step will be the trail on 19 May. Back in 2012, Hall was working as a freelance research coordinator for Finnish NGO Finnwatch, which was analysing working conditions in Finnish supply chains. Its 2013 report, Cheap Has a High Price, alleged human rights violations and illegal activities by Natural Fruit Company, a pineapple processing plant in Prachuap Khiri Khan province in southern Thailand. The report alleged that there were dangerous working conditions in the factory, illegally low wages and discriminatory treatment against migrant workers. Hall had interviewed employees at the company and the report drew on his research. Natural Fruit vigorously denied all allegations, and within a fortnight of the report being published, the company had decided to prosecute Hall. By November 2014, Hall faced two criminal defamation charges and two civil defamation actions. If found guilty he could be imprisoned for seven years and fined 400m Thai baht (\u00a37m). \u201cWhen I got that email saying that I\u2019d been prosecuted, my heart just missed a beat \u2013 I thought, what did I do wrong?\u201d Hall says. \u201cI\u2019ve committed my life to helping migrant workers who were abused in Thailand. I\u2019ve never believed that I sacrificed my life, because I chose to do it. So why would somebody come after me with all these criminal cases?\u201d  Migrant workers make up at least 10% of the workforce in Thailand (more than 80% of whom are from neighbouring Myanmar), and continue to suffer from alleged human rights abuses: the fishing industry was condemned last year for its treatment of migrant workers. Yet labour laws provide little protection for migrants \u2013 they are \u201ckind of invisible\u201d, Hall says. \u201cMigrants are in such a terrible situation, and I found myself in a position to speak out for them.\u201d     Andy Hall receiving flowers outside the Bangkok South Criminal Court in January 2016. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images    Hall has committed his working life to defending labour rights. The 36-year-old from Spalding, Lincolnshire, graduated with a first class degree in law from UCL, and began a PhD in corporate social responsibility in Melbourne and Cardiff, before travelling through northern Thailand where he started helping migrant workers who had been left disabled from work accidents.  Over the past decade he\u2019s earned a reputation as a prominent defender of migrant workers\u2019 rights, working as an adviser to the Myanmar government \u2013 he even describes Aung San Suu Kyi as a second mother. He exudes confidence and intelligence, but the past few years of his life have been dominated by what he, and global human rights organisations, believe to be harassment.     I\u2019ve got white skin and media support, but they\u2019re still doing it to me. How would an average activist dare to speak up?  Andy Hall     Staff at Finnwatch were astonished that Natural Fruit was prosecuting Hall instead of the NGO. Director Sonja Vartiala says: \u201cIf Natural Fruit wanted to go after the one who was responsible for the publication they should have sued us.\u201d  Finnwatch doesn\u2019t have a legal team to look through reports to prevent it getting sued, but it does have an ethical code of conduct, according to Vartiala. The NGO always invites companies to comment on the findings; it tries to meet them and have a dialogue to give them a voice. Thai Union and Unicord, the two other companies that were investigated in the report, did this \u2013 Thai Union would even go on to pay Hall\u2019s 300,000 baht (\u00a36,000) bail surety costs \u2013 but Natural Fruit \u201chas never given any comments to the original report before or after it was published, although it was given several opportunities to do so\u201d, says Vartiala. Instead, Natural Fruit brought a criminal lawsuit against a private individual. Why? That\u2019s a question that hangs over Hall. The Guardian asked Natural Fruit for a comment but it did not respond.  Hall\u2019s case brings into focus larger issues for human rights defenders in Thailand and south-east Asia. He believes it is a way to silence him and incite fear in other activists. \u201cIt makes people, especially Thai people, fear speaking out,\u201d Hall says. \u201cI\u2019ve got white skin, I\u2019ve got embassies, I\u2019ve got media support, but they\u2019re still doing it to me. How would your average activist ever dare to speak up?\u201d This sentiment has been echoed by global human rights organisations. Bobbie Sta. Maria, the south-east Asia researcher and representative at Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre, says it could lead to \u201cself-censorship to avoid unnecessary prosecution like this, which is a valid reaction\u201d. Phil Robertson, Asia deputy director of Human Rights Watch, agrees: \u201cThere is certainly a chilling effect on people doing research in the supply chains in Thailand, and I think that affects not only foreigners, but Thai NGOs as well.\u201d      The Thai fishing industry, which employs migrant workers from Myanmar and Cambodia, has been accused of illegal fishing and the abuse of workers. Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPA    Thailand has been in a human rights crisis since the military coup in 2014, according to Human Rights Watch. The ruling junta has imposed restrictions, including widespread censorship and banning public gatherings of more than five people, making it a dangerous place for grassroots activism. Hall\u2019s case, says Robertson, shows \u201cthe systematic abuse of criminal defamation law in Thailand to try and silence activists and grassroots organisations from revealing inconvenient truths\u201d. Last year, an Australian and a Thai journalist were taken to court on criminal defamation charges for reporting Thai naval officers\u2019 alleged involvement in human trafficking on independent news site Phuketwan. The case related to a 41-word paragraph from a Reuters news agency report on Rohingya refugees that was simply reposted on their site. They faced up to seven years in prison and substantial fines, but were acquitted in September. The outcome was seen as a success for media freedom in the region, but Robertson says that while the trial was going on the news site shut down. \u201cThey were acquitted on criminal defamation charges, but their voice has been silenced as a news organisation,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is that kind of backhanded harassment: dragging them through judicial processes that\u2019ll take years and wear them down.\u201d    Government leaders should recognise that these killings weigh heavily on global public perceptions of Thailand  Human Rights Watch     And in December 2015, a 15-year-old Thai girl was threatened with legal action by a mining company after she was featured on the Thai Public Broadcasting Service talking about how the gold mine had negatively affected her community. \u201cIt just shows that if you challenge power in south-east Asia you better be prepared to pay a price,\u201d says Robertson.  For some, that price is fatally high: \u201cIt\u2019s not just prosecution, but even threats on your personal safety,\u201d adds Sta. Maria. A 2014 report from Global Witness found that 16 Thai environmentalists were murdered between 2002 and 2013, the second highest total in Asia behind the Philippines. Human Rights Watch recorded more than 30 deaths of human rights activists and environmentalists in that time. Yet the police have charged suspects in less than 20% of these cases. Small community activists are particularly vulnerable. Human rights defender Por Cha Lee Rakchongcharoen, from Kaengkrachan National Park in Petchaburi, who was involved in a lawsuit against park officials was reportedly arrested and later released in April 2014, but his whereabouts are currently unknown. Even more unsettling is that February 11 will mark the first anniversary of the murder of Chai Bunthonglek, who campaigned for land ownership for the Khlong Sai Pattana community in Surat Thani province. He is the fourth activist from that community to be killed in the past five years. These are such significant issues that Human Rights Watch has called on the Thai government to \u201cend its apathy toward deadly attacks against human rights defenders. Government leaders should recognise that these killings over time weigh heavily on global public perceptions of Thailand as a rights-respecting country.\u201d     Halls says the attention his case has brought to the issue of migrant rights is a silver lining on a very dark cloud. Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters    Hall has not faced threats on his life for his activism but his case has put human rights in Thailand into the global spotlight. \u201cHow he\u2019s treated will have an impact on investigations into supply chains and serious allegations of migrant workers abuse that continues to happen in Thailand,\u201d says Robertson. \u201cThese problems are real, and Hall is just pulling back the cover in one company, and for that his entire life is being overturned.\u201d But despite the disruption to his life, Hall is stoical about what he is going through. \u201cThere are so many terrible things that happen, so you have to put it in context. It\u2019s a lot of stress and inconvenience, but compared with what other people face, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Hall hopes his case will highlight the dangerous realities for activists in the region. \u201cThe level of attention I\u2019ve managed to bring through this prosecution to the issue of migrant rights in Thailand and the vulnerability of activists is really a silver lining on a dark cloud.\u201d Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

There\u2019s no roof: it\u2019s open to the stars \u2013 and the occasional downpour that provokes sudden closure. The sea air mingles with the scent of copal wood (burnt to repel mosquitos) and hardwood embers in the oven; when you run a restaurant in the jungle, the plumbing and mains electricity don\u2019t reach. Thus the wood-fired oven and grill, solar panels and generator, and the blocks of ice in chest freezers that make up their refrigeration system. Werner and his wife Mya Henry left New York for Tulum in pursuit of a more sustainable and meaningful lifestyle. They perhaps didn\u2019t envisage themselves, machetes in hand, hacking through thick vegetation and rotting trees on a cheap patch of land infested with snakes and iguanas to build this restaurant. But what they have made is beautiful; it is at once a restaurant and a family \u2013 you can\u2019t manage in an environment like this without strong relationships, and the couple work closely with the local community. As you\u2019d expect, they buy from independent farmers and fishermen, but they listen, too, picking up local knowledge. Take the cenote underwater cave systems \u2013 these sinkholes were considered sacred by the ancient Mayans and are known as snorkelling and diving destinations, but less considered is how their crystal-clear fresh waters feed deep-rooted plants. The couple will tell you about the particular type of tern whose presence marks the arrival of certain schools of fish; or the sweet flesh of the pale-pink Maya prawns caught by shrimpers along the nearby lagoon with hand-cast nets; which fish you can only catch with a spear and a guide (robalo); and how to cut away the stressed flesh around the wound before cooking. There\u2019s a knowledge and reverence for their ingredients that means every dish \u2013 cliched as it has become to say it \u2013 is cooked with care and passion.     Guests dine by candlelight.

The setting is magical. The food? The food is unforgettable. And it is food that you can recreate at home, as evidenced by their new cookbook. In such a basic kitchen, the cooking can\u2019t be complicated \u2013 temperature control is achieved by logs added to or removed from the fire (and if you want heat quickly, you make sure the log has already been roasted so that it ignites fast). But there are tricks (\u201ckitchen workhorses\u201d Werner calls them) to layer flavour \u2013 great use is made of various pickles, flavoured salts and roasted oils (chilli, garlic, onion) for cooking and finishing. Superstar chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi describes Hartwood as \u201cthe place I dream about\u201d, partly because of Werner\u2019s cooking, but also, no doubt, because it\u2019s such a special place to eat. The risk of losing a night\u2019s business in a downpour still won\u2019t persuade them to install a roof since \u201cthe magic of serving food to a room of people sitting under the stars is worth the risk of the occasional rainout\u201d.

La Pineta, Marina di Bibbona, Italy  Around \u00a350 a head, plus drinks     La Pineta by night. Photograph: Bruno Bruchi    From the outside, La Pineta doesn\u2019t look all that. Sure, it\u2019s right on the beach, but this stretch of the Tuscan coast is hardly the most picturesque. The place looks more like an out-of-season deckchair storage facility than somewhere you\u2019ll find some of the finest seafood you\u2019re ever likely to encounter, and many first-time visitors will probably share my initial reaction: \u201cAre you sure this is the right place?\u201d Open since 1964 \u2013 when the grandmother of the current chef and owner, Luciano Zazzeri, did the cooking \u2013 La Pineta has become a place of pilgrimage for me. Zazzeri, a former fisherman, has a ridiculously light touch for a man who used to haul nets for a living; in fact, with many dishes, he applies no touch at all, serving his wares in their natural state.     La Pineta uses freshly caught local fish. Photograph: Bruno Bruchi    There\u2019s seafood antipasti of outrageous freshness, much of it raw or only briefly introduced to a heat source \u2013 the better to taste the sea. As for main courses, before service, Zazzeri proudly wheels around a trolley topped with enormous wild bass, bream and whatever else has caught his eye at market that morning, giving diners some face-to-face time with their lunch or dinner, much as you\u2019d get at a high-end Tokyo sushi joint. But if there\u2019s a single dish that marks La Pineta out for me \u2013 and one I\u2019d happily shove down my cakehole at least once a week \u2013 it\u2019s Zazzeri\u2019s red mullet maltagliati. It\u2019s simply remarkable, and remarkably simple: just small, misshaped pasta of a colour that tells you proper eggs have gone into its making, a few flakes of mullet poached just-so in stock and oil, a scrap of diced tomato here and there, the merest fleck or two of parsley. That\u2019s it. I\u2019d trek out to La Pineta for a plate of that alone. So long as I can have seconds. And thirds. At the end of each service, Zazzeri leaves the kitchen to take up residence at a desk by the door, where he personally draws up and takes payment for each bill. It\u2019s his way of bonding even further with his customers: a final act of hospitality before we say our goodbyes. Somehow I can\u2019t imagine the likes of Heston, Gordon and co ever doing that.

Add a pinch of salt, then cover the pan and leave the fish to poach over a low heat for six or seven minutes. Once the fish is cooked, fillet it in the pan \u2013 use two spoons to separate flesh from bone. Lift out the carcass, add the fish cheeks and head to the pot, then add more stock if needed and bring to a boil, so the oil and stock emulsify. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in lots of boiling salted water for three to four minutes, until just al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving a tablespoon of the cooking water. Tip the pasta and reserved cooking water into the sauce, add the tomato and parsley, then season to taste. Toss together until the sauce clings to the pasta (the fish will break up), and serve. \u2022 Excerpted from The Seahorse Cookbook by Mitch Tonks and Mat Prowse (Absolute Press, \u00a325). Bo Lan, Bangkok, Thailand     Bangok\u2019s Bo Lan. Photograph: Brent Lewin/Redux/eyevine    When I went to Bo Lan, it was the first restaurant I visited on my first-ever trip to Bangkok. I didn\u2019t realise what a mistake this was. Because nothing we ate for the remainder of our trip had even the faintest chance of holding a candle to this electrifying, eye-popping, enlightening dinner. The restaurant\u2019s owners \u2013 Thai Duangporn \u201cBo\u201d Songvisava and Australian Dylan \u201cLan\u201d Jones \u2013 met while working at their mentor David Thompson\u2019s Nahm in London. Thai food guru Thompson was between restaurants at the time so we didn\u2019t get a chance to compare with the master, but they share with him a love of Thai home-cooking and streetfood traditions, all realised with the finest ingredients; they\u2019ve forged close relationships with local farmers, producers, foragers and fishermen. Some of the little starters and dim sum seemed furiously alien, but as soon as I ate one \u2013 the burst of sour fruit or jolt of mustard greens, reek of nam pla or the crisp joy of puffed rice with a rush of spices and palm sugar \u2013 I wanted to eat it again. If I close my eyes, I can still almost taste the pheasant liberally laced with freshly picked green peppercorns nipping at the tastebuds, so vivid they made any other peppercorns seem like pallid, sickly imitations. Cured pork with coconut cream featured a portfolio of entirely new flavours.     A selection of petit fours at Bo Lan. Photograph: Justin Mott/The New York Times/R / eyevine    Bo Lan was one of the first upscale (ish \u2013 it\u2019s still very reasonably priced) restaurants in Bangkok to not give much of a toss about being farang-friendly: no toning down of those Technicolor Thai keynotes. It\u2019s as if your palate was being re-educated into a regime of exquisite, almost-pain. None of the Thai food we ate subsequently, whether the highest-end hotel dining rooms or the grungiest, most renowned street stalls (some introduced to us by Thompson himself) came close. Dammit. We just had to go back. Even though the two owners have gone on to some celebrity in Thailand, attention to the restaurant is still their priority. At the time, the flavours made me feel trippy and now, looking back, the whole experience has the quality of a Mekhong spirit-induced dream. In a good way, of course.

I\u2019m assured you can reach this mountain restaurant all year round on foot and, in winter, you can also ski there on a narrow track that branches off a gentle blue run. But by far the quickest route is off-piste through the trees. (The quickest, that is, if you don\u2019t keep falling headfirst into piles of snow.) The building itself is a small, wooden chalet with a lethal tiled floor that doubles as a skating rink, and a log fire surrounded by gently steaming piles of hats and gloves. There are only about six tables, permanently full to bursting with smug, pink-cheeked diners; reservations are heartily recommended. Perhaps uniquely among restaurants in this corner of the Haute-Savoie, you won\u2019t find any molten cheese on the short menu. The owners hail from Alsace, land of smoked pork, choucroute and enormous sausages, served with vast bowls of rosti (refilled on request) and bookended by charcuterie and cornichons, and a dessert trolley groaning with strudel. The only cheese comes in tart form, and very good it is, too, though the onion version is even better (especially paired with a glass of crisp Alsatian pinot gris). If she likes you, Madame will leave a bottle of homemade firewater on the table along with the bill (cash only), to be poured round as liberally as you feel is safe before heading back into the forest. That fateful first visit, we eventually staggered out to find Mont Blanc no longer visible from the little terrace and all the lifts closed. A friend lost a ski, then the rest of us lost the rescue party; we ended up having to pay a passing local to drive us all back to town. But, warmed by schnapps and the lingering, convivial satisfaction of a lunch well done, not one further tear was shed.

Mohamed Apandi Ali, a former judge with ruling party links, who was appointed attorney general by Najib last year, said on Tuesday that $681m (\u00a3475m) secretly deposited in Najib\u2019s personal bank accounts was a private gift from the Saudi royal family.   Related: Malaysian prime minister cleared of corruption over $681m Saudi 'gift'    Apandi refused to address the central question of why the gift was made and for what purpose. The deposit came to light last July after foreign media investigations [paywall] into a debt-ridden state fund run by Najib known as 1MDB.  \u201cI am satisfied with the findings that the funds were not a form of graft or bribery. There was no reason given as to why the donation was made to PM Najib, that is between him and the Saudi family,\u201d Apandi said. Apandi offered no explanation as to why $620m was apparently later returned to the Saudis, and what happened to the remaining $61m. The Saudi regime has declined to discuss the matter. Najib has always denied any wrongdoing. His unmatched influence as prime minister since 2009 in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, and his leadership of its main political component, the United Malays National Organisation, in power continuously since 1957, makes him a difficult man to challenge. Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia\u2019s best-known, much-persecuted opposition leader, nearly defeated Najib in the 2013 elections. He has has since been jailed again, on what are widely viewed as trumped-up charges. In November a UN human rights group said Anwar\u2019s detention was illegal and his treatment in prison cruel and degrading. Mass street protests last August failed to dislodge Najib. An ongoing currency and foreign investment slump, related to the scandal, and a demand from Malaysia\u2019s unofficial founding father, Mahathir Mohamad, that he resign have also left him unmoved.

Photograph: Mohd Rasfan/AFP/Getty Images    Instead, Najib has silenced critics, sacking ministers, appointing loyalists, and dismissing the previous attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail, who was leading corruption inquiries. Under the guise of fighting terrorism, Najib has also taken additional powers to control media and opposition, notably last month\u2019s draconian new national security council law. Human rights groups described the law as a step towards dictatorship. In a statement on Tuesday Najib called the scandal an \u201cunnecessary distraction\u201d and claimed the matter had been \u201ccomprehensively put to rest\u201d. However, the 1MDB affair reportedly remains under legal investigation in Switzerland, Hong Kong and the US. The absence of an international outcry about this failure of democratic accountability in Malaysia is troubling. Visiting Kuala Lumpur last July, David Cameron went through the motions, urging Najib to clean up his act. Likewise, at a November meeting, Barack Obama said he had impressed [paywall] upon Najib the importance of accountability and transparency. In the case of the US and Britain, the former colonial power, the reluctance to make waves may be explained by the high priority they attach to keeping Malaysia, a moderate, pro-western, mostly Sunni Muslim ally, onside in the age of Islamic State and global jihad. The Obama administration also views Malaysia as part of its informal regional bulwark against China\u2019s rise, and as an important Asia-Pacific trading partner. Similar considerations appear to influence western attitudes towards the repressive behaviour of the junta in neighbouring Thailand. Despite earlier promises, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta\u2019s leader, has still not set a date for free elections.    Related: Bangkok bombing wrongfoots Thailand's junta    In Vietnam, meanwhile, where George W Bush\u2019s administration began a process of rapprochement in the early 2000s, the US continues to turn a blind eye to one-party rule, partly in return for Vietnamese support over Chinese maritime expansionism.  Even this modest aim is at risk as this week\u2019s Communist party congress prepares to dump Nguyen Tan Dung, the country\u2019s moderately reformist prime minister, in favour of the authoritarian old guard.  Amid the gloom, Myanmar may offer a glimmer of regional light after last November\u2019s landslide election victory of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi. The NLD is due to take its seats in the new parliament on Monday. But despite assurances about a proper democratic transition, Myanmar\u2019s military seems reluctant to hand over real control. It retains sweeping constitutional powers over security, budgets, borders and external relations, and will have a veto over who becomes the next president.

The prolific Finnegan writes in a mode he calls \u201cpaltry realism\u201d and has completed the 13th volume of his\u00a011-volume novel, Nevah Trust a\u00a0Christian: \u201cPaltry realism means writing shit, he said. What I mean to say is, what is art, only a howl against death. Are we agreed on this, Rob? he demanded. Yet why is it that so much art tries to do the opposite, to ignore, even to deny death? Have you thought about this?\u201d It\u2019s a bold opening: a story that sets up a metafictional diving board and leaps from it with misanthropic glee. I\u00a0cackled at Finnegan\u2019s takedown of the tourists who flock to Dublin for Bloomsday: \u201cfat, mental penguins\u201d, indeed. As the Ulysses approaches port, however, Finnegan lapses into self-absorbed mumbling and doubt creeps in. Readerly doubt follows. Is the diving board a plank? Is this collection itself in the paltry realistic mode? This\u00a0isn\u2019t going to be deliberately shit,\u00a0is it? Finnegan is one of a cast of alienated misfits, drunks and paranoiacs who\u00a0people the followup to Doyle\u2019s well\u2011received debut novel, Here Are the\u00a0Young Men. Many stories tell the tales of friends or acquaintances of a\u00a0first-person narrator; yet more are of\u00a0writers struggling with demons, depression and weltschmerz. Lest we\u00a0fall too easily into the trap of assuming that the narrating \u201cI\u201d is identical to the author, \u201csome frazzled drifter called Rob Doyle\u201d crops up in a\u00a0couple of\u00a0episodes. Nietzsche hovers over the entire set, not so much as a structuring or orientating force of thought, more as an obsession to be referenced. \u201cOn Nietzsche\u201d details its protagonist\u2019s failure to write a book that would deal with the philosopher, or to make a Nietzsche tour to Turin, as his Russian girlfriend abandons him and his life shrinks to nothing. The narrator becomes convinced that he has destroyed his own employment prospects with a story about sexual aberration: \u201cAs soon as I had sobered up, I realised that publishing this story online, and framing it in such a way that the reader might assume it expressed my true shameful fantasies, or else was straightforwardly autobiographical, might not have been the wisest of moves.\u201d Given that we\u2019re reading stories with a pronounced focus on misadventures with drugs and sex, this commentary reads like a\u00a0tempting of fate and a talismanic warding off of demons rolled into one. The Bataille-through-new-media \u201cAnus \u2013 Black Sun\u201d is magnetically effective: a William Gibson conceit with soundtrack by Coil. The first-person text-speak portrayal of deep psychosis laced with apocalyptic delusion in \u201cFinal Email from P Cranley\u201d has an authentically manic energy. A\u00a0cycle titled \u201cOutposts\u201d is less successful. Cutting up sources listed on an acknowledgments page that include, inter alia, \u201cdreams, memories, Colm To\u00edb\u00edn, radio, T\u00f5nu \u00d5nnepalu, Georges Bataille [...] Killian Turner, Andrei Tarkovsky, an abandoned novel set in Bangkok, my old notebooks, and Aka Morchiladze\u201d, it does not approach the sum of its multifarious parts. That list speaks volumes about the themes of this collection, though: Irish literature, media forms, obscure authors, global travel, self-cannibalisation and a couple of canonical transgressors. The pieces that result from this compositional strategy have a tendency to juxtapose portentous philosophical pronouncements and the self-consciously grubby: \u201cIn Naples a whore sucked me off in a room like this, I couldn\u2019t manage to come ... But Nietzsche lived in such a way, he thinks,\u00a0dancing naked in a frugal room in Turin. Every day a ledge between the prison and the madhouse. \u2018My love, all the world is aflame.\u2019\u201d That juxtaposition might be the point, but if so, I couldn\u2019t discern its merit. These pieces lack the precision of the great experiments in\u00a0a\u00a0similar mode; the controlled, renegade scientism of a Ballard or a\u00a0Burroughs. Instead they come worryingly close to\u00a0the poetry of Jim Morrison. That\u2019s a\u00a0definite stumble on the plank. \u201cExiled in the Infinite \u2013 Killian Turner, Ireland\u2019s Vanished Literary Outlaw\u201d combines Lovecraftian themes with occult artistic experimentation. Anything on Turner is always welcome, so difficult to access are his works, but\u00a0this biographical account doesn\u2019t get us much closer to the real thing. With another cycle of stories and the\u00a0final piece working the pseudo-biographical riff\u00a0further, I couldn\u2019t help\u00a0but wonder how this collection might have played out had the philosophically minded \u201cRob Doyle\u201d challenged the romanticised nihilism of John-Paul Finnegan\u2019s \u201chowl against death\u201d. This faded motto gives the book an aesthetic guide and a thematic\u00a0impetus, which it pursues to\u00a0appropriately doomy ends; as a programme for experimental writing, however, it\u00a0offers little in the way of formal possibility. \u2022 Mark Blacklock\u2019s I\u2019m Jack is published by Granta.

We spent much of the winter right by the sea in the South Hams, minutes from the coast path, discovering secret sandy beaches and rocky, pool-filled coves. The kids loved it all \u2013 there was so much freedom to simply play. Now the year\u2019s over it\u2019s great to reflect on our amazing adventure. Whatever happens next it\u2019s a shared experience we\u2019ll treasure forever. We\u2019re moving back into a house, but we\u2019re definitely not going back to \u201cnormal\u201d. We\u2019ll be focusing on living sustainably: ditching the car and adventuring from our doorstep.

I leapt at the chance to escape a depressed Europe though I would never have been brave enough to leave my secure, employed life behind without a firm job offer. It seemed a dream come true.    Here was a city with hotels, fabulous restaurants and plenty of tourists, but with not a single decent beach restaurant  Portia Hart     But in December 2014, my employer told me that they\u2019d decided against Bogot\u00e1, would I mind relocating to Cartagena in the north? No problem. A month later, after I\u2019d arrived, they informed me there would in fact be no office, no company and no job. So there I was in Cartagena, with only slightly more Spanish than I had on arrival, and a lot less of a plan. Fortunately it\u2019s a small community, and within weeks I had met Lina Bustillo, who had also lived in France. We had friends in common, and we bonded over a shared frustration at the lack of places in Cartagena to eat a good dinner after enjoying the Caribbean beaches. Here was a city stuffed with hotels, fabulous restaurants and tourists arriving by plane, cruise ship and bus, but with not a single decent beach restaurant.   Related: Beth Orton's Cartagena, Colombia    Lina\u2019s family had an empty piece of land about 30 minutes\u2019 drive from central Cartagena and had been considering what to do with it for some time. I spoke to friends back in England and they all confirmed what I was thinking \u2013 that very rarely in life do you find yourself in the position I was in: a ready market, no competition, and extremely low barriers to entry. I chucked in the last of my savings, a few thousand pounds, and begged and borrowed a similar amount from friends and family. We built our beach club and restaurant, El Pescador de Colores, with less than 10% of what the equivalent would have cost in Europe. We opened last November, just before the high season started in December. I wouldn\u2019t say it has been easy and it\u2019s certainly no instant goldmine. \u201cI own a beach bar in Colombia,\u201d is definitely not as glamorous in reality as it sounds in the pub back home. We work 18 hours a day, including doing all the business\u2019s laundry. I\u2019ve had to learn the restaurant trade, Spanish and the Colombian fiscal system from scratch, and everything takes longer, and is more complicated than it would be in western Europe, say. It\u2019s normal for deliveries to arrive days late (if at all), with half of what you ordered missing. That said, we provide 10 local people, and a couple of foreigners who\u2019ve settled here, with jobs. We are helping to provide basic education and professional training for our staff, as well as English lessons. My office is a beach, I love being my own boss, and we get a huge amount of satisfaction from the small role we play in supporting the local community. I get to live in the Caribbean, instead of saving all year to pay for a week to come here. On days off we have the beach and the sea on our doorstep, as well as calling one of the world\u2019s most beautiful colonial cities home (Cartagena is a Unesco world heritage site).I\u2019m certainly not planning on returning to the UK any time soon. \u2018My crazy yachting years\u2019     Charlotte Drury during her yachting years    Charlotte Drury, 37, from East Sussex, used to work on yachts in the Med and CaribbeanIn my 20s I worked on yachts, cooking and cleaning my way around the Med and Caribbean hoping that I would earn enough from tropical serfdom to fund more independent and intrepid travel. I fell into the industry after working on a cruise ship. I began doing day work in Miami, which led to stewardessing on charters to the Florida Keys and Bahamas, and eventually to becoming a crew chef and cookingfor boat owners too. It was lucrative but could be brutal \u2013 not just the 18-hour days, but the crew were often macho and the culture materialistic. Sometimes it was boring \u2013 once we had to clean a 50ft yacht with cottonbuds!   Related: New Puerto Rico flight brings idyllic Vieques within reach    But the yacht world was also wonderful and dynamic. I often worked with kindred spirits and laughed a lot. I learned how to cook by helping chefs and had a few stints at modelling for brochures and delivering catamarans around the Bahamas, which was tremendous fun. The best perks were definitely the adventures in beautiful places during downtime, crossing the Atlantic was amazing \u2013 to feel so far from land and see whales and dolphins, and sunset after sunset\u2026 Unfortunately I fell foul of a few boats in the south of France. I\u2019m too clumsy and loud to be a good professional yachtie \u2013 one owner\u2019s wife took great dislike to me and had me fired. She\u2019d had so much plastic surgery and botox that only her nostrils moved \u2013 it was very hard to read her face. I decided to work on land after that, and wound up life modelling in Antibes and teaching English to ladies who were obsessed with Lady Diana and some men who wanted to learn pickup lines for a stag-do in Prague. I wanted to improve my French so I answered a newspaper advert to work in a bar called Fanys in Corsica. I didn\u2019t realise it was a (barely concealed) strip club until it was too late and although I didn\u2019t have to dance they expected me to talk to the gentlemen and sell as much champagne as possible. I learnt to say pas toucher rather quickly and became a little more fluent in French slang. Now that I am a rural housewife with a small child, living a calm and ordered life in Sussex, I look back to my crazy yachting years and smile. For the duration in rural Spain Paul, 56, and Sally Wright, 51, moved to a mountainous area near BenidormIn 2004 I was a financial controller in manufacturing and Sally, my wife, was customer services manager with a building society. Maybe it was a mid-life crisis, but we just could not face the prospect of another 25 years doing the same. Without any clear plan, we sold our house and moved to Spain, eventually buying a house in a remote mountain community: the Vall de Gallinera, about 40km from Benidorm.   Related: Weekend in Valencia: a complete itinerary    Our children, George, then seven, and Lucy, then four, went to a local school, where we discovered to our consternation that Spanish was not the first language. We had not realised until then that Valenciana, a dialect of Catalan, was what was generally spoken. That was not the only shock. The first winter we had temperatures plummet to -4C and the house had no heating. That\u2019s when I realised I shouldn\u2019t have given away the big pile of wood that the previous owners had helpfully left. We have been through a variety of jobs, but now Sally serves in the village bar/restaurant and I\u2019ve become a guide with a community tourism project (tothecoreofthings.com) which aims to preserve and promote the cultural, natural and human heritage of the area. We act as hosts to small groups of visitors, no more than six people, introducing them to the village and local people. We wanted to \u201cwork to live\u201d rather than \u201clive to work\u201d and broadly speaking it has worked out. We are here to stay. A long-term affair with Italy      Londoner Doreen Russell, 53, followed her love of Italy to a job in ParmaI fell for Italy when I visited Florence as a student in the 1980s. I regularly returned to the country and fantasised about moving there. On one trip I inadvertently propositioned a waiter in my tourist\u2019s Italian, and so I decided to learn the language. Perhaps deep down I thought that mastering Italian would take me closer to my dream \u2013 an Italian farmhouse with rare-breed goats and a new career as a cheesemaker. I don\u2019t have a farm or goats, and I buy my cheese from the market, but these days I do live in Italy. I came here to work seven years ago, transferring the skills I acquired as an environmental health officer in London to a new job with the European food agency in Parma.   Related: 10 of the best places to stay in Italy for foodies    I was fortunate in that I already spoke the language and was joining an international organisation geared to helping expats, so I was protected from the more arcane peculiarities of Italian bureaucracy. This meant I got a codice fiscale (tax code \u2013 a prerequistie for accomplishing even quite simple tasks), a bank account, an apartment, internet connection and a medical card without having to shout at anyone. But I did spend a lot of time standing in queues and filling out forms, lots of forms...  I love it here. It was a bit of a shock after London \u2013 Parma is a compact, bike-friendly, easy-to-live-in kind of place that some might find a little too slow. And after a long day at work, living in one city can seem pretty much like any other. Oh, and the weather can be extreme \u2013 perishing winters and hot, humid summers. But we\u2019re an hour by train from big cities such as Bologna and Milan (add 30 minutes for a Florence fix), two hours from the beaches or the mountains, and never more than 100 metres from a decent trattoria.  Parma is my home but I miss the usual things: family and friends, curry, British humour and decent tea. But all in all, it has been a fair exchange.

Photograph: Giacomo Morini/Corbis    Faith Hill, 37, gave up corporate life to set up wellbeing breaksI used to be a magazine publisher in London and busted a gut climbing up the career ladder. But I started to fall out of love with my work in 2009, so signed up for a two-day \u201cFind Your Calling: course with life coach Marietta Birkholtz. Instead of identifying a new career path, I came up with the idea for my company, but it took me five years to kill off my fears and go for it. I researched the field, talked to people about my idea and saved some money. This pot of cash has helped me live a holiday lifestyle while the company is in its infancy; I\u2019ve given myself permission to expand it gradually instead of going full tilt to grow and earn fast. I wore myself out doing that for years for my old bosses, I don\u2019t want to do it any more.

Life\u2019s a breeze in Belize      Rachael Wilson, 38, spotted a gap in the market in Central AmericaI moved to Belize in early 2009 after 10 years in the corporate marketing world in London. I felt stifled and uninspired and definitely in need of a new adventure. So I took off on a six-month solo tour of South America. In Belize I found a welcoming and friendly country and there seemed to be a gap in the market there for a bespoke travel service. I set out to fill it with Absolute Belize. There were some big challenges: it\u2019s a country where lots of expatriates come and go, so it\u2019s difficult at first to be taken seriously. Then there is a large amount of bureaucracy, like a huge jigsaw puzzle. After seven years, however, things are going well. I met Cliff, an American who runs sailing charters, fell in love and got married. Sometimes we work many days in a row without any breaks, but when we\u2019ve got free time you\u2019ll find us fishing, kiteboarding or just kicking back on Caye Caulker \u2013 our favourite island \u2013 with some friends and a few beers.\u201d Fish and chips in Beirut     Richard Bampfylde, left.    Richard Bampfylde, 36, from Guildford left work as a business development manager to deliver fish and chips to Beirut I moved to Beirut in summer 2009. My mum actually grew up here \u2013 she\u2019s Greek. Her family left Smyrna (today\u2019s Izmir) in southern Turkey at the start of the 20th century and travelled through Syria to Lebanon. My parents met here, though they brought me up in the UK. They left Lebanon prior to the civil war (1975-90) and only returned again when I moved here. I grew up hearing about Lebanon over the extended family Sunday lunch table \u2013 there were Brits, Greeks and Arabs \u2013 so I was always curious. Then, when I visited back in 2007 it just felt right. So I came up with the plan to move here and just kind of did it.   Related: 'Beirut is a city that refuses to die. I love its energy and resilience'    I originally wanted to set up my own pub but didn\u2019t have enough money for that so worked at a school (which I\u2019m still contracted to now \u2013 I run sustainability projects using my masters in sustainable development, and coach rugby) in order to get to know the city and country and also get some idea of what could work in terms of setting up a business here. After seeing a gap in the market I had the idea of running a fish and chip business. I started out home-cooking the food and delivering it around town on my Vespa. The fish is beer-battered using a local beer. Two main \u201cingredients\u201d come from the UK \u2013 the malt vinegar and the English newspaper wrap. It\u2019s pretty damn popular. I even delivered some to the ambassador at the British embassy. I\u2019ve branched out a bit too: catering for quiz nights, street food festivals, fishing and cooking trips \u2026    I started out home-cooking the food and delivering it around town on my Vespa  Richard Bampfylde     The main idea behind my business has been about having fun and if there\u2019s an opportunity to cook at a fun location then I tend to just go for it. There are many things not to like here: limited electricity, lack of waste infrastructure, water scarcity, traffic. But there are so many great things too: history \u2013 the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans; snowboarding in the winter and swimming in the summer. The world\u2019s largest Roman hippodrome is in the southern city of Sur \u2013 my favourite spot. There\u2019s a great mix of languages \u2013 many Lebanese tend to speak Arabic, French and English \u2013 and for the Middle East there\u2019s a good level of freedom of expression. There are many opportunities for businesses, which I very much doubt I would have had back home. Brewing up in the Alps     Alpine brewers Matthew Stone (left) and Chrigl Luthy    Matthew Stone (37) set up a brewery and restaurant in Morzine in the French Alps with Chrigl Luthy (34) I\u2019d been working as a chef in south London for a few years and felt I needed to change my work/life balance and try for a job during the winter season so I could indulge my love of skiiing. Someone I worked with hooked me up with a job chefing in Chamonix for the winter of 2011/12. I spent the season there and met my wife Susan who had friends in Morzine so that\u2019s what led us there. I realised there was a gap in the market there for a bar that served different beer and food in an informal atmosphere. Then I met Chrigl who had left his job to learn to brew beer, at the Kernel in Bermondsey. It turned out they\u2019d been thinking of moving to the alps to open his own brewery. We quickly saw how our ideas could be combined.    I needed to change my work/life balance and wanted to try a job during the winter season \u2013 to indulge my love of skiiing  Matthew Stone     The Alps especially are suited to the brewpub format (as most of France\u2019s pubs and bars are tied, like many in the UK, to certain beers they are contracted to), though there are only a handful \u2013 the first brewery in the Haute Savoie and Savoie, called the Fer Rouge, is in the next valley, just up from Abondance, the Irish Pub in Les Gets, and the well-known MBC in Chamonix. They all helped us figure things out and have become friends. We found a property, signed up an accountant who guided us through the process of creating a business plan and introducing us to banks in the area for a loan, and got the Bec Jaune Brewery open within three months of buying it. Since then it\u2019s gone really well, and has certainly been the change I was looking for. I have more free time than I did working in London and can enjoy the sports I like right on my doorstep. Being in a ski/mountain bike resort has its downsides too, with busy seasons and very quiet inter-seasons, a lack of culture (other than ski and mountain bike culture) and a very transient population. It also has very limited options for careers outside of hospitality and this was partly responsible for Susan moving back to London. We currently travel between London and Morzine when we can, which is not easy. France is not a paradise: the tax system is confusing and frustrating, I often struggle with the language and customer service seems somewhat lacking.

Truly. His name pops into my inbox at around this time every year and I feel a surge of calm. He will look after me, I think. He will do the sums and the form-filling and ensure my tax return is filed on time. I imagine him fighting various epic battles in my name, like Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant, defending me against the rampant might of the HMRC grizzly bear. My accountant has many qualities. However, being a \u201cpersonality\u201d is the one thing I am grateful he is not. In truth, I\u2019ve never met him. We conduct our business by email. The whole personality thing is over-rated, anyway. There\u2019d be nothing more annoying than missing the deadline for filing your tax return because your accountant\u2019s too busy doing jazz hands and trying to remember the punchline for a knock-knock joke. I raise the personality issue because of Jim Harra. He is HMRC\u2019s director-general of business tax. He was one of the civil servants behind the negotiation of Google\u2019s tax deal with the government, which saw the corporation pay 25p and a packet of fizzy cola bottles to the Treasury. Last week, Harra took to the airwaves to insist that the authorities had negotiated the best possible deal, as he would. But this is not a column about the iniquities of the deal \u2014 no I\u2019m more interested in an interview with Radio 4\u2019s The World at One, during which it was revealed, almost in passing, that Harra had been named Tax Personality of the Year for 2015. Yes, you read that correctly. A swift internet search (yep, I used Google) revealed that the honour was bestowed at something called the Taxation Awards, where a \u201cPlatinum\u201d table cost \u00a33,300 plus VAT. The Taxation Awards website has photographs of a lot of rather surprised-looking individuals clutching statuettes in an anonymous hotel, alongside The Observer\u2019s very own Mariella Frostrup. There are helpful tips on how to enter. Sticking to the word count for supporting statements is key: apparently, last year someone submitted their entry with a 60-page appendix. But why bother with an award for Tax Personality of the Year in the first place? Isn\u2019t it more important that the people in HMRC are just good at their job? Being a \u201cpersonality\u201d is no guarantee that the individual in question is particularly effective in a professional capacity. In many cases, quite the opposite is true. We\u2019ve all been stuck in offices with the self-appointed joker (the kind of individual who goes around saying: \u201cI\u2019m mad, me,\u201d and has a humorous desk toy next to their stapler) and we know they\u2019re difficult to manage and irritating to work with. Yet we exist in a culture that increasingly rewards personality rather than character, that prizes fame over achievement. In politics, MPs are constantly encouraged to have a personal narrative in order to connect with voters. On reality television, the contestants who create the most drama are the ones who win. The bestseller lists are rammed with celebrity autobiographies, their subjects ever more desperate to share the uniqueness of their personal stories. And every year, the BBC trots out the Sports Personality of the Year trophy, as if being personable is somehow more important than being good at, well, sport. Personality loses its appeal when it has to be cultivated. It\u2019s a different thing from simply being good company. You can be brilliant at your job without being the zany conversationalist in the pub after work. And if you\u2019re trying too hard to be exceptional, you\u2019re probably not that great at focusing on the matters in hand: namely, the timely completion of my tax return. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t need my accountant to be Joey Essex. Puts the new Barbies in the shade     Child Angel dolls are displayed at a shop in Bangkok. Photograph: Wasawat Lukharang/NurPhoto/Corbis    You know how it is. You want to take your haunted doll on to the plane and then the air hostess insists you have to treat it as carry-on and you\u2019re all, like: \u201cBut this doll has been blessed by a monk and is inhabited by a wandering soul and it requires refreshments and a seat like any other human being.\u201d I mean. Another day, same problem, right? Or maybe not. Just occasionally, I read a news story so demented I\u2019m left questioning whether I\u2019m the weird one for not understanding it. Last week, I was introduced to the concept of \u201cluk thep\u201d \u2013 lifelike dolls in Thailand referred to as \u201cchild angels\u201d \u2013 which are pampered by their owners as if they are real family members. After purchasing a doll for anything up to \u00a3600, the owner takes it to a monk who conducts a prayer in order to invite a spirit to inhabit its plastic form and give it a soul. The luk thep is then believed to bring its owner good fortune. I promise I\u2019m not making this up. In Thailand, there are restaurants that offer special luk thep rates on the menu. And a few days ago, Thai Smile Airways announced that passengers were now permitted to buy plane tickets for their dolls so that owners could travel next to them when they fly. The Thai Civil Aviation Authority then issued a clarification on the matter, stating sensibly: \u201cPassengers are people.\u201d At first glance, this all seems extremely strange. But having been on more than my fair share of long-haul flights sitting next to screaming, real-life babies, there is part of me that would welcome sharing an economy row with a luk thep. No unwanted conversation, plenty of legroom and the chance to get an extra bread roll. In many ways, they could be the perfect passenger.

During that time, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to interview her on four occasions, which is the most I\u2019ve ever interviewed anybody. With Baroness Williams, I never once ran out of questions. She was always so eloquent, but sometimes it was hard to keep the interview on track because she was so keen to ask questions back. The last time we met, we talked over a toasted teacake in the House of Lords about her great friend the late Denis Healey for a tribute piece in the New Review. Soon, she had winkled out of me the fact that I\u2019d spent some time in Los Angeles and immediately wanted to know what I thought about the American elections and why people there had such a problem with guns. It was disarming being asked my opinion by someone with such a sharp brain who had spent a lifetime analysing these matters. Yet she never once made me feel any less than her equal. I left every encounter feeling she was always more interested in other people than herself. That restless curiosity is a rare and lovely quality.

In November two well-known Chinese dissidents, Dong Guangping and Jiang Yefei, who had sought refuge in Thailand after incurring Beijing\u2019s wrath, were repatriated, sparking condemnation from rights groups and the UN.  The previous month, Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong bookseller who specialised in sensational tomes about the private lives of China\u2019s leaders, vanished from his beachfront flat in the Thai town of Pattaya. Gui reappeared last month, claiming in a \u201cconfession\u201d broadcast by Chinese state television that he had voluntarily handed himself over to police over a hit-and-run accident that he said had taken place more than a decade ago. Gui\u2019s daughter said she believed her father had been abducted and forcibly returned to China.  On Wednesday, He Fangmei, Li Xin\u2019s wife, told the Guardian she feared that her husband had suffered a similar fate. He, who also uses the name Shi Sanmei, said she had been summoned to a police station near the couple\u2019s home in Henan province on Tuesday. She said she had been allowed to speak to her husband, who was apparently in a different location, on Wednesday over an internal police telephone system.  \u201cHe said: \u2018This is Li Xin. I\u2019m in China. I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry. I came back to China willingly to face investigation,\u2019\u201d his wife said. \u201cI asked: \u2018Why do you have to face an investigation if you didn\u2019t commit any crime?\u2019\u201d He, who is four months pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child, rejected her husband\u2019s claim that he had voluntarily returned to China. \u201cI do not believe it. I 100% do not believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt he was forced to say those words, that he said them against his will. Each time I tried to ask him a question he interrupted me.\u201d Yan Bojun, a Chinese activist who fled to Thailand last year and is seeking asylum through the United Nations, said he had last seen Li Xin over dinner on 9 January, on the eve of his disappearance. \u201cI warned him to be very careful in Thailand. It is very dangerous here,\u201d said Yan, a former university professor from Hunan province who is living in hiding in Bangkok. \u201cThe CCP [Chinese Communist party] is very strong here.\u201d Human rights activists have expressed outrage at the apparent internationalisation of Chinese repression under President Xi Jinping. They believe that dissidents being returned to China are likely to have been coerced or forced into doing so by Beijing\u2019s agents. Writing in the Guardian last December, Amnesty International\u2019s east Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, accused China of slowly eroding \u201cone of international law\u2019s key principles: the prohibition against returning people to a place where they could face persecution or other serious human rights violations\u201d. He wrote: \u201cMany, like Thailand\u2019s military rulers, but also the governments in Cambodia, Pakistan or central Asian countries, appear all too eager to help \u2013 in clear contravention of their own international obligations to protect those seeking refuge.\u201d ", "publicationDate": "2016-02-03T09:58:08Z", "tags": ["China", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/activist-li-xin-vanished-in-thailand--held-in-china-says-wife", "title": "Activist who vanished in Thailand is being held in China, says wife", "sentences": ["It is very dangerous here,\u201d said Yan, a former university professor from Hunan province who is living in hiding in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The tipoff talked of an illegal gambling operation, and 50 police and military personnel stormed the upstairs room in the Thai beach resort of Pattaya. But rather than a den of iniquity, they instead found a bridge club frequented mainly by British retirees. Officers nonetheless arrested all 32 people found on Monday night at the Jomtien and Pattaya bridge club, which meets three times a week in a room above a restaurant, the Pattaya One website reported. Since no money was changing hands with the cards, the players \u2013 mainly British but also some Dutch and Scandinavian nationals \u2013 were held under a Thai law from 1935 that says no one can possess more than 120 playing cards at a time. Another alleged offence related to the fact that the cards did not have an official government seal on the boxes, one player told the website. Reports named the organiser of the club, Jeremy Watson, 74, as among the 26 men and six women detained. Another was reportedly an 84-year-old Dutch woman. Police seized cards, computers and book of bridge results as evidence, Pattaya One said. A note on the club\u2019s website said it was temporarily closed \u201cwhilst we get a new licence to have cards on the premises\u201d. It added: \u201cAll problems have been solved with understanding by the authorities.\u201d One player, who was not named, told Pattaya One that those arrested were held for 12 hours before being bailed for 5,000 baht (\u00a395) each. The player said it was believed they would not be charged, following discussions between senior local police officers and the president of the Thai bridge league, \u201cwho travelled to Pattaya to provide further information on bridge and how it is played for points and not money\u201d. Associated Press named the president of the bridge league as Chodchoy Sophonpanich, a civic activist who is also a member of Thailand\u2019s most prominent banking family. \u201cPolice know that bridge is a sport because a similar case happened before, but this time it was military and district officials who initiated the raid and they probably didn\u2019t know,\u201d Chaiyut Assanaiyarat, the bridge league\u2019s manager, told AP.

Footwear is important to him: his characters often find their sturdy brown British leather on unfamiliar ground. \u201cShoes tell you a lot about someone,\u201d he says. \u201cThink of Strangers on a Train. The first thing we see are Bruno\u2019s shoes. We know right away that something is up.\u201d Osborne says his own are \u201cspectators; people wore them to sporting occasions\u201d, but together with his ivory-coloured suit they seem like part of a costume. The whole meeting is theatrical. For one thing, he insists that I go for a massage beforehand \u2013 \u201cthe best cure for jet lag\u201d \u2013 and he picks me up from the spa. He is tall, with a rich actor\u2019s voice, apart from a surprisingly high-pitched laugh.

The waitress is impressed. \u201cPast a certain level my Thai is shitty, but they\u2019re not used to white people speaking it. You get so many foreign correspondents who don\u2019t speak the language,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering.\u201d This tone, a kind of angry bafflement at the way many western writers approach foreign cultures, especially in Asia, is one of the engines of his fiction. After a nomadic life Osborne, 57, has quietly built a reputation as one of Britain\u2019s most accomplished novelists. Unusually in the age of Instagram and Twitter, he has let the work speak for itself. The best writers tend to have a specific subject matter to which they constantly return: Osborne tells dark, thrilling tales of travellers coming unstuck in alien cultures. Paul Bowles and Graham Greene are his obvious pole stars, with Patricia Highsmith, Evelyn Waugh and Asian cinema also in the firmament. His prose has a measured quality that echoes his plots, which drag his characters steadily but inexorably to their fates.     \u2018Working here has been a way of reflecting on my own culture, and also on myself\u2019: Osborne catches a water taxi in Bangkok. Photograph: Nana Chen for the Observer    In 2012 he published The Forgiven, the story of an English couple whose lives unravel when they run over a local boy in Morocco, which found itself on many books of the year lists. In 2014 he followed it with The Ballad of a Small Player, an eerie retelling of the Faust myth. Reviewing it for the Sunday Times, Robert Collins wrote: \u201cAt precisely the point where most novelists start to show signs of flagging, Osborne\u2026 has arrived as a thrilling, exceptional talent in British fiction\u2019s landscape.\u201d Last year came Hunters in the Dark, about a young schoolteacher in Cambodia. In the Evening Standard David Sexton described it as \u201cpitilessly good\u201d, and said that comparisons with Greene \u201caren\u2019t even flattering any more\u201d. Out of the glare of any western literary \u201cscene\u201d, Osborne\u2019s talent has flourished. \u201cSo many writers live their whole lives in rooms,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can be too civilised in the environment you have around you, too oriented towards speaking engagements and literary festivals and dinner parties. That has no interest for me these days. You get to a point where you don\u2019t care any more. At that point you can start to write.\u201d    Novels should be bleach boned. It\u2019s a question of lived suffering. It takes time    Yet Osborne did not emerge completely from obscurity. He published his first novel, Ania Malina, in 1986. It is a Lolita-esque romance set in the aftermath of the Second World War. He wrote it during a winter in Italy when he and his then-wife were living on an olive farm in Tuscany. The novel found a publisher and good reviews. But a comic second book, The Angelic Game \u2013 \u201ca piece of shit\u201d \u2013 sank unlamented. After that, no novels until 2012. \u201cI was writing fiction the whole time, but it just wasn\u2019t any good. Sometimes you can publish a first novel in a kind of lyrical flourish, but it is not really a lyrical form. The beautiful truths about the world are more hard won than that. Novels should be bleach boned. It\u2019s a question of cumulative observation and lived suffering. It takes time.\u201d Osborne\u2019s father worked in market research; his mother was a journalist who also wrote radio plays. They lived in southwest London until Osborne was nine, when they moved to Haywards Heath. \u201cMy parents were decent, aspirant first generation middle-class. They read Reader\u2019s Digest, listened to classical music; my grandparents had a bust of Stalin on the mantelpiece. The kids of that generation were terrified of being below par, class-wise.\u201d     Osborne in 2008: \u2018Beautiful truths about the world are hard won.\u2019 Photograph: Chris Wise    He says he was a \u201cteenage fuck-up\u201d and didn\u2019t show much academic interest until his late teens, when he decided to learn Greek with the help of \u201cthis courtly gay guy teaching at a prep school up the road\u201d. Cambridge was sufficiently impressed to offer him a place to study English, and he went on to a Masters at Harvard but didn\u2019t like the look of academia. \u201cIt attracts weak personalities, and I couldn\u2019t see myself playing politics on campus.\u201d Instead he moved to Paris. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone there, so I went to the American church and looked through the personal ads. There was one desiring an \u2018English gentleman for English lessons\u2019. It turned out to be a raving gay left-wing priest, who had become famous during the Algerian war. He was a tiny man with shoulder-length dyed hair and a motorbike in his flat.\u201d There he remained until the priest\u2019s advances got too much. \u201cIt got to the point where he was hammering on the door of my room and I would let myself out through the window. I became terrified.\u201d His wife, six years his junior, was the daughter of celebrated Polish musicians, and through their connections they arranged for the couple to run a collective blueberry farm near the Russian border. \u201cWe slept in a barn on a huge mountain of straw \u2013 it was wonderfully romantic, although of course communist Poland was a fucked-up place. There was nothing to eat. I was very lefty at the time, but it turned me off that whole model of the world.\u201d Soon came a son, Tad, and a return to Paris, where Osborne wrote a nonfiction book called Paris Dreambook, a gothic exploration of the city\u2019s hidden corners. A chance call took him to San Diego. \u201cThis guy who owned the San Diego Reader had read the Paris book and rang me out of the blue. He offered me more money per piece than I had got for the books. I got on the plane with about $25, two T-shirts and a pair of jeans.\u201d Osborne wrote magazine articles until he got fired. His marriage was disintegrating for \u201ca variety of reasons. We got married too young. We were children.\u201d    My mother died as I\u00a0went to interview Almod\u00f3var. It was like therapy    Osborne moved to New York, where 1980s Brooklyn provided a lifestyle \u201clike Withnail &amp; I\u201d, with no money and something approaching a serious drink problem. At his lowest ebb, he stole a stilton from a shop on 3rd Avenue. \u201cI figured that if you steal a piece of cheese someone is going to stop you. If you steel a whole cheese you have credibility. I went home and ate that motherfucker with a teaspoon.\u201d His break came when the New York Times commissioned him to write a feature on deaf children in Nicaragua. \u201cSuddenly I was this \u2018well known journalist\u2019,\u201d he says. The New Yorker sent him to Papua New Guinea. He became Vogue\u2019s wine columnist. \u201cAnna Wintour asked if I wanted healthcare or business class travel. I took the travel.\u201d Osborne eventually came to Bangkok for cheap dentistry and because he realised the pay for a single New York Times piece could last six months here. Yet he is scornful of journalism as a serious career. \u201cCyril Connolly was right. It is the enemy of promise. You get used to the rhythm of the world, and the power that comes from working for a large publication. If you say you\u2019re from the New York Times presidents will call you back.\u201d He is withering about the \u201cinherited arrogance and contempt\u201d of white people, and points out that NGOs which spent 15 years looking for trafficking in Thailand never found anything. \u201cLast month two girls drowned in Thailand trying to escape from an anti-trafficking asylum run by a Texan Baptist church. Twenty hours of Bible study a day for devout Buddhist girls. They climbed the fence and threw themselves into the river.\u201d There\u2019s the anger again. Written down it doesn\u2019t do justice to Osborne\u2019s company, which is excellent. His ambivalence about the London literary scene should not be mistaken for not caring what people think. He is a fine host and a natural raconteur. We talk about Japanese food, whiskey, tailoring, weightlifting, cinema, the damaging effects of social media. His journalism has led to nonfiction books on various subjects \u2013 Bangkok Days, a memoir of his time in Thailand, came out in 2011. In the book he describes eating insects, sleeping with prostitutes. He is mystified by western prudishness around sex work, which he says is a \u201cneurosis\u201d. Perhaps Buddhism, where you might once have been a dog, makes it easier to separate sex from love. \u201cMy girlfriend, who is Thai, cannot understand [our obsession with prostitution]. I ask her and she\u2019s like: \u2018What is wrong with you people? Is it Christianity? Why must you go around with this sense of glowering doom?\u2019\u201d In 2000 the New York Times sent him to Morocco to write about the trilobite mines. Nearly a decade later, a chance encounter sowed the seed of the novel that would make his reputation. \u201cAt a party I was told this story about a couple on a trip to Morocco who had run over and killed a local boy. It\u2019s every middle-class person\u2019s nightmare.\u201d A first draft came out in six weeks. He pitched it to a young editor at Random House, Charlie Conrad, who bought the book on the spot. \u201cCharlie said to me at the start: \u2018Nobody knows you, so you better make sure this book is really good. Not just half-good. It has to be perfect.\u201d His mother died before she saw it published. \u201cShe\u2019d waited all her life, in a way, for me to go back to fiction. She was always telling me to stop being a journalist, to be serious, to stop being an asshole. I should have listened. She died on 11 September 2011, which was spooky. Right after that Newsweek sent me to interview Pedro Almod\u00f3var in Madrid, but it ended up being like therapy, Almod\u00f3var saying: \u2018So, tell me about your mother.\u2019\u201d You feel his mother would have been proud of The Forgiven. Its success led to The Ballad of a Small Player, about \u201cLord Doyle\u201d, a provincial solicitor on the run in Macau, and to Hunters in the Dark, his most recent and best novel, which tells of a young teacher who goes missing in Cambodia. Like Doyle, he runs into a sum of money and then quickly into trouble. Nobody in Osborne\u2019s books survives contact with money for long, perhaps a consequence of his own long stints of poverty. \u201cMost British people still die in the class we are born,\u201d he says. He works in a rented apartment, on a quiet, leafy street north of Bangkok\u2019s traffic-clogged main artery. His death certificate hangs on the wall, \u201ca sobering thing to look up at\u201d, the legacy of an article he wrote on people who fake their own deaths to claim the insurance payouts. \u201cThis part of the world is full of escapees,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not all con men.\u201d His next novel will be a \u201clesbian love story\u201d about an Irish chef in Bangkok. A film of The Forgiven is in the pipeline. Beyond that, Italy is an appealing setting, in particular since the migration crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s this island, Favignana. It might have been Calypso\u2019s island in Homer\u2019s Odyssey, there\u2019s Phoenician graffiti on the walls, and now these African migrants are turning up.\u201d Fertile ground, perhaps, for Osborne\u2019s themes of culture clash in ancient landscapes. For now he is happy in Bangkok, walking streets he knows well, writing to the music of tree frogs and cooled by night-time breezes through his window. Tad, a budding chocolate maker, passes through Tokyo, where it is, relatively speaking, easier for father and son to meet up. \u201cWorking here has been a way of reflecting on my own culture, and also on myself. The illusion of a career was very damaging to me. At 35 I was manic about it, desperate for approval, but I was exhausted. Eventually you realise you just have something to say before you die, which is, what, a few books? You say what you\u2019ve got to say and then Nunc dimittis, off we go.

And with the rapid rise to the top echelons of the Premier League, they can finally add \u201cLeicester City\u201d to their lexicon. But in this case, Thais are saying it with pride. The Thai duty free magnate Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought the club in 2010 when they were struggling in the Championship. The self-made billionaire wanted to use Leicester to boost Thai brands and it may have been the best business decision he ever made.

And on Thai-language football forums, the team are referred to as the \u201cSiamese Foxes\u201d. Vichai\u2019s company, King Power, sells duty free at every major airport in Thailand and with its logo emblazoned across Jamie Vardy\u2019s chest, it is now truly a global brand. But Vichai is credited for bringing a \u201cThainess\u201d to the team, too, which many attribute to their roaring success. In September 2014, the owner flew Buddhist monks in to bless the stadium and the players in the early days of their return to the Premier League. After the ritual, the team beat Manchester United 5-3, despite being two goals down in the game. \u201cIt was adorable,\u201d said a Thai Manchester United fan, Tadsasorn Tangmatikul, of the monks\u2019 trip. Leicester were her second favourite team, she added, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a Thai club.\u201d The Foxes\u2019 triumph resonates with Thais, lovers of stories about winning against the odds. One of the country\u2019s favourite rags to riches tales is literally about an underdog, a street mongrel called Copper who was rescued by King Bhumibol Adulyadej from an alley. Copper died late last year but lived her last days in regality and was the protagonist of a highly-successful animated film titled The Inspiration as well as several books, including one written and illustrated by the king. Vichai\u2019s son and club vice-chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, said last month that Leicester have been run like a Thai family. \u201cIt\u2019s the Thai culture. We give our time to the staff, the players, and to the manager. We try to manage it like a family, to listen to the problems of every single member of staff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the culture that we brought to the team.\u201d City\u2019s starting lineup is not dissimilar to the one that struggled in their first Premier League season, evidence of the patience and steadfastness seen as a risk by other top teams that are criticised for buying, rather than nurturing, talent. Kitinan Sanguansak, assistant sports editor of the Thai daily newspaper The Nation, told the Observer that this equanimity can be attributed to the Thai management style.     Buddhist monks on the pitch at the King Power Stadium. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX/Shutterstock    \u201cThainess has had some effect on the club,\u201d he says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t really culture \u2013 it\u2019s about the habit of Thai people. Thais generally give people opportunity and time more than westerners. \u201cLast season, Leicester City were almost relegated but they didn\u2019t sack the manager. They gave him a proper chance and time. Thais are also very understanding people.\u201d Yet the Thai owner\u2019s understanding ran out shortly after the season ended when James Pearson, the son of the then manager Nigel, was filmed with two other players in a racist sex tape, and in which they made offensive comments during a visit to Bangkok. The three players were sacked and the manager was forced out shortly after. The scandal was hugely embarrassing to the club and also unnerved Thailand, where local media coverage was muted compared to the UK press, wary of negative international attention. While there is a lively sex tourist industry in the south-east Asian nation, many in Thailand would prefer a more nuanced global reputation. Leicester City have tried to maintain a positive image in Thailand, appointing the manager of the Thai national team and most beloved football figure as a brand ambassador. Known as Coach Zico, the sporting hero played 131 international matches in which he scored 70 goals, both records in Thailand. The club even have a Thai-language YouTube channel, with videos showing the Foxes emblem with \u201cPride of Thais\u201d underneath. The king\u2019s portrait has been raised at the club and a Thai flag has been run up at the stadium. \u201cVichai is running the club with all seriousness \u2026 He didn\u2019t take over to do things superficially. He didn\u2019t buy the team just to make a name for himself,\u201d says Kitinan. Leicester have also managed to avoid the pratfalls of the other Thai owner of a British football club, the ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin bought Manchester City in 2007 but his critics said it was a publicity stunt to garner political support in Thailand and he was later criticised by the manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who said he didn\u2019t understand football.         Leicester City football clinic advert    When Eriksson later moved to Leicester shortly after it was bought by Vichai, he said: \u201cShinawatra was in politics. These aren\u2019t,\u201d praising King Power for investing in the club. According to one Manchester United fan in Thailand, the support base is for the most part discerning, supporting Leicester for their brio rather than ownership. \u201cIf their style wasn\u2019t entertaining, or if they were placid, Thais wouldn\u2019t be cheering,\u201d says Fai Jirenuwat. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like when Thaksin took over Manchester City. There were many people following them just because they liked Thaksin.\u201d Perhaps by keeping a lower profile than Thaksin, Vichai has avoided too much media attention.

All that is known about Nalamphun \u2013 banned for 18 months on Wednesday for betting then failing to cooperate with TIU investigators \u2013 is that he is a moderate 22-year-old Thai doubles player who had a junior career-high ranking of 1,223 in 2010 and has earned only $682 on court. The TIU continue to protect their sources by refusing to give even the most basic details of Nalamphun\u2019s offences, apart from the fact they occurred between July and November 2014, with no hint of where the matches took place or against whom. A statement issued at the TIU\u2019s London headquarters said: \u201cConsistent with the confidentiality of the independent anti-corruption hearing process no further details of the hearing or decision will be made public.\u201d Such secrecy will do little to encourage confidence in recent pledges of transparency after reheated allegations of old match-fixing offences so dominated the first slam tournament of the season, the Australian Open.

Nalamphun, who has never appeared on the full ATP Tour, is unranked having registered just four minor wins during a spectacularly unsuccessful senior career, in which he has lost 20 times. His last recorded match was in January, when he took just one game off the Austrian Maximilian Neuchrist and served 11 double faults in two quick sets in the first round of qualifying for the Bangkok Open.

The ousted populist politician and business tycoon called for talks with the coup leaders, warning that Thailand\u2019s military rule will isolate the country as it moves towards becoming a pariah state. \u201cIt\u2019s a charade to show the world that Thailand is returning to democracy,\u201d Thaksin told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cBut in reality it would be like Myanmar before its political reforms. There would be a prime minister, but the real power would be in some politburo above him and the economy would suffer. No other government would want to touch Thailand.\u201d The military says it took power to prevent a political crisis and insists elections will be held in 2017 after a new constitution is approved. However, the lengthy timeframe has raised scepticism over its intentions \u2013 a draft constitution presented last year was rejected by an army-backed council, adding months to the process. The latest draft adds further delays and, more worryingly for the military\u2019s critics, allows the generals abolute power in the name of national security. In a separate interview with the Financial Times, Thaksin called the constitution \u201ccrazy\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that this kind of constitution can be written in this manner in the 21st century. It\u2019s as if we are in the 18th century,\u201d he said. \u201cAny regime that [does] not respect the people will not last long. No one respects North Korea, namely.\u201d Thaksin was ousted in a 2006 coup and his sister, Yingluck, was also removed by the military in 2014 after three years as prime minister. The army-led constitution drafting process is largely seen as an attempt to prevent the powerful Shinawatra family from returning to power. While Thaksin, 66, has spoken infrequently since the coup, his combative comments will unnerve the generals in Bangkok. After he called for mass protests in 2010 to allow elections more than 90 people were killed in the capital. Thai leaders are further concerned over the ill health of the 88-year-old king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is regarded as a stabilising force overarching battling political and military leaders.  Thaksin has been in self-imposed exile since 2008 to avoid being jailed for corruption on charges he denies. Yingluck is also facing charges that she ignored corruption surrounding a multibillion-dollar rice farming subsidy, although she too denies any wrongdoing. But the Shinawatras are increasing their presence in the spotlight, possibly to rally their rural support base after months of keeping a low profile. Yingluck has held several public events recently, including welcoming reporters to her Bangkok home to see her vegetable garden. In his comments, Thaksin criticised the military\u2019s economic policies, a key complaint among Thais after foreign direct investment dropped by nearly 80% last year despite junta efforts to stimulate growth. But he also urged the prime minister, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, to talk. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be paranoid. Please don\u2019t fear that I\u2019ll come looking for revenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for any conditions to help myself.

Even without the food, it\u2019s a kind of paradise: close to the Myanmar border, modern yet resolutely traditional, spotlessly clean while never sterile; easily navigable but filled with a thousand hidden treasures, urban and chic (in part thanks to the large student population from the university) but surrounded by hills and jungle.     A barbecue stand on the streets of Chiang Mai    And my god, the food! The moment we stepped off the train from Bangkok you could smell it, that glorious barbecue aroma: the mu ping (pork skewers) you can pick up for three baht (6p) on any street, the sai ua (spiced lemongrass sausages) \u2013 a Chiang Mai signature dish \u2013 you can gobble for 30p. Food was everywhere; everyone was eating \u2013 even while driving along on their motorbikes.     Sausages and fish on a stand at Sompet market    It was the Cowgirl who really did it for me: that was when everything about the city came together. There we were, riding past the Chang Phuak Gate not long after arriving, when we saw the queue, and at the end of the queue the cart, and behind the cart the Cowgirl, immaculately made-up beneath a Stetson hat, wielding a cleaver above a mountain of pork, a ridiculous grin on her face.  She became my champion, the city-saint of sanuk, that Thai philosophy of taking pleasure in all that you do. And what pleasure. The Cowgirl\u2019s khao kha mu \u2013 stewed pork knuckle over rice, served with a boiled egg, raw garlic, pickled mustard greens and chilly vinegar \u2013 was a revelation; love at 30 baht, the perfect one-plate meal. I began to take things seriously then, researched all I could, even corralled Michelin-starred chef Andy Ricker, the US champion of Lanna (northern Thai) food into having coffee with me. I learned from him how the geography of the region created the city\u2019s unique cuisine. Relatively isolated, its culinary development came without ready access to the coconut milk, palm sugar, and fish sauce that was so prevalent in central and southern Thailand. In their place: herbs, roots and plants from the jungle, filling the spicy Lanna meals \u2013 which traditionally used wild game, snakes, frogs and grubs \u2013 with sour, bitter and pungent notes. One of the most famous dishes in this tradition is laab, a punchy, smokey (in some cases raw) mincemeat, offal and blood salad; another is nam prik ong, a tomato pork dip akin to a ragu \u2013 excellent versions of both are made by the sisters of Sorn Chai restaurant, opposite Thapae Gate. But Chiang Mai, and the love I developed for it, wasn\u2019t only about Lanna food. The Cowgirl\u2019s dish, the khao kha mu, isn\u2019t Lanna after all. Neither is the exceptional fish and chips that Dee (who goes by only one name) serves from the fryer attached to his motorbike (his father ran George\u2019s chippie in Clapham), nor the fine Beast Burger from the gourmet van off Nimmanheamin.     A very mobile street food service on Nimmanhaemin Road    No, it was everything hurled together: a gleeful fusion of climate, landscape and character, the student buzz mixed with the rural pace, the fact that you can get from one side of the city to the other on a bike in 15 minutes. The fact that you can pretty much pick any point on the map, go there, and eat something outstanding. It was in this way that the barren forecourt of the 7-11 in a nondescript neighbourhood transformed into a food market at night; the way a fried-chicken vendor was open for business at 7am; how there was no call for a sit-down restaurant with windows and doors because everything wonderful was happening on the streets. Take Warorot market, take Chiang Mai Gate, take Nimmanheamin on a Friday night, where the back-end of a pick-up truck parks beside a bar and serves grilled oysters and steak. Take the road we lived on near the temple of Wat Chet Yot: come sunset, the staff of one beauty salon set up a gas burner and a mookata grill (a cross between a hot pot and a Korean barbecue) on the pavement and began to drink beer and cook meat for themselves. Across the road, a tailor was doing the same. And you knew \u2013 you just knew \u2013 that you could join them if you smiled hard and wanted to. A little further up, at the shop where we bought our morning fish-rice porridge, the family were barbecuing together, the young daughter directing her elder brother by means of a piggyback ride. It all seemed to blur together: family, work, play, religion and commerce, on every little alleyway and road, and always, at the heart of it, food. It\u2019s a way of life or rather, life itself. I\u2019m sure my Cowgirl would agree. MY FAVOURITE STREET STALLS AND RESTAURANTS Cherng Doi and SP Chicken     A chef prepares roast chicken at SP Chicken    It\u2019s impossible to choose between Cherng Doi and SP Chicken \u2013 both make stunning versions of the north-east Thai (Isaan) barbecue chicken dish kai yang. The former, in a cosy garden setting, grills boneless strips to crispy-outer and tender-inner perfection; the latter roasts whole small birds on a customised spit at the front of its Old City restaurant. Both serve delicious dipping sauces on the side: Cherng Doi\u2019s sour-sweet tamarind one is sublime. For full pleasure, eat your chicken with khao niao (sticky rice) and a som tam (raw papaya salad).

To get a sense of the dish\u2019s Chinese-Muslim origins, head to the bustling, canteen style Khao Soi Islam, where the broth is light and the noodles are spaghetti-like. My favourite, though, was Khao Soi Khun Yai, a small cart-and-tables set-up on a patch of waste-ground beside Wat Kuan Kama. The broth is glorious: fragrant but subtle, rich but not oily, and the perfect balance between spicy, sour and sweet.\u2022 Khao Soi Islam, Charoenprathet Road Soi 1, +66 082 392 0142; meal for two \u00a32-\u00a34.

This is the place I discovered sai ua (Chiang Mai sausage), nam prik ong (chilli tomato pork dip) and kaeng khanun (jackfruit curry). The 30 or so stalls are a lively introduction to Lanna and wider Thai cuisine, and because locals come to pick up food for home, the standards are consistently high.

Aon, the laconic Shan-Burmese owner, is at the wok every day, juggling dishes in the glow of the 7-11 convenience store.

In 2014, the US State Department\u2019s trafficking in persons (Tip) report downgraded Thailand to tier three, the lowest ranking, and the country has remained there. Since the EU\u2019s yellow card warning last April, Thai authorities have enacted legislation to curb trafficking and illegal fishing. Measures adopted include an illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing enforcement act in alignment with EU regulations, and labour laws preventing under-18s from working on boats and in seafood processing factories. A command centre to combat illegal fishing (CCCIF) has also been introduced, with a remit to track every fishing vessel in Thailand\u2019s 42,000-strong fleet through a new registration and monitoring system. Last month, seafood companies signed a memorandum of understanding with the command centre pledging to eliminate products in their supply chains that had been obtained through illegal fishing, labour or trafficking. Thai Union Group, the world\u2019s biggest tuna exporter, is among the signatories. Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods, which the Guardian previously exposed as having slavery in its supply chain, is also a signatory.. An EU delegation visited Thailand last month to reassess the situation, but has not yet commented on its findings. Thailand, the world\u2019s third-largest seafood exporter, is desperate to avoid the crippling effects of an EU-wide ban. A boycott could cost the south-east Asian nation $1bn a year. The military government ruling Thailand, which came to power in a 2014 coup, says the crackdown on trafficking is a major achievement. \u201cMeasures implemented since last April have been aimed at halting all illegal fishing, installing monitoring systems on fishing boats and eliminating the use of child and slave labour,\u201d the CCCIF\u2019s Benjamaporn Wongnakornsawong told the Bangkok Post.  \u201cThe CCCIF has been working on this issue with the EU\u2019s cooperation for some time now. We\u2019re confident we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d According to independent investigations by the EJF, however, policing of fishing boats remains highly erratic; overfishing is rampant, driving the need for cheap and/or free labour; crew transfers still take place at sea, allowing slaves to remain unseen by authorities; and the number of convictions linked to trafficking has decreased \u2013 from 206 in 2014 to 169 in 2015. \u201cThe root causes behind these abuses run very deep and to effectively address them it will be necessary to address the culture of clientelism and extensive corruption, both in the business community and across the statutory agencies of the state,\u201d Trent said. \u201cThere needs to be a huge effort to build a much wider, broadly accepted culture of compliance, along with an effective monitoring and enforcement regime that can deal with the worst offenders, criminal elements and thugs who have characterised these issues in the Thai seafood sector.\u201d           Thai fishing industry turns to trafficking: \u2018We witnessed girls being raped again and again\u2019 \u2013 video    In spite of the ruling junta\u2019s \u201cgenuine and serious\u201d efforts to wipe out trafficking, the military government may be preventing real progress, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institutes of Security and International Studies. \u201cA top-down government with absolute power ironically lacks mechanisms to solve human trafficking problems at home, due to both a lack of cooperation and corruption from agencies and personnel involved. Rectifying human trafficking cannot simply be ordered and delivered from the top \u2013 it involves carrots and sticks on the ground.\u201d In an industry that relies heavily on migrant labour \u2013 more than 90% of those working in the fishing sector are from neighbouring countries, many of them trafficked \u2013 it is up to the government to create a framework that protects migrant workers both on the ground and at sea. Yet Thailand has failed to implement such a strategy, putting millions of workers at unnecessary risk, claims migrant rights activist Andy Hall. \u201cThe government migration policy continues to be short term and, in many ways, continues to promote the smuggling and trafficking of people irregularly across borders and in and out of work whilst undermining formal and safer migration channels,\u201d says Hall. \u201cThere have also been many kneejerk reactions to public pressure in the seafood sector that have impacted negatively on workers in the supply chain.\u201d Wiping out all forms of slavery \u2013 from trafficking to bonded work and everything in between \u2013 is no easy task in an industry that has depended on slavery, and profited from it, for decades. But some local businesses say Thailand has already done enough cleaning up to prove the EU \u2013 and the world \u2013 wrong. \u201cThailand can guarantee that as of January 2016, there is no illegal labour in the Thai fishing industry,\u201d Thiraphong Chansiri, the president and chief executive of Thai Union Group, recently claimed. \u201cThe country does not deserve such a ban.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-02-25T01:00:18Z", "tags": ["Employment", "Thailand", "Fishing", "Global development", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Slavery", "Trade and development", "European Union"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/25/slavery-trafficking-thai-fishing-industry-environmental-justice-foundation", "title": "Slavery and trafficking continue in Thai fishing industry, claim activists", "sentences": ["\u201cMeasures implemented since last April have been aimed at halting all illegal fishing, installing monitoring systems on fishing boats and eliminating the use of child and slave labour,\u201d the CCCIF\u2019s Benjamaporn Wongnakornsawong told the Bangkok Post."]}, {"article": "The staffing crisis in schools is being exacerbated by an exodus of newly qualified teachers who are \u201cflocking abroad\u201d to work in the rapidly growing international sector, including branches of England\u2019s elite public schools, it has been claimed. Sir Michael Wilshaw, who is the chief inspector of England\u2019s schools, warns that the country is facing a \u201cteacher brain drain\u201d at a time when schools across the country are already struggling to fill vacancies amid rising pupil numbers. Lured by enticing offers of competitive, tax-free salaries, free accommodation and a warmer climate, teachers are taking their hard-earned qualifications to the Gulf states, the far east and beyond, where there is growing demand for a \u201ctraditional\u201d English education, says Wilshaw. In turn, schools in England are increasingly having to look overseas to recruit their own staff \u2013 from countries as diverse as Jamaica, Canada, South Africa and Australia \u2013 in order to get sufficient teachers in front of classes. In his regular monthly commentary as head of the schools watchdog, Ofsted, Wilshaw writes: \u201cAnyone regularly perusing the job vacancy pages of the education press cannot help but notice just how many of our elite public schools are busy opening up international branches across the globe, especially in the Gulf states and the far east,\u201d he says.   Related: Long hours, endless admin and angry parents \u2013 why schools just can\u2019t get the teachers    \u201cTwo years ago, there were 29 of these overseas franchises. At the end of 2015, there were 44 and the number will rise again in the coming months with several new campuses scheduled to open soon. \u201cFamous institutions like Harrow, Marlborough, Shrewsbury and Brighton College \u2013 to name just a few \u2013 are clamouring to meet a growing demand for a \u2018traditional\u2019 English education among the burgeoning middle classes of these countries as well as the increasing number of British ex-pats who have relocated there.\u201d It\u2019s part of a worldwide boom in international schools \u2013 many of which follow a British-style curriculum and use the English language \u2013 which is fuelling demand for UK-trained teachers. In 2014-15 an estimated 100,000 full-time teachers from the UK were working in the international sector, \u201cmaking us the world\u2019s biggest exporter of teaching talent\u201d, says Wilshaw. And it will only get worse, he says, with research by the International School Consultancy suggesting that the number of international schools is expected to almost double from 8,000 now to more than 15,000 by 2025. To address the teacher recruitment and retention crisis, Wilshaw once again called for financial incentives to ensure trainees start their teaching career in areas where they are needed most. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, that means Barnsley not Bangkok, Doncaster not Doha, and King\u2019s Lynn not Kuala Lumpur.\u201d He continued: \u201cIs it fair that the offspring of overseas oligarchs are directly benefiting from UK teacher training programmes at the expense of poor children in large parts of this country? \u201cIs it unreasonable to ask someone who has been trained in our system to make a contractual commitment to teach in that same system for the first few years of their career? \u201cI would, therefore, once again urge policymakers to consider the idea of some form of \u2018golden handcuffs\u2019 to keep teachers working in the state system that trained them for a period of time.\u201d Teachers\u2019 leaders welcomed Wilshaw\u2019s intervention, and made their own suggestion that the government should write off teachers\u2019 university tuition fees as an incentive to keep newly qualified teachers in English state schools. Leora Cruddas, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThe idea of \u2018golden handcuffs\u2019 to keep teachers in this country for a period of time is an interesting one which deserves more examination. \u201cOur view is that more needs to be done to incentivise teaching as a career. We would suggest that government undertakes to write off, over a period of time, the undergraduate tuition fees of students who become teachers, as long as they remain in the state system in this country during that period.\u201d Russell Hobby, general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 NAHT union, said: \u201cThe government must look at why some teachers are choosing to work abroad at a time of shortages in the UK.  \u201cPay flexibilities do not work when schools have insufficient funds to use them; enforced pay freezes are making starting salaries uncompetitive. Excessive workload, poorly planned change and constant criticism drive out experienced teachers.  \u201cWe don\u2019t need golden handcuffs to keep trained teachers in the UK. We just need to treat them with respect. It has the advantage of being cheaper, as well as being the right thing to do.\u201d  A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cAs part of our drive to achieve educational excellence everywhere, we want all schools to be able to recruit high-quality teachers. It is disingenuous to suggest our approach is not working \u2013 despite the challenge of a competitive jobs market, the proportion of trainee teachers with a top degree has grown, faster than in the population as a whole, and there are more teachers overall. \u201cBut we are determined to continue raising the status of the profession. That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing hundreds of millions in teacher recruitment, backing schemes like Teach First and the National Teaching Service to get great teachers where they are most needed, and why we\u2019ve given schools unprecedented freedom over staff pay, to allow them to attract the brightest and the best. \u201cThe number of former teachers returning to the classroom has increased year on year \u2013 further evidence of the popularity of the profession \u2013 recent research shows that the number of teachers leaving the profession to work abroad is 1%.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-02-26T07:24:26Z", "tags": ["Teacher shortages", "Teaching", "Education", "Schools", "UK news", "Ofsted"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/26/uk-schools-suffering-as-new-teachers-flock-abroad-warns-chief-inspector", "title": "UK schools suffering as newly qualified teachers 'flock abroad'", "sentences": ["\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, that means Barnsley not Bangkok, Doncaster not Doha, and King\u2019s Lynn not Kuala Lumpur.\u201d He continued: \u201cIs it fair that the offspring of overseas oligarchs are directly benefiting from UK teacher training programmes at the expense of poor children in large parts of this country?"]}, {"article": "You think it\u2019s cold out?

Thanks to Caitlyn Jenner, television shows such as Orange is the New Black and Transparent, and films including last year\u2019s indie crowd-pleaser Tangerine and Oscar winner The Danish Girl, the transgender movement is in the spotlight in a way that it\u2019s never been before. \n \n  Related: Sonita review: Afghan female rapper goes on unpredictable journey in triumphant documentary  \n \nA documentary following four middle-aged transgender women in Pacific north-west logging towns, The Pearl paints an illuminating portrait of lives seldom given a presence onscreen. But though the subjects and their stories are inherently fascinating, the film-makers, Jessica Dimmock and Christopher LaMarca, rather bafflingly can\u2019t seem to make out a worthy film out of the material.  \nThere\u2019s Nina, a pizza delivery person who identifies as trans, but who struggles with how to convey her true self to her wife of nearly 40 years. Amy, the eldest of the lot, loses her wife of many years and opens her home to fellow trans people seeking support. Finally, there are Krystal and Jodie, two former brothers who now identify as sisters. The film starts with the group convening for a trans convention, and tracks their separate journeys from there. \nDimmock and LaMarca take a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 approach to their documentary, choosing to have the women\u2019s everyday actions speak for themselves, rather than through confessional on-camera interviews. With the occasional voiceover, the four discuss what led them to transition, but they\u2019re rarely afforded the chance to open up about the battles they no doubt face in embodying their true selves. \n \n  Related: Why TV could teach cinema a lesson about how to treat trans characters  \n \nAmy especially receives the short end of the stick.

Instead, it registers as a shock because of its abrupt presentation. \nDuring a discussion after The Pearl\u2019s premiere at the True/False film festival, the four trans women proved to the audience how engaging and moving they could be.

Related: Total solar eclipse 2016 live: Indonesia prepares to witness totality    On Wednesday 9 March, people in some parts of Australia and south-east Asia will be able to witness the event. It will also be visible in Hawaii, east of the international dateline, where it will still be Tuesday 8 March. For those further west or east in Europe and America, it will already be night, so the sun will not be visible. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What is a solar eclipse? A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly between the Earth and the sun, casting a shadow over the Earth. It can only happen during a new moon \u2013 when the dark side of the moon is facing the Earth.       Lunar eclipses, on the other hand, occur when the Earth passes between the sun and the Moon, casting a shadow over a full moon. Where and when to see the eclipse The following graphic produced by Nasa shows from where you can best see the eclipse. As the Earth rotates, the best spot to see the eclipse will move along the the central blue zone. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be in that zone \u2013 most of which lies in Indonesia \u2013 then you should be able to see the sun completely blocked by the moon.     A graphic released by Nasa showing where the solar eclipse of March 2016 will be visible. Photograph: Nasa    If you are a long way north or south of that spot, you will only be able to see a partial eclipse. For example, people in Darwin in northern Australia will be able to see 60% of the sun covered by the moon. People in Perth should be able to see 10% of the sun blocked. Moving north, people in southern Vietnam and Thailand will see a 60% eclipse, while most people in Japan should be able to see a 20% eclipse.    Wondering where you can see the eclipse from next Tuesday? This gif that NASA made should have you covered. pic.twitter.com/xWYbHVyWZf&mdash; Michael Slezak (@MikeySlezak) March 3, 2016    If you\u2019re confused by the times (and date) in those graphics, don\u2019t worry \u2013 the eclipse won\u2019t be happening at midnight. The time there is Universal Time, which is equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time. You can use Google or a site like this to convert it to your local time. In Australia, unfortunately the major centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart will miss out on the eclipse. But if you\u2019re in Queensland, and north of about Rockhampton, you should be able to see a partial eclipse from about 11am on the coast, or a bit earlier from inland. In the Northern Territory, it should happen around 10am. And most people in Western Australia should be able to see a partial eclipse \u2013 start watching from about 8am. In central Sumatra in Indonesia, where the eclipse will be a total one, it will happen almost immediately after the sun rises, so start watching from about 6.30am. In Jakarta, you should see about a 90% eclipse about 15 minutes later. In Japan, you should be able to see about a 20% eclipse. It will start at about 10.20am in the west. In Hawaii, if the skies are clear, you should be able to see a 60% eclipse from about 5.30pm, just as the sun is preparing to set. Here are some guides for key centres along the route of the eclipse. The following places will experience totality at these times (all times local):  Palembang, Sumatra: 7.21am Palu, Sulawesi: 8.38am Ternate, Malaku: 9.53am  And these cities will also see their peak partial eclipse at the following (local) times:  Bangkok, Thailand: 7.32am Singapore: 8.23am Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: 8.23am Manila, Philippines: 8.58am Darwin, Australia: 10.17am Cairns, Australia: 11.12am  The total eclipse viewing time will span an hour either side of these times. Wherever you are, pop by the Guardian website and follow our stories, which will be collecting photographs of the event as it happens. The most important thing Do not look directly at the sun. The eclipse itself can be viewed safely with the naked eye for only a few seconds, and only if you are in a location where the sun will be completely covered by the moon. Looking at even a sliver of the sun can cause permanent eye damage or blindness.  And your sunglasses don\u2019t help either. Read on to find out the safest way to watch. How to watch the eclipse As we warned above, do not look directly at the sun \u2013 but there are some materials you can use to safely look at the sun. You could buy some \u201cnumber 14 welder\u2019s glass\u201d from a welding supply outlet or from some hardware stores. You can also use aluminized mylar, which can even be cut with scissors. Another way to see it happen is to make your own pinhole camera. Basically, it requires poking a hole in a box, and putting some paper over the back of it. Follow directions in this video:            How often do eclipses occur? Solar eclipses can occur up to five times a year, although that is rare. Nasa keeps a list of past and future eclipses and according to that, only 25 years in the past 5,000 have had five solar eclipses. Each eclipse is viewable from a different location. For example, in 2015 a total eclipse of the sun was viewable from the UK, but that country won\u2019t see another one until 2090.", "publicationDate": "2016-03-07T23:59:45Z", "tags": ["Solar eclipses", "Astronomy", "Science", "Asia Pacific", "Indonesia", "Australia news", "Japan", "World news", "Hawaii"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/08/total-solar-eclipse-2016-when-is-it-happening-and-how-to-watch", "title": "Total solar eclipse 2016: when it's happening and how to watch it", "sentences": ["The following places will experience totality at these times (all times local):  Palembang, Sumatra: 7.21am Palu, Sulawesi: 8.38am Ternate, Malaku: 9.53am  And these cities will also see their peak partial eclipse at the following (local) times:  Bangkok, Thailand: 7.32am Singapore: 8.23am Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: 8.23am Manila, Philippines: 8.58am Darwin, Australia: 10.17am Cairns, Australia: 11.12am  The total eclipse viewing time will span an hour either side of these times."]}, {"article": "The new Man Booker International prize is the most exciting thing to happen to literary translators since Asterix was resuscitated in 2005. With its high profile and equal shares of cash for writers and translators \u2013 a split of the \u00a350,000 prize \u2013 it promises to make translated fiction hit the headlines at last.    Translated novels by female writers are the palomino unicorns of the publishing world    But a glance at the longlist announced on Thursday reveals the same old pattern: only four out of 13 titles were originally written by women. Eight out of the 14 translators are women; but while achieving gender balance in this field is a real achievement, I\u2019m hardly bowled over. Translated novels by female writers are the palomino unicorns of the publishing world \u2013 not just unusual, but a small subset within a subset. Not only do translations make up a tiny fraction of the books brought out in the UK and US, but only about a quarter of them are by women. Various recent counts have found that about 26 % of English translations are female-authored books (although the gender balance among their translators is roughly equal). With such a small pool to choose from in any one year, it may not be surprising that women have rarely won prizes for translated titles in the past. The Man Booker International\u2019s forerunner, the Independent foreign fiction prize, went to two women and 19 men over its lifetime, only shortlisting six women in its last five years. On the other hand, America\u2019s younger equivalent, the Best Translated Book awards, have managed to honour Dorothea Dieckmann, Gail Hareven, Tove Jansson and Can Xue in eight years.   Related: Man Booker International 2016 longlist includes banned and pseudonymous authors    Editors have to look hard to find women writers in other languages. Not necessarily because they\u2019re not being published abroad, but because of a familiar story \u2013 they get less recognition than their male counterparts. Again, prizes are a useful indicator. Modelled on the Booker, the German Book prize may have gone to six women and five men since 2005, but its longlists have always strongly favoured men, on one occasion by 16 to four. And that kind of attention, plus review coverage and buzz, is what gets writers picked up for translation in the first place. Incidentally, seven of the German winners are available or forthcoming in English. And now guess the gender ratio: yes, four of them are by men. Another factor behind the startling imbalance may be the kind of books traditionally translated into English. Until recently, they tended to be cerebral literary novels; think WG Sebald or Milan Kundera. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that and there are certainly women producing equally intellectual writing out there \u2013 Dubravka Ugresic and Herta M\u00fcller spring to mind. But until the likes of Karin Fossum and the inescapable Elena Ferrante came our way, more commercial or accessible writing simply wasn\u2019t crossing the language barrier.    With less than 100 foreign-language books by women making it to the UK every year there\u2019s plenty of undiscovered writing    Things may be looking up, though, despite the Booker International longlist. Coinciding with the success of Ferrante and last year\u2019s IFFP winner Jenny Erpenbeck, two new presses have been founded with the mission of publishing only women in translation, Les Fugitives and Calisi Press. Another, Tilted Axis, hopes to bring us \u201cfresh, exciting voices from places like Bangkok and Kolkata, Seoul and Jakarta: mainly translations, mainly women\u201d.

The book was the last winner of the Guardian\u2019s self-published book of the month, which picked seven books from open submissions between June and December 2014 and reviewed them on the site. I followed the series from the start, but Jalan Jalan was the first entry to really catch my attention. The tale follows a heartbroken young Brit through Indonesia, where he finds himself embroiled in a murky world at the bottom of the expat barrel after accepting a teaching job at a dodgy language school after a five-minute telephone interview. Josh Lacey called it an \u201cinvolving tale of self-transformation, and a welcome blast of heat and spice\u201d. It\u2019s all that and more; a curious blend of Alex Garland and Nick Hornby with a ghost thrown in for good measure. It has some memorable drug- and alcohol-fuelled set pieces, lots of very funny dialogue, and lashings of tropical atmosphere. But it also has a more complex, moving and rather magical core. The protagonist \u2013 whose name is not revealed until the final chapter \u2013 is haunted by memories of his dead girlfriend, and as the book progresses it becomes clear that there is more going on here than mere misadventure in a foreign land. I could see why Jalan Jalan might have failed to find a UK publisher. It wasn\u2019t a question of quality, but as far as the UK publishing industry is concerned Indonesia is a distant dot on a far horizon, rather than the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation and south-east Asia\u2019s biggest economy. A well-written literary novel set in Indonesia is the sort of thing that a hard-nosed UK agent might look at twice, but not a third time. But the publishing world does not end on the shores of Britain. In south-east Asia the expat novel is a staple of airport bookshops, with stories of them heading off the rails in Jakarta or Bangkok looming large on the lists of many south-east Asian publishing houses. I found myself strangely troubled by the notion that the author of Jalan Jalan \u2013 which was a cut a way above the usual standards of expat lit \u2013 might not be aware of this fact. It turned out that Stoner, who based the book on his experiences teaching in Indonesia in the early years of this century, had indeed done the dispiriting rounds of agents and publishers in the UK before deciding to publish himself. But he had never thought of trying further afield. I suggested a few places that might be worth approaching \u2013 Monsoon Books, Marshall Cavendish, EDM, and the other Singaporean publishers for a start \u2013 and off he went to try his luck. By now I had developed a determination to see Jalan Jalan make it to print myself, so I also emailed Cathy Layne, my own editor at Tuttle, and told her about the book. Tuttle is one of the biggest names in south-east Asian publishing, with bases in the USA and Singapore, and their books are distributed worldwide. They also happen to have their own retail arm which runs Periplus, the main English-language bookstore chain in Indonesia, with outlets in glitzy shopping malls and airport terminals. There\u2019s always a horrible moment of doubt after you\u2019ve recommend a book, especially an unpublished one, to a publishing professional. What if Cathy didn\u2019t like it? What if there was something horribly wrong with my judgment? But a month later she told me she\u2019d thoroughly enjoyed the book and Tuttle was going to publish it. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic tale of self-discovery in a foreign land \u2013 an ever-popular genre,\u201d Cathy explained. \u201cThe story has elements that make it comparable to Alex Garland\u2019s phenomenally successful The Beach \u2013 and what editor wouldn\u2019t want to find the next Beach? Crucially, Stoner\u2019s writing was great \u2013 for a first novel it was incredibly well crafted and structured. The only real polishing we needed to do before publication was to trim down a few overly long descriptions.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just Cathy who liked it. Karl Taro Greenfeld, author of Standard Deviations, one of the best books in the expat lit genre, gave high praise and some valuable feedback when Stoner and Tuttle approached him for a blurb. Veteran Jakarta-based writer Terry Collins also praised its \u201crare integrity and intensity\u201d. The new version came out in Asia and the US in January, and was released in the UK on 26 February, completing an unlikely journey that still astonishes Stoner. \u201cI had sent the manuscript to about 30 agents and publishers in the UK before deciding to self-publish,\u201d he says. \u201cI had some positive rejections mixed in with the blunt \u2018no thanks\u2019 ones. I came very close to one agent taking it on. She really liked it but the bosses said they thought it was a risky first novel. \u201cI never considered that an Asian publisher would be interested. The idea of all those airport shops and beach-read bookshops never really entered my head. I think I got so caught up in the idea of self-publishing that that was all I focused on.\u201d Stoner says he thoroughly enjoyed the self-publishing experience, though it didn\u2019t exactly bring him fame and fortune. \u201cBefore winning the self-published book of the month I could put a name to every sale, pretty much, and even afterwards I think I only made about eight sales.\u201d But of course, without self-publishing, the book in its new form would not now be available worldwide, sitting proudly on the front tables of every airport bookshop in Indonesia. \u201cI\u2019d recommend self-publishing to anyone who writes and gets dejected about being rejected, because you never know where it might lead. If I hadn\u2019t made the effort I\u2019d never have won the Guardian award \u2013 a very happy moment \u2013 and I\u2019d never have heard from you and taken your great advice.

Five nights a week and on three afternoons, the streets around 42nd are almost impassible, glutted with ticket holders filling theaters and crowds of luckless others begging for a seat. Onstage, you can hear hip-hop, rock, folk and pop alongside traditional operetta and casts composed largely of Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and African Americans. In the spirit of inclusion, long-deferred, the Deaf West production of Spring Awakening, seen earlier this season, not only brought hearing disabled actors to the Broadway stage, but also the first performer who uses a wheelchair. The radical and runaway success of Hamilton even threatens to make the musical cool again. So is this a new golden age for the American musical as some have suggested? Maybe.   Related: How did Hamilton become Broadway's breakout hit?     The economic picture is certainly rosy, but in terms of innovation and diversity, Broadway musicals, still the likeliest venues for presenting work that will impact the broader culture, have not come so far. While shows such as Hamilton, a history of the founding fathers refracted through the lens of more recent immigration, and Fun Home, about a lesbian daughter\u2019s exploration of her closeted father\u2019s suicide, augur for new kinds of stories and new ways of telling them, the season to come \u2013 with its promised jukebox musicals, revivals, and adaptations of television shows and films \u2013 suggests that most producers are still playing it safe. While a greater array of musical styles can now be heard, it\u2019s been decades since mainstream musical theater kept pace with popular music. When was the last time a musical birthed a real crossover hit? Was it One Night in Bangkok from Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus\u2019s Chess or Phantom\u2019s Music of the Night, which became a minor sensation on adult contemporary stations? This season has seen more actors, singers and dancers of color on stage, but many of those performers were and are restricted to musicals marketed to and geared toward limited demographics (Allegiance, On Your Feet, The Color Purple), which can feel more like tokenism than true diversity. Broadway audiences are still overwhelmingly older and white, just like the writers and producers of most of the shows on offer. By contrast, though nearly 70% of spectators are female (based on Broadway League statistics for the 2014-2015 season), most of the writers, directors, composers and designers are male. And yet, there is hope that Broadway \u2013 and American musical theater more generally \u2013 may be opening itself, however slowly, to different styles and voices. But why has it been so slow to change? And what can writers, directors and producers do to productively shake up the form? The director and sometimes book writer Alex Timbers (Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson, Rocky, the forthcoming adaptation of Frozen), believes that the structure of new musicals still feels \u201cfairly codified in a way that a new play doesn\u2019t\u201d, he explained. He recalled discussions during early runs of Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson, an emo rock history of the seventh president, with producers encouraging him to end the show with a big, upbeat number. As the show\u2019s ending centered on the Trail of Tears and the Native American genocide, this suggestion wasn\u2019t especially palatable.      The Book of Mormon was seen as \u2018too controversial for Broadway\u2019 before it went on to become a huge hit. Photograph: Joan Marcus/AP    Stylistic elements that are de rigueur downtown and in straight plays transition to the Broadway musical with difficulty. Rachel Chavkin, the director of the forthcoming production of Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812, Dave Malloy\u2019s indie rock/free jazz/classical adaptation of War and Peace, has been fighting to maintain the immersive aspects \u2013 actors racing through the audience, complimentary shots of vodka to be drunk along with the cast \u2013 that made the show such a success in its earlier runs. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking to vodka to be part of the experience,\u201d she said, and promising that actors will interact with audiences more elaborately than merely running up and down the aisles. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning what I expect is going to be a very long permitting process with the city right now.\u201d Certain kinds of music may be a trickier fit for Broadway, too. Michael Friedman, the composer of Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson and numerous off-Broadway musicals, notes that, \u201crock music and a lot of other post-rock forms\u201d can resist integration into the proscenium. \u201cAmplification is a huge part of that. Rock music wants to be on a microphone,\u201d which may make the songs more disconnected from unamplified book scenes. \u201cIt can make the storytelling more up and down,\u201d said Friedman, though this can sometimes lead to greater innovation, like Hedwig and the Angry Inch, which wove its story structure into a concert format.     When we were doing an emo rock musical, emo rock was already pass\u00e9, because we\u2019d been working on it for six years  Alex Timbers     Yet even when a narrative work-around is found, musicals take so long to bring to fruition, often the better part of a decade, that integrating current music proves difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for musical theater to be so responsive to the zeitgeist or the contemporary music sense,\u201d said Timbers. \u201cWhen we were doing an emo rock musical, emo rock was already pass\u00e9, because we\u2019d been working on it for six years.\u201d Because of the long lead time, the staggering costs and the large numbers of people involved, it seems remarkable that any new musical makes it to Broadway, innovative or otherwise. As Natasha, Pierre\u2019s Malloy notes: \u201cMaking an amazing Broadway musical seems really, really hard to do. Not just the conceiving/writing/composing part, but also all the thousand other people and things that have to align just so to make something happen.\u201d Even when it does it can be tough to reconcile \u201cthe bizarre art/commerce tension that drives the whole thing, and it\u2019s no wonder that the Hamiltons and Fun Homes are so few and far between\u201d, he said. But many creators and producers still feel hopeful about the future of the Broadway musical and believe that there are solutions \u2013 creative and institutional \u2013 to many of the problems the form still faces.  Robert Lopez, the composer of Avenue Q, The Book of Mormon and Frozen, hopes that producers will realize that taking risk can reap great dividends. He remembered many producers passing on The Book of Mormon, still one of Broadway\u2019s top earners, because they found it too controversial.  \u201cWriters have to take risks,\u201d Lopez said, \u201cand producers have to know that if they want the mainstream success they have to journey into the unknown\u201d and have to accept that the greatest rewards may come from embracing something \u201cthat\u2019s going to make them scared to write the check, more scared than usual\u201d. And those producers can find ways to attract younger and more diverse audiences to their work. Melissa Anelli, one of the organizers of last winter\u2019s Broadway Con, which attracted more than 5,000 attendees during a blizzard, most of them under 35, believes that few shows are exploiting the potential of social media to build new audiences. She had particular praise for Once, which invited audiences on to the stage before the show and encouraged tweeting pictures, and the \u201cHam4Ham\u201d shows, in which Hamilton cast members come out on the sidewalk to entertain those standing in line for tickets, performances which are later uploaded as video. \u201cThose things are brilliant,\u201d Anellis said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re never going to get to New York, you get to know the cast, you get to have fun with them.\u201d    Related: Hollywood has a diversity problem, but Broadway may be at a tipping point    But there are interventions that can be made well before a producer\u2019s reading or a Broadway run. Shanta Thake, the director of Joe\u2019s Pub, which has hosted early incarnations of many new musicals, Hamilton among them, believes that artistic directors should actively seek out new voices to infuse fresh sounds and styles into musical theater. With the New York Voices commissioning program, she encourages musicians, who now find it difficult to make a living without constant touring, to explore the possibilities of musical theater. She is already working with established musicians like Toshi Reagon and Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo to create full-length theatrical works and hopes that their approaches may subsequently open up the world of musical theater, encouraging departures from the standard book musical form, which may attract other composers. Watching a recent Janelle Mon\u00e1e concert, Thake thought, What is Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s musical? She\u2019s already doing a musical onstage every night. So incredibly theatrical, it\u2019s unbelievable. What could she create given the right collaborators?\u201d Jeanine Tesori, the composer of Fun Home, wants to encourage a diverse roster of composers even earlier in their careers. With musical theater stars Idina Menzel and Taye Diggs, she founded A Broader Way, which offer arts-centered programming for girls in underserved communities. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get as many girls aware of their muscles, of their theater muscles in music and dramatic storytelling,\u201d Tesori said. If groups like hers succeed, then \u201cmore diverse voices are going to be heard\u201d.  Friedman, who jokingly acknowledged his status as a 40-year-old white man, hopes and believes that this will be the case. When he goes to concerts now, he said, \u201ceveryone wants to write musicals and maybe they don\u2019t want to write musicals that sound like musical theater,\u201d which he finds cheering. \u201cI\u2019m basically a horrible pessimist,\u201d he said, \u201cbut maybe not about the state of American musical theater.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-03-25T17:18:56Z", "tags": ["Broadway", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Musicals", "Hamilton", "Lin-Manuel Miranda"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/25/new-broadway-golden-age-musical-theater", "title": "'Writers have to take risks': is this really a new Broadway golden age?", "sentences": ["Was it One Night in Bangkok from Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus\u2019s Chess or Phantom\u2019s Music of the Night, which became a minor sensation on adult contemporary stations?"]}, {"article": "With long, leafy boulevards, Chiang Mai presents an alluring alternative to the Thai capital, Bangkok.

The pace of life may have speeded up in recent years as the city\u2019s grown, but Chiang Mai is still a city of quiet charms, best absorbed at a leisurely pace. WHAT TO SEE AND DO Learn traditional skills     Fields of plenty \u2026 visitors to the Chiang Mai Thai Farm Cooking School select herbs.    Although Thai massage can be a shock to first-timers, the after-effects of being forcibly contorted into pretzel shapes can be wondrous. Pick up a few tricks from the pros by registering at one of the training centres in town. Thai Massage School Shivagakomarpaj (courses from \u00a336) in the Old Medicine Hospital stands out for its comprehensive courses in history, concept and technique. More than 20,000 students, half of them foreigners, have studied there since it opened in 1962. A full introductory course lasts five days, but there\u2019s a two-day foot massage course or a one-day herbal hot compress course, using healing herbs gathered in a cloth bundle and applied to pressure points. If you\u2019d rather improve your culinary prowess, there are dozens of cooking schools in the city. A lesson at boutique hotel 137 Pillars House (\u00a346pp) includes a trip to Thanin market and instruction by a top chef. For a more budget option, the Chiang Mai Thai Farm Cooking School (\u00a324, including food and transfers) offers hands-on, small-group classes with individual cooking stations. Participants stop at the nearby Ruam Chok market before visiting an organic farm to stroll in the fields and take a crash course in ingredients such as jackfruit, holy basil and bitter eggplant, then get to work pounding curry paste with a mortar and pestle. Heed the call of the wild     The Elephant nature park serves as a sanctuary    Selfie-snapping tourists have come under fire in recent years for posting pictures of themselves cuddling tiger cubs or riding elephants. But there are still plenty of ways to get up close and personal with nature ethically. Elephant Nature Park, some 40 miles from Chiang Mai, has been rescuing and rehabilitating pachyderms since the 1990s. Visitors can spend the day feeding, swimming with and walking alongside the contented herd in their 200-acre habitat. Got a little extra time and cash? Consider a week-long homestay in a Karen village helping with reforestation, animal vaccinations and farming. A one-day package costs \u00a346; the full week, with Journey to Freedom, costs \u00a3275, with full-board. Support the arts Chiang Mai fosters a small but steadily growing community of artists and designers. Join the city\u2019s creative crowd any evening at Thapae East, a hip space decked out in exposed brick that hosts everything from poetry readings to indie concerts. Or check out exhibitions spotlighting local talent at the new Gallery Kang Wat in Baan Kang Wat, an artists\u2019 village and craft showcase near Wat Ram Poeng. Hern Gallery (1/3 Padat Road) is a recently opened offshoot of the Gallery Seescape, on a bend of the Ping river south of the old town. Hit the markets      The city\u2019s outdoor bazaars are a \u2018riot of sounds and smells\u2019. Photograph: Alamy    Chiang Mai\u2019s outdoor bazaars are a riot of sounds, and smells. When dusk falls, prowl for gai yang (grilled chicken), khao kha moo (pork shank braised with star anise) and kanom jin (rice noodles with curry) on Chang Khlan Road every evening. Pick up silver jewellery and other handicrafts on Wualai Road on a Saturday and save a few hours on Sunday to browse on Ratchadamnoen Avenue. For a market with more locals and fewer bootleg DVDs, rise early and go to the smaller Somphet Market on Moon Muang Road. See the best of the temples One glance at the regal Wat Phra Singh (the temple of the lion Buddha) explains the crowds it attracts. But don\u2019t miss Wat Chedi Luang, also in the old centre, where visitors can chat casually with monks about Buddhism, life, the universe and everything. Established in the late 13th century, Wat Chiang Man is not only impressive as the city\u2019s oldest temple, but also for its two immense Buddha statues. One of the most revered shrines is across the Ping river: Wat Chedi Liam, part of Wiang Kum Kam, the ruins of the Lanna empire\u2019s original capital. At the temples, remember to dress modestly. Take a trek     Gorgeous gorge \u2026 the surrounding rainforest is a magnet for walkers. Photograph: Getty Images    After a few days in the city, the lure of the jungle beyond is hard to resist. Virtually every guesthouse will try to convince you to go on a trek, and with so many similar itineraries \u2013 rafting, elephants, hill tribe encounters \u2013 picking the right one can be a challenge. Tiger Trail Outdoor Adventures (two-day treks from \u00a367) is a socially responsible tour operator that has been organising treks in south-east Asia since 2000. Private treks are available, but group tours never exceed 10. Or try Pooh Eco-Trekking (two-day trek from \u00a362), which has been leading tours for two decades.

My wife talked about feeling a biological imperative, which I had no answer for. Who was I to stand in the way of something like that? I signed on.  But there is a whole other potential person to consider, too \u2013 the new life that you are bringing into the world without asking first. It\u2019s not really fair. For while the world is a wonderful place, one we humans have made nicer for ourselves with wonderful inventions like books and record players, penicillin and pizza, it\u2019s also a really awful place, one we\u2019ve ravaged with deforestation and smog, nuclear weapons and mountains of pizza delivery boxes and other garbage.

This complicates the already difficult decision of whether to have a kid.  We\u2019re living through what scientists call the \u201cSixth Extinction\u201d, an era of precipitous decline in the number of species able to live on the planet. The last mass extinction, the fifth, happened 66 million years ago, when a giant asteroid crashed into Earth and 76% of all the species on the planet perished. This time, we\u2019re doing it to ourselves.  \u201cClimate scientists agree that humanity is about to cause a sea level rise of 20 or 30ft, but they have tended to assume that such a large increase would take centuries, at least,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Justin Gillis reported. But a recent study led by retired Nasa climate scientist James E Hansen, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, indicates that the negative effects are happening a lot faster than we\u2019d thought, perhaps feet of rise within the next 50 years. \u201cThat would mean loss of all coastal cities, most of the world\u2019s large cities and all their history,\u201d Hansen told Gillis, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re in danger of handing young people a situation that\u2019s out of their control.\u201d  Imagine that: New York, Tokyo, Mumbai, Shanghai, Bangkok, Amsterdam, Miami would go first. Think about the implications. Global economic collapse, famine, border disputes, wars. Jesus, just the inland traffic.  Thinking about the horrific future scientists predict hurts a very specific part of me, a part of me that I only first learned was there when I met my newborn son, 11 years ago, as he lay on the tray of the scale where the doctors had just weighed him and counted his fingers and toes. The moment is wordless, and as mind-blowing as any drug trip I ever took. But my friend Dave, who had kids before me, came closest to capturing its essence while we were talking later that day: it was like having a door open in your brain and stepping through it and realizing that there\u2019s this whole other part of your brain that you never knew was there before. A room, roughly the same size as the part of your brain that you\u2019ve been using all your life, it was vast and mostly empty (like your old brain) but in it I found stuff, inside myself, that I had never known was in there before.

And I realized a deep, heavy responsibility: protecting him was instantly the most important job of all my jobs \u2013 to keep this thing alive, healthy, happy, thriving.  Future climate meltdown was already a theoretical concern for future generations: what kind of world would my great-great-grandchildren inhabit? Now it all feels more pressing. How am I going to protect my kid? Was it fair for me to bring him into this world at all? Was it immoral?  Was I complicit in the damage? I remember every extra paper towel I\u2019ve ever unspooled from the roll, and think about a tree falling in the Amazon, and then think about my son growing up in a gray, dying world \u2013 walking towards Kansas on potholed highways. Maybe while trying to protect his own son, like the father in The Road. Will he decide to have a kid? I have foisted upon him a decision even more difficult than my own. It\u2019s all very depressing. Still, I come down on the side of advocating reproduction. It gets back to the power we have, we humans. Such devastating power, with which we\u2019ve already changed our world so dramatically. Maybe we can change it back, or at least innovate to survive. What if, and this is obviously a huge \u201cif\u201d, some young person, perhaps a certain 11-year-old in a Black Sabbath T-shirt (I highly doubt it, he can rarely remember to take his lunchbox out of his knapsack at the end of the day), perhaps someone who is not yet born, perhaps not yet conceived, is the one super-genius to figure out the invention that could save the planet?  The ultimate windmill system that can meet all our energy needs and somehow also cool the atmosphere while it works and also spread seeds to grow more trees as it does. And also make pizza. I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s kind of the point: we don\u2019t know. Maybe it could be something even better than that.  There\u2019s always maybe. And that\u2019s enough to persevere for.

They\u2019ve become increasingly paranoid and repressive in their crackdown against any form of resistance \u2013 both online and offline. On 30 March, the self-styled National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), or the Thai junta that staged a coup on 22 May 2014 and robbed the rights of millions of voters, told me on the phone that they would not permit me to travel to Helsinki to attend the Unesco-organised World Press Freedom Day.

Before being released I had to sign, under duress, a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d saying that I would seek the junta\u2019s permission before leaving the kingdom. Other conditions included agreeing not to participate, aid or lead an anti-junta movement. If I did not maintain these conditions, the junta reserved the right to freeze all my bank accounts and prosecute me. Nothing in the agreement forbids me from scrutinising and criticising the military dictatorship and this is the one condition I will never sign up to. And I have been criticising them continually for nearly two years now since the coup, both through my work as a journalist and on Facebook and Twitter. This is what happens to a Thai journalist when you refuse to pretend that the military junta is legitimate.  As I write, the junta is preparing what it calls \u201cre-education camps\u201d for dissidents and journalists who continue to refuse to kowtow to them. It will soon invite its critics, both political and in the media, to go through a course that could last seven days inside various military camps. The camps are about silencing.

His way of keeping peace and order is to impose a ban on political gatherings of five or more persons. This ban has been in effect for nearly two years. According to iLaw, a Bangkok-based human rights documentation centre, since the coup in May 2014, 900 people have been summoned by the junta for the \u201cattitude adjustment\u201d programme, which in some cases include detention without charge for up to seven days.

There, a few dozen white barrels line the edges of the rooftop; inside, a bright green jam is bubbling in the heat. There\u2019s no smell \u2013 just the captivating sight of an urban farm harvesting spirulina, an edible green algae sometimes referred to as the \u201cspinach of the future\u201d.  The Novotel\u2019s rooftop spirulina farm is the brainchild of EnerGaia, a Thai startup pushing the boundaries of urban farming. Saumil Shah, EnerGaia\u2019s 42-year-old director and founder, decided to invest in the microalgae business after reading an article about how carbon dioxide from an industrial facility could be used to grow algae.    Related: Impossible foods: how startups are changing what we eat \u2013 in pictures    Shah grew up around Atlanta. He graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he studied aerospace engineering. After designing aircraft engines, he moved to General Electrics, and in 2006 the company sent him on an assignment to Bangkok, where he fell in love with the Thai way of life. He formed EnerGaia and began installing edible algae-producing, CO2-eating bioreactors around Bangkok. His aim is to use unused spaces \u2013 rooftops, vacant parking lots \u2013 to encourage more urban farming, starting with spirulina. Right now, his biggest challenge is that of familiarity. \u201cPeople simply don\u2019t know what spirulina is,\u201d he says. Tasty green algae At the Novotel Bangkok caf\u00e9, customers on high-backed leather bar stools drink spirulina shakes: a vibrant green juice containing cucumber, green apple, lemon juice and algae. Except that, unlike other brunch foods, spirulina is roughly 3.5bn years old. The edible algae was once part of the diet of Aztecs and populations near lake Chad. Scientists only rediscovered it relatively recently: one of the earliest modern references to spirulina comes from the International Association of Applied Microbiology, who referred to it as \u201ca wonderful future food source\u201d in 1967. Heeding the call, Nasa later studied it as a potential food source for astronauts. In recent years, it has increasingly become a popular nutritional supplement for health geeks around the world. What drives interest in this single-celled cyanobacteria is its nutritional profile. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), dried spirulina has a protein content of 59-65%, and only 36 kilocalories per 10 grams. (By comparison, raw beef has around 20% protein content.) Spirulina is also a complete source of amino acids and Omega-3, has a high concentration of essential minerals, and contains vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12, C, D and E.     A bartender makes a shake with spirulina, apple juice and cucumber at the bar of the Hotel Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square.  Photograph: Paola Di Bella/Redux    According to a 2014 European Commission report, the production volume of food and feed supplements derived from microalgae has risen from 1000 tonnes dry weight in 1999 to 5,000 tonnes dry weight in 2004, and 9,000 tonnes dry weight in 2011. Today, 25m tonnes of seaweeds and other algae are harvested annually for use as food, in cosmetics and fertilizers, or are processed to extract thickening agents or used as an additive to animal feed. In this market, spirulina dietary supplements have the largest production volumes worldwide: 5,000 tonnes a year worth about $40m annually, according to the report. The key players are concentrated in the US, with companies such as Cyanotech, Earthrise and USA Nutra developing and commercializing natural products from microalgae. Recent estimates suggest some 1000 tonnes are currently sold in the US market \u2013 80% in the form of health and dietary supplements. Still, the study notes that large scale commercial production of microalgae is still an \u201cinfant industry\u201d. George Grimble, a nutritionist at the University College London\u2019s Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, says that while spirulina is great, it\u2019s decades away from becoming a major food, because there simply aren\u2019t enough consumers around the world who would look at spirulina the way they look at vegetables or meat. \u201cThe issue with algae is it\u2019s quite difficult to formulate it into foods that people are familiar with,\u201d he says. However, Mauro Vigani, a senior research fellow at University of Gloucestershire\u2019s Countryside and Community Research Institute, says that despite the challenges the microalage sector still needs to address, its growth potential is high. \u201cSince 2000, the microalgae sector has grown five to 10-fold,\u201d he says. \u201cSo far, the greatest investments have been made in the US, Australia and Asia.\u201d Vigani believes more consumers should be made aware of the advantages of microalgae products. \u201cIt would be beneficial to have the support of government institutions and public campaigns.\u201d   Related: Urban farmers around the world \u2013 in pictures    An innovative rooftop urban farm This is where EnerGaia comes in. The company is headquartered in a small building in Bangkok. The first floor hosts a research and development center \u2013 a small, busy office where Shah and his team design labels, brainstorm ideas, and work towards conceptualizing the next generations of microalgae. The company employs two microbiologists from Thailand and two local technicians who are responsible for working at the farms and packaging the spirulina. There\u2019s also an office manager, an export sales manager from France, and one intern from Mexico who is helping the startup with organic certification application paperwork. Upstairs, the team maintains a spirulina master culture in a fully equipped lab. In a room next door, a modified washing machine spin-dries the algae. EnerGaia runs a second urban farm in Bangkok\u2019s Green Zone \u2013 a preserved area in the middle of the city\u2019s river that hosts only community projects and green businesses. With more than 900 tanks, this facility is about 10 times bigger than the one occupying the Novotel rooftop. The Novotel\u2019s spirulina farm consists of 80 sq m of space, 15 stories above the busy streets of Bangkok. There are two sets of around 40 interconnected bioreactors, closed tanks that hold more than 250 liters of water each and form a closed system that prevents pollutants from entering and limit evaporation. Spirulina flows from tank to tank thanks to a blower that pumps filtered air in the system. In the future, EnerGaia hopes to adapt this design to use CO2 emissions from industrial sites to feed, aerate and mix the algae. Manuel Raymondin, resident manager of the hotel, says the hotel rents its rooftop to EnerGaia for just a few dollars a month. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make money on it,\u201d he says. \u201c[We] thought it was a superb idea to be the first one to be able to grow Spirulina on the top of a roof in a hotel in Bangkok.

Photograph: Paola Di Bella/Redux    Changing the world The EnerGaia team harvests the spirulina three to four times a week, taking it from the farm to a facility that spin dries the algae and packs it. It is then shipped back to the Novotel, and to 11 other stores and retailers around Thailand. Over the course of a year, EnerGaia gets somewhere between 300-500kg of fresh spirulina from the hotel rooftop. It retails for around $40/kg; to diversify its offer and reach more costumers, EnerGaia also sells pasta containing spirulina and dried spirulina powder. The company\u2019s turnover is currently around $70,000 per year. \u201cNot so much yet, but we are growing 200% per year for the last two years,\u201d says Shah. He now hopes to partner with NGOs and multi-governmental agencies like the UN and the World Health Organization to deploy its urban farming system in refugee camps on a trial basis. The EnerGaia system can be installed anywhere, as long as the temperatures are above 32C (89F) and below or around 38C (100F). \u201cI think we can make a big positive impact on several fronts: not just the environmental footprint but also food security,\u201d Shah says.  He hopes spirulina will become as ubiquitous as other once niche foods, such as kale or quinoa are today.  \u201cThe challenges make me nervous, but all in all we keep making progress.

Beyond the apps that most people will use routinely as part of their working day - the likes of Google Maps, Facebook and Twitter - there are many designed to make an entrepreneur\u2019s life that little bit easier. 1. Slack It\u2019s the app everyone\u2019s talking about. Slack is a platform that keeps all of the messages you and your team need in one place. There are \u2018channels\u2019 dedicated to various projects or themes, as well as direct messaging, and users are \u2018invited\u2019 to join a team. You can also send files and emojis, and there are 280 tools that can be integrated, including ordering an Uber via chat message.  For Thomas Villeneuve, CEO of online flatsharing marketplace Weroom.com, Slack allows multiple teams to talk to one another without having to get stuck in to lengthy email chains. \u201cIt groups together all communications between my teams, meaning I can stay on top of individual and group conversations between our offices in Paris and London. Its smart notification system means that I am not overwhelmed with a high volume of messages but I also don\u2019t miss any urgent alerts,\u201d he says.  The app is free to download and use (including a history of up to 10,000 messages), and an estimated 2.3m people use it everyday.  2. Basecamp  For companies with employees working in various locations on multiple clients, keeping up to date with each other on progress can be difficult. Hence many entrepreneurs, such as Jaime Gee, managing director of Manchester communications company Jam, are coordinating teams with Basecamp. \u201cAll team members can access it from the office, remotely, from their devices and you can invite clients to view selected projects too to keep them updated with progress,\u201d she says.  \u201cThe whole team can see where an action is up to by checking the latest update on that \u2018to do\u2019 or individual task. It\u2019s clearly laid out and helps us stay on track, reminds us of deadlines, and allows us to run all our client activity smoothly and efficiently.\u201d The app is free to download. 3. Trello Another popular project management tool is Trello. The app gives managers a picture of how a project is progressing, with ideas, to-do items and those tasks in-progress, all tracked in a visual way. Each task is assigned a card, which can be assigned to teams and workflows, and is signed off when completed.  All updates and notifications are in real time, users can include comments or upload extra documents to support the project. Due dates can also be assigned and the app synchronises across all devices. Plus, it\u2019s free to download and use.  4. Google Drive or OneDrive Google and Microsoft\u2019s cloud storage apps are hugely popular with business people who want access to their documents from wherever they are and on whatever device they are using. Chef and restauranteur Ken Hom, travels the world with his work for UKTI\u2019s Exporting is Great campaign.  \u201cI am always on the go, splitting my time between my homes in two homes in Paris and Bangkok and my Michelin Star restaurant MEE in Rio de Janeiro, as well as travelling globally for business,\u201d he says. \u201cI often have media opportunities connected to my various ventures which requires me to send high resolution food shots. Without Google Drive I\u2019d be lost! With everything online these days, customers eat with their eyes. A high quality photo is almost as important to my business as a well-spiced dish.\u201d 5. SignEasy  Ever needed to sign a document on the go but can\u2019t get near a printer or scanner? That\u2019s where SignEasy comes in handy. Users can digitally sign documents at the press of a button, wherever they are.  It\u2019s a favourite of Amer Hasan, CEO of cab price comparison business, minicabit. \u201cPaperwork is the last thing I want to do after a busy day, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the case for most small businesses. SignEasy has definitely come to the rescue here. It lets me sign a contract on the way home from a partner meeting, or sign a software invoice to go live asap \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a day when I haven\u2019t used it.\u201d SignEasy offers three annual price options: Pro \u00a329.99; Business \u00a359.99 and PAYG \u00a33.99. 6. PayPal Here If you are often out and about selling your products, chances are you might agree with Andrew Dark, MD of print wear retailer, Custom Planet, that PayPal Here is the most useful app around. \u201cWe do a lot of trade shows and conferences where we sell our wares. With PayPal here you can either take payments direct on your phone or link it to a card reader to make taking payments really easy. It links up to your current PayPal account so no messing about,\u201d he says.  The app is free to download and there is a one-off payment of \u00a359.95 for the card reader, which talks to your mobile or tablet device via Bluetooth. 7. Swytch  Swytch allows up to five UK phone numbers to be accessed from one device using a data or a Wi-Fi connection. You could, for example, call your boss from the office number and your partner using your personal mobile. It\u2019s also possible to set up a temporary number (to keep your personal line private).  Adam Rice, Marketing Manager of lighting business, Urbis Schr\u00e9der, uses the app to save money on international calls when on business trips. \u201cI use the app when I travel as it lets me avoid expensive roaming charges,\u201d Rice says. \u201cI can use a Swytch number to call back to the UK at local rates.\u201d  The app is free to download and your first number is free for six months. After that, it\u2019s \u00a34.99 per month, \u00a314.99 for six months, or \u00a324.99 per year. 8. Concur or Expensify  If you\u2019re tired of collecting receipts, an app that handles business expenses can be a blessing. Users can scan in or photograph receipts, and link claims to a credit card. Concur makes it easy to build detailed expense reports with minimal fuss, and to track and approve employees\u2019 business and travel expenses. Charges can be imported from a linked credit card and it\u2019s possible to book travel and hotels from within the app itself. A small business account with Concur costs $8 per month, per user.  As well as tracking expenses, Expensify can monitor billable time and mileage, making it particularly useful for consultancy businesses. Users can also create multiple reports or invoices to send to their numerous clients. It\u2019s $5 per month, per user. 9. ScanBizCards  Rather than carry around a wallet full of business cards, ScanBizCards allows users to scan the details and add them to their address books (via the Cloud). It\u2019s also possible to import those contacts into other business tools, such as SalesForce, or a spreadsheet.  The app can read 23 languages and it syncs with calendars, so you can set reminders to follow up with new acquaintances. The iOS version is \u00a30.79 to download from the app store. ScanBizCards is a useful addition for its parent company app CircleBack, which keeps address books up to date by pushing notifications when a contact\u2019s job title or position changes.  10. NearDesk  Everyone has had times when they\u2019ve got a few hours to kill before their next meeting but they want to be productive without having to sip six cappuccinos in Costa. Darren Fell, CEO of Crunch Accounting swears by NearDesk, which guides him to the nearest desk that can be hired by the hour.  \u201cIt\u2019s like an Oyster card for co-working spaces,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can use the app to reserve desk space or a meeting room ahead of time, then you use your card to tap into any workspace in their network, and then you get billed for all the hours you use at the end of the month. It\u2019s perfect for people with flexible schedules or who travel a lot.\u201d The card costs \u00a324 per annum (including VAT).  And if you are happy setting up shop in the nearest coffee bar?

And at the end, their team having been beaten 1-0 in a game they really needed to win, those same home fans stayed on long enough to applaud their opponents off the pitch. This was not Old Trafford spontaneously saluting the genius of Ronaldo \u2013 the Brazilian one \u2013 as happened in 2003 after a resplendent hat-trick had removed Manchester United from the Champions League. The key to this applause was the recognition that Leicester are doing it not just for themselves but on behalf of the ordinary clubs, such as Crystal Palace, for whom the Foxes\u2019 success is sign that it is not impermissible to dream.   Related: Leicester cast as freedom fighters against Premier League era\u2019s iniquities | Paul Wilson    Everywhere they go in England, with the exception of certain parts of north London, Claudio Ranieri and his players hear the same exhortation: \u201cNow go on and win it.\u201d This is the sort of reaction occasionally experienced by an underdog when the FA Cup final still represented the climax of the domestic football season. For it to happen in the league is unprecedented and hugely enjoyable. Yes, the club is now owned by a Thai businessman and Bangkok is full of fans wearing Leicester City shirts, some of whom can be assumed to have been only dimly aware of the club before success struck. But that is not the same as being bankrolled by a Russian oligarch or the investment funds of Gulf states, or by a Florida family who bought a prosperous club by putting it heavily into debt. By contemporary standards, the Foxes are not difficult to like off the pitch as well as on it, where the clarity and brio of their football has reminded many people of a simpler time, before tactics became oppressively complicated. Whether or not they manage to convert a lead of seven points with six matches to go into a first league championship for a club founded 132 years ago, the story of their miraculous season also seems likely to have introduced many fans to the concept of having a second team to support. This goes against the grain of the modern football philosophy, which says that an individual is supposed to invest every last drop of emotion in the cause of a single institution. There has surely been no more spectacular example of the obsession with one club to the exclusion of all others than the true story, now half a century old, of the bricklayer who named his daughter \u2013 his daughter! \u2013 after Liverpool\u2019s 1965 FA Cup winners. I sometimes wonder how Paula St John Lawrence Lawler Byrne Strong Yeats Stevenson Callaghan Hunt Milne Smith Thompson Shankly Bennett Paisley O\u2019Sullivan got on in life and whether, between her realisation of what her father had done and the celebration of her 50th birthday this year, she had recourse at any time to the deed-poll mechanism. How the tabloids of the day loved that story, which certainly outshines the more recent revelations of children christened Bermondsey Millwall Den and Lanesra (try it backwards).     \u2018It is harder now to take the spontaneous decision to go to a top-flight match in order to see a particular visiting star, something easily done in the era of Tony Currie.\u2019 Photograph: PA    The momentum of the trend was given a boost when the largely successful effort to combat hooliganism inside stadiums led to the end of terraces and to the strict segregation of seating. While it is unwise to get too mistily nostalgic about life in the Gallowgate End or the Shed, the removal of the right to free movement in physical terms must have strengthened the psychological divide between the supporters of different clubs \u2013 something that has not been dispelled by the invention of the ludicrous half-and-half \u201cfriendship\u201d scarves, aimed at those wanting to take a souvenir back home to Gothenburg or Guangzhou. But for many of us, football loyalty is not actually something completely indivisible. At seven years of age I was taken to watch my first match, at Notts County. Two years later I formed a relationship with Nottingham Forest that has survived a lifetime of transient satisfactions and prolonged abuse. An allegiance to a team on the one side of a river does not preclude an affectionate interest in the fortunes of the mob on the opposite bank, even when, as has happened in brief spells, they occupy the same division \u2013 including a handful of seasons in the top flight, now beginning to seem as remote as the time of the pharaohs. Notts, however, are not my second team. That would be the new holders, after a thrilling match at Wembley last weekend, of the Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy. A personal allegiance to Barnsley FC goes back beyond my own birth, when my father befriended a man named Charlie Baines, who kept a pub in Ardsley, a South Yorkshire mining village. Charlie had made more than 300 appearances for Barnsley between 1921 and 1931, at left-half. He became my godfather and, although he died when I was only seven years old, he is the reason I check Barnsley\u2019s results after Forest\u2019s and, despite last Sunday\u2019s triumph, wonder when they are going to find another midfield string-puller to match Ronnie Glavin. In fact, Notts are not even my third team. That would be Milan, although in recent years the relationship has been tested to breaking point by Silvio Berlusconi, whose desire to stop signing cheques has led to the assembly of a squad without a single player good enough to get into the teams of Nereo Rocco, Arrigo Sacchi and Carlo Ancelotti. But an allegiance based entirely on first-hand exposure one night in 1969 to the golden aura of Gianni Rivera still survives, somehow. It is harder now, even close to impossible, to take the spontaneous decision to go to a top-flight match in order to see a particular visiting star, something easily done in the eras of Stanley Matthews, Johnny Haynes, Peter Osgood and Tony Currie. But an attachment to individual players \u2013 and not only the superstar vendors of replica shirts such as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 is another way of enjoying football. Many whose recently kindled enthusiasm for Leicester will not outlast the summer\u2019s celebrations may find themselves retaining an interest in the career of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, wherever he eventually goes \u2013 which could be Old Trafford, if we take Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s description of the Frenchman as the player of the season to be the sign of a fishing expedition undertaken on behalf of Manchester United. But perhaps that\u2019s too cynical an interpretation.

He has come to Tate Modern for a three-day retrospective of his multifarious moving-image work \u2013 feature films, shorts, promos \u2013 the bulk of which was screened continuously for 14 hours overnight on 9 April to mark the reopening of the gallery\u2019s Starr cinema auditorium. Weerasethakul, a charming, unfailingly polite and very neatly dressed 45 year old, says he doesn\u2019t mind in the least that his delicately composed, subtly atmospheric films should be exhibited in such an environment; it is, he says \u201ca celebration, a big party\u201d.   Related: Everything is possible \u2013 five things we learned at the Apichatpong Weerasethakul all-nighter    But the fact that such a venue should be hosting such an event tells us quite a bit about Weerasethakul\u2019s work, and his approach to it. He is the winner of one of cinema\u2019s highest honours, the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or, for his 2010 feature, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, but is only now releasing a substantial follow-up, Cemetery of Splendour, which premiered at Cannes in 2015.

Photograph: Chai Siris/Kick the Machine Films    Weerasethakul, bless him, says he still can\u2019t understand why Uncle Boonmee \u2013 an elliptical tale of a dying man who is visited by the spirits of his dead wife and vanished son \u2013 made such an impact. \u201cI liked it because there were so many personal references, but I didn\u2019t think they could translate to the audience. Some of my other films I can understand why they got a reaction because there are certain things in them cinematically; but Uncle Boonmee, it\u2019s such a strange one.\u201d   Related: Cemetery of Splendour review: a very calm sort of hysteria    Cemetery of Splendour is Weerasethakul\u2019s seventh feature, if you include his long-form 2000 documentary Mysterious Object at Noon (due to be restored and reissued on DVD following the Tate\u2019s event) as well as the normally glossed-over 2003 comedy The Adventure of Iron Pussy \u2013 mention of which elicits a sheepish giggle. (\u201cIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing if the audience doesn\u2019t know the context.\u201d)  His film-making strengths \u2013 as displayed in Blissfully Yours, Tropical Malady, Syndromes and a Century, and Uncle Boonmee itself \u2013 are a structural audacity that often results in narratives stopping dead, switching characters, or reformatting themselves; a languid, lyrical shooting style; and an unhurried investigation of memory and place. It\u2019s a combination that \u2013 along with an unabashed cinematic eroticism \u2013 has made him a fixture at major international film festivals, and a three-time prizewinner at Cannes.     A scene from Tropical Malady, starring Sakda Kaewbuadee and Banlop Lomnoi. Photograph: Kick the Machine Films    However, it\u2019s clear that feature films are not necessarily his priority: Weerasethakul spends much of his time creating installations and performance pieces with glorious titles like A Man Who Ate an Entire Tree. In fact, he says, getting features off the ground has got tougher since his elevation to the Cannes pantheon: it is becoming \u201charder to finance\u201d what he calls his kind of \u201csmall, no stars\u201d films. \u201cIt\u2019s the climate of funding. It\u2019s all on a big scale now.\u201d He\u2019s actually doing more visual art, he says. \u201cI am just enjoying experimenting and doing different things.\u201d It\u2019s this tension \u2013 or cross-pollination \u2013 between art and cinema that seems to lie at the heart of Weerasethakul\u2019s work. The shorts and art pieces, he says, are where he can film \u201cwithout rules\u201d; for feature films, he says, \u201cyou are leading the audience by the hand. In order for them to follow, you need to use the established rules.\u201d His work is all rooted in the same ideas, he says, but the format dictates itself. \u201cIt\u2019s instinctive.\u201d He describes how it worked for Cemetery of Splendour, which takes place largely in a hospital for soldiers afflicted by a mysterious form of narcolepsy. It started, he says, with \u201cthis idea of sleep\u201d. Then, \u201ca bit of narrative comes along\u201d, and \u201cyou get a larger picture\u201d. \u201cThat tells you what it needs to be; that it needs to be a film.\u201d     A surreal moment from Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall his Past Lives.    Seen back to back, as most of them will have been in the night-long retrospective, Weerasethakul\u2019s preoccupations emerge with some force. Some are stylistic and structural: a fondness for bifurcated storytelling; characters and actors that shift from film to film; a tip of the hat to the cheesy Thai TV of his youth. Others are thematic: an investigation and recreation of memories \u2013 he grew up the son of doctors, hence the frequent presence of hospitals and medical procedures in his films; reincarnation and the spirit world regularly invoked for its metaphoric value; the recurring presence of the military as a symbol of power and control.  A lot of his ideas, he says, derive directly from the people he works with. Anyone with a passing knowledge of his work, for example, will probably recognise the figure of Jenjira Pongpas (aka Nach) Widner, the woman whose romantic yearnings and undisguised limp \u2013 the result of a motorcycle accident \u2013 have become key features of what Weerasethakul terms his \u201cuniverse\u201d. Actors, says Weerasethakul, \u201care not just a shell, they are part of the movie\u201d. Widner, whose story Weerasethakul also explored in one of his shorts, Cactus River, has become an even more significant figure in Cemetery of Splendour, which foregrounds her habit of knitting baby socks and her relationship with her American husband. \u201cWhen I wrote Cemetery, Jenjira was in my mind from the beginning.\u201d         Watch a trailer for Cemetery of Splendour    In Weerasethakul\u2019s hands, Thai culture comes across as simultaneously profound and absurd, mysterious and mundane, heroic and trivial. His films\u2019 \u2013 and characters\u2019 \u2013 interest in reincarnation arguably gives his work its most distinctive flavour, allowing him to stage utterly strange sequences \u2013 such as the talking ape scene in Tropical Malady, or the princess-fish sex in Uncle Boonmee. It\u2019s an active social force in his homeland he says: \u201cPeople believe in it, and it drives the way they view life. [Belief in] karma makes people submissive; that\u2019s how the country is run.\u201d For Weerasethakul, this issue is no longer simply aesthetic: after the 2014 military coup, it\u2019s one of political urgency. Pointing out that \u201cthe army has its own fortune teller\u201d, he sounds less than happy at the state of affairs: \u201cThe country is run by superstition.\u201d Weerasethakul is in a relatively fortunate position, in that his arcane films are not exactly populist and don\u2019t depend on the mainstream Thai film industry for funding, but he has become cast as a significant voice of dissent in a difficult time. \u201cFor the record,\u201d he says, \u201cCemetery is not censored: I refuse to submit it to the censor board. It\u2019s not that they ban it, but the fact they ban other things.\u201d      Jenjira Ponpas Widner, right, in Cemetery of Splendour. Photograph: Chai Siris/Kick the Machine Films    But in retrospect, the heavy presence of soldiers and the military in his films suggests a presentiment that turned out to be correct. Cemetery of Splendour, if nothing else, is a pointed analysis of the wounds the Thai military have inflicted on the country over the decades. \u201cI like to show uniforms anyway, but in the course of the last 10 years the role of the army has got more and more difficult. I have shifted from symbolic uses to do with power, like being a sexual predator, to more reflect the political involvement they have had for a long time.\u201d The mid-1960s communist insurgency, supported by Maoist China and leading to significant conflict in the north-east of the country, is the subject of Weerasethakul\u2019s touring installation project Primitive, which grew directly out of his research for Uncle Boonmee (which is set in the same region).  But, he says, there\u2019s nothing like dealing with Thai bureaucracy for keeping your feet on the ground. \u201cWhen I go to get a driving licence or to report something missing to the police, they want to write down my profession. I say, \u2018I am a film-maker\u2019; and they say, \u2018What?\u2019 Then they write: \u2018Freelance.\u2019\u201d \u201cIn Thailand, being an artist or a film-maker is not considered a career.\u201d Oh well, give the boy time. You never know, he just might get somewhere.  Cemetery of Splendour is released in UK cinemas on 17 June, and the installation Primitive opens at Tate Modern, London, on the same date. Mysterious Object at Noon is released on DVD and Blu-Ray on 25 April.

The Migrant Offshore Aid Station, run by American entrepreneur Christopher Catrambone and his wife, Regina, has rescued almost 13,000 people in the Mediterranean Sea and moved one ship, the MY Phoenix, to the Andaman Sea. The Phoenix had been due to launch two unmanned helicopters to search large areas of the ocean to assess trafficking and prevent loss of life. The 40-metre ship would then rescue any migrants in distress and bring them to land. \u201cWe cleared it with the ministry of defence, the Royal Thai Navy, the transportation ministry and the prime minister\u2019s office,\u201d Catrambone told the Guardian, speaking from the telecommunications room on board the Phoenix. But when the two drones were due to transfer through Thailand to the ship, anchored on the Thai coast, they were blocked by customs for weeks despite guarantees, he said. \u201cEvery single aspect of the process was disrupted,\u201d said Catrambone. The mission was due to start operations on 3 March to help save Bangladeshi migrants and Burmese Rohingya refugees during the dry season when human traffickers and smugglers take advantage of the calm conditions to make the route to Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. With the rainy season and rough seas starting in May, the delay forced the crew to abandon the mission as the yearly migration ends, Catrambone said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t wait any more for the drones. Its a matter of the monsoon season starting. We would be wasting our time. \u201cWe did not expect the Thais to have any authority to restrict [the drones],\u201d he said, adding that the equipment would only transit Thailand to a Belize-registered ship. Countries in the region have tried for years to ignore the yearly migrant crisis that has become a humanitarian catastrophe. Human rights groups have consistently accused Thailand of ignoring the abuse of trafficked people and allege many officials are implicated in the trade. A former Thai officer tasked with investigating human trafficking said in 2015 that he fled for his life after he found senior figures in the military and police were involved in the trade. Thailand\u2019s military junta denies the claims and has also pressed charges against more than 100 people, including an army general, on counts of human trafficking after dozens of bodies were found in a jungle prison camp in 2015. However, Thailand and neighbouring Malaysia have pushed the boats back out to sea to prevent the migrants coming ashore. When pursued by the authorities, the smugglers have at times abandoned their ships and left the migrants without food or water.   Related: The millionaire who rescues migrants at sea | Giles Tremlett    Catrambone said his team, particularly the Thai partners it worked with to transfer the drones, had been put under surveillance. \u201cWe tried to go along as best we could until all our people were scared away,\u201d Catrambone said, adding that a man working for them in Bangkok said he was followed. He said the Thai agent working on clearing the drones through customs suddenly told the charity that she would stop working with them. \u201cBasically she dumped us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she was pressured. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong what they did to us. Our paper trail goes back six months. We have dotted our i\u2019s and crossed our t\u2019s. We have done everything.\u201d The foreign ministry and prime minister\u2019s office did not respond to Guardian requests for comment. Wednesday is a national holiday in Thailand. The drones were due to stream live footage of the search area online. The operation could not continue without the drones, Catrambone said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re conducting an operation at sea you have visibility of two nautical miles. A drone can cover 300 square miles around your ship. We\u2019ve proven that model works in the Med. \u201cYou definitely need air assets to operate at sea.\u201d The ship would now conduct a shorter two-week mission without the drones in the Andaman Sea but was being followed by Thai navy ships, Catrambone says. On Monday, he said, the navy conducted aggressive manoeuvres close to the ship as it sailed up the coast. \u201cWe have the Thai navy shadowing us. We had them come across our bow. It\u2019s like being cut off on the road,\u201d he said. He said the crew were harassed in Phuket port and that customs in Ranong, to the north, had tried to get them to enter the port. \u201cThey want us in the port but if we are out at sea they can\u2019t really do anything. I have a feeling they are trying to detain the vessel.\u201d On Tuesday evening the ship was allowed to leave. MOAS plans to retry the effort in October when the monsoon season ends. The government of Myanmar does not recognise the roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya as citizens, creating a stateless people. In 2012 deadly clashes with Buddhists in the western state of Rakhine caused 140,000 Rohingya to flee their homes. Tens of thousands have since left by boat, often using family savings to pay smugglers.

It was Chapman\u2019s intervention that turned it into gold. \u201cHow can we make this madder?\u201d he had wondered.

None of it really makes sense. Baffling, beautiful and stamped with its own copyright. Where else, just for starters, has a story of this nature begun with a manager, infamous for calling a journalist an ostrich, being sacked after an orgy involving several players, one being his son, on a club tour to Bangkok? What kind of logic went into deciding the best person to replace that manager was someone who had lost his last job, in charge of Greece, after losing to the Faroe Islands? And good luck to any prospective title-winners trying to copy the formula. Some enterprising street sellers have appeared outside the King Power Stadium in the past couple of weeks with several bags filled with \u201cChampions\u201d scarves. Some were held aloft after the win at Sunderland last weekend and Alan Birchenall has used his column in the Leicester Mercury to urge supporters not to get too far ahead of themselves.

Claudio Ranieri\u2019s latest press conference featured questions from Barcelona\u2019s Sport newspaper, Fox Australia, La Repubblica, the Discovery Networks and BT Sport, a Danish newspaper which has a correspondent in Leicester for the next three weeks. \u201cThe problem is we cannot get into any games,\u201d its reporter, Farzam Abolhosseini, says glumly. Leicester\u2019s press box is oversubscribed and buying a ticket is not straightforward unless you can afford the obscene amounts the touts are asking (up to \u00a315,000). Otherwise, there are \u201cSold Out\u201d posters around the stadium where, walking down Lineker Road, past the old electricity station, the car garage and along Filbert Way to the home of the champions in waiting, one word stands out. It is emblazoned on the side of the stadium in giant capital letters: Fearless.   Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend    Leicester have already appeared on the front of the Wall Street Journal in an article that handily explains it is Less-ter, not Lie-ches-ter, and asks whether a correlation can be drawn between the discovery of Richard III\u2019s remains in the city and the fact that ever since he was ceremonially reburied, in March last year, the team have barely stopped winning. Sports Illustrated has introduced readers to the story with the headline: \u201cAs likely as Elvis being alive\u201d. CNN\u2019s cameras have been carrying out vox-pops in the city centre and a small army of Japanese journalists, following Shinji Okazaki\u2019s progress, has flown into the place where JB Priestley once wrote he was \u201cquite ready to praise it, but glad to think I did not live in it\u201d. Leicester: the city of Showaddywaddy, Joseph Merrick, Willie Thorne, Engelbert Humperdinck and Adrian Mole. Population: 330,000. Motto: Semper Eadem. It means \u201cAlways the Same\u201d and in a football context that is not a bad description of the club\u2019s 132-year existence. League titles pre-2016: zero. FA Cup wins: same again. Fairytales: ditto. It has not been an entirely heroic journey and they might have to forgive us for suspecting some fancy footwork, to put it in the most generous terms, to circumnavigate the Football League\u2019s financial fair play regulations when they were promoted two years ago. Jamie Vardy\u2019s racism, caught on CCTV at a late-night casino, is not a stain that will wash out easily and let us not forget it was Leicester going into administration, wiping out \u00a350m of debt, that shocked the Football League into imposing 10-point penalties for any clubs planning similar tactics. Leicester owed \u00a36m in tax at the time and perhaps it would be a decent gesture, on the verge of hitting the jackpot, if they remembered the \u00a316,000 they owed to East Midlands Ambulance Service or the \u00a34,415 that should have been paid to St John Ambulance for providing first-aid volunteers. They have never seen a penny \u2013 and nobody can possibly say Leicester cannot afford to put it right. All the same it would need a remarkable killjoy not to appreciate what has happened at a club that spent almost six months \u2013 175 days, to be precise \u2013 in the bottom three last season with their toes in danger of being tagged for the relegation morgue. Leicester has had a world snooker champion, an X Factor winner, a Glastonbury-headlining band and a secret diary-keeper, aged 13 and three-quarters, who once had a go at glue-sniffing and accidentally stuck a model aeroplane to his nose. What they have never had is a title-winning football team and, barring one near miss in 1962-63, they have never really been close since finishing as runners-up to Sheffield Wednesday in 1929. Since the second world war Leicester have spent as many years outside the top division, 35, as they have in it. They have managed only five top-seven finishes, the last being 40 years ago, and were grubbing around for points among the puddles and potholes of third-tier football as recently as 2009. On this weekend seven years ago they were preparing for League One\u2019s run-in on the back of a 3-1 win against Hereford United at Edgar Street, in front of 4,389 people. Leicester had three matches left: Southend, Scunthorpe and Crewe. Don\u2019t assume Riyad Mahrez was joking when he said he had never heard of Leicester until they tried to sign him. \u201cI thought they were a rugby club,\u201d the Algerian explained.     The belief Claudio Ranieri has instilled in his Leicester City side is remarkable as the Premier League title beckons. Photograph: Plumb Images/Getty Images    What we have now is thrilling schadenfreude for those of us who find ourselves peering inside football\u2019s bubble and not always liking what we see about the establishment, the churn of success for the same old superpowers and the way, at some clubs, it sometimes feels as if money is the way they keep the score. Leicester\u2019s entire wage bill, to put it into context, is \u00a357m, roughly a quarter of that of the Manchester United side who are now barely a speck in their wing-mirrors. It may seem surprising that Leicester are the eighth-highest net spenders since promotion but, then again, just consider how much the three players nominated for the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association\u2019s Player of the Year award cost the club. Four years ago Vardy was turning out for Fleetwood Town, Mahrez was playing for Le Havre reserves and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 was breaking through in a Boulogne side slithering towards the Championnat National, France\u2019s third division. They cost a combined \u00a37.1m and heaven knows what they would fetch in the current market. Not that Leicester need to think that way these days. The dreamers have become the dream-makers. They have reached this point with starting odds of 5,000-1 and, in the process, they are changing all our perceptions. Because if Leicester can win the league, then, crazy as it sounds, what is to stop the supporters of Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and other like-sized clubs wondering whether the same can happen to them one day? The truth, of course, is more prosaic and it is much more likely normal service will resume next season when Manchester City will surely improve under Pep Guardiola, Chelsea cannot be so bad again and Manchester United would presumably like to think the same about themselves. But this is why Leicester\u2019s story is so captivating. They have brought hope where many thought there was none. They have supplied hard, exhilarating evidence that it is possible to catch and overhaul the super-rich and, in doing so, they have made glorious buffoons out of all of us who imagined them in the relegation quicksands. The stampede of people tipping Leicester to slip into the Championship included correspondents from the BBC, ITV, the Times, the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and, yes, the Guardian. Leicester\u2019s title odds were the same as Dagenham and Redbridge winning the FA Cup or the Loch Ness Monster being discovered in the River Soar. And how many people had a flutter? Twenty-five, according to William Hill, ranging from a woman in Edinburgh who put on five pence and might get \u00a3250 for her troubles to the two largest stakes, \u00a320, placed in Warwick and Manchester. The gamblers include a Brighton supporter, Nathaniel Whessell, who placed his 60p bet \u201cfor a laugh\u201d and plans to spend the summer in Ibiza if he rakes in \u00a33,000 winnings. In total the 25 bets amounted to \u00a368.55. Only three, however, were placed in Leicester, which suggests that many people in the city shared Gary Lineker\u2019s suspicions last July about the appointment of their new manager. \u201cClaudio Ranieri?\u201d Lineker wrote on Twitter. \u201cReally?\u201d   Related: PFA Awards: Leicester\u2019s Vardy, Mahrez and Kant\u00e9 lead the case for the crown | David Hytner    Not everyone, though.

Next season, he says, he hopes to spend his winnings on a season ticket. It is not straightforward, however. \u201cThey tell me the waiting list is astronomical.\u201d From Ranieri, taking his seat for a standing-room-only press conference, there was an apology for abandoning his usual policy of shaking everyone\u2019s hands. \u201cI would lose one hour,\u201d Ranieri said, looking round a sweaty, airless room filled with 70-plus journalists. Ranieri talked about how much he loved the Champions League music and his tears at Sunderland. He called his players \u201cmy sons\u201d and reminisced about starting the season as the manager with the shortest odds to be sacked (\u201cI remember it very well\u201d). His eyes twinkled, his smile was never far away. Would he like a statue? \u201cIn Italy we have a saying that you get a statue only when you are dead,\u201d he replied, and he rocked with laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to have a great season with great teams,\u201d Alessandro Vocalelli wrote in Corriere dello Sport this week. \u201cLeicester are the tangible demonstration that fairytales still exist and the classic clubs aren\u2019t the only ones who can have a go at winning something.

Other areas of the hotel \u2013 such as the restaurant, which has communal tables made from wood salvaged from the old factory \u2013 blend Mexican traditions with contemporary design, while allowing the architectural history of the building to peep through.\u2022 Doubles from \u00a375, +52 222 309 19 20, lapurificadora.com Paper Factory Hotel, New York      It\u2019s no surprise that NYC, with its big, red-brick industrial buildings and insatiable appetite for cool, has its fair share of industrial-chic luxury. These include the Refinery Hotel, with its rooftop bar, and the Wythe, with its floor-to-ceiling factory windows. Still, they both command reasonably high prices, whereas the Paper Factory Hotel (guess what kind of building this one was?), is at the budget-boutique end of the spectrum. In the borough of Queens, the hotel has its fair share of exposed brick walls but also has a sense of humour in its design, compared with most, straight-faced minimalist hotels: the interior incorporates British telephone boxes, leather suitcases, pianos, punch bags and all sorts of vintage props to make your stay a bit of an adventure.\u2022 Doubles from \u00a398 +1 718 392 7200, paperfactoryhotel.com Curiocity, Johannesburg      A hostel with a history that goes deeper than its industrial past, Curiocity occupies the old red-brick premises of Pacific Press, which printed material for the ANC and Black Sash Movement during the apartheid era. Now the hostel brings travellers to one of the city\u2019s oldest suburbs, thanks to the work of young entrepreneur and creative Bheki Dube, who founded it.

Instead, visitors find themselves in a spacious, modernist construction, bold and geometric from the outside, clean and simple on the inside. The central design feature is a staircase that zigzags up inside of the building, giving views a bit like an MC Escher print. The dorms, with simple metal bunks and bare walls, may seem a bit spartan, but the private rooms, with smooth concrete desks, sinks and en suite bathrooms, will appeal to anyone on the hunt for a more creatively designed (and industrial) place to stay in the capital.\u2022 Doubles from \u00a316, dorms from \u00a34, +66 2 266 9400, thrivethehostel.com", "publicationDate": "2016-04-18T05:30:08Z", "tags": ["Hotels", "Hostels", "Top 10s", "Travel", "Architecture", "Art and design"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/18/top-10-industrial-chic-hotels-hostels-new-york-bangkok-berlin-tokyo", "title": "Top 10 industrial-chic hotels and hostels", "sentences": ["The design inside is simple but modern, using corrugated metal and scaffolding to create a communal, social space.\u2022 Doubles from \u00a322, dorms from \u00a39, +27 0 11 614 0163 , curiocitybackpackers.com Thrive The Hostel, Bangkok      With a design concept that takes bamboo beach huts, hammocks and banana pancakes and dashes them against a cold, hard, concrete wall, Thrive The Hostel in Bangkok is a welcome change from the usual cheesy traveller-hippy aesthetic of most hostels along the south-east Asian backpacker trail."]}, {"article": "If anyone is to beat Gennady Golovkin before he eventually retires, he needs to meet the Kazak on his own best night and hope the finest all-round fighter in boxing turns up with a black eye and the idiot grin of someone who has just been mugged. \u201cI am the future,\u201d Golovkin said before destroying the unbeaten American Dominic Wade in two rounds at the Inglewood Forum in Los Angeles on Saturday. He is also the recent past and the present of his sport, a genuine draw-card in what everyone knew was going to be a flat period after the alleged retirement of Floyd Mayweather, one win short of a half-century.   Related: Gennady Golovkin defends titles with two-round destruction of Dominic Wade    Carl Froch, who declined an offer to come out of retirement and meet Golovkin at super-middleweight, is one of the few doubters. \u201cI see him getting hit with shots,\u201d he says. \u201cHe walks through them to land his, but he\u2019s wide open coming forward. I\u2019m not on the GGG bandwagon.\u201d With all due respect to one of our finest champions in recent years, from this keyboard there is nobody to touch Golovkin at or either side of 11st 7lb. Indeed, if noises about a Mayweather comeback pan out, that is still the fight boxing needs, even at some ridiculous catchweight. For now GGG, garlanded with endorsements and cheered raucously wherever he goes in his adopted country, is officially an America hero. He got his biggest purse, $2m, on Saturday; he should soon be nudging that way higher \u2013 especially if he fights an opponent more credible and marketable than Wade. Golovkin toyed with Wade, whose pre-fight assertion that the four-belt champion was \u201cbasic and up and down\u201d was cruelly turned back on him. The one who went down, up, down, up and down again was the game, bewildered kid from Largo, Maryland. Golovkin decked the challenger for practice in the first round, put him down with a right to the shoulder to finish off earlier cuffs to his confused head, and finally kept him on the canvas for the full count at the end of the second. His main threats from these islands, probably in this order, bring the added value of British TV money: James DeGale, who should have minimum trouble defending his IBF title against the nondescript Rogelio Medina in Washington on Saturday; the undefeated WBO champion Billy Joe Saunders, forced to pull out of his title fight against Max Bursak in London on the same night because of a hand injury; and, so his dad keeps telling us, the British champion Chris Eubank Jr. There is also, of course, Amir Khan. Having campaigned most of his professional career at light-welter and welter, he steps up to middleweight to fight the WBC champion Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alv\u00e1rez in Las Vegas two Saturdays from now, knowing an upset would place him in pole position for a shot Golovkin. However, win or lose, Khan has his sights set on revenge against Danny Garc\u00eda \u2013 perhaps because the man who took his welterweight title off him has been mentioned as a potential comeback opponent for Mayweather, who twice reneged on fights with Khan. And, curiously, Alv\u00e1rez doesn\u2019t sound as keen as he did a few months ago. He told reporters last week: \u201cI want to have that fight. I want to give that to the fans. I\u2019m just not sure when.\u201d That\u2019s fighting talk \u2013 if you\u2019re wearing a pinstripe suit and have a damp stogie sticking out the side of your mouth. It is risky to call a fighter ageless, because they all get old. But Golovkin, now 34, is aging gracefully and with increasing menace, his innate talent, boxing IQ and natural strength the foundation of his ringcraft. He is on a par with Mayweather, Bernard Hopkins, Winky Wright, Kostya Tszyu and Crisanto Espana \u2013 the wise guys of this and recent eras \u2013 for sheer ring intelligence. It is his power that fans remember, though. Americans (fans and suits) love Golovkin because he knocks people out; he has 14 clean count-outs among his 32 stoppages in 35 fights. So a round of applause for Mehdi Bouadla, Ian Gardner and Amar Amari, the only opponents to go the distance with him, all in the space of 12 months about nine years ago. There was another treat on the BoxNation undercard \u2013 apart from the ever excellent and out-there, back-here-in-the-studio asides of the Steves, Bunce and Lillis \u2013 the very clever Rom\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. The Nicaraguan flyweight, probably No2 to Golovkin as pound-for-pound best in the world, had a tougher assignment in his fifth defence of his WBC title, taken 12 rounds for only the seventh time in 45 fights, by the 30-year-old Puerto Rican McWilliams Aroyo. Gonz\u00e1lez moves, thinks and hits with purpose, wasting nothing, cashing in on every mistake of his opponent. Aroyo\u2019s task was made no easier when the sole of his right shoe came off in the fourth round, meaning he had to box with tape around his foot, which reduced traction when throwing a right. Competing with Gonz\u00e1lez with two good shoes is hard enough without the handicap of such an unusual wardrobe malfunction. But he tried all the way. It brought to mind the wet, wild night in Bangkok 62 years ago when the world bantamweight champion Jimmy Carruthers and his Thai challenger, Chamroen Songkitrat, went 12 rounds barefoot, to better get a grip on the soaked canvas in the outdoor National Stadium. That wasn\u2019t their only problem. Twice during the downpour the ring lights exploded, showering them in glass. Songkitrat had the worst of it. After soaking up the rain and Jimmy\u2019s left hooks for several rounds, he got back to near level terms near the end, only to lose by two clear rounds on the lone judgment of the referee Fred Henneberry \u2013 who, like Carruthers, was Australian. The 24-year-old champion announced his retirement the following day \u2013 and, inevitably, made an unsuccessful comeback 10 years later \u2013 but was lured back to fisticuffs in later life, stripping to his underpants to quieten an ambitious troublemaker in his fabled Bells Hotel in Woolloomooloo, near Sydney\u2019s red-light district. A no-nonsense wharf labourer in his younger days (and a tireless campaigner for unions and world peace), the Sydney-born son of English migrants did not lose many, in or out of the ring. Gonz\u00e1lez says he would like to move up in weight. Carruthers would have given him a good argument at bantamweight, with or without shoes.", "publicationDate": "2016-04-25T14:51:19Z", "tags": ["Gennady Golovkin", "Boxing", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/25/gennady-golovkin-pound-for-pound-post-mayweather", "title": "Gennady Golovkin proves a genuine draw in the post-Mayweather world | Kevin Mitchell", "sentences": ["It brought to mind the wet, wild night in Bangkok 62 years ago when the world bantamweight champion Jimmy Carruthers and his Thai challenger, Chamroen Songkitrat, went 12 rounds barefoot, to better get a grip on the soaked canvas in the outdoor National Stadium."]}, {"article": "In your own personal, mental geography, what does New York look like? A GPS grid of streets, shops and restaurants? A knot of colour-coded subway lines? Or perhaps Saul Steinberg\u2019s famously myopic View of the World from 9th Avenue. For the writer, activist and Guardian contributor Rebecca Solnit, America\u2019s biggest conurbation is a \u201ccrazy diagonal slash of islands. If you put the whole city together, almost half of it is New Jersey, but that is usually blotted out in some way. It is just a really big, complex place\u201d. Solnit, well-known for her writing on politics, art and feminism, has turned her attention to New York City\u2019s complexities in Nonstop Metropolis, the third of her trilogy of atlases and accompanying exhibitions, which began in 2010 with Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas, and was followed in 2013 by Unfathomable City: A New Orleans Atlas. \u201cTennessee Williams said: \u2018America has only three cities, New York, San Francisco and New Orleans. All the rest are just Cleveland,\u2019\u201d Solnit explains, before admitting there were other reasons she expanded this undertaking, which began as a commission from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, to include the Big Apple and the Big Easy. \u201cThey\u2019re cultural capitals, three port cities on the three coasts of the US,\u201d she says. \u201cNew York has been hovering in the wings for a long time. When this book comes out in October, I will be done making atlases for the foreseeable future.\u201d In anticipation of the book\u2019s publication, which Solnit oversaw with her co-director, the writer and geographer Joshua Jelly-Schapiro, New York\u2019s Queens Museum is currently hosting an accompanying exhibition, Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix. For the rest of 2016, the museum will be staging talks and events, commissioning artworks inspired by the new atlas, and giving away free broadsides \u2013 single sheets reproducing the book\u2019s works, which aren\u2019t the kind of cartography you\u2019re likely to find racked in a nearby Exxon station. One new map, by Atlas contributors Garnette Cadogan and Jonathan Tarleton examined, what Solnit describes as \u201cone of the great paradoxes of modern history\u201d. \u201cThe South Bronx was being burnt down and destroyed as hip-hop was being born,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was massive war-like destruction, but there\u2019s this great cultural birth going on.\u201d Another, looking into New Jersey\u2019s avant-garde heritage, from Dizzy Gillespie to pioneering land artist Robert Smithson, is accompanied by an interview with New Jersey-born writer, activist and actor Peter Coyote. \u201cNew Jersey has this great avant-garde history,\u201d says Solnit. \u201cyet it lives in the shadow of New York and doesn\u2019t get much respect.\u201d The atlas celebrates polyglot New York in a map entitled Mother Tongues in Queens. \u201cNew York is the single most linguistically diverse place on earth with more than 800 languages spoken,\u201d says Solnit, who worked with the Endangered Language Alliance when researching the languages. \u201cThat includes a lot of endangered, disappearing languages. A lot of those speakers live in Queens.\u201d The Queens museum show expands on this, with specially commissioned works from Duke Riley, a local artist fascinated with all things aquatic, whose mural, That\u2019s What She Said, looks at the sources of New York\u2019s drinking water; and Mariam Ghani, a New York artist of Afghani and Lebanese heritage, whose wall piece, The Garden of Forked Tongues, riffs on the Queens language map.     Duke Riley Panorama 1 Photograph: Hai Zhang/Queens Museum    There\u2019s also a much-anticipated map of the Wu Tang Clan\u2019s Staten Island, as described by the group\u2019s co-founder, Rza and illustrated by the Beijing-born artist Peach Tao. \u201cStaten Island is seen as this white, suburban place,\u201d says Solnit. \u201cYet this group of black men went to a bunch of kung fu movies in the flophouse theatres on 42nd Street and Times Square, and came up with this mythology, of Staten Island as Shaolin: a mysterious, magical, Chinese place.\u201d Solnit\u2019s project is in part a response to the kind of digital mapping services most of us use today. \u201cPeople put restaurants in Google maps and little else,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t think a place has a tragic and astonishing history. It just seems to be places just to eat food.\u201d She admits that, while online maps aren\u2019t perfect, neither is her new atlas. \u201cYou can\u2019t show everything,\u201d Solnit says. \u201cYou can show butterfly migration paths and gay public history as we did on our map of San Francisco, Monarchs and Queens; you can show language use, or police brutality or landlord arson. Maps are always arbitrary.\u201d In many cases the choice of what to show where lay with the Atlas\u2019s 30 or so contributors, whom include among their number the writers Luc Sante and Teju Cole, and the historian Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts. Yet Solnit\u2019s reluctance to describe herself as the Atlas\u2019s author \u2013 she occasionally titles herself atlas ringmaster \u2013 belies just a sliver of autobiography. Although raised in California, Solnit was born in the New York metropolitan area, and stayed with relatives in the five boroughs when New York City was a far less safe place than it is today. \u201cI was a punk rocker, and that kind of grew out of the ruins of modernism both culturally and geographically,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember when New York was a place literally beyond redemption. Now Manhattan is this super-swanky, elite place full of offshore tax-sheltered empty apartments and insanely expensive luxury goods. New York has been a lot of difference places. There\u2019s the birth of hip-hop in the ruins of the Bronx, the fact that it\u2019s the most Jewish place outside of Israel. There\u2019s Wall Street and Occupy Wall St. If you love Occupy, you probably don\u2019t like Wall St.\u201d In this way, the atlas ringmaster hopes her audience, be they Queens Museum visitors or book readers, native New Yorkers or out-of-towners, may gain some sense of time, in this exercise geographical place. \u201cIn maps you can see how a place got to be the way it is and who was there before you,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are really important tools in order to be a well-informed citizen. Visitors may take that home to Bangkok or Edinburgh or Helsinki, and that may help them think about their cities.\u201d Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix is at the Queens Museum until 1 January 2017; Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas is published by University of California Press in October ", "publicationDate": "2016-04-26T15:51:34Z", "tags": ["Exhibitions", "New York", "Maps", "Culture", "Books", "Art and design", "Travel", "San Francisco", "New Orleans"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/26/nonstop-metropolis-atlas-exhibition-new-yorks-rebecca-solnit", "title": "Nonstop metropolis: viewing a city's crazy, diverse, complex history as an atlas", "sentences": ["Visitors may take that home to Bangkok or Edinburgh or Helsinki, and that may help them think about their cities.\u201d Nonstop Metropolis: The Remix is at the Queens Museum until 1 January 2017; Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas is published by University of California Press in October "]}, {"article": "Three members of a British family who were attacked at a Thai beachside resort have been allowed to leave hospital. Lewis and Rosemary Owen, aged 68 and 65, were with their son, also Lewis, in his 40s, when several men attacked them this month during Thai new year celebrations in Hua Hin, a coastal town south of Bangkok. Recently emerged CCTV footage showed a vicious and prolonged assault which started when the younger Lewis accidentally knocked into one of the men and spilled his drinks as the family made their way along a busy street.  The men, who were already brawling among themselves, then pushed Lewis angrily to the ground. In an attempt to stop them, his mother slapped one, shortly before her husband was punched by another. One of the men then punched Rosemary with such force that she was knocked unconscious. Her husband and son continued to be punched and kicked. When she came around her assailant kicked her in the head. All three Owens were left on the pavement as a large crowd watched on. A spokesman for the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said police had arrested six people and charged them with grievous assault on 17 April. He said: \u201cAn investigation is in process and the suspects will soon be under the jurisdiction of the court. If found guilty, the perpetrators of this incident will face full justice under Thai law. \u201cThe Tourism Authority of Thailand would like to express our deepest sorrow to the family who were subjected to the assault \u2026 We hope that you recover from your injuries and make a swift and full recovery. TAT would like to assure international travellers that this was an isolated incident, not targeted on any group of foreign tourists in particular. The situation was exacerbated by alcohol.\u201d Lewis and Rosemary are expected to return to the UK next week, and their son is already back in Singapore, where he works, the TAT said. A police spokesman, Chaiyakorn Sriladecho, told the Associated Press: \u201cThe men say they are sorry and that they wouldn\u2019t have done this if they weren\u2019t drunk.\u201d The father and son required stitches for head injuries, while the mother suffered serious head and eye injuries, Chaiyakorn said.

A spokeswoman said: \u201cOur staff have been in contact with the family to offer assistance and will remain in contact with the local authorities.\u201d The Owens\u2019 neighbours in Wenvoe, near Cardiff, expressed shock at the incident. John Miles, 65, a retired lecturer at Cardiff University, said he learned about the attack in the newspaper. He said: \u201cI later saw Rose and Lew\u2019s daughter in the village, who told me that it was her mum, dad and brother who had been attacked. It came as a big shock. She said she hadn\u2019t slept all night and looked so worried. It must be hell for her knowing this has happened and being on the other side of the world. It is dreadful. \u201cLew and Rose are really well-liked people and everyone is thinking of them. When they come back I know that everyone will do whatever they can to help.\u201d Miles added that the couple often went to Thailand to visit friends and their son had flown out from Singapore to meet them. \u201cLew and Rose are a really lovely couple and very hard-working,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all know the lay of the land there and the local customs. They are genuinely lovely people, I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would ever want to hurt them.\u201d   Related: British family beaten unconscious in Thailand during holiday    The Owens\u2019 daughter, Ceri, visited her parents\u2019 bungalow on Wednesday and is reportedly helping to arrange flights to get them home. A contributor to the Hua Hin internet forum said he had rushed to help the family during the attack. As revellers were leaving for the night, groups of Thai youths had gathered on the street looking for trouble.  He wrote: \u201cWithin 20-30 metres of leaving the bar the Thais were punching the 65-year-old lady in the face!! The elderly gentleman was down on the floor and their son was beaten very badly!!! At this point I caught up to the scene and pushed one of the youths away from the woman.\u201d He said he was left needing dental work for his own injuries. \u201cI got severely punched and kicked for my troubles, but felt the need to protect this frail lady.\u201d Hua Hin is one of Thailand\u2019s top five beach resorts and the country is increasingly popular with UK tourists, the TAT said, with 940,000 Britons visiting in 2015. During the Thai new year Songkran festival, also known as the water festival, major streets are taken over by a giant water fight for three days as people party continuously. The water is a symbol of cleansing and renewal.  The British embassy had begun a safety campaign to make sure tourists were aware of the dangers.

Today, the Thai billionaire\u2019s retailer, King Power, has a near-monopoly in the country\u2019s major airports. And the \u00a339m he paid for Leicester City in 2010 looks, in retrospect, to have been a steal. It is not clear if Vichai is a gambler but, even if he did not bet on his team, the businessman has won big. Leicester could now be worth more than \u00a3436m \u2013 11 times what he bought the club for according to the New York\u2011based research firm Private Company Financial Intelligence. Not unlike the Foxes, Vichai\u2019s rise was hard to predict but his growing wealth has mirrored Leicester\u2019s success. Forbes puts the 58-year-old \u2013 who is worth an estimated \u00a31.9bn \u2013 at fourth place in Thailand\u2019s rich list in part due to the recent influx of Chinese tourists to the country.           Leicester City: their Premier League title glory in numbers    He is seen to have balanced support from both sides of Thailand\u2019s political establishment, who despise each other, and, importantly, the powerful monarchy. His name \u201cSrivaddhanaprabha\u201d was bestowed to him in 2012 by King Bhumibol, the world\u2019s longest serving monarch, for his success and charity work. And the Thai king\u2019s portrait has also been raised at the King Power Stadium. Despite operating for nearly two decades, it was only in 2006 that King Power managed to secure the exclusive rights to duty-free stores in Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi Airport, now the 12th busiest in the world. The contract was blessed by the Thai telecoms tycoon turned prime minister and former Manchester City owner, Thaksin Shinawatra. \u201cVichai has made his money by being close to politicians, that\u2019s how you have to do it,\u201d said a member of the Bangkok business community, who asked for anonymity. \u201cBefore that he was an average businessman.\u201d Although Thaksin was later ousted in a coup, Vichai survived and his business is still going strong under the current junta run by Thaksin\u2019s foes in the military. King Power continues to open new stores around the country. The virtual monopoly is so strong that when a Korean competitor recently tried to enter the market, it was allowed to start building a duty-free store in Bangkok but was later blocked from opening pick-up counters at the capital\u2019s two major airports. Without the pick-up counters, customers cannot receive their tax-free purchases. \u201cThey almost finished the building but they can\u2019t operate,\u201d the source said.

Photograph: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images    Vichai\u2019s prestige among Thailand\u2019s elite has been bolstered by his promotion of the nation abroad. The billionaire, who owns a Gulfstream business jet, has flown Buddhist monks to England to bless the stadium and the players. His son and club vice-chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, said this year that Thai values had rubbed off on the club. \u201cIt\u2019s the Thai culture. We give our time to the staff, the players and to the manager. We try to manage it like a family, to listen to the problems of every single member of staff,\u201d he said. Vichai promised in 2014, following the club\u2019s promotion to the Premier League, that he would spend \u00a3180m to reach the top five within three years. Two years later and with only a third of that money spent, Leicester have won the league. Aiyawatt, also know as \u201cTop\u201d, has a more public presence. He has played polo on the same team as Prince Harry and makes appearances at the King Power headquarters in Bangkok, where weekly games are streamed live. \u201cWe have 600 people come to celebrate and enjoy to watch Leicester, the team that maybe seven years ago no one knew,\u201d said Aiyawatt at King Power headquarters after Leicester\u2019s 4-0 win against Swansea City.

He has given free beer and donuts to supporters at the stadium and ticket prices rose only marginally after their promotion two years ago. He also subsidised buses to away games, capping tickets at \u00a310. The Foxes Trust chairman, Ian Bason, has applauded Vichai saying it \u201cwould be hard to criticise him at all\u201d. \u201cOther than what the club has actually achieved, [the owners] have always listened to the fans,\u201d Bason, whose supporters group was a former part-owner of the club, said. \u201cVichai has always respected the heritage of the club.\u201d Yet King Power has made money in other ways, not least by its global brand status, exploiting the club\u2019s fame by placing video adverts in Thai airport terminals showing the striker Jamie Vardy running around a duty-free shop in full kit while picking up gifts.

Algeria: President told Mahrez: thank you for making us proud On the 25 April, Riyad Mahrez was named PFA Player of the Year, becoming the first African to win the coveted award. Two days later, the president of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, issued a statement on state television congratulating the winger on his exploits and subsequently thanking him for inspiring Algeria\u2019s children and making the country proud. Algerians have followed Leicester\u2019s historic run closely. Mahrez\u2019s mesmeric play has dominated the front pages of every daily paper. Scores of pedestrians have congregated in front of news stands after weekends for updates as the Foxes inched closer and closer to this most improbable feat.

Leonardo Ulloa was not a prolific scorer in Argentina and has flown under the radar in his homeland. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    The exploits of Diego Simeone driving Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to the latter stages of the Champions League or the role of Paulo Dybala in Juventus\u2019 fifth consecutive Scudetto are much more interesting to Argentinian media and the football fanatics in this country than Leonardo Ulloa\u2019s story as one of the heroes of Leicester. Maybe that is because he was never considered a star player in the few years he played in the Argentinian first division (31 matches for San Lorenzo, 12 for Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed and 14 for Olimpo de Bah\u00eda Blanca with a total of nine goals in 57 matches). The fact that he has never played for the national team is perhaps also part of the reason he is not being given huge media coverage, or the fact that he was born in a small town, General Roca, 1,000 kilometres from Buenos Aires. He is still an unknown quantity in his homeland. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave Argentina in the best way, pretty much by the back door, to pick up the fight [to succeed] in Spain\u2019s second division\u201d he told La Naci\u00f3n, last month. In the country of Lionel Messi, a lot of Barcelona shirts are being sold on the streets but no Leicester ones, and it is doubtful whether the country\u2019s president Mauricio Macri \u2013 who was chairman of Boca Juniors in the 1990s \u2013 is even aware that an Argentinian striker has played a part in Leicester winning the Premier League. Of course, websites are reporting his goals and Leicester\u2019s wins but no one is suggesting that he should join Lionel Messi and Sergio Ag\u00fcero in La Albiceleste; although the recent, touching letter of Claudio Ranieri to his players caught the media spotlight over here more than Ulloa\u2019s achievements when coming off the bench. Pablo Vignone, La Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires Austria: Pride at title charge that started in town of Bad Radkersburg     Christian Fuchs is a vital player for both Leicester and the Austrian national team, giving rise to great pride. Photograph: Christian Bruna/Corbis    Austrians are a humble people when it comes to football. Not because we are humble by nature, but because football is not a sport we generally excel in. Here we still talk about of the 3-2 \u2018Miracle-of-Cordoba\u2019 victory over Germany. That was in 1978. Our most talented players do not stay in the domestic league for too long so we learn to appreciate the small things, such as David Alaba doing well for Bayern Munich. But now we have a new person to cheer and follow in Christian Fuchs, the Austria captain and Leicester City full-back. In fact, we can claim some credit for his team\u2019s success this season, as Sportnet.at pointed out: \u201cLeicester City is the big sensation of the football world. The foundation for its success was laid in Austria \u2026 as the season started for them in the South Styrian town of Bad Radkersburg. The team visited the small settlement, population 3,115 from 12-17 June as a part of their pre-season preparations. It was the third time running they had gone there and no wonder that Hotel Park manager Harald Eberhaut is happy for the team. \u201cThis is a sensation,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the beginning I thought, that was a good start, but that it would be over soon. However, they\u2019ve just carried on.\u201d Few would have thought, at the start of the season, that the 30-year old Fuchs from the small town of Neunkirchen near Vienna would win the Premier League title in his first year playing for the club. Naturally, Austrians started supporting Fuchs and his team as they headed for a historic title. It is a miracle almost as big as Austria winning Euro 2016, and we all know that is not going to happen. Austrians may be humble but they are most certainly proud of Christian Fuchs and the \u201cMiracle of Leicester\u201d. David M\u00fcller, Vienna Denmark: Christmas party in Copenhagen made team even more popular      Kasper Schmeichel dressed as Mr Incredible and stood behind the Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles at Leicester\u2019s Christmas party in Copenhagen. Photograph: Social Media    It took a mix of a fairytale Premier League title and a Danish goalkeeper as an integral part of it finally to knock Christian Eriksen off the throne as Denmark\u2019s best player. Well, at least in one of the two main awards. For three years Eriksen has been sitting comfortably on the Danish football throne but in 2015 Kasper Schmeichel won one of the two awards ahead of his international team-mate at Spurs. It showed that Schmeichel\u2019s popularity is growing \u2013 and at a fast rate. There are other signs too. Leicester were recently featured on the most popular news show, 21 Sondag, on Danmarks Radio, the country\u2019s public service broadcaster. 21 Sondag normally focuses on investigative journalism and the big political stories but felt that Leicester\u2019s and Schmeichel\u2019s extraordinary adventure was a topic worth covering. Furthermore the newspaper B.T. has had a reporter in Leicester for two weeks now just writing about the city\u2019s club and pretty much every Dane \u2013 apart from Tottenham Hotspur fans \u2013 have been cheering Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team on. The team\u2019s popularity was also helped by their decision to fly to Copenhagen for their Christmas party in December, with some of the players wearing Ninja Turtles costumes. Troels Henriksen, Jyllands-Posten, Copenhagen France: \u2018It is shocking that no one had noticed Kant\u00e9 before\u2019     N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 was selected for his France debut in March and promptly opened the scoring against Russia. Photograph: Francois Mori/AP    Ligue 1 does not enjoy the same profile in France as the top clubs in the Premier League have in England, so there was something of an unknown quality to N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 to many casual football supporters in the country when he moved to Leicester from Caen at the beginning of the season. It was not until the Foxes had been well established in first place and the Paris-born midfielder had been called for the national squad that people really started to take notice of him. With greater coverage has followed greater notoriety, although his explosion on the field still seems to be regarded with curiosity as opposed to incredible fanfare. Apart from his former sporting director at Caen, Xavier Gravelaine, who told Ouest France last month: \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of Leicester matches and N\u2019Golo is the same there as he was with Caen. The difference is that he\u2019s playing in the Premier League. It\u2019s shocking that no one\u2019s noticed it before. His explosion doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d On the other hand, Riyad Mahrez\u2019s influence in Leicester\u2019s title success has been widely celebrated by France\u2019s large Algerian community, with his name and number apparently ubiquitous in certain areas. Of course, the coverage of Leicester has been far in excess of what they would have enjoyed previously. Although the report of their win over Swansea last weekend was squirrelled away at page 20 of L\u2019Equipe, they enjoyed more column inches than Juventus winning the Serie A title. Robin Bairner, Paris Germany: Hometown celebrates success of loveable oddity Huth     Germans remember the days when Robert Huth featured in the national team under J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann. Photograph: Lars Baron/Bongarts/Getty Images    In Germany, Berlin-born defender Robert Huth has long been seen as a loveable oddity: a born Berliner who never played in the domestic league; a player who looked like he belonged to another era even though he took part in modern German football\u2019s sea-change moment; a cult hero, but an imported one. While Huth is fondly remembered by German fans for his role in the \u201csummer fairy tale\u201d of the 2006 World Cup, he was soon discarded in favour of more mobile players like Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng, playing his last game for his country in an insignificant 7-2 friendly against the United Arab Emirates in 2009. A recent in-depth interview in 11 Freunde magazine noted that Huth, who has spent almost half of his life in the UK, appeared to have become \u201cestranged\u201d from his homeland. Leicester\u2019s rise has undoubtedly brought Huth back to the forefront of the national memory, though not quite into the national squad. After Boateng got injured earlier in the year, 80% of users of Sport1 website called for the 31-year-old to be brought back for the Euros. But coach J\u00f6gi L\u00f6w moved swiftly to quash speculation, explaining that he prefers his teams to play further up the pitch than Leicester. Philip Oltermann, Berlin Ghana: Schlupp and Amartey spark curiosity     Jeffrey Schlupp\u2019s impact for Leicester has not gone unnoticed in the country he represents. Photograph: Richard Calver/Rex/Shutterstock    The Premier League\u2019s fans in Ghana are decidedly of the Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and the two Manchester clubs variety; a smattering of Spurs fans and then ... nothing. When a Ghanaian signs for an English club, the team may get support based on the player\u2019s status \u2013 think Asamoah Gyan getting Sunderland a few, while Michael Essien copped Chelsea a large following. If the player is not that huge, say Jordan Ayew, then no can do. It is just pride that Daniel Amartey, Jeffrey Schlupp and 20-year old Joe Dodoo are from these parts, as former Ghana captain Stephen Appiah told Citi FM: \u201cI believe Schlupp is one of the key players for the team. I\u2019m saying that because he got injured, went out for some months and came back with three games to the end of the season and the coach started him. So that shows you how important he is to the team. For Amartey, I am so happy for him because you join a team like Leicester a couple of months ago and you are going to win a trophy.\u201d Still, Leicester shirts are very, very rare in Ghana. Premier League is so big here that people will watch a lot of it and even take a sneak at Everton v WBA. But sure, there is curiosity about Leicester, especially among fans of Arsenal, and Man City because of their title aspirations. Man Utd and Liverpool fans would watch Foxes games just to cheer them on at the expense of the aforementioned two. Gary Al-Smith, Super Sport TV, Accra Italy: Love for gentleman Ranieri comes to the fore     Claudio Ranieri is well remembered for his time in charge of Roma, in his home city. Photograph: Tony Gentile/Reuters    Thank you, Leicester. This story has been the stuff of dreams for Italy, the country of Claudio Ranieri. The English city has been the place where we were able to see a new side to Ranieri: he has always been a gentleman, but he has never been so happy and enthusiastic about his job. Ranieri was way too bothered because the world of football in Italy has always been hard to please. Everyone was touched by seeing him so human at Leicester. Here in Italy, Leicester has attracted the same interest as the Italian teams, both in newsrooms and among fans. The team has been always on the front page of the major newspapers, always on every fan\u2019s social media feeds. If you want to know some curious examples, in a high school in Bergamo all of the male students showed up in class with the football shirts of the players of Leicester, from Vardy to Mahrez. They had to buy them at crazy prices on eBay months before, since finding Leicester jerseys here in Italy at the moment is really impossible. As the capital is his birth-place, Roma\u2019s fan club dusted off some old scarves dedicated to Claudio Ranieri, who once coached the side, to support him. Everyone is cheering him in Rome, especially in Testaccio, the district where Ranieri was born and raised. He has left amazing memories in his home town. Walter Veltroni, a former mayor of Rome, interviewed Ranieri as a journalist for Corriere dello Sport and said: \u201cClaudio is fantastic!\u201d There are a lot of bars in which fans gather to cheer on Leicester. A very special fan club for the Foxes was born in Lamezia Terme; meetings were organised on Facebook and took place in city squares from Milan to Florence to cheer their title win. A popular Italian Facebook group (Calciatori Brutti, which means \u201cUgly football players\u201d) decided to organise a road trip from Italy to Leicester by car to celebrate. At the last count, 500 participants were ready to go. All this is for love of the fable called Leicester and for a great coach like Claudio Ranieri. Thank you, Leicester.  Fabrizio Romano, Sky Sports, Milan Jamaica: Morgan shirts still not in demand \u2013 but that could yet change     Wes Morgan tackles Nelson Haedo Valdez during Jamaica\u2019s match against Paraguay at last year\u2019s Copa America. Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images    Wes Morgan may be born in Nottingham but he has 25 caps for Jamaica after qualifying through his grandparents. The reaction to Leicester\u2019s success in Jamaica is what we assume it has been anywhere in the world: bemused amusement. While the Premier League dominates the local version for attention, any Leicester \u201cwagonists\u201d are waiting carefully for the title; or perhaps the second title when it comes. For now Leicester are everyone\u2019s second team. Speaking to 35-year-old Richard Currie from Kingston, who sells replica football shirts, his business is still to see an increasing demand for a player who has already captained the Reggae Boyz thanks to his defensive leadership for the Foxes. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen an order to date or anyone wearing one,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then Morgan isn\u2019t someone who grew up in Jamaica so perhaps people can\u2019t identify with him like local players; but how he defends and his fighting spirit is what people here identify with him and rate him for. Now he has won the title you\u2019ll see them come out. We Jamaicans are a proud people and we like to show it!\u201d The Guardian did find one newly minted Leicester fan, 20-year-old Hakeem Bryan from Spanish Town, who says he has already ordered his replica shirt: \u201cOf course I\u2019m proud of a fellow Jamaican doing wonderful things in [an] area of sport. It\u2019s special because of the journey and the struggle.\u201d But the name on the back of that shirt? Riyad Mahrez, rather than the uncompromising Jamaican centre-back. In fact, it is rare to see any Raheem Sterling shirts, despite the fact that he was born in Kingston. But that is partly down to there not being many Manchester City supporters around, though that could change with Pep Guardiola arriving. Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal are still the big teams here with Chelsea making some inroads in recent years. Leicester still have a long way to go. Ross Sheil, Kingston Japan: The Foxes brought into the wider public conscience     Japanese supporters pay tribute to Shinji Okazaki as he wins his 100th cap for their national team in March. Photograph: Yutaka/Corbis    Takarazuka, a short drive from Kobe in western Japan, is famous nationwide for its all-female theatre. Now, one of the city\u2019s celebrated sons has played a vital supporting role in perhaps the most astounding tale ever played out on the English football stage. The arrival of Shinji Okazaki this season promoted Leicester City to top billing when J Sports selected which five of the 10 Premier League matches it would broadcast each matchday. At first, this was merely provisional; interest would surely soon wane as it had for Maya Yoshida at Southampton and fans of the five biggest clubs could be guaranteed their customary live coverage again. But ultimately, Japanese viewers have stayed with the Foxes\u2019 story right from opening day through to its glorious conclusion. Leicester\u2019s romantic win prompted a host of articles across the specialist sporting press. In a country that has only had professional football for 23 years, and where it is not particularly uncommon for newly promoted sides to challenge for J. League honours, Japan\u2019s finest football writers have grappled for the right words to explain just how improbable this achievement has been. The mainstream media tends to focus on the more obvious star quality of Keisuke Honda and AC Milan, but camera-friendly scenes like the win at Manchester City and Okazaki\u2019s overhead kick against Newcastle United have gradually brought the Foxes into the wider public conscience. Expect plenty more Leicester features on terrestrial television now the trophy has been claimed.

There is so much to see, hear and view - music, film, drama, dance, poetry, talks and walks. Plus a circus... and not forgetting the Lady Boys of Bangkok. We are the epitome of a trans-friendly city. It all kicks off today (6 May) under the aegis of guest director Laurie Anderson - she of O Superman fame - in what promises to be a month of undiluted fun.  A great deal of that fun is generated by the fringe festival, which has grown over the years to become a substantial event of its own: the brochure runs to 138 pages.  It is worth reading just for the descriptions of the acts. Some lure audiences through the apparent absurdity of their pitch. Others do a neat line in self-deprecation. I\u2019m unworthy, they suggest, but come and see me anyway. You can thrill to the (supposedly) \u201cmuch anticipated solo show from knife-wielding tortured French chanteuse La Poule Plomb\u00e9e\u201d who evidently doesn\u2019t do a double act with another dangerous performer, Daggers Mackenzie, \u201cthe gal who defies death with every toss of the blade.\u201d There is plenty of burlesque, scores of magic shows and an endless supply of revues and cabarets. And then there is the comedy: hours and hours of sketch shows and stand-ups in venues across the city.  Here\u2019s a selection to whet your appetite (or send you off for a drink elsewhere)... Chris Betts is \u201csceptical, ludicrous and hilarious\u201d while Adam Vincent judges the world \u201cwith wanton cynicism.\u201d Daphna Baram is billed as \u201cthe middle-Eastern Mary Poppins\u201d and Cheekykita will treat audiences to \u201ca crab dance, silly songs, fish stories and a bit of horror.\u201d Ian Lane\u2019s show \u201ccontains 3 types of sneezes; 3 impressions of screensavers; 4 impressions of toilet seats; 6 rejected fire exit sign designs...\u201d Toilets turn up in several acts. Matthew Giffen, a Colombian/Irish/Englishman will urge people to try a Japanese toilet. These stand-ups seem tame beside Sara Mason\u2019s offering, a show called \u201cBurt Lancaster pierced my hymen (when I was 11).\u201d  Or perhaps you would prefer an evening with Adrienne Truscott who appears - so it says - \u201cdressed only from the waist up and ankles down\u201d in order to undo \u201cthe rules and rhetoric about rape and comedy.\u201d Then there is Darius Davies who decided to be a wrestler and tells a story of \u201cteenage naivety, steroid use and broken bones.\u201d I think I\u2019ll skip the stand-up in favour of an evening listening to the wonderful Gavin Henderson with his (allegedly) hilarious stories of the conductors he has worked with, such as Klemperer, Stokowski, Rattle, Barbirolli and Sargent. The blurb writers for the theatrical shows clearly feel the best way to attract festival-goers is to hint at the sinister or the sexy. You can choose to listen to four of Brighton\u2019s most notorious killers telling you their true-life stories; three friends attending the funeral of another friend; the story of \u201cleper priest\u201d Father Damien; or a drama about Crazy Horse, the Sioux chief who defied the US military. The sex? Too much to mention. Better perhaps to listen to the chaste \u201cconfessions of a red-headed coffeeshop girl\u201d (Rebecca Perry) or how about \u201ca kaleidoscope of mundanity and the surreal\u201d by the Upstairs Brigade\u201d?

The analogy is deliberate, since Guildford\u2019s players have a backbone of French grandmasters and are a class superior to their domestic opponents. Yet they are well behind the major contenders in the European Chess Cup \u2013 a fact tacitly acknowledged because the Surrey club never enters a competition dominated by elite squads from Russia and Azerbaijan backed by oil money. Guildford were well ahead on game points from their principal rivals, the Midlanders from Cheddleton, when the three May Day weekend rounds at Birmingham started. However, they kicked off receiving a nasty shock in Guildford v Barbican, when the former Irish champion Sam Collins crushed Nigel Short in 18 moves. There was extra humiliation for the one-time world title challenger because the loss of rating points cost him his place among the world\u2019s top 100 GMs, where he had been the oldest player at 50. The setback will not affect Short\u2019s status as a popular globetrotting UK chess ambassador, who has won tournaments in 29 different countries. Last year he played in Bangkok and Kolkata, earlier in 2016 he was in New Zealand, while later this month he will compete in Iceland. Guildford recovered strongly to defeat Barbican 6-2 and went further ahead when Cheddleton lost to White Rose, for whom James Adair had the better of a draw with the England No2, David Howell. This was a highly significant result for the talented 23-year-old Yorkshireman, since it gave him his third and final GM result. He still needs a 2500 Fide rating to qualify for the prestige title but this should follow quickly given his current 2474 mark and good form. The Cambridge chemical engineering student Yang-Fan Zhou achieved his second GM norm. League pairings are scheduled so that the most likely winners are paired in the final round. Guildford were almost sure of the title anyway but still unleashed a secret weapon in the head-to-head against Cheddleton \u2013 the world No5, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, whose sharp Ruy Lopez against Howell ended with a bishop sacrifice for a draw by perpetual check. Heading the final league table were Guildford 14, Cheddleton 10, Barbican 10, Wood Green 7. Overall the 4NCL continues to forge ahead under the wise leadership of Mike Truran, who also doubles as the English Chess Federation chief executive. More than 80 clubs now take part and the new Northern section is growing\u00a0rapidly. A mysterious feature of Nigel Short\u2019s rapid defeat was why he varied from 9...c5, which brought him an endgame win earlier this year at Tradewise Gibraltar. This time he preferred a slow baroque strategy which Collins treated roughly by advancing his h pawn and setting up a winning tactic.

To celebrate, his parents took him and his younger brother Alex out for lunch at an Indian restaurant not far from their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Both brothers were born in Canada, but for the past decade the family had lived in the US. The boys\u2019 father, Donald Heathfield, had studied in Paris and at Harvard, and now had a senior role at a consultancy firm based in Boston. Their mother, Tracey Foley, had spent many years focused on raising her children, before taking a job as a real estate agent. To those who knew them, they seemed a very ordinary American family, albeit with Canadian roots and a penchant for foreign travel. Both brothers were fascinated by Asia, a favoured holiday destination, and the parents encouraged their sons to be inquisitive about the world: Alex was only 16, but had just returned from a six-month student exchange in Singapore. After a buffet lunch, the four returned home and opened a bottle of champagne to toast Tim reaching his third decade. The brothers were tired; they had thrown a small house party the night before to mark Alex\u2019s return from Singapore, and Tim planned to go out later. After the champagne, he went upstairs to message his friends about the evening\u2019s plans. There came a knock at the door, and Tim\u2019s mother called up that his friends must have come early, as a surprise. At the door, she was met by a different kind of surprise altogether: a team of armed, black-clad men holding a battering ram. They streamed into the house, screaming, \u201cFBI!\u201d Another team entered from the back; men dashed up the stairs, shouting at everyone to put their hands in the air. Upstairs, Tim had heard the knock and the shouting, and his first thought was that the police could be after him for underage drinking: nobody at the party the night before had been 21, and Boston police took alcohol regulations seriously. When he emerged on to the landing, it became clear the FBI was here for something far more serious. The two brothers watched, stunned, as their parents were put in handcuffs and driven away in separate black cars. Tim and Alex were left behind with a number of agents, who said they needed to begin a 24-hour forensic search of the home; they had prepared a hotel room for the brothers. One of the men told them their parents had been arrested on suspicion of being \u201cunlawful agents of a foreign government\u201d.    Not only were their parents indeed Russian spies, they were Russians. They were not Donald Heathfield and Tracey Foley    Alex presumed there had been some mistake \u2013 the wrong house, or a mix-up over his father\u2019s consultancy work. Donald travelled frequently for his job; perhaps this had been confused with espionage. At worst, perhaps he had been tricked by an international client. Even when the brothers heard on the radio a few days later that 10 Russian spies had been rounded up across the US, in an FBI operation dubbed Ghost Stories, they remained sure there had been a terrible mistake. But the FBI had not made a mistake, and the truth was so outlandish, it defied comprehension. Not only were their parents indeed Russian spies, they were Russians. The man and woman the boys knew as Mom and Dad really were their parents, but their names were not Donald Heathfield and Tracey Foley. Those were Canadians who had died long ago, as children; their identities had been stolen and adopted by the boys\u2019 parents. Their real names were Andrei Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova. They were both born in the Soviet Union, had undergone training in the KGB and been dispatched abroad as part of a Soviet programme of deep-cover secret agents, known in Russia as the \u201cillegals\u201d. After a slow-burning career building up an ordinary North American background, the pair were now active agents for the SVR, the foreign spy agency of modern Russia and a successor to the KGB. They, along with eight other agents, had been betrayed by a Russian spy who had defected to the Americans. The FBI indictment detailing their misdeeds was a catalogue of espionage cliches: dead drops, brush-pasts, coded messages and plastic bags stuffed with crisp dollar bills. The footage of a plane carrying the 10 touching down at Vienna airport, to be swapped for four Russians who had been held in Russian prisons on charges of spying for the west, brought back memories of the cold war. The media had a field day with the Bond-girl looks of 28-year-old Anna Chapman, one of two Russians arrested not to have pretended to be of western origin; she worked as an international estate agent in Manhattan. Russia didn\u2019t know whether to be embarrassed or emboldened: its agents had been busted, but what other country would think of mounting such a complex, slow-drip espionage operation in the first place? For Alex and Tim, the geopolitics behind the spy swap was the least of their worries. The pair had grown up as ordinary Canadians, and now discovered they were the children of Russian spies. Ahead of them was a long flight to Moscow, and an even longer emotional and psychological journey. *** Nearly six years since the FBI raid, I meet Alex in a cafe near the Kiev railway station in Moscow. He is now officially Alexander Vavilov; his brother is Timofei Vavilov, though many of their friends still use their old surname, Foley. Alex is 21, his still-boyish looks offset by a serious manner and businesslike clothes: black V-neck over a crisp white shirt. A gentle North American lilt and the careful aspiration of final consonants give him the unplaceable accent of those who have been schooled internationally \u2013 in Paris, Singapore and the US. These days, he speaks enough Russian to order lunch, but is by no means fluent. He is studying in a European city and is here to visit his parents; Tim works in finance in Asia. (In the interests of privacy, both brothers have asked me not to reveal details about their working lives.)     \u2018Donald Heathfield\u2019 with Alex and Tim in 1999. Photograph: courtesy Tim and Alex Foley    Since 2010, they have made a conscious decision to avoid the media. They have agreed to talk to me now, Alex explains, because they are fighting a legal battle to win back their Canadian citizenship, stripped from them six years ago. They believe it is unfair and illegal that they are expected to answer for the sins of their parents, and have decided to tell their story for the first time. As we eat khachapuri, a Georgian bread stuffed with gooey cheese, Alex recalls the days after the raid. He and Tim stayed up until the early hours in the hotel room the FBI had provided, trying to understand what was going on. When they went home the next day, they found every piece of electronic equipment, every photograph and document had been taken. The FBI\u2019s search and seizure warrant lists 191 items removed from the Foley/Heathfield residence, including computers, mobile phones, photographs and medicines. They even took Tim and Alex\u2019s PlayStation. News crews held a vigil outside; the brothers sat inside with the blinds drawn, their phones and computers confiscated. Early next morning Tim snuck out to get online at the public library and try to find a lawyer for his parents. All the family bank accounts had been frozen, leaving the boys with just the money they had in their pockets and whatever they could borrow from friends. FBI agents drove them to an initial court hearing in Boston, where their parents were informed of the charges. There was a brief meeting with their mother inside jail. Alex tells me he did not ask her what she and his father were accused of. This seems surprising, I say: surely he must have been dying to ask?    They were promising, young, smart people. They were asked if they wanted to help their country and they said yes    \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I knew that if I was going to testify in court, the less I knew, the better. I didn\u2019t want to cloud my opinion with anything. I didn\u2019t want to ask questions, because it was obvious people were listening,\u201d he says. A boisterous group of women are celebrating a birthday at the next table, and he raises his voice. \u201cI refused to let myself be convinced they were actually guilty of anything, because I realised the case would probably draw on for a long time. They were facing life in prison, and if I was to testify, I would have to completely believe they were innocent.\u201d The family had been planning a month-long summer break in Paris, Moscow and Turkey; their mother told them to escape the media circus and fly to Russia. After a stopover in Paris, Alex and Tim boarded a plane to Moscow, unsure of what to expect on arrival. They had never been to Russia before. \u201cIt was a really terrifying moment,\u201d Alex recalls. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting on the plane, you have a few hours to kill and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming. You just sit there and think and think.\u201d As the brothers disembarked, they were met at the plane door by a group of people who introduced themselves in English as colleagues of their parents. They told the brothers to trust them, and led them outside the terminal to a van. \u201cThey showed us photos of our parents in their 20s in uniform, photos of them with medals. That was the moment when I thought, \u2018OK, this is real.\u2019 Until that moment, I\u2019d refused to believe any of it was true,\u201d Alex says. He and Tim were taken to an apartment and told to make themselves at home; one of their minders spent the next few days showing them around Moscow; they took them to museums, even the ballet. An uncle and a cousin the brothers had no idea existed paid a visit; a grandmother also dropped by, but she spoke no English and the boys not a word of Russian. It would be a few days before their parents would arrive, having admitted at a court hearing in New York on 8 July that they were Russian nationals. An exchange was already in the offing, and they arrived in Moscow, via Vienna, on 9 July, still wearing the orange prison jumpsuits they had been given in America. My face must give away some of my amazement: how does a 16-year-old process such an extraordinary turn of events? Alex smirks at me wryly. \u201cTypical high school identity crisis, right?\u201d     \u2018Tracey Foley\u2019 with Tim at Toronto Zoo in 1991. Photograph: courtesy Tim and Alex Foley    Alex and Tim\u2019s father was born Andrei Olegovich Bezrukov, in Krasnoyarsk region, in the heart of Siberia. Since his return to Moscow in 2010, he has given just a handful of interviews to Russian media outlets, mainly concerning the more recent work he has done as a geopolitical analyst. Details of his past, or that of his wife, Elena Vavilova, are scarce. Alex tells me what he knows about his parents\u2019 recruitment, based on the little they have told him: \u201cThey got recruited into it together, as a couple. They were promising, young, smart people, they were asked if they wanted to help their country and they said yes. They went through years of training and preparing.\u201d None of the 10 deportees has spoken publicly about their mission in the US, or their training by the SVR or KGB. Department S, which runs the illegals programme they were on, was the most secretive part of the KGB. One former \u201cillegal\u201d tells me his training in the late 1970s included two years in Moscow with daily English lessons, taught by an American woman who had defected. He was also trained in other basics such as communicating in code and surveillance. All the training was done on a one-to-one basis: he never met other agents. The programme was the only one of its kind in international espionage. (Many assumed it had been stopped, until the 2010 FBI swoop.) Many intelligence agencies use agents operating without diplomatic cover; some have recruited second-generation immigrants already living abroad, but the Russians have been the only ones to train agents to pretend to be foreigners. Canada was a common place for the illegals to go, to build up their \u201clegend\u201d of being an ordinary western citizen before being deployed to target countries, often the US or Britain. During Soviet times, the illegals had two main functions: to aid in communications between embassy KGB officers and their US sources (an illegal would be less likely to be put under surveillance than a diplomat); and to be sleeper cells for a potential \u201cspecial period\u201d \u2013 a war between the US and the Soviet Union. The illegals could then spring into action. The KGB sent the couple to Canada in the 80s. In June 1990, Vavilova, under the assumed identity of Tracey Foley, gave birth to Tim at the Women\u2019s College hospital in Toronto. His first memories are of attending a French-language school in the city and visiting the warehouse of his dad\u2019s company, Diapers Direct, a nappy delivery service. It was hardly James Bond, but the work of an agent has always been more tortoise than hare \u2013 years spent painstakingly building up the legend. Andrei Bezrukov already had a degree from a Soviet university, but \u201cDonald Heathfield\u201d had no educational records. Between 1992 and 1995, he studied for a bachelor\u2019s degree in international economics at York University in Toronto. In 1994, Alex was born; a year later the family moved to Paris. We don\u2019t know whether this was on the orders of the SVR, but it seems a safe assumption. Donald studied for an MBA at the \u00c9cole des Ponts and the family lived frugally in a small flat not far from the Eiffel Tower; both brothers shared the only bedroom while the parents slept on the sofa. As Bezrukov and Vavilova built up their story, the country that had recruited and trained them ceased to exist. The ideology of communism had failed; the fearsome spy agency that had dispatched agents across the globe was discredited and renamed. Under Boris Yeltsin, post-Soviet Russia seemed on the verge of becoming a failed state. But in 1999, as the family planned a move from France to the US, a new man entered the Kremlin who himself had a KGB background. In the subsequent years, he would work to make the KGB\u2019s successors important and respected again. With the legend of a hardworking, well-educated Canadian perfected over the years, Heathfield got into Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government towards the end of that year, and was ready to deploy as an agent of the SVR. He would be spying not for the Soviet system that had trained him, but for the new Russia of Vladimir Putin.    I never had anything close to a suspicion. It seemed all my friends' parents led much more exciting lives  Alex     Heathfield and Foley sent their sons to a bilingual French-English school in Boston, so they could maintain their French and stay in touch with European culture. They could not teach their children about Russia; perhaps the emphasis on French was a way of ensuring their children were not \u201cordinary\u201d Americans without ringing alarm bells. At home, the family spoke a mixture of English and French. (An online video of Bezrukov, appearing in his post-deportation role as a political analyst, shows him speaking smooth North American with the faintest of twangs.) When he completed his postgraduate degree at Harvard, Heathfield got a job working for Global Partners, a business development consultancy. I speak to Tim on a Sunday afternoon, talking to me on Skype from his kitchen. He has the same facial features and careful parting as his younger brother, but his hair is blond rather than dark. Looking back on his youth, he tells me his father worked hard, making frequent business trips. He encouraged his sons to read and educate themselves about the world, and \u201cwas like a best friend to us\u201d. Foley, Tim says, was a \u201csoccer mom\u201d, picking her sons up from school and taking them to sports practice. When the boys were in their teens, she started work as a real estate agent. In 2008, Tim got a place at George Washington University, in DC, to study international relations. He focused on Asia, taking Mandarin lessons and spending a semester in Beijing. The same year, the family became naturalised Americans, with US passports in addition to their Canadian nationality. The brothers would never live in Canada again; Alex had been one when they left Toronto and Tim only five \u2013 but both felt Canadian. The family returned often to ski, and when the boys went on school trips from Boston to Montreal, they took pride in showing the other students around their \u201chome\u201d country. Alex made a big fuss about his Canadian background, because \u201cat high school you always want to go counterculture\u201d. Tim describes their childhood as \u201cabsolutely normal\u201d: the family was close and spent time together at weekends; his parents had many friends. He has no recollection of them discussing Russia or the Soviet Union; they never ate Russian food, and the closest Tim says he came to a Russian was a polite boy from Kazakhstan at school. Their parents did not discuss their childhood much, but this was how they had always been and the boys had little reason to question it. \u201cI never had anything close to a suspicion regarding my parents,\u201d Alex says. In fact, he often felt disappointed by how boring and mundane they were: \u201cIt seemed all my friends\u2019 parents led much more exciting and successful lives.\u201d Little did he know. Bezrukov and Vavilova had been put under FBI surveillance soon after they moved to the US, probably because of a mole in the Russian agency. Excerpts from their 2010 indictment suggest the couple lived with a level of intrigue most people would assume exists only within the pages of a spy novel. One paragraph recounts an intercepted communication from Moscow Centre (SVR headquarters), explaining how Vavilova should plan for a trip back to her motherland. She was to fly to Paris and take the train to Vienna, where she would pick up a fake British passport. \u201cVery important: 1. Sign your passport on page 32. Train yourself to be able to reproduce your signature when necessary\u2026 In the passport you\u2019ll get a memo with recommendation. Pls, destroy the memo after reading. Be well.\u201d Their father, meanwhile, was using his work as a consultant to penetrate US political and business circles. It is not clear whether he managed to access classified material, but FBI intercepts reported a number of contacts with former and current American officials. In the few public remarks Bezrukov has made about his job, he makes it sound more like that of a thinktank analyst than a super-spy. \u201cIntelligence work is not about risky escapades,\u201d he told Expert magazine in 2012. \u201cIf you behave like Bond, you\u2019ll last half a day, maybe a day. Even if there was an imaginary safe where all the secrets are kept, by tomorrow half of them will be outdated and useless. The best kind of intelligence is to understand what your opponent will think tomorrow, not find out what he thought yesterday.\u201d    The family home had been bugged for years. The FBI knew the couple's real identities, even if their own children did not    Bezrukov and Vavilova communicated with the SVR using digital steganography: they would post images online that contained messages hidden in the pixels, encoded using an algorithm written for them by the SVR. A message the FBI believes was sent in 2007 to Bezrukov by SVR headquarters was decoded as follows: \u201cGot your note and signal. No info in our files about E.F., BT, DK, RR. Agree with your proposal to use \u2018Farmer\u2019 to start building network of students in DC. Your relationship with \u2018Parrot\u2019 looks very promising as a valid source of info from US power circles. To start working on him professionally we need all available details on his background, current position, habits, contacts, opportunities, etc.\u201d Way back in 2001, nearly a decade before her arrest, the FBI had searched a safe-deposit box belonging to Tracey Foley. There they found photographs of her in her 20s, one of which bore the Cyrillic imprint of the Soviet company that had printed it. The family home had been bugged, possibly for many years. The FBI knew the couple\u2019s real identities, even if their own children did not, but the Americans preferred to keep an eye on the Russian spy ring, rather than make a move. Why the FBI finally acted is unclear. One suggestion is that Alexander Poteyev, the SVR officer believed to have betrayed the group, felt his cover was blown. He reportedly fled Russia in the days before the arrests; in 2011, a Russian court sentenced him to 25 years in prison for treason in absentia. Another possibility is that one of the group was getting close to sensitive information. Whatever the reason, in June 2010 the FBI decided to wrap up Operation Ghost Stories and bust the Russian spy ring.     The house raided by the FBI in June 2010. Photograph: Russell Contreras/AP    I speak to Tim and Alex many times, in person, over Skype and email. They are not uncomfortable talking about their experiences, but neither do they enjoy it much. Initially, they want to speak only about their court case in Canada; but gradually they open up, answering all my questions about their extraordinary family life. I have to admit there are some details that bother me. Did they really never suspect a thing? In 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported that unnamed US officials claimed an FBI bug placed at the family\u2019s Boston home had picked up the parents revealing their true identities to Tim long before the arrest. Furthermore, the officials said, his parents had told Tim they wanted to groom him as a Russian spy. A second-generation spy would be a much more impressive asset than first-generation illegals, who had built up personas that were solid but not impregnable to background checks. Tim, according to the unnamed officials, agreed he would travel to Moscow for SVR training and even \u201csaluted Mother Russia\u201d. Tim strenuously denies the story, insisting it was a total fabrication. \u201cWhy would a kid who grew up his whole life believing himself to be Canadian, decide to risk life in prison for a country he had never been to nor had any ties to? Furthermore, why would my parents take a similar risk in telling their teenage son their identities?\u201d The claim that he saluted Mother Russia is \u201cjust as ridiculous as it sounds\u201d, Tim says. He would be happy to answer the allegations in court, but it is impossible to argue with anonymous sources. When contacted by the Guardian, the FBI declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal article. There was another thing that bothered me: was it really just coincidence that the family had planned to travel to Russia that summer, and that the brothers therefore had Russian visas? Yes, Alex says. \u201cIt was very much my idea to go to Russia. We had this world map at home and when you looked at the pins on it, you could see we\u2019d been almost everywhere but Russia, so I was very curious and I was pushing for it. It was just going to be one part of our summer trip.\u201d In hindsight, surely, that summer trip to Paris, Turkey and Moscow must have looked rather different. When the family were reunited in Moscow in July 2010, did the boys ask their parents what the plan had been? Had they intended to reveal everything? Or were they really going to spend a week in Moscow pretending not to understand a word spoken around them? \u201cI actually think that was the plan,\u201d Alex says. \u201cThat we would travel to Russia, and maybe they might go and meet people without us. But I don\u2019t think there was a plan to tell us anything.\u201d Tim agrees. If their parents had revealed the truth, it would have made Tim and Alex a huge liability; \u201cas professionals\u201d, he says, it\u2019s unlikely they would have taken the risk. They doubt their parents ever planned to tell them about their real identities. \u201cHonestly,\u201d Tim says, \u201cI really don\u2019t think so. It sounds strange, but yeah.\u201d Both brothers tell me they remember, as young children, seeing their grandparents. Where? On vacation, Alex says, \u201csomewhere in Europe\u201d; he can\u2019t remember where, exactly. Asked if he was sure the people he met were his real grandparents, he says, \u201cI think so.\u201d Were they speaking Russian? \u201cI was really young, I have no idea,\u201d he says firmly. I raise the question with Tim, who would have been older. He remembers seeing his grandparents every few years until he was around 11, when they disappeared from his life. \u201cObviously, now when I think back on it, I kind of understand how it worked. If I had seen them when I was older, I would have realised that they don\u2019t speak English \u2013 they don\u2019t seem very Canadian.\u201d At Christmas, the boys would receive gifts marked \u201cfrom grandparents\u201d. Their parents told them they lived in Alberta, far from Toronto, which was why they never saw them. Occasionally, new photographs would arrive of the grandparents against a snowy backdrop; it helped that the climates of Alberta and Siberia are not so different.     An FBI surveillance photo of Tracey Foley. Photograph: FBI    If Tim and Alex\u2019s story sounds eerily familiar to fans of The Americans, the television drama about a KGB couple living in the US with their two children, that\u2019s because it\u2019s partly based on them. The show is set in the 1980s, providing a cold war backdrop, but the 2010 spy round-up served as an inspiration. The show\u2019s creator, Joe Weisberg, trained to be a CIA case officer in the early 1990s and, when I speak to him on the phone, tells me he always wanted to put family at the heart of the plot. \u201cOne of the interesting things I saw when I worked at the CIA was people lying to their children. If you have young children, you can\u2019t tell them you work for the CIA. And then, at some point, you have to pick an age and a time, and they find out that they\u2019ve been lied to for most of their lives. It\u2019s a difficult moment.\u201d When I meet Alex in Moscow, he has just finished watching the first season. (He had started on previous occasions, but found it too difficult; he and Tim joked that they should sue the creators.) His parents like the show, he tells me. \u201cObviously it\u2019s glamorised, all this killing people and action everywhere. But it reminded them of when they were young agents, and how they felt about being in a strange new place.\u201d Watching it, Alex says, has made him more curious: what set his parents off on this path, and why? *** In 2010, the spies were welcomed back to Russia as heroes. After a debriefing at SVR headquarters, Bezrukov, Vavilova and the other deportees met with then-president Dmitry Medvedev to receive medals for their service. Later, they met with Putin, and the group reportedly sang the patriotic Soviet song From Where The Motherland Begins. The authorities put on a tour: the agents and their families travelled to St Petersburg, Lake Baikal in Siberia and Sochi on the Black Sea. The idea was to show off modern Russia, and to provide them with an opportunity to bond. Do they still meet up, I ask Alex. \u201cFrom time to time,\u201d he says. He and Tim were the only adolescents; of the four couples arrested, two had younger children, while another had adult sons. Even so, the other families were probably the only people in the world who could even begin to understand their surreal situation. Bezrukov and Vavilova found themselves back in a very different Russia from the one they had left. The oldest of the agents had been retired from active espionage work for a decade, Alex says, and barely remembered how to speak Russian. The group were told they would no longer work for the SVR, but jobs were found for them in state banks and oil companies. Anna Chapman was given a television series and now has her own fashion line. Bezrukov was given a job at MGIMO, a prestigious Moscow university, and has written a book on the geopolitical challenges facing Russia. Tim and Alex were given Russian passports at the end of December 2010; suddenly, they became Timofei and Alexander Vavilov. The names were \u201ccompletely new, foreign and unpronounceable for us\u201d, Tim says. \u201cA real identity crisis,\u201d he adds with a hint of bitterness. Unable to return to university for his final year, he managed to transfer to a Russian university and complete his degree there, before doing an MBA in London. Alex was less lucky. He finished high school at the British International School in Moscow, but did not want to stay in Russia. He applied to university in Canada, but was told he would first have to apply for a new birth certificate, and then a citizenship certificate; only then could he renew his Canadian passport. In 2012 he was admitted to the University of Toronto, and applied for a four-year student visa on his Russian passport. The visa was issued and he planned to depart for Canada on 2 September. But four days before he was due to leave, as he was packing his bags and exchanging emails with his future roommate, he received a phone call from the Canadian embassy in Moscow demanding he come for an urgent interview. The meeting was hostile; there were a lot of questions about his life and his parents. The visa was annulled before his eyes, and he lost his university place. Alex has since been rejected for French and British visas. Twice, he has been accepted to study at the London School of Economics, but both times did not get a visa. Eventually, he was able to get a visa to study elsewhere in Europe; Tim travels mainly in Asia, where many countries can be visited visa-free on a Russian passport.    I'm glad they had a cause they believed in, but I wish the world wouldn\u2019t punish me for their choices  Alex     The brothers\u2019 battle to regain Canadian citizenship is not just about logistics. Moscow is not a city that embraces newcomers, and neither of them feels particularly Russian. \u201cI feel like I have been stripped of my own identity for something I had nothing to do with,\u201d Alex tells me. Both are keen to work in Asia for the time being, but want to move to Canada when they feel ready to start families. More than anything, their Canadian identity is the last straw they have left to grasp on to, after so much of the rest of their previous reality fell away. \u201cI lived for 20 years believing that I was Canadian and I still believe I am Canadian, nothing can change that,\u201d Tim wrote in his affidavit to the Toronto court. \u201cI do not have any attachment to Russia, I do not speak the language, I do not know many friends there, I have not lived there for any extended periods of time and I do not want to live there.\u201d Everyone who is born in Canada is eligible for Canadian citizenship, with one exception: those who are born to employees of foreign governments. But the brothers\u2019 Toronto-based lawyer, Hadayt Nazami, argues that it is ridiculous to apply the provision to their case; the whole point of the law, he says, is to prevent those who don\u2019t have the responsibilities of citizenship from enjoying its privileges. Ultimately, the court seems to be operating as much on emotional as on legal grounds, possibly with the Wall Street Journal story about Tim\u2019s apparent recruitment at the back of its mind. But even if the brothers knew about their parents\u2019 activities (and there is no hard evidence of this), I wondered what the court expected of them. What is a 16-year-old who finds out he is the child of Russian spies supposed to do? Call the FBI?     Alex and Tim in Bangkok in 2011. Photograph: courtesy Tim and Alex Foley    Tim and Alex have been through many months of questioning themselves and their identities, and of wondering whether they should be angry with their parents. They don\u2019t want their childhood to define them as they grow older. Many of their close friends know, but most of their casual acquaintances don\u2019t. When asked where they are from, the default response for both is \u201cCanada\u201d. They remain friends with many people from their previous life in Boston, though Tim says some broke off contact, mainly those whose parents were friends with his parents and felt betrayed. While they have no wish to live in Russia, both brothers visit Moscow every few months to see their parents. I ask them how hard it has been to keep that relationship going. Was there a confrontation? Tim and Alex choose their words carefully; they want to appear rational and pragmatic, rather than emotional, it seems. \u201cOf course, there were some very difficult times,\u201d Tim says. \u201cBut if I get angry with them, it\u2019s not going to lead to any beneficial outcomes.\u201d He admits it is sad that, even though he can now spend time with his grandparents, the language barrier means he will never know them properly. \u201cIn terms of family and keeping this whole thing together, it really doesn\u2019t work out well when you choose this kind of path,\u201d he says, his voice trailing off wistfully. Alex tells me that he sometimes wonders why his parents decided to have children at all. \u201cThey live their lives like everyone else, making choices along the way. I am glad they had a cause they believed in so strongly, but their choices mean I feel no connection to the country they risked their lives for. I wish the world wouldn\u2019t punish me for their choices and actions. It has been deeply unjust.\u201d A number of times, Alex tells me that it is not his place to judge his parents, but that six years ago he spent a long period wrestling with \u201cthe big question\u201d of whether he hated them or felt betrayed. In the end, he came to one conclusion: that they were the same people who had raised him lovingly, whatever secrets they hid.", "publicationDate": "2016-05-07T08:00:10Z", "tags": ["Espionage", "Russia", "FBI", "US news", "World news", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/discovered-our-parents-were-russian-spies-tim-alex-foley", "title": "The day we discovered our parents were Russian spies", "sentences": ["Alex and Tim in Bangkok in 2011."]}, {"article": "If anyone needs convincing of the need for greater UK investment in infrastructure, they should visit south-east Asia. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, has a modern airport and a highways network that is arguably better than that of any major UK city other than London. Lining the highways are large factories built by global corporations such as Canon and by local businesses. The huge levels of employment and wealth creation would not exist without the highway infrastructure. Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, has a modern highway network connecting it to other major cities, and a clean, modern suburban rail network. Its airport is world class. Viewed from the air, the massive industrial developments around the highway network are breathtaking. The high-speed railway that is being built to Singapore will open at least 10 years ahead of the first of the UK\u2019s high-speed lines. Hong Kong has a top international airport and a modern highway, rail and metro infrastructure. Its suspension bridges and tunnels overcome obstacles such as straits between islands, hills or population centres. Its public transport system has more passengers than London. Investment has paid off: since 1960 its GDP per head has increased twelve-fold, nearly to that of the UK (it saw a three-fold increase) and which it will soon overtake.    Related: Smart infrastructure is the key to sustainable development    Singapore remains south-east Asia\u2019s star performer. A poverty-stricken nation of shanty towns 50 years ago, it has become the world\u2019s number one city and is aiming to be the world\u2019s first smart nation. Its international airport, Changi, is a showcase for the country\u2019s ambition. With 50 million passengers a year, nearly as many as Heathrow, it remains the best airport in the world. It plans to increase capacity to 130 million passengers annually before 2030. Not bad for a country of just five million people and an area of 716 square kilometres.  Justifying the development a few years ago, Singapore\u2019s prime minister said: \u201cThe question is, do we want to stay this vibrant hub of south-east Asia, or do we want to let somebody take over our position, our business and our jobs?\u201d Two more lines are being added to its rail network of clean and pleasant trains. The road network is superb, with 10 motorways and an 11th being built. One 10-mile-long road tunnel underneath the city has mostly five lanes on each side. With less than 2% unemployment, per capita income at twice that of the UK and no national debt, Singapore is a model for other nations and cities.  Thailand is investing heavily to try to catch up. With a modern, world-class airport at Bangkok, it has four high-speed rail projects due for completion soon after 2020, dwarfing those envisaged for the UK for the 2030s, as well as massive highways and other rail projects.  The link between infrastructure investment and prosperity for citizens is clear. The UK lost its way many years ago. It is 170 years since a rail tunnel was built through the Pennines. That closed 50 years ago and none has been built since. Its motorway network is heading for third-world status. Nearby cities such as Manchester and Sheffield are without decent road links. Commuter journeys between Manchester and Leeds are 40% below what they should be.  The government is to be commended for recognising the importance of infrastructure to economic growth and job creation. However, despite some initiatives in the past 50 years \u2013 such as the Humber Bridge, Crossrail and the Greater Manchester tram system \u2013 current plans are wholly inadequate in the face of fierce global competition.

Related: Liverpool's Europa League party fizzles out as Sevilla reign again | Barney Ronay    Moreno was not the only one to blame for Liverpool\u2019s comprehensive defeat, of course. Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino were like a couple of geckos introduced to Easter Island by Polynesian settlers a long time ago, insofar as they had no influence whatsoever on events in Basel/Basle/Baaarl/Barzuhl. And Klopp himself didn\u2019t seem to exert much control in the second half as Sevilla reminded everyone what a nifty team they can be. Ah yes, the Premier League fans predicting a comfortable Liverpool victory had forgotten about that last bit, hadn\u2019t they? After the match Klopp had the unhappy duty of having to look at a bunch of journalists but, to his credit, he resisted any temptation to throw Moreno to the slobbering pack. Instead he lamented the way his whole team unravelled after Sevilla\u2019s equaliser to the point that they were practically indistinguishable from the shower that Brendan Rodgers used to send out earlier this season. OK, those are our words, not exactly his. What he said was: \u201cAt this moment we lost faith in our style of play, we changed from passing quick and simple to complicated and lost our formation.\u201d  At least Klopp managed to finish his press conference, if not his season, on a high note: \u201cWe are disappointed and frustrated 100% but tomorrow or later in the week we will see it a little bit more clearly and we will use this experience, that is what we have to do,\u201d he bugled. \u201cIt is clear we are not in a European tournament next year so we don\u2019t have football on Wednesday or Thursday, so we will have time to train and we will, for sure, come back stronger.\u201d And with a new left-back, for pity\u2019s sake.

Sydney Swans were pounding the Wagga Wagga Wasps or some such when the break came. The half-time entertainment generously comprised an attempt to break a record of some sort for line dancing. Exciting. As if that wasn\u2019t enough of a treat, they also had some dusty bush-type and his dogs herding sheep around the perimeter of the oval. It was all going quite smoothly until one of the dogs got slightly overcome by the occasion and bit one of the sheep on its back leg. The suddenly-spooked sheep scattered in all directions, skittling dozens of tasselled line-dancers to the ground while the dogs descended into full rampage, encouraged as they were by a suddenly boisterous and baying crowd. Tears and cheeks have rarely met under more wondrous circumstances\u201d \u2013 Glenn Leete. \u201cBack in the days of The Dell, a police dog team prepared to demonstrate their catch-a-man skills.

The boat, which was carrying 32 tourists plus four crew, flipped over Thursday afternoon after it was hit by a wave near a rocky stretch of coast in the Gulf of Thailand. The bodies of a 28-year-old British woman and a 29-year-old German woman were retrieved that afternoon, said Paiboon Omark, a district chief on the island. On Friday morning rescue workers found the body of a third tourist, who police identified as a Hong Kong woman \u201cin her 30s\u201d. Her body was found at 10.30am 500 metres away, said Thanakorn Pattananun, the head of the island\u2019s tourist police, told AFP. A team of 50 rescue workers in seven boats were searching for a British man who is still missing, he said. The Thai captain of the Ang Thong Explorer speedboat has been detained and charged with negligence that led to deaths and injuries. \u201cWeather was the cause of the accident because it created high waves, but the boat was also being driven at a high speed,\u201d Apichart Boonsriro, the commander of Surat Thani provincial police, told AFP. Four tourists have been hospitalised for injuries sustained during the accident, including a British woman and Australian man who have been sent to a hospital in Bangkok, said staff at Samui hospital. The two other tourists, a Romanian woman and a German man, are receiving medical treatment on the island, the hospital said. The speedboat had been taking the tourists on a day trip to nearby islands and was only a few metres from a pier when it capsized. The British Foreign Office confirmed the death of a British woman and said it was assisting her family. A spokeswoman said they were aware of another British national in hospital for injuries suffered in the same incident, but did not make reference to a third citizen. \u201cWe remain in contact with local authorities in Thailand for further information,\u201d she said. The German embassy in Bangkok was not available to comment. Tourism is a key source of revenue for Thailand, but accidents involving tourists are common in a country where safety regulations are often weakly enforced. In February a British tourist was killed on Koh Samui after being thrown from an elephant. Gareth Crowe, 36, was taking part in a trek when the animal turned on its handler. In January a speedboat struck and killed a French tourist while she was snorkelling in waters reserved for swimmers off a Thai island in Krabi province.

The man, an Iranian, was one of four people to volunteer for resettlement as part of a $40-million deal forged between Australia and Cambodia in September 2014. The deal relates specifically to refugees detained by Australia on Nauru. After he, a Rohingya man and an Iranian couple agreed to be part of the first group, the government tacked on an additional $15.5m to cover the initial resettlement costs. The Iranian refugee did not respond to a request for comment but Kerm Sarin, a spokesman for Cambodia\u2019s general department of immigration, told Guardian Australia on Friday that the man had left Cambodia in April. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say why, but he volunteered to go back to his home country,\u201d Sarin said, adding that the refugee liaised directly with the Iranian authorities in securing his passage back there.   Related: Fifth refugee secretly moved from Nauru to Cambodia under $55m deal    \u201cWe didn\u2019t provide any assistance in getting the paperwork,\u201d Sarin said. The man\u2019s departure was also confirmed by Joe Lowry, the Bangkok-based spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration. Lowry did not respond to questions about the integration program IOM set up after winning the tender to assist in the resettlement of refugees, and whether or not it would be altered following the departures. Two more Rohingya men detained on Nauru have volunteered to be resettled in Cambodia, where a lone Rohingya man who arrived separately to the first group is now the only refugee still here. Upon their arrival in Phnom Penh on a scorching day in early June last year, the first group of four were swiftly whisked away to a gated villa in the southern outskirts of Phnom Penh. While sequestered there, the group \u2013 which had also been promised a cash incentive by the Australian government \u2013 took part in an orientation and integration program set up by the IOM, which included Khmer language lessons and trips around the capital. Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said by phone that Cambodia had only ever been seen as a way out of the \u201cdeterrent centre\u201d that is Nauru; that Cambodia was a \u201cstopping-off point\u201d through which the refugees could ultimately try and go somewhere else.   Related: Australia spent $2m relocating two refugees from Nauru to Cambodia    In this case, all four have returned to the countries they once fled. The first was the lone Rohingya man, who lasted just four months in Cambodia. He returned to Myanmar last October. The Iranian couple left Cambodia in February. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to see a situation where refugees are coerced into returning to their home countries,\u201d Rintoul said. \u201cThe whole thing associated with Cambodia is to get that effect and treat people in such an abominable way; deny them a future that people do \u2018voluntarily\u2019 return to their home countries. It\u2019s an outcome that\u2019s designed to be forced upon them.\u201d The refugee resettlement deal with Cambodia was first floated by the Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, in January 2014, just weeks after the Cambodian government opened fire on protesting garment workers, killing five civilians.

The head of MI5, Eliza Manningham-Buller, was so incensed when she discovered the role played by MI6 in abductions that led to suspected extremists being tortured, she threw out a number of her sister agency\u2019s staff and banned them from working at MI5\u2019s headquarters, Thames House. According to Whitehall sources, she also wrote to the then prime minister, Tony Blair, to complain about the conduct of MI6 officers, saying their actions had threatened Britain\u2019s intelligence gathering and may have compromised the security and safety of MI5 officers and their informants. The letter caused a serious and prolonged breakdown of trust between Britain\u2019s domestic and foreign spy agencies provoked by the Blair government\u2019s support for rendition.  The letter was discovered by investigators examining whether British intelligence officers should face criminal charges over the rendition of an exiled Libyan opposition leader, Abdul Hakim Belhaj. A critic of Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan dictator, Belhaj was seized in Bangkok in March, 2004 in a joint UK-US operation, and handed over to the CIA. He alleges the CIA tortured him and injected him with \u201ctruth serum\u201d before flying him and his family to Tripoli to be interrogated.     Abdul Hakim Belhaj, centre, speaks during a press conference in Tripoli in 2012. Photograph: Mahmud Turkia/AFP/Getty Images    According to documents found in Tripoli, five days before he was secretly flown to the Libyan capital, MI6 gave Gaddafi\u2019s intelligence agency the French and Moroccan aliases used by Belhaj. MI6 also provided the Libyans with the intelligence that allowed the CIA to kidnap him and take him to Tripoli. Belhaj told the Guardian that British intelligence officers were among the first to interrogate him in Tripoli. He said he was \u201cvery surprised that the British got involved in what was a very painful period in my life\u201d. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed a bath for three years and I didn\u2019t see the sun for one year,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThey hung me from the wall and kept me in an isolation cell. I was regularly tortured.\u201d The secret role played by MI6 was revealed after the fall of Gaddafi, when documents were found in ransacked offices of his intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa.  One, dated 18 March 2004 was a note from Sir Mark Allen, then head of counter-terrorism at MI6, to Moussa Koussa. It said: \u201cI congratulate you on the safe arrival of Abu Abd Allah Sadiq [Abdul-Hakim Belhaj]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years. I am so glad. I was grateful to you for helping the officer we sent out last week.\u201d Allen added: \u201c[Belhaj\u2019s] information on the situation in this country is of urgent importance to us. Amusingly, we got a request from the Americans to channel requests for information from [Belhaj] through the Americans. I have no intention of doing any such thing. The intelligence on [Belhaj] was British. I know I did not pay for the air cargo [Belhaj]. But I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this and am very grateful for the help you are giving us.\u201d Scotland Yard has concluded its investigation into the alleged involvement of intelligence officers and officials in Libyan rendition operations and an announcement about whether or not to prosecute is imminent. Whitehall sources have told the Guardian that police and prosecutors have been reviewing the issue for months. They say investigators have been frustrated by the way potentially key witnesses have said they were unable to recall who had authorised British involvement in the rendition programme, who else knew about it, and who knew the precise details of the Belhaj abduction. \u201cThis is an extremely difficult area for police and prosecutors,\u201d said one source. \u201cThe problem is, the CPS cannot bring a charge against a government policy.\u201d The letter to Blair sent by Manningham-Buller, who was director general of MI5 from 2002 to 2007, reflected deep divisions within Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies over the methods being used to gather information after the 9/11 attacks on the US. Though MI5 has been criticised about some of the tactics used, the letter suggests Britain\u2019s security service had serious misgivings about rendition operations and the torture of suspects. The Guardian has been told the MI5 chief was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the treatment of Belhaj and vented her anger at MI6, which was then run by Sir Richard Dearlove. \u201cWhen EMB [Manningham-Buller] found out what had gone on in Libya, she was evidently furious. I have never seen a letter quite like it. There was a serious rift between MI5 and MI6 at the time.\u201d She has since said the aim of engaging with Gaddafi to persuade him to abandon his chemical and nuclear weapons programme was not \u201cwrong in principle\u201d.  However, she added: \u201cThere are clearly questions to be answered about the various relationships that developed afterwards and whether the UK supped with a sufficiently long spoon.\u201d The police files with the CPS are understood to describe how Belhaj, his pregnant wife, Fatima Bouchar, and children, and Sami al-Saadi and his family were abducted from the far east to Gaddafi\u2019s interrogation and torture cells in Tripoli in 2004. The British government paid \u00a32.2m to settle a damages claim brought by al-Saadi and his family. Belhaj has refused to settle unless he receives an apology. Jack Straw, who as foreign secretary was responsible for MI6, and Allen have always denied wrongdoing.   Related: UK government 'seeking to avoid responsibility' for renditions    In December 2005, when the first evidence emerged that Britain was colluding in CIA rendition operations, Straw told MPs: \u201cThere is simply no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition full stop.\u201d When the Libyan renditions came to light, Straw said: \u201cNo foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time.\u201d  He has been interviewed by the police but only as a potential witness. Government officials, insisting on anonymity, said MI6 was following \u201cministerially authorised government policy\u201d. Blair said he did not have \u201cany recollection at all\u201d of the Belhaj rendition. The Blair and Straw denials appeared to be contradicted by Dearlove. He has said: \u201cIt was a political decision, having very significantly disarmed Libya, for the government to cooperate with Libya on Islamist terrorism. The whole relationship was one of serious calculation about where the overall balance of our national interests stood.\u201d Neither MI5 nor MI6, nor Manningham-Buller, wanted to make any public comment. Whitehall sources insist the relationship between MI5 and MI6 has now been repaired after a difficult period.  Belhaj is demanding an apology and an acceptance of British guilt. He has taken his case to the supreme court, which has yet to hand down a judgment. Last year, the court was confronted with the prospect of Straw and British intelligence officers deploying the \u201cforeign act of state doctrine\u201d \u2013 that is to say, the courts here cannot rule on the case since agents from foreign countries, notably the US and Libya, were involved, and they are granted immunity. Section 7 of the 1994 Intelligence Services Act, sometimes described as the \u201cJames Bond clause\u201d, protects MI6 officers from prosecution for actions anywhere in the world that would otherwise be illegal. They would be protected as long as their actions were authorised in writing by the secretary of state. However, lawyers for Belhaj say many cases involving deportation or asylum seekers, for example, relate to actions of foreign states and that, in any case, torture overrides all legal loopholes. An inquiry under Sir Peter Gibson, a retired senior judge, into earlier rendition programmes in which British intelligence was involved, was abandoned because of the new and dramatic evidence about Belhaj\u2019s abduction.  After insisting that the issues were so serious that it needed a judge-led inquiry rather than one carried out by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, David Cameron reversed his position. After the Gibson inquiry was dropped, he said the issues should be taken up by the committee after all. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general and now chair of the committee, said shortly after he was appointed last October: \u201cOur longer-term priority is the substantial inquiry into the role of the UK government and security and intelligence agencies in relation to detainee treatment and rendition, where there are still unanswered questions.\u201d The Gibson inquiry published a damning interim report before it folded. It concluded that the British government and its intelligence agencies had been involved in rendition operations, in which detainees were kidnapped and flown around the globe, and had interrogated detainees who they knew were being mistreated. It said MI6 officers were informed they were under no obligation to report breaches of the Geneva conventions; intelligence officers appear to have taken advantage of the abuse of detainees; and Straw, as foreign secretary, had suggested that the law might be amended to allow suspects to be rendered to the UK.  It raised 27 questions they said would need to be answered if the full truth about the way in which Britain waged its \u201cwar on terror\u201d was to be established. The questions include: \u2022 Did UK intelligence officers turn a blind eye to \u201cspecific, inappropriate techniques or threats\u201d used by others and use this to their advantage in interrogations? \u2022 If so, was there \u201ca deliberate or agreed policy\u201d between UK officers and overseas intelligence officers? \u2022 Did the government and its agencies become \u201cinappropriately involved in some renditions\u201d? \u2022 Was there a willingness, \u201cat least at some levels within the agencies, to condone, encourage or take advantage of a rendition operation\u201d?", "publicationDate": "2016-05-31T16:56:10Z", "tags": ["MI6", "MI5", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "UK news", "Libya", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Africa", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Abdel Hakim Belhaj", "Tony Blair", "Politics", "Jack Straw", "Rendition"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/31/revealed-britain-rendition-policy-rift-between-spy-agencies-mi6-mi5", "title": "Blair government's rendition policy led to rift between UK spy agencies", "sentences": ["A critic of Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan dictator, Belhaj was seized in Bangkok in March, 2004 in a joint UK-US operation, and handed over to the CIA."]}, {"article": "A senior Conservative MP has described the continuing cover-up of Britain\u2019s complicity in the kidnapping and torture of detainees in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d \u2013 and of who authorised it \u2013 as a shocking scandal that must be resolved without further delay. Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition, made clear that an answer to the key question \u2013 who knew about the secret operations \u2013 was getting closer. Tyrie, also chair of the Commons liaison committee of senior backbenchers and the Commons Treasury committee, was responding on Wednesday to the Guardian\u2019s disclosure that the former head of MI5 was incensed when she discovered the role played by MI6 in abductions that led to suspected extremists being tortured.    Related: Blair government's rendition policy led to rift between UK spy agencies    Lady Eliza Manningham-Buller was so angry that she threw out a number of her sister agency\u2019s staff and banned them from working at MI5\u2019s headquarters at Thames House in London. She wrote to Tony Blair, then the prime minister, to complain about the conduct of MI6 officers, saying their actions had threatened Britain\u2019s intelligence gathering and may have compromised the security and safety of MI5 officers and their informants. Her letter was discovered by investigators examining whether British intelligence officers should face criminal charges over the rendition of the exiled Libyan opposition leader Abdul Hakim Belhaj. \u201cThis letter strongly suggests Tony Blair, the former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove, and Eliza Manningham-Buller, the head of MI5, all knew that secret agents were engaged in the rendering, and possibly subsequent maltreatment, of prisoners,\u201d Tyrie told the Guardian. \u201cIt is now essential to establish who authorised this rendition. The chances of it not having been authorised would appear low. Were it unauthorised it would be criminal.\u201d Section 7 of the 1994 Intelligence Services Act protects MI6 officers from prosecution for actions anywhere in the world that would otherwise be illegal. They would be protected as long as their actions were authorised in writing by the foreign secretary, who is the minister responsible for MI6. At the time the office was held by Jack Straw.     Eliza Manningham-Buller. Photograph: D Dudley/Pacific/Barcroft    Tyrie told the Guardian: \u201cIt is a scandal and shocking that, after nearly a decade of demanding answers, the public still don\u2019t know the scope and limits of the UK\u2019s complicity in kidnap and torture. Public confidence in the security services has been eroded as a consequence. We need them. It is now essential that the prime minister ensures that the ISC [parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee] are able to get to the bottom of this, and without delay. Only by doing so can a line be drawn under this sorry episode.\u201d Tyrie clashed with David Cameron at a meeting of the liaison committee in January, arguing that the ISC should have more effective powers to scrutinise the security and intelligence agencies. Separately, a leading human rights group said Manningham-Buller was \u201cright to be disgusted\u201d over MI6\u2019s involvement in secret rendition \u2013 the seizure and interrogation of suspected extremists. Cori Crider, a lawyer at the international human rights organisation Reprieve, said: \u201cYou know MI6 under Blair\u2019s government were running amok when their role in CIA kidnap operations turned even the stomachs of MI5. Yet now, according to this report, officials are exercising mass tactical amnesia over who signed off the most appalling abuses in the \u2018war on terror\u2019. The notion that \u2018the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] cannot bring a charge against a government policy\u2019 of torture is obviously wrong.\u201d Crider added: \u201cLady Manningham-Buller was right to be disgusted. The rendition of the Belhaj and al-Saadi families to Libya wasn\u2019t just illegal \u2013 it broke every value Britons hold dear. It\u2019s a damning assessment when even the hard-nosed head of MI5 could see that delivering a pregnant woman and four children to Gaddafi\u2019s dungeons was wrong, pointless, and made Britain less safe. There clearly is a case to answer here, and Reprieve aren\u2019t the only ones who think so. We eagerly anticipate the long-delayed decision of the CPS.\u201d      Reprieve\u2019s Cori Crider. Photograph: Pablo Porciuncula/AFP/Getty Images    A spokesperson for Leigh Day, Belhaj\u2019s lawyers, said: \u201cThese revelations are extraordinary, we hope that the CPS does take the decision to prosecute those allegedly responsible for illegal acts of rendition. The courts can then determine the full extent of the role played by the British government, and its security services, in sending our client Abdul Hakim Belhaj, along with his pregnant wife, back to Libya to be imprisoned and brutally tortured.\u201d Though government sources in the UK and US claim Blair and Straw knew about the rendition, both men have denied wrongdoing, saying they either did not know of the MI6 operation or had no recollection of it. Manningham-Buller\u2019s letter caused a serious and prolonged breakdown of trust between Britain\u2019s domestic and foreign spy agencies provoked by the Blair government\u2019s support for rendition.  Belhaj, a critic of the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, was seized in Bangkok in March 2004 in a joint UK-US operation and handed over to the CIA. He alleges the CIA tortured him and injected him with \u201ctruth serum\u201d before flying him and his family to Tripoli to be interrogated. Scotland Yard has concluded its investigation into the alleged involvement of intelligence officers and officials in Libyan rendition operations and an announcement about whether or not to prosecute is imminent. Whitehall sources have told the Guardian that police and prosecutors have been reviewing the issue for months. They say investigators have been frustrated by potentially key witnesses saying they were unable to recall who had authorised British involvement in the rendition programme, who else knew about it, and who knew the precise details of the Belhaj abduction. When the Libyan renditions came to light, Straw said: \u201cNo foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time.\u201d He has been interviewed by the police but only as a potential witness. Government officials, insisting on anonymity, said MI6 was following \u201cministerially authorised government policy\u201d. Blair said he did not have \u201cany recollection at all\u201d of the Belhaj rendition.

Nimble enough to weave through traffic jams and narrow streets, the three-wheeled auto rickshaw is one of the most convenient ways of getting around congested cities in the developing world. For residents, they tend to be cheaper than taxis. For tourists, they offer the novelty of an open-air view. Unfortunately, they are also noisy and highly polluting, black smoke spewing from the exhaust. A handful of companies believe they have a solution: an electric, zero-emission version of the three-wheeled vehicle. And they hope the clean (and quiet) technology can help popularise the tuk-tuk on the more ordered roads of the western world. Tuk Tuk Factory is a Dutch company manufacturing a range of \u201ce-tuks\u201d in Thailand. All powered by battery, the basic three-seater can go for more than 60 miles after a five-hour boost with the on-board charger.     Inside an electric tuk-tuk factory in the Netherlands. Photograph: Tuk Tuk Factory    \u201cMy team and I all loved tuk-tuks but we wanted to make sure they were environmentally sustainable as well as fun,\u201d explains company director Roland Vos. The company has sold 800 e-tuks across 30 countries since 2011, mostly countries with no history of using the diesel and gasoline-guzzling tuk-tuks. The biggest market so far has been Portugal, where they have sold 90 of their electric tuk tuks. Although the novelty factor has played a role in raising interest, Vos believes the market in is ready to take off beyond rides in tourist resorts and quiet historical districts. \u201cWe have a lot of resorts and hotels excited about them, and the market among food truck vendors is really big,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut the use of tuk-tuks as a daily taxi service is also getting bigger.\u201d   Related: Transport for London moves to clamp down on rickshaw riders    Michael Fox is sales director at the e-Tuk USA, a Denver-based company licensing the design of the Tuk Tuk Factory\u2019s vehicles and manufacturing them in the US. Fox has sold just under 40 of them in the first 12 months in the US and is excited by the idea of tuk-tuks filling the so-called \u201clast mile\u201d gap, the distance between a station and a traveller\u2019s final destination. As well as ferrying people short distances in downtown areas, he thinks they could work well alongside America\u2019s growing public transport system.     Image0126 Photograph: Mellowcabs    \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of competition out there \u2013 Uber, taxis and limo services,\u201d Fox says. \u201cBut an Uber or taxi driver doesn\u2019t want to drive someone four or five blocks, they want to go four or five miles. We want to go those short distances, picking people up from a train station and dropping them at the stadium, or taking them from the ball game to the bar afterwards.\u201d Fox says at a typical rate of $2 per person (\u00a31.50), the e-tuk offers a quick, cheap and eco-friendly way of making those journeys. Businesses hope to persuade transport authorities that e-tuk-tuks could also help ease congestion on the roads. \u201cSmaller vehicles carrying a few passengers at a time \u2013 it\u2019s a very efficient way to get people around,\u201d says South African e-tuk entrepreneur Neil du Preez. Yet regulation remains a big barrier, as does the competition. Even if you convince the relevant high-level authority to permit tuk-tuks on the road, as e-Tuk USA has with the US Department of Transportation, three-wheeler drivers are likely to come up against taxi unions defending their precious territory. \u201cEvery change comes with friction,\u201d says Vos. \u201cThe existing taxi world has not been known for its flexibility. At the moment this is complementary to the taxi market because last mile and touristic transport aren\u2019t always what the taxis are doing. But as the market evolves, I think tuk-tuks can take a slice of the taxi market in many places.\u201d     At $2 per person (\u00a31.50), the e-tuk offers a quick, cheap and eco-friendly way of making short journeys.

Mellowcabs has struck an agreement with Uber to have its own three-wheeler drivers feature on the ride-sharing app within South Africa. Yet du Preez has had to tread carefully to avoid conflict with the country\u2019s powerful minibus industry. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged with the operators to make sure we\u2019re complementing what they\u2019re doing and not interfering with their routes into residential areas,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut the meter taxi cab industry isn\u2019t too big in South Africa \u2013 we\u2019re okay with seeing them as the competition.\u201d Meanwhile, Japanese company Terra Motors is enjoying some success selling its three-wheeler electric rickshaws in Asian countries where fossil fuel-burning auto rickshaws still dominate.

Tourists moved by the spectacle of such splendid creatures living side by side with human beings could also pay the saffron-robed Buddhist monks an extra \u00a315 to help feed the cubs, or to have their picture taken with an adult tiger\u2019s head resting on their lap. Along with nearly 250,000 people, Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9 and their daughter Blue Ivy posed with the animals last year, and marvelled that some of the world\u2019s fiercest creatures could be so tame. Now the doors of the temple have been closed and the animals removed, possibly for ever. After a decade of allegations by animal groups of cruelty, illegal wildlife trafficking and breeding, 1,000 police, military and government officials descended on the temple to expose a shadowy trade in tiger parts that feeds an insatiable market in China and threatens the few remaining tigers in the wild. The figures are stark and depressing. Today\u2019s population of wild tigers is estimated to be around 3,200, down from 100,000 in 1900. But research by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), Australia\u2019s Conservation and Environmental Education 4 Life (Cee4life) and others, backed by investigations for Traffic, the wildlife trade monitoring network, suggest that more than 5,000 tigers are being farmed in China, 1,450 in Thailand, 180 in Vietnam and possibly 400 in Laos. In addition, there are private collections and zoos in most other Asian countries. Debbie Banks of the EIA has worked undercover at tiger farms in China. She says that for the past decade, tiger breeding has been a fast-expanding and lucrative industry, often masquerading as conservation. The existence of the farms is stoking demand for luxury products and traditional Chinese medicines, and endangering the few tigers left in the wild.   Related: Thai police charge 22 with wildlife trafficking from tiger temple    \u201cThese places are stockpiling dead parts in freezers. This [raid in Thailand] was just the tip of a trade that spans south-east Asia and sees so-called tiger sanctuaries and farms secretly selling tiger parts and products on the black market for enormous profit,\u201d she said. In Kanchanaburi, what was found out of sight of the tourists shocked even hardened wildlife investigators. Apart from 137 live tigers, they found a laboratory, suggesting that the monks were using tiger parts to make wines and medicines \u2013 as well as the carcasses of 40 cubs stored in a freezer. Farms such as these \u2013 which have grown in number and size in response to rising demand for tiger bone and other body parts, and the precipitous decline in wild tigers \u2013 say they are making people aware of the tigers\u2019 plight and claim that their captive-bred animals could be returned to the wild. Banks is scornful: many such \u201cfacilities\u201d are breeding tigers for profit, she says, and most are suspected of being involved in the illegal selling or trading of tiger parts. Despite an international agreement in 2007 stipulating that tigers should not be bred for trade in parts, and that tiger farms should be phased out, the opposite has happened, with the trade in body parts from captive tigers rising, and the demand for wild tigers higher than ever. Traffic says that parts of around 1,600 tigers were seized by Asian authorities between 2000 and 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to break down which were wild and which captive, but they could not have all been wild tigers,\u201d said spokesman Richard Thomas. \u201cMany of the hundreds of tiger part seizures in Asia appear to be from captive-bred animals, and Traffic has previously called upon a number of countries, including Thailand, to demonstrate what controls are in place to prevent such illegal trade taking place.\u201d   Related: Forty dead tiger cubs found in freezer at Thai temple    Yet business is booming. The authors of a 2014 report, commissioned for Cites (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), the world regulator of trade in protected wildlife, said: \u201cAn increasing number of live animals and frozen bodies are being detected, with more than 50% of seizures over the past 14 years occurring since 2010. It is suspected that many of these are of captive origin. \u201cSeizures of suspected captive-origin tigers have risen in Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, and evidence suggests that such trade is also taking place in Indonesia.\u201d The strong suspicion is that corrupt authorities and powerful businessmen are behind the billion-dollar trade in tiger parts. \u201cChina has systematically exercised internal trading privileges for companies dealing in skins and derivatives, produced mainly but not exclusively from captive breeding,\u201d says the Cites report. Despite international bans on the trade, porous borders between Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and China allow traffickers to easily export animals. Two weeks ago, a 26-year-old Vietnamese man was found with four frozen tiger cubs at the Laos border. He said he had bought the carcasses at a border market for 2 million Vietnamese Dong (\u00a362) and was delivering them to a buyer. Once the tiger parts reach China, the rewards are immense. For decades, tiger parts, used in traditional medicine, drove the black market trade. It has been forbidden to use tiger bones in China since 1993, but John Scanlon, secretary-general of Cites, says there has been an expansion in demand for some species, from buyers keen to display their wealth. \u201cThis is most evident with the use of rhino horn and tiger parts. This is part of a shift from traditional culture-related consumption to conspicuous consumption, which is also affecting many other species pressured by illegal trade,\u201d said Scanlon. A skin from a fully grown farmed tiger can sell for around \u00a340,000 in China. According to EIA, wealthy Chinese are buying pelts for rugs and wall hangings, and drinking tiger wine at $500 (\u00a3340) a bottle. Tiger bones are worth almost their weight in gold, and a bowl of tiger penis soup \u2013 said to boost virility \u2013 sells for more than $300. There only around 50 tigers left in the wild in China, but two large tiger farms and many smaller ones legally hold some 5,000 animals. Some countries have argued that captive breeding of endangered animals can relieve the pressure on wild animals. But while this may be true with crocodiles, it is thought to actually increase demand for tiger parts, says the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see tigers commercialised in any way,\u201d said Colman O\u2019Criodain, WWF\u2019s wildlife trade specialist. \u201cThe fact is, the wilder the tiger, the better the medicine is considered. It\u2019s also very expensive to rear tigers in captivity. With the difficulty of separating farmed products from wild ones, it\u2019s too much of a risk. There is too much temptation to cash in.\u201d Banks added: \u201cTiger farms have nothing to do with conservation of wild tigers. On the contrary, both legal and illegal trade in parts and products from these horrific facilities are stimulating demand, which drives the poaching and extinction of wild tigers.\u201d Campaigners hope that the horrors of Kanchanaburi will stir the world\u2019s conscience. But for the trade in one of the world\u2019s most impressive creatures to end, there may need to be another cultural revolution in China. Tigers in danger There are about 3,200 tigers in the wild. Fewer than 30 in Vietnam, 50 in China, 2,200 in India and about 500 in Russia. There are more than 7,000 tigers being bred in captivity in 240 farms in SE Asia. China has 5,000 captive tigers, Thailand 1,450, Vietnam 180 and Laos around 400. The skin, meat, bones and claws of tigers are all prized for luxury goods and traditional medicine. The equivalent of 1,590 dead tigers were seized between 2000 and 2014. About 30% of the illegal tiger parts seized in Asia are suspected to have come from farms.", "publicationDate": "2016-06-04T20:44:58Z", "tags": ["Endangered species", "Wildlife", "Animal welfare", "Animals", "World news", "Thailand", "China"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/04/tiger-temple-scandal-billion-dollar-trade-china-thailand", "title": "Tiger temple scandal exposes the shadowy billion-dollar Asian trade", "sentences": ["A week ago it cost 600 baht (\u00a311.50) to visit the tiger temple in Thailand\u2019s Kanchanaburi province, west of the capital, Bangkok."]}, {"article": "When plucky 5,000-1 outsiders Leicester City won the Premier League, their victory parade was cheered by thousands of local supporters who had waited generations for such a day. But the last leg of that parade took place in Bangkok. The Premier League pumps a global product out of the deep wells of local loyalty and identity. It\u2019s tempting to see football as a kind of metaphor for the state of the nation. But over large swaths of the Earth \u2013 the most economically vibrant parts in fact \u2013 the Premier League is Britain and Britain is the Premier League. Not a metaphor for British values but their fullest expression. So the story that football tells about us is important. What is that story? The official version charts a happy transformation from 70s hooliganism through improved stadiums, Italia \u201990, Gazza\u2019s tears and Fever Pitch to today\u2019s world-class classless product. Adrian Tempany proposes a darker history, one in which the game is hunted down and devoured by Rupert Murdoch, in which the physical and ideological spaces where the game once roamed have been enclosed, and the fans condemned \u2013 like Native Americans on reservations \u2013 to act out ersatz versions of their own rituals for the benefit of tourists. This is a bold, important, honest, gripping, authoritative book that takes us to the dark heart of how Britain works. It\u2019s also brilliantly written. The first chapter will be anthologised for ever \u2013 alongside Orwell\u2019s A Hanging, say, or Pliny\u2019s description of the destruction of Pompeii \u2013 as an eyewitness account of an appalling event. Tempany survived the Hillsborough disaster, just. His description of that April afternoon is so gut-wrenching that I had to take a break after every couple of paragraphs.   Related: Hillsborough: \u2018Finally, we got justice\u2019    His writing is so vivid partly because he has never been allowed to consign the sights and sensations of that day to history. One effect of the 27-year fight to expose the cover-up is that the victims of the South Yorkshire police and Sheffield Wednesday FC have been forced to revisit their trauma over and over again, most recently at the inquests in Warrington. This makes the optimism of some of the book\u2019s conclusions all the more heroic. The Hillsborough campaign naturally focused around the bereaved families. Their losses were the most devastating and the easiest to grasp. For survivors such as Tempany things were more complicated. Not only had they seen terrible things, they had been blamed for them. Their own post-traumatic stress, survivor\u2019s guilt and personal griefs were exacerbated by the lies and accusations of the powerful. This book is not just an examination of the state of football but an attempt by Tempany to work out what happened to him and to Britain \u2013 and more surprisingly, what we can do about it. The opportunity to re-evaluate Hillsborough, he says, might be an opportunity to re-evaluate the state of our nation. The effects of Hillsborough are felt well beyond the world of football. It has had a role to play in the creation of our risk-averse culture, in the transformation of childhood from the free-range, unsupervised playtime of my own day, to the managed, scheduled and branded world of playdates and activity camps. Hillsborough fired the starting pistol on the race to demonise the working class whose finishing line is austerity \u2013 an economic policy that is itself a kind of cover-up. Coverage of the disaster played a crucial role in the cementing of the country-supper chumocracy that runs Britain. It\u2019s a nightmarish irony, says Tempany, that the person who was ultimately responsible for \u201cThe Truth\u201d headline [in the Sun four days later] is the person who gained the most from the game that was created by the Taylor report. His forensic account of the way Murdoch was able to use football as a battering ram on the gates of propriety and regulation reads like a le Carr\u00e9 thriller. The mutually parasitic relationship between police, politicians and the media, which we saw briefly exposed at the Leveson inquiry, has its roots in that headline. The dishonouring\u00a0of the dead \u2013 whether of the 96 or Milly Dowler \u2013 is its hazing ritual. When Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt refreshed the Hillsborough libel with their \u201cblunders\u201d (as Hunt did when he was sports minister), they were publicly embarrassed but Murdoch benefited and Hunt and Johnson are still in power.    For survivors things were more complicated. Not only had they seen terrible things, they had been blamed for them    When the findings of the independent panel were unveiled in the Lady Chapel of Liverpool\u2019s Anglican Cathedral in 2012, it felt like the big revelation was that we had been living in a dystopia. But Tempany doesn\u2019t leave things there. If this is bad, he says, what would good look like? He travels to Germany to look at how the Bundesliga clubs have managed to create World Cup-winning football while maintaining their connection with fans and communities. He interviews Paul Cooper \u2013 the founder of Give Us Back Our Game, a campaign that persuaded the FA to support less structured, more joyful football for children. He celebrates the moral victories that fans have won \u2013 in protesting against ticket prices, or clubs relocating to ridiculous but lucrative locations (Wimbledon\u2019s proposed move to Dublin, for instance) or the notorious attempt to pimp the league through \u201cGame 39\u201d. The first time I read the book I came away surprised and energised by its optimism. That was in March 2014 when it was about to be published in time for the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough. Like many of the commemorations it was put on hold until the inquests were over. Tempany has added a final chapter taking us through those inquests. If like me you thought they were a way of formalising\u00a0what everyone already knew, then this chapter makes shocking reading and gives the book a new urgency. From where the victims were sitting, the inquests were a close-run and painful thing. South Yorkshire officers strolled in from their golf-themed retirements and trotted out the old lies, apparently oblivious to the hurt they were causing, the public money they were wasting, or the disrepute into which they were dragging their colleagues. A toxic compound of slovenliness and malice, they talk like Satan\u2019s Keystone Kops. Four pages in this chapter are worth the price of the whole book. They are Brenda Campbell\u2019s QC cross-questioning of a sergeant who was on duty at the Leppings Lane end. It\u2019s hard to know whether he is delusional or consciously clinging to a lie but if it weren\u2019t for the context these pages would be a comedy classic, and they serve as a reminder that the impetus of the campaign must not be dissipated in the emotional release \u2013 after so many years \u2013 of the verdict. As Andy Burnham points out, it is time to end the scandal of corrupt police officers avoiding prosecution through early retirement. There is work to be done. But there are people who can do it. The verdicts were a victory for the jury system \u2013 for the right thinking of ordinary men and women who did not buckle under pressure, the kind of people who carried the injured and the dying on that day in April, the kind of people who campaigned with dignity and patience for justice, the kind of people who deserve better and can do better.

But prosecutors concluded he had been in contact with countries that detained Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi in 2004 as they were transferred back to Colonel Gadaffi\u2019s Libya and had \u201csought political authority for some of his actions\u201d. Following a four-year investigation by Scotland Yard, which gathered nearly 30,000 pages of evidences, the CPS has confirmed that it did not believe there were grounds for launching legal action against \u201cthe suspect\u201d described only as a public official.  Sue Hemming, the head of the CPS\u2019s special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: \u201cFollowing a thorough investigation, the CPS has decided that there is insufficient evidence to charge the suspect with any criminal offence. \u201cWe made our decision based upon all the available admissible evidence and after weighing up all of the information we have been provided with.\u201d  There had been speculation that the former foreign secretary Jack Straw could face charges. That prospect now seems to have disappeared. Belhaj, a Libyan, and his wife, Fatima Bouchar, were abducted and flown by the CIA from Bangkok to president Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s interrogation and torture cells in Tripoli. Saadi, who was forced on to a plane in Hong Kong, spent six years in jail. Both Belhaj and Saadi say they were frequently tortured. Saadi\u2019s wife and four children \u2013 the youngest being a six-year-old girl \u2013 were also rendered and imprisoned. Evidence of MI6 involvement in the Libyans\u2019 ordeal emerged in correspondence with Allen that was found inside the abandoned office of Moussa Koussa, Gaddafi\u2019s foreign minister and former intelligence chief, after the regime fell. A CPS statement said: \u201cIn what has been a thorough and painstaking investigation, evidence and information was obtained from a large number of records, individuals and organisations including the Secret Intelligence Service [MI6], the Security Service [MI5], other government departments and authorities in other countries.  \u201cEvidence was also taken from alleged victims and other witnesses during the course of this four-year investigation.\u201d The CPS concluded: \u201cOfficials from the UK did not physically detain, transfer or ill-treat the alleged victims directly, nor did the suspect have any connection to the initial physical detention of either man or their families.\u201d   Related: MI6 gets off scot-free over rendition of suspected Islamists to Libya    But, the statement added: \u201cFollowing careful review, the CPS has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support the contention that the suspect had been in communication with individuals from the foreign countries responsible for the detention and transfer of the Belhaj and Al-Saadi families; disclosed aspects of what was occurring to others within this country; and sought political authority for some of his actions albeit not within a formal written process nor in detail which covered all his communications and conduct.\u201d There was no reference to section 7 of the 1994 Intelligence Services Act, sometimes described as the \u201cJames Bond clause\u201d, which protects MI6 officers from prosecution for actions anywhere in the world that would otherwise be illegal. That protection would only be available as long as their actions were authorised in writing by the secretary of state.

Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters    Under the victims\u2019 right to review scheme, Belhaj and Saadi have already indicated through their lawyers that they will challenge the CPS\u2019s decision not to bring charges. If that fails to reverse the outcome, they could subsequently initiate judicial review of the process. Westminster\u2019s intelligence and security committee confirmed it would continue to investigate the two rendition operations. Chair Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, said: \u201cThe ISC will be examining this case as part of our current inquiry in relation to detainee treatment and rendition. I cannot pre-judge the outcome of our investigation: this is a wide-ranging and detailed inquiry and I expect it to continue for some time.\u201d Responding to the CPS decision, Cori Crider, a lawyer from the human rights organisation Reprieve who represented the two families, said: \u201cWith today\u2019s official acknowledgement that British officials were involved in this rendition, the fig leaf of official secrecy in this case is in tatters. There is one crucial question: who knew who was on those planes, and for those who knew, what possible reason can there be for them to evade justice?    Related: Public need answers in 'shocking' MI6 rendition scandal, says senior Tory    \u201cTop British officials helped abduct a pregnant woman and four children, and so far we have no apology, no explanation, and now no one held responsible. Sir Mark Allen took credit, in writing, for the operation. Jack Straw, we are told, signed it off. The head of MI5 was so incensed about all this she wrote to Tony Blair at the time.  \u201cStrangely, the CPS\u2019s attitude to all this is \u2018see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil\u2019. It is hard to escape the conclusion that this decision has a great deal to do with political power and very little to do with the rule of law. While these families have been denied justice at every turn, we are determined to keep fighting for it.\u201d Belhaj\u2019s wife, Fatima Bouchar, told the BBC about her rendition in 2004: \u201cI was six months pregnant. I was so scared that I was going to die.\u201d  Belhaj said: \u201cI am very disappointed that individuals responsible will not be prosecuted. If there is political interference with the courts then it undermines British justice.\u201d  The Metropolitan police issued a separate statement saying that its investigation, known as Operation Lydd, had been \u201cthorough and penetrating\u201d and \u201cconducted without fear or favour\u201d over a two-and-a-half year period, resulting in a 28,000-page file of evidence being handed to the CPS.  It added that the decision to not prosecute Allen was entirely a matter for the CPS. Privately, however, some at the Yard have expressed their anger at the decision, believing they had built a powerful case, in particular over the second of the two rendition operations, in which Saadi and his wife and children were abducted and flown to Tripoli. Andrew Tyrie, the prominent backbench Tory MP who has campaigned for several years for a thorough investigation into the UK\u2019s involvement in extraordinary rendition, said the ISC must now get to the bottom of what happened. \u201cThe public need to be assured that the scope and limits of British involvement in kidnap and torture have been fully investigated. \u201cThey cannot yet have that confidence. Failure to get to the truth would almost certainly result in a drip-drip of further revelations. These could tarnish Britain\u2019s reputation far more than the shorter term impact of an inquiry \u2013 preferably judge-led \u2013 which gets to the truth.\u201d Sonya Sceats, the policy and advocacy director at charity Freedom from Torture, said: \u201cThe full truth about British complicity in torture still has to be smoked out, even if this will not happen in a criminal court. The gravity of the issues and legal obligation for a human rights-compliant process mean that David Cameron must make good on his promise to hold a judge-led inquiry. \u201cBy taking this step, the prime minister can start to repair the damage done to the UK\u2019s reputation, support those working inside the intelligence services to prevent further British involvement in torture, and deliver justice for the survivors who endured unspeakable brutality at the hands of our security partners in Libya and elsewhere.\u201d  Amnesty International UK\u2019s legal programme director, Rachel Logan, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision underscores the need for an independent inquiry that is thorough, effective, and can get to the bottom of the grave allegations of UK involvement in rendition and torture. \u201cThe police investigations were narrow in scope \u2013 focused on whether they felt there was a realistic prospect of convicting an identified individual, to the criminal standard of proof, in these cases; the need properly to investigate the UK\u2019s responsibility for violations of its human rights obligations in relation to these matters remains.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-06-09T14:57:47Z", "tags": ["MI6", "Abdel Hakim Belhaj", "Libya", "Rendition", "Crown Prosecution Service", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "Africa", "Middle East and North Africa", "UK news", "World news", "CIA", "Law"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/mi6-officers-not-charges-rendition-of-libyan-families-abdel-hakim-belhaj", "title": "Ex-MI6 officer will not face charges over Libyan renditions", "sentences": ["Belhaj, a Libyan, and his wife, Fatima Bouchar, were abducted and flown by the CIA from Bangkok to president Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s interrogation and torture cells in Tripoli."]}, {"article": "Born in 1940, I was raised in Paris. My father, an Armenian born in Istanbul, Turkey, went to a French school in Alexandria, Egypt, and immigrated to France in 1935. After marrying my mother, a Parisian, and being badly injured in the second world war, he worked as a jeweler-diamond dealer with a keen eye for real estate \u2013 buying and renovating small inns, restaurants and houses.    Related: Tell us how you got here: share your stories of immigration    My parents were very pro-American. I still remember when my hometown was liberated and Mother and I walked on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. I always wished to visit America but my father, who was very strict, was against it. At the time, I had a full-time job in an international music publishing company off the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, translating English lyrics to French. This gave me the opportunity to meet artists such as Edith Piaf. Even though it was a glamorous job, I still longed for travel and adventure (and to get away from my strict father). Armenian friends in Los Angeles agreed to sponsor me, and within one month I had obtained a visa and, later, a green card. In Paris, I had bought a Greyhound package giving me unlimited travel for three months. I travelled to 30 US states before settling in San Francisco in the fall of 1961. I was excited to go and listen to jazz in San Francisco. I found a job downtown, making less there than I had in Paris. Still, I loved the work and the people there. I also did some hair modelling for Clairol. People who heard my French accent asked: \u201cDid you come with one of our GIs?\u201d I was pleased to tell them no, I had come alone, using my own money.  In June 1967, I was married. On our honeymoon, we attended the Monterey International Pop Festival. My husband knew Janis Joplin and members of the Big Brother and Holding Company, who they were performing there. After the summer of 1967, the San Francisco mood began to change and by 1969 many of our friends were leaving, some on a bus to Tennessee to start a commune.    Related: Before I left Damascus I wondered: 'Trenton, New Jersey ... what is that?' | Abel Korkor    Our first daughter was born in late 1969 and at this time my husband decided to go back east to finish his studies. In 1972 he obtained a master\u2019s degree in environmental planning from the University of Pennsylvania. The then Georgia governor, Jimmy Carter, offered him a position in his natural resources department and we moved to Georgia. We had a second daughter, and I worked at several jobs, mostly as a translator, to have funds for regular trips to Paris. In 1982, a large corporation, Lockheed Martin, offered me a position. About 60 Algerian air force trainees had come to learn English and C-130 aircraft maintenance. As a customer liaison officer, I spoke French with them. I was like their big sister, taking them to doctors, making sure their stay in America went smoothly. Over time, we had trainees from Kuwait, Egypt, Dubai, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, China, Ethiopia, etc. Some stayed a week and others stayed a couple of years.  It was another glamorous job, but it was demanding since I needed to be on call 24/7 in case of an emergency (and there were several!). I wrote reports on the trainees\u2019 countries so my colleagues at Lockheed would be familiar with their culture. I also took the trainees on little trips and explained American culture.  After 26 years in my company, I decided to retire knowing that I would miss the international connections. During those 26 years, I had traveled, paying my own way to many of my trainees\u2019 cities, such as Addis Ababa, Dubai, Algiers, Tunis, Singapore, Dakar, Pisa, Bangkok, Jakarta, Libreville (Gabon) and more. Many of our trainees were Muslims and were enthusiastic students, always very respectful of me, so it saddens me to hear all the anti-Muslim rhetoric these days in the US.

On a crisp, sunny evening at Queen\u2019s, Ivan Lendl lifted the gloom as only he can, chin still stuck to his upturned palm, stare fixed and silent wisdom fairly pouring out of him, as Andy Murray resumed a winning partnership with the coach he has trusted more than any of the 10 he has had in 11 years on the Tour. Murray has learned plenty from all of them but none brought the authority Lendl delivered in the two-and-a-bit years they shared when the Scot won two slams and an Olympic gold medal. They split in March 2014, and got back together again when Lendl texted Murray on Saturday from his home in Florida \u2013 or was he on the golf course? \u2013 to confirm he could spare up to 20 weeks a year for him.   Related: Novak Djokovic beats Andy Murray to claim first French Open title    On Tuesday at Queen\u2019s the prize was not a major but a first-round win over Nicolas Mahut, not exactly Novak Djokovic in a slam final, and it was a mixed but encouraging resumption of business. It took the world No2 an hour and 50 minutes to beat the 34-year-old world No51 7-6, 7-6. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him back as part of the team,\u201d Murray said later. \u201cWhen we were chatting before the match, it didn\u2019t feel strange. It felt like it did before.\u201d He cavilled slightly when asked if he could \u201chit the ground running\u201d with Lendl after two years. \u201cI expect Ivan to have a positive impact on me and my whole team. Whether that happens in three days or a few months, I have no idea. But I trust and believe in what he says, and that can obviously help immediately. \u201cBut ultimately it\u2019s up to me to perform on the court. That\u2019s why I put a lot of time and effort into preparation for the major events, and I will practise hard next week with Jamie [Delgado] and Ivan, and hopefully that puts me in a good position for Wimbledon. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like I\u2019m coming in having been garbage the last few months. I have been playing well. I expect to keep that going.\u201d Just as Lendl had resumed his familiar pose, so Murray carried on as of old. He said beforehand he did not recall his on-court demeanour being much different when with Lendl than what it was during his two years with Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, who quit in April, citing his temper as one of the factors in her decision. The memory can play a lot of tricks, on observers and participants. Here, Murray nearly collected the umpire\u2019s chair hunting down a drop shot in the first set, indulged in a bit of muttering then had a frank exchange of views with the umpire, Fergus Murphy, who refused to agree with him halfway through the second set, with the sun shining, that the court was too slippery for their safety \u2013 two weeks before Wimbledon. Both had a point. Mahut was a good opponent, almost the perfect test, an accomplished, experienced grass-courter coming off an uplifting defence of his title in \u2019s-Hertogenbosch against Gilles M\u00fcller. Dropping serve in the fifth game was a jolt for Murray against an opponent who beat him here in three tight sets in the first round four years ago \u2013 his only win now in six encounters. Two double faults from 40-15 up in the next game interrupted Mahut\u2019s excellent opening service barrage and, although it took him three break points to hit back, Murray levelled. In a tense tie-break, Mahut handed him the set when he netted a forehand. Lendl tugged down his white baseball cap, fiddled with his sunglasses and retreated for \u2026 a cup of tea? There was a mildly surprising scene on his return: Lendl laughing volubly with Murray\u2019s full-time coaching director, Delgado, who plainly has a good sense of humour. There was plenty to smile about, and a few moments of concern. Mahut went 3-1 up in the second. Would he crack again? Yes, but not without a fight. Murray won three games in a row to get back to five-all and the Frenchman was visibly rattled. Murray hit an irresistible vein of minor genius then a string of howlers, and had to save three set points on his serve to force a second tie-break. It might have been an ugly finish, Mahut taking a nasty tumble at 0-3 when his right ankle collapsed under him as he tiptoed across the greasy grass, but he stuck it out to the end, Murray sealing it with a chip and a simple tapped volley into an open court. It had appeared when the draw was made that Murray was set for a five-course French feast here, selected from Mahut, Beno\u00eet Paire, Paul-Henri Mathieu, Gilles Simon and Richard Gasquet \u2013 but the menu has changed a little. In fading light, Aljaz Bedene beat Paire after an absorbing contest, 6-7 (6-7), 7-6 (7-6), 6-4 that took two-and-a-half hours. So, for the first time since he lost to Tim Henman in Bangkok nearly 10 years ago, Murray will play a fellow British player in a Tour level match. As he said afterwards: \u201cThat\u2019s amazing really. I don\u2019t know what to say about that \u2013 but, yeah, it\u2019s been a long time.\u201d Rain has forced Mathieu\u2019s match against Dan Evans and Simon\u2019s against Kyle Edmund into Wednesday\u2019s schedule, as tournament organisers continue to eye the skies nervously. Gasquet, who looked sensational for a set and a half against Murray in the quarter-finals of the French Open and was booked for a third-round encounter here with him, lost on Monday evening to the unseeded American Steve Johnson. At the bottom end of the draw, second seed Stan Wawrinka \u2013 whom Murray drained to the point of exhaustion in the French Open semi-finals \u2013 looked more resigned than shattered when Fernando Verdasco\u2019s final forehand clipped the line in the second-set tie-break to give them both an early night, and the Swiss a chance for some extra rest before Wimbledon. The Spanish left-hander played some inspired tennis towards the end to win 6-2, 7-6 in just under an hour and a half. \u201cI think I played a pretty good match,\u201d said Verdasco, who had to overcome six double faults but generally served well on the slick grass. The heavy, wet air and soft ground underfoot could yet be a factor in the tournament, as Wawrinka testified. \u201cThe conditions are difficult for everybody after a few days of rain,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried today with what I had, but I need more time to get my level there.

That was the liberal sweetener in the \u201cexpert panel\u201d report of 2012, a document that endorsed the deterrent of offshore processing. Duly fortified against her left flank (one of the \u201cexperts\u201d was Paris Aristotle, a well-respected \u201crefugee advocate\u201d), then prime minister Julia Gillard declared her government would \u201cmove urgently to restart offshore processing on Manus Island and Nauru\u201d. Last week, the Papua New Guinea police opened fire with automatic weapons on university students marching against corruption. That shocking manifestation of overt authoritarianism by Australia\u2019s key partner in offshore detention provides a glimpse of what refugee politics has meant for the region four years down the track. In July 2013, PNG\u2019s prime minister, Peter O\u2019Neill, stood next to Kevin Rudd in Brisbane as the Australian government announced its so-called PNG Solution. Henceforth, Rudd explained, asylum seekers would not only be processed on Manus Island, they would also (if assessed as refugees) be settled in PNG.   Related: Australian election 2016: Bill Shorten accuses NBN chief of 'shameful breach' \u2013 politics live    According to the PNG supreme court, the deal was, right from the start, entirely unconstitutional. Nowhere else in the world, said PNG MP Belden Namah, would a politician have \u201camended the constitution to accommodate another foreign country\u2019s domestic policy interest.\u201d But, of course, few other countries in the world (other than Nauru, of which more later) relate to Australia in the way that PNG does. PNG was once an Australian colony \u2013 \u201cone of the last places in the world where white settler colonialism was advocated as colonial policy,\u201d as John Connell explains in his Papua New Guinea: The Struggle for Development. Self-government came in 1973 and independence in 1975. The relative lateness of the process left PNG with particularly acute versions of the ills endemic in post-colonial societies, including widespread poverty, economic underdevelopment, weak civil institutions and an ongoing dependence on the former colonial power. The \u201cPNG Solution\u201d was made possible by those problems, even as it worsens them. In its report for 2015, Human Rights Watch lists the financial inducements offered by the Australian government to make the Manus Island deal happen.  \u201cAustralia remains [PNG]\u2019s most important international partner,\u201d it explains, \u201cproviding an estimated US$460m in development assistance for 2013-2014. Australia provided an additional $556.7m this financial year to support the Manus Island detention center.\u201d    Jason Sharman has warned that Canberra has privileged the ... detention centre over the fight against corruption    But O\u2019Neill also possessed his own reasons for signing up. In 2011, the PNG supreme court ordered him to stand down in favour of Michael Somare, an order with which he simply refused to comply. The agreement with Australia, the regional power, thus provided him with international legitimacy. By promising to deliver refugee resettlement (a plan that was, right from the outset, unpopular in PNG, O\u2019Neill made himself indispensible to Canberra, on the basis of the \u201che-might-be-a-son-of-a-bitch-but-he\u2019s-our-son-of-a-bitch\u201d principle so beloved of US presidents).  There was no secret about what that meant. A few days after shaking Rudd\u2019s hand, O\u2019Neill boasted that he\u2019d achieved what he called \u201ca realignment\u201d of Australian aid in PNG.  Since then, Professor Jason Sharman, a money laundering expert at Griffith University, has repeatedly warned that Canberra has privileged the maintenance of the detention centre over the fight against corruption. \u201cThe government sends signals,\u201d he told the Guardian, \u201coften reflecting media attention, as to what it wants investigated. Various people have flagged PNG corruption proceeds in Australia as a problem, not least elements of the PNG government and law enforcement as well as the AFP and Austrac, but the Australian government under both Labor and the Coalition has chosen not to investigate, and recently Manus has been a big reason for inaction.\u201d That\u2019s the backdrop to the recent student protests. Two years ago, anti-corruption police issued a warrant to arrest the prime minister over a million-dollar fraud involving the company Paraka Lawyers. O\u2019Neill responded by disbanding the corruption taskforce and installing his own handpicked police chief. The student demonstration was part of an anti-corruption campaign, seeking to force O\u2019Neill to comply with basic democratic principles. But the vicious brutality of the PNG police has a context, too \u2013 and, again, the links to Australia are telling. The Manus Island deal entailed a contingent of Australian Federal Police officers training the Royal PNG Constabulary (RPNGC). In late 2015, an AFP whistleblower told the ABC that the Australian government was turning a blind eye to the corruption and police involvement in extra-judicial killings, for fear that the detention centre might be closed. \u201cThe RPNGC were essentially murdering people, raping people, burning villages down,\u201d he said. He\u2019d seen local police commit horrific crimes, he explained, but his reports had been ignored by his superiors. \u201cWhat we soon noticed was that anything that painted the government of PNG with corruption, or the RPNGC with their brutality, murder and rape was being sanitised,\u201d he said. The AFP said it had reviewed reports from the officer and hadn\u2019t found any matters requiring further action. It\u2019s not simply that successive Australian governments, keen to keep the Manus deal alive, do not want to antagonise the PNG government. It\u2019s worse than that. In the final analysis, the Australian facility on Manus Island relies on coercion to keep asylum seekers detained. That\u2019s why, ever since it opened, it has built a relationship with the most notorious of the PNG police units. In 2013, for instance, Rory Callinan reported:   Papua New Guinea\u2019s most thuggish paramilitary police unit \u2013 allegedly responsible for rapes, murders and other serious human rights abuses \u2013 is being discreetly funded by the Australian Immigration Department to secure the Manus Island asylum seeker detention centre. The \u2018Mobile Squad\u2019 officers, who just last month beat a local man to death on the island, are receiving a special living-away allowance of about $100 a day from funding provided by the department.  In February 2014, when detainees began to protest, the Mobile Squad played an important role in quelling the demonstration. As Human Rights Watch explains:  During the incident, many detainees sustained injuries and one detainee was beaten to death. Police allegedly entered firing their guns when violence broke out inside the facility.   This is not an anomaly. Rather, it\u2019s an illustration of how an Australian program that\u2019s only possible because of the weaknesses of a post-colonial society continues to exacerbate those weaknesses. Think, for instance, of the secrecy endemic in the refugee policy. On Tuesday, Mathias Cormann boasted that barring journalists from the detention centres was a necessary element of the program\u2019s success. What effect does that have on a country like PNG where, as Freedom House says, press freedom has been eroding in recent years? Or what about the rule of the law? After the supreme court ruled the detention centre to be illegal, O\u2019Neill agreed that it should be closed \u2013 a welcome adherence to the separation of powers by a politician with a dubious record of obeying such rulings. But, as Daniel Flitton recently wrote, \u201cthe Turnbull government looks to have persuaded PNG to keep the camp open until after the Australian election\u201d. In other words, in the context of the struggle taking place between students risking their lives to uphold democratic principles and a regime willing to flout the courts, the Turnbull government has \u2026 \u201cpersuaded\u201d PNG to delay implementation of a supreme court ruling.  After the shootings in Port Moresby, the detainees on Manus Island penned an open letter to pro-democracy activists. They said.   We are very aware of the corruption issues in PNG. Billions of dollars have been given to the PNG government by Australia to run the Manus detention centre. That money has not been used for the people of Manus or PNG, but has been used to deny our liberty and keep refugees illegally imprisoned. We have a common fight against corrupt government in PNG and Australia, and a common fight for freedom from tyranny.  But that commonality could be extended further, for the parallels between what\u2019s happening in PNG and what\u2019s happening in Nauru are striking. In the same way as Rudd\u2019s \u201cPNG Solution\u201d depended on (and then aggravated) the weaknesses of post-colonial PNG, John Howard\u2019s \u201cPacific Solution\u201d targeted Nauru as a former Australian colony, independent only since 1968. Nic Maclellan has written at length of the damage the detention centre\u2019s arrival wreaked on an already impoverished society. He writes:   An influx of Australian officials into government positions in Nauru has been accompanied by a neoliberal agenda of privatisation. This has shifted the burden for government failure onto the Nauruan community, even as hundreds of millions of dollars are splurged on Australian companies that manage the detention camps. Over more than a decade, these policies have transformed Nauru\u2019s financial status, increasing its dependency on Australian aid.\u201d  Today, Nauru is a dysfunctional, authoritarian state. Since 2013, the government removed key members of the judiciary and then banned them from re-entering the country. Last year, the criminal code was amended to make expressions of \u201cpolitical hatred\u201d \u2013 a term so nebulous as to include almost anything to which the government objects \u2013 a crime punishable by seven years jail. According to Stewart Firth from the ANU, \u201cJustice Minister David Adeang \u2026 has seized the opportunity created by Australia\u2019s dependence on his country to amass power and suppress dissent, secure in the knowledge that Canberra will offer little criticism.\u201d Again, though, one might go further. Canberra is not simply turning a blind eye: by prioritising the detention centre, it\u2019s actively pushing Nauru away from democracy. Conscious of the Australian government\u2019s hostility to journalists investigating its offshore camps, the Nauru regime now levels hugely expensive visas on journalists seeking to visit (a fee of US$5,000, non-refundable if the request\u2019s denied \u2013 which it often is).    Related: Cruelty to asylum seekers dressed up as compassion is the scandal that bedevils Australia | Antony Loewenstein    The policy\u2019s obviously driven by Australian priorities but it has equally obvious consequences for domestic politics on the island. The same might be said of Nauru\u2019s ban on Facebook: on the one hand, a sop to the Australian government (which loathes detainees communicating with activists); on the other, a way of inhibiting opposition activity within Nauru itself. Because of the detention centres, the effects of Australian refugee policy are most evident on PNG and Nauru. But the ramifications are also visible in less dramatic form elsewhere. As Phil Robertson from Human Rights Watch argues:  Australia is rarely pushing for rights-respecting solutions these days \u2013 and more than that, is too often part of the problem. Politicians trapped in the refugee policy dialogue in Canberra frequently fail to recognise that Australia\u2019s boat push-back policies, and offshoring asylum seekers into abusive conditions of detention in Nauru and on Manus Island, are seen as a green-light by Asian governments to do the same \u2026  By soliciting governments to help stop boats, Australia also ends up looking the other way on other rights abuses. By cooperating with Australia to take back boats of their nationals, both Sri Lanka and Vietnam know they could count on Australia not to publicly raise concerns about the rights abuses that drove those people into the boats in the first place.  Push backs by other countries are also met with silent acquiescence from Canberra. Australia said nothing when Thailand sent back 109 ethnic Uighurs in July to China to face torture in custody and long prison terms, and has kept silent as Beijing pursues its dissidents in Bangkok. China arrests and sends fleeing North Koreans back to the brutal regime of dictator Kim Jong-Un, and is met by deafening silence from down under.

But Murray, who needed some of his most inventive tennis on Thursday to see off the second-best player in the country, Aljaz Bedene, in two tight sets \u2013 his first match against a compatriot since Henman beat him in Bangkok at the start of his career in 2006 \u2013 was not getting carried away. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect just now, but it\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s progress. So you have to be happy with that.\u201d Edmund was gifted a walkover in the Aegon Championships when the Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu withdrew with a wrist injury on Thursday, and he will be well up for his first match against Murray, who has become a friend and mentor. \u201cIn Miami we have been to some basketball games or had days off [from training at Murray\u2019s winter-block HQ] and done stuff as a team together,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s let me stay in his apartment, and we hung out and chatted. \u201cHe\u2019s been the biggest inspiration for players my age, the guy we\u2019ve looked up to. Andy has had all the pressure, all the expectations, and he\u2019s dealt with it very, very well.\u201d Murray recalled his first big match against Henman in Basel in 2005 and pointed out playing someone you admire can be an emotional moment. \u201cIt felt very strange in comparison to when I played other guys, because Tim was someone that I looked up to when I was growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cI always had watched him play on the TV, probably more than any other player. \u201cWhen you\u2019re standing in a competition on the opposite side of the net to them, it\u2019s a little bit surreal. I was up, I think, 6-2, 5-3, and then, coming to serve for the match, I felt nervous. It was a big moment for me at that time. Thankfully, I ended up winning the match, but it definitely feels different.\u201d Murray is, by a distance, still the best player the country has had since Fred Perry in the 30s (or ever), and he built on his excellent clay-court form on Thursday to beat Bedene 6-3, 6-4 in an hour and 23 minutes on his favoured grass. He is in solid shape for Wimbledon, which starts on Monday week \u2013 as are Bedene, ranked 58 in the world, and Edmund, who is at 85. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to say how good someone can be, or how high they\u2019re going to get,\u201d Murray said. \u201c[Bedene] has a good serve, he has a nice forehand, he\u2019s quick. I don\u2019t think he moves his best on grass, but he\u2019s still fast. It\u2019s difficult to say, but he\u2019ll get better. I don\u2019t think 58 will be his best ranking.\u201d As for Edmund, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not with Kyle day-in, day-out. But the time that I have spent with him, he\u2019s very professional, he loves tennis, he\u2019s very focused on his career. The last 18 months or so he\u2019s made big improvements, won a number of Challengers and is winning matches consistently on the Tour on all of the surfaces. There\u2019s no reason why he\u00a0can\u2019t get himself up into the top 20, top 30 in the world, and from there you never know.\u201d Murray, meanwhile, is hoping to win a record fifth title here \u2013 one more than that proven great Roy Emerson, who has been at the Queen\u2019s Club this week and who should act as inspiration for this generation. Emerson was 31 when he turned professional and secured a total of 12 grand slam singles titles in his career. Murray is 29 and has two slams to his name, as well as every hi-tech aid available \u2013 and the renewed advice of Ivan Lendl. If they can combine in their mission to undermine the most dominant No1 of the age, Novak Djokovic, he has a chance of adding to those majors. The winner of the match on Friday plays either the unseeded American Steve Johnson or the No5 seed Marin Cilic. On the other side of the draw Gilles M\u00fcller, who was guided by Murray\u2019s year-round coach, Jamie Delgado, saved 10 match points to beat John Isner (whose penchant for long tie-breaks knows no bounds), 3-6, 7-6 (16), 7-6 (7). The match featured an appalling call against the American in the second set that inspired a championship standard rant. M\u00fcller, who lost against Nicolas Mahut (Isner\u2019s famous Wimbledon long-match cohort in 2010) at the Ricoh Open final in the Netherlands on Monday, will play Bernard Tomic, who beat Fernando Verdasco 6-7 (2), 6-4, 6-4.

It is something about which a London cabbie, an Uber driver and I can all agree. But there is a catch. America has gone further towards coming clean about its torture programme than the UK government has about its role in the same. Obama\u2019s administration \u2013 despite his original pledge to \u201clook forward, not backwards\u201d on torture \u2013 has declassified hundreds of pages detailing what the CIA did to its captives, in response to freedom of information requests and after the Senate\u2019s seminal torture report.

The diapers are used for sanitary reasons during transportations, and as a means to humiliate the prisoner \u2026 the prisoner\u2019s hands are shackled together as are his feet. Then a short chain is used to shackle the hands to the feet. This keeps a prisoner\u2019s hand shackled within several inches of his feet.

This CIA memo (though taken from a different facility) largely echoes how my client Fatima Bouchar was treated when, several months pregnant, she passed through a CIA blacksite in Bangkok, before her arrival in the dungeons of Muammar Gaddafi in 2004. British spies were heavily involved in her rendition, colluding with the CIA to abduct two families \u2013 Abdul-Hakim Belhaj, his wife Fatima, and Sami al-Saadi, his wife, and their four children \u2013 and deliver them to Gaddafi\u2019s Libya. Both Sami and Abdul-Hakim were cruelly tortured. After her abuse in the blacksite and on the flight to Libya, Fatima gave birth to a 4lb (1.8kg) baby. We know about the UK\u2019s involvement not through transparency at the mother of all parliaments, but because when Gaddafi\u2019s regime was toppled his spy offices were forced open, and MI6 faxes fluttered like confetti around Tripoli. These documents would never have seen the light of day in Britain. Unlike in the US, where CIA files can be accessed under the Freedom of Information Act, UK law provides a blanket exemption for security service material. There is no public interest test, and there is no time limit. MI6 files remain secret. The exception \u2013 and our best shot at a public reckoning \u2013 was a judge-led public inquiry into torture. David Cameron promised one during his 2010 election campaign, but has punted the inquiry into the secretive intelligence and security committee. This is the flawed parliamentary \u201coversight\u201d body that dozed at the wheel on rendition, and which refuses to offer the slightest detail of its work. Cameron\u2019s lawyers have also obstructed moves for a civil trial. And just this month, the Crown Prosecution Service said that a 28,000-page dossier from the police is \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to charge the British official most involved \u2013 MI6\u2019s former director of counterterrorism, Sir Mark Allen. Among the papers found in Libya was a fawning message from Allen to Gaddafi\u2019s fearsome spy chief, Moussa Koussa, congratulating him on the \u201csafe arrival\u201d of the \u201cair cargo\u201d and boasting how the \u201cintelligence on [Belhaj and his wife] \u2026 was British\u201d. While my clients were being tortured in Libya, Allen moved from MI6 to oil firm BP, which went on to win lucrative contracts after Tony Blair\u2019s deal in the desert with Gaddafi. Jack Straw, foreign secretary at the time of the renditions, accused citizens concerned about Britain\u2019s involvement in rendition of indulging in \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d. When the Tripoli files broke, Straw shrugged, saying he could hardly know what his spies got up to all the time. Yet this month we learned that none other than Lady Eliza Manningham-Buller, the head of MI5, wrote to Tony Blair to protest these abductions and chucked several MI6 staff out of Thames House.

Yet one of its major environmental threats lies underground: Beijing is sinking. Excessive pumping of groundwater is causing the geology under the city to collapse, according to a new study using satellite imagery that reveals parts of Beijing \u2013 particularly its central business district \u2013 are subsiding each year by as much as 11 centimetres, or more than four inches. The authors of the study warn that continued subsidence poses a safety threat to the city of more than 2o million, with \u201ca strong impact on train operations\u201d one of the predictions. The study on Beijing\u2019s subsidence has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Remote Sensing and is based on InSAR, a type of radar that monitors land elevation changes. It was written by a team of seven researchers, including three who explained their findings to the Guardian: Chinese academics Chen Mi [Capital Normal University, China] and Li Zhenhong [Newcastle University, UK], and Spanish engineer Roberto Tomas [University of Alicante, Spain]. \u201cWe are currently carrying out a detailed analysis of the impacts of subsidence on critical infrastructure (eg high-speed railways) in the Beijing plain,\u201d they said in an email to the Guardian. \u201cHopefully a paper summarising our findings will come out later this year.\u201d Beijing sits in a dry plain where groundwater has accumulated over millennia. As wells are drilled and the water table drops, the underlying soil compacts, much like a dried-out sponge. The study finds that the entire city is sinking but the subsidence is most pronounced in Beijing\u2019s Chaoyang district, which has boomed since 1990 with skyscrapers, ringroads and other development. The researchers say the uneven nature of the subsidence in some areas poses risks to buildings and other infrastructure. Tens of thousands of water wells are thought to exist in and around Beijing, many of them used in farming and landscaping. The state has regulatory power over installation of wells but is inconsistent in applying it, according to one leading Chinese environmentalist. \u201cThere are some rules but the enforcement is doubtful,\u201d said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing. Ma said he wasn\u2019t surprised subsidence was relatively high in the Chaoyang district given its rapid growth of recent decades. He expected it to keep moving east as the city sprawled in that direction. In 2015 China inaugurated a mega-engineering project aimed at mitigating Beijing\u2019s water crisis. The state completed construction of the South-North Water Diversion, a \u00a348bn, 2,400km network of canals and tunnels, designed to divert 44.8bn cubic metres of water to the capital. Even before the canal began delivering water, Beijing was easing up on some groundwater pumping. In January of 2015 the Chaoyang district announced plans to phase out 367 water wells, reducing the use of 10m cubic meters of underground water. Experts say it is still too early to know if the canal\u2019s water deliveries will help recharge the aquifer and slow Beijing\u2019s rate of subsidence. In the meantime concerns about impacts to buildings and rail systems continue. To prevent derailments a 2015 study recommended that China ban new water wells near completed high-speed rail lines [PDF]. Other cities around the world are experiencing subsidence caused by excessive water pumping or other factors. Mexico City is sinking by up to 28cm a year and Jakarta is subsiding at a similar rate. Bangkok is dropping annually by as much as 12cm, similar to Beijing, according to the Remote Sensing researchers.", "publicationDate": "2016-06-24T00:04:55Z", "tags": ["China", "Satellites", "Water", "Asia Pacific", "Environment", "Science", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/beijing-has-fallen-chinas-capital-sinking-by-11cm-a-year-satellite-study-warns", "title": "Beijing has fallen: China's capital sinking by 11cm a year, satellite study warns", "sentences": ["Bangkok is dropping annually by as much as 12cm, similar to Beijing, according to the Remote Sensing researchers."]}, {"article": " The government has spent at least \u00a3600,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money trying to prevent a civil case being brought against it by a husband and wife who allege that British intelligence was complicit in their detention, rendition and torture. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal the extraordinary lengths to which the government is going to prevent the civil case against it, former home secretary Jack Straw, and former MI6 spy chief Sir Mark Allen coming to court.   Related: Special report: Rendition ordeal that raises new questions about secret trials    The case is being brought on behalf of Abdel Hakim Belhaj, an opponent of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, who were seized in Malaysia and rendered via Bangkok to Libya in 2004 in an operation conducted jointly by MI6, the CIA and Libyan intelligence. Boudchar says she was chained to a wall for five days and subsequently taped to a stretcher for a 17-hour flight, which left her in agony. She was held in a Libyan prison until just before the delivery of her son, who was born weighing just four pounds. On arrival in Libya, Belhaj was imprisoned for six years, during which time he says he was regularly subjected to torture. Their claims are similar to those made by another opponent of Gaddafi, Sami al-Saadi, who alleges that he, his wife Karima and their four children, aged 12, 11, nine and six, were detained in Hong Kong before being rendered to Libya with the full knowledge and help of MI6. Saadi\u2019s eldest daughter, Khadija, has described hearing her mother \u201csaying that we were being taken back to Libya to be executed by Colonel Gaddafi\u201d, and says she \u201cfainted, because I was sure we were going to be killed\u201d. Saadi, like Belhaj, was held for six years and also alleges that he was tortured. The UK\u2019s role in the two rendition operations was revealed in 2011, when faxes from MI6 to Gaddafi\u2019s spy chief, Moussa Koussa, were found following the fall of the regime. The faxes revealed Allen, MI6\u2019s former head of counter-terrorism, discussing the role of UK intelligence in securing the arrival of what he termed the \u201cair cargo\u201d. The Metropolitan police carried out a criminal investigation into the two renditions but the Crown Prosecution Service ruled earlier this month that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to bring charges. The Saadi family received a \u00a32m settlement two years ago. However, Belhaj and Boudchar have pursued a civil court action as they seek an apology. Supporters say the case represents one of the few remaining opportunities they have of exposing the role played by the UK government in rendition.

Photograph: BBC    However, information released under FOI shows that by 10 September last year the government had spent \u00a3355,000 on internal legal advice and \u00a3259,000 on external advice as it sought to have the case dropped. Of this, \u00a327,000 was spent on advice relating to Straw and \u00a3110,000 on advice relating to Allen. The FOI data reveals that the government has been paying as much as \u00a3250 an hour to two senior barristers involved in defending the action. A number of junior barristers have also been charging between \u00a345 and \u00a3120 an hour. Given that the figures are 10 months old, there is speculation that the total cost of fighting the case \u2013 before it even comes near a court \u2013 could be well in excess of \u00a310m. \u201cThe government has wasted over half a million pounds in taxpayers\u2019 money arguing that torture cases shouldn\u2019t get their day in court, simply to spare the blushes of MI6 and the CIA,\u201d said Cori Crider, a lawyer for the victims at international human rights organisation Reprieve. \u201cMeanwhile my clients, Abdel Hakim and Fatima, are prepared to settle for just \u00a33 \u2013 one pound per defendant \u2013 and an apology.\u201d The government argues that the case should not be heard on the grounds that it would involve ruling on the activity of a foreign government. The Supreme Court is currently considering this. The issue of rendition will be thrown into sharp relief on Wednesday when it is the subject of a parliamentary debate. \u201cThe government must use this week\u2019s debate on renditions as a chance to finally come clean over Britain\u2019s involvement in rendition and torture, and apologise to the victims of this shameful practice,\u201d Crider said. \u201cSaying sorry to the women and children that were kidnapped and abused by British intelligence is not only the right thing to do \u2013 it will allow our country to finally move on from this dark chapter in the \u2018war on terror\u2019.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-06-25T23:04:11Z", "tags": ["Jack Straw", "Abdel Hakim Belhaj", "UK news", "World news", "Rendition", "Human rights", "Law", "Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "Politics", "MI6", "UK security and counter-terrorism"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/mi6-600k-legal-bill-block-libyan-couple-rendition-civil-case", "title": "Battle to stop Jack Straw facing Libya rendition charges", "sentences": ["Related: Special report: Rendition ordeal that raises new questions about secret trials    The case is being brought on behalf of Abdel Hakim Belhaj, an opponent of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, who were seized in Malaysia and rendered via Bangkok to Libya in 2004 in an operation conducted jointly by MI6, the CIA and Libyan intelligence."]}, {"article": "On an April morning last year in Los Angeles, Nicolas Winding Refn dropped his daughter at school and walked into a parking lot. He was shooting a new film, but still scouting locations. The lot stood behind Musso and Frank, the Hollywood steakhouse whose regulars once included Steve McQueen. There, he found a young man on the asphalt, bleeding nightmarishly; another man was hunched over him, trying to staunch the blood. With no one else in sight, Refn attempted to help. It was no good. The man died. Soon the LAPD arrived. He had never seen anyone die before.  He told me this story a few weeks later, still in LA. I asked if he had felt emotional. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. Nothing? \u201cStrangely nothing.\u201d The next morning? \u201cNuh-uh.\u201d He sipped juice through a straw. \u201cBut later,\u201d he said, \u201cI was happy. Because I got a fucking great idea for a scene.\u201d     Elle Fanning in The Neon Demon.    Now, a year on, I meet him again in an Italian restaurant in London. The film he was making, The Neon Demon, is about to come out: the story of a 16-year-old model in the feral world of high fashion. To help promote it, Refn has cranked up his own style. Along with his heavy-framed glasses and sharp-cornered haircut is a fitted suit in steel blue. Prada, he says. His Danish accent comes flecked with cartoonish Americanisms (\u201cI still have a punk attitood.\u201d) The film is a whirl of shiny surfaces that turns to horror, a glossy crazed cousin to Refn\u2019s last LA movie, the neon love story Drive. In the restaurant, we\u2019re barely through the small talk before he is on to his place in modern cinema. \u201cI\u2019m glamour,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m vulgarity. I\u2019m scandal. I\u2019m gossip. I\u2019m the future. I\u2019m the counter culture. I\u2019m commercial reality. I\u2019m artistic singularity.\u201d Beside us, the waiter smiles politely and asks if we\u2019d like some water. \u201cThanks,\u201d Refn says.    My wife told Kristen Stewart she looked like a hobbit. We haven't seen her since             Nicolas Winding Refn on The Neon Demon: \u2018Hollywood mirrors everything else\u2019 \u2013 video interview     Related: The Neon Demon review: Nicolas Winding Refn makes Zoolander 3, but erotic and evil    Yet oddly for such an auteur, some of his most important creative decisions are made elsewhere. Now 45, he has been with his wife, the actor Liv Corfixen, for 21 years. She had been his only girlfriend before they married. \u201cWithout her, I would be nothing.\u201d The family \u2013 the couple and their two daughters, 13 and seven \u2013 move as a unit. The last time Refn made a film, the woozily brutal Only God Forgives, they spent six months in Bangkok, where the children struggled with the climate and schools.  \u201cThe therapist said the next move had to be \u2018We.\u2019 So I said to Liv, \u2018Well, where?\u2019\u201d The therapist? \u201cA couples therapist.\u201d They have been going, he says, for 10 years. I ask whose idea it was and Refn grins. When he does this, his mouth stretches from ear to ear, giving him the endearing look of a Muppet of himself. \u201cLiv initiated it.\u201d Corfixen asked that the next film be made in California. Then, once Refn outlined his idea, she recommended he cast Elle Fanning, who duly became its star. Corfixen had also proposed Carey Mulligan for her role opposite Ryan Gosling in Drive. Refn says it\u2019s important how professional contacts get on with his family. Vice versa too. While in LA, they entertained the former Twilight star Kristen Stewart. \u201cLiv said: \u2018My God, you\u2019re so tiny. You look like a hobbit.\u2019 We haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201d     Ryan Gosling in 2011\u2019s Drive. Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex Shutterstock      I know how terrifying LA can be, because I've been there as a failure    After he left the Musso and Frank parking lot, his first reaction was to call his wife. He told her he needed to see her as soon as she could make it, perhaps a little emotional after all. Now, the waiter returns to take our order. Refn is, he says, \u201con the red carpet diet\u201d. I assume this is a joke, but when I order risotto he tuts. \u201cCarbs.\u201d Asking about fashion brings more flying adjectives. \u201cIt\u2019s glamorous, melodramatic, intoxicating. And sick, disgusting, terrifying.\u201d Inevitably, we reach the moment where two middle-aged men discuss whether his film is misogynist. After many years making films about men \u2013 gangsters, prisoners \u2013 his first about women doesn\u2019t lack for nudity. But then, he says, that was true with the men too. \u201cIt\u2019s a film that gives women control.\u201d Fanning and the other women in the cast were, he says, active collaborators in the story, including the film\u2019s most eye-popping scene, a morgue-set sex scene that breaks new ground in lesbian necrophilia.     Refn with his wife Liv Corfixen in 2012. Photograph: Richard Young/Rex Features    The Neon Demon is dedicated to Corfixen. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s my best movie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a huge relief.\u201d Until now her favourite was the favourite of most people: Drive. Its huge success was a sudden twist in a career mostly spent making films \u201cwatched by two people\u201d. He recognises it changed his life. \u201cI know how terrifying LA can be, because I\u2019ve been there as a failure. After Drive, it was the most marvellous place in the universe.\u201d The other turning point of his life came at eight when his film editor father Anders Refn and cinematographer mother Vibeke Winding relocated to New York. Refn arrived as a dyslexic, speaking no English. By his teens, he was in love with movies, and non-stop 80s Manhattan. \u201cIt was a magical period.\u201d He returned to Denmark at 17. Now, between films, Copenhagen is where he and Corfixen are based. Refn says he has few friends. \u201cIt\u2019s a great city for the kids. Clean. Safe. But it\u2019s not my home. It\u2019s my family\u2019s home.\u201d A cultural faultline runs through him and his movies. \u201cAmerica has no one to catch you when you fall. That makes you want to achieve. It is healthy for the soul. But all that is valued is success.\u201d And Denmark values your humanity? \u201cNo, they value you for being equal.\u201d The word sits there, shivering. \u201cI believe in free education, free healthcare. But I do not believe in equality. In Denmark, they call it janteloven. Don\u2019t rise above the crowd. If you say \u2018I am the best\u2019, you are punished.\u201d    Yes, Lars von Trier likes to make films about women. He likes to beat and humiliate them    Refn is frank about his Danish peers; he makes unkind remarks about photogenic director Thomas Vinterberg on roughly an hourly basis. But at this year\u2019s Cannes festival, he took public aim at another Dane, Lars von Trier, accusing him of trying to sleep with Corfixen.  Refn has known Von Trier most of his life. \u201cLars\u2019 best films are all edited by my father.\u201d Some of the outburst came from real distaste. When I say von Trier too makes films about women, he says: \u201cYes. He likes to beat and humiliate them.\u201d But it also made sure that in the helium atmosphere of Cannes, Refn grabbed the attention of the media. \u201cI\u2019m a showman.\u201d He grins. And The Neon Demon is a showman\u2019s film: a glitterbomb of sex and death, made to draw out the pub bore criticism of style over substance. Naturally, there were boos and bad reviews. While a lot of directors will claim they relish hostility, Refn might be telling the truth. \u201cPeople ask about divided reactions, and I think \u2018Don\u2019t you get it yet?\u2019 With the internet, there\u2019s no gatekeeper. There\u2019s just content. So to survive, it doesn\u2019t come down to what you do. It comes down to what you represent. And being talked about.\u201d           Driving round LA with Nicolas Winding Refn: \u2018I will go against good taste till I die\u2019 \u2013 video feature    Refn always had that knack. I met him in the 90s, at the time of his first two films, the Copenhagen street dramas Pusher and Bleeder. He was more brittle then, less fun. But even then he could work a journalist; useful if you want to make films as strange as his and still end up in a Prada suit. He himself volunteers that he can\u2019t make a living from his movies. That comes from advertising, from Gucci, Hennessy cognac, Lincoln cars. \u201cThey hire me because I bring the singular, the narcissistic, the high artistic endeavour...\u201d Is there anything he wouldn\u2019t advertise? \u201cSoft drinks. Fast food. I will not do anything aimed at children.\u201d He might almost pass for a wholesome Danish socialist. \u201cYou have to have values.\u201d These were also why he never worked with Rihanna. He says he was approached to direct the video for her single Bitch Better Have My Money; already dubious about the title, he met her and decided that, while she was \u201csweet\u201d, she \u201cwanted the video to be violent without the pain of violence\u201d. Instead, he pitched an idea in which he would co-star, playing a big-league movie director. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like that.\u201d     Mads Mikkelsen and Kim Bodnia in Refn\u2019s 1996 feature debut Pusher. Photograph: Ronald Grant    Back in his teens, Refn had barely left New York before returning to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He trained to be an actor. A year later, he was expelled for hurling a table against a wall while improvising. Was he angry as a young man? \u201cI was ambitious without focus.\u201d Did he really want to be an actor? \u201cNo. I just felt I was special.\u201d Refn is unsentimental about people he works with. \u201cWe move on. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves.\u201d But he does get misty-eyed about Ryan Gosling and Elle Fanning. \u201cMe and Ryan, we\u2019re mother\u2019s boys.\u201d And Fanning? \u201cElle has the thing that marks her out. You\u2019re born with the thing. You can destroy it or you can work it like a muscle. I know what I\u2019m talking about. I have the thing too.\u201d The charge sometimes thrown at Refn is that his films are adolescent. He doesn\u2019t take it as an insult. The thought of 15 year olds watching The Neon Demon on their phones excites him. \u201cYou can be more bold and abstract now, because the young are so smart. Older people complain about their attention span, but in fact kids just understand everything faster.\u201d  The Neon Demon is out in the US; it opens in the UK on 8 July ", "publicationDate": "2016-07-01T16:46:22Z", "tags": ["Nicolas Winding Refn", "The Neon Demon", "Film", "Culture", "Thriller", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/01/nicolas-winding-refn-neon-demon-interview", "title": "Nicolas Winding Refn: 'I bring the singular, the narcissistic, the high art'", "sentences": ["The last time Refn made a film, the woozily brutal Only God Forgives, they spent six months in Bangkok, where the children struggled with the climate and schools."]}, {"article": "Imagine The Apprentice but with Condoleezza Rice, Henry Kissinger and Tony Blair \u2013 or at least their younger counterparts \u2013 arguing over the state of the living room and who wants to be project manager, as well as whether this week\u2019s Chilcot report on the Iraq war has got it\u00a0right. Oh, and this time, it\u2019s set in China. A\u00a0new elite master\u2019s course, which starts this month at Tsinghua University in Beijing, presents just this scenario. According to the programme\u2019s website, Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive and co-founder of the US private equity corporation Blackstone, founded the Schwarzman Scholars programme with $100m in order to \u201cgive the most talented future leaders the power to change the course of history\u201d and \u201ccreate change at a global scale\u201d. The programme, which selects exceptional candidates aged between 18\u00a0and 29 and provides support for them to live and study together for a year in China, was inspired by the Rhodes scholarships, set up through the legacy of the mining magnate and imperialist politician Cecil Rhodes after his death in 1902, to give an Oxford education to international young leaders committed to public service. Nigel Thrift, former vice-chancellor at the University of Warwick, now executive director of Schwarzman Scholars, says the programme is \u201ca concerted attempt to bring together an extraordinarily talented group of students\u201d.     Artist\u2019s impression of the new Schwarzman College in Beijing. Photograph: Schwarzman College    \u201cIt is also an attempt to introduce these students to China and to build a network between China and these students which will serve them and China in the future.\u201d Other Rhodes-inspired programmes have attempted to tap into the next generation of world leaders in similar ways, including the Yenching scholars programme at Peking University, announced after the Schwarzman programme but already going for a year. What distinguishes its Schwarzman rival is the stellar advisory board. Blair, Rice and Kissinger are all members, and it also includes former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, former US secretary of state Colin Powell and Sir James Wolfensohn, a former president of the World Bank. Thrift says their involvement is \u201chelp where help is needed\u201d. For example Kevin Rudd, former prime minister of Australia, a Mandarin speaker, was able to contribute by drawing on his extensive contacts in China. One academic suggested to the Guardian that some of the advisers looked like \u201can Iraq war reunion\u201d, while another who does not want to be named for fear of disadvantaging any future graduates who want to apply, says: \u201cThe whole idea that one can produce world leaders in one year on one course strikes me as a bit reductionist. A world leader emerges over a longer period of time with different experiences. Nelson Mandela didn\u2019t do a programme like this.\u201d He suggests the programme\u2019s view of what makes a leader is a narrow one, focusing too much on business, and for him, the political/money nexus represented by the advisory board is worrying. The advisory board also includes top names from the business world, including Robert Rubin, previously of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and a former US Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, and Bob Dudley, group chief executive of BP. Another Goldman Sachs alumnus\u00a0on the board is John L\u00a0Thornton, who retired as president of the investment banking firm in 2003 and\u00a0is now director of global leadership at Tsinghua University. Thornton\u2019s son, JR, whose first novel, Beautiful Country, was published in the US in April, will be among the first 111 scholars. His book, based on his experience training as a tennis player in Beijing, was endorsed as \u201cin many ways the quintessential \u2018Chimerican\u2019 novel for the millennial generation\u201d by Harvard professor of history Niall Ferguson, who will be one of the programme\u2019s guest lecturers. More than 3,000 applications were received, and applicants had to go through a rigorous selection process. The 300 \u201csemi-finalists\u201d were then invited for interviews in Beijing, Bangkok, London or New York before panels including such figures as Brian Mulroney, former prime minister of Canada; David Walker, former chairman of Barclays; Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times, and \u00d3lafur Gr\u00edmsson, president of Iceland.     Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd , a Mandarin speaker, drew on his contacts in China to help develop Schwarzman\u2019s programme. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian    \u201cThe interviews were really tough,\u201d says Stephanie Burrell, 24, from Quadring in Lincolnshire, an Oxford biological sciences graduate who has worked at Accenture and in the Cabinet Office. She says she had a half-hour slot in which a panel of six fired questions at her, such whether she thought the European Union would still be together in two years. Others focused on her particular interest, which is new technologies and artificial intelligence. Another British scholar, Natasha Rachman, 22, who studied PPE at Oxford and has been working for Lady Faulkner, Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for foreign affairs in the House of Lords, says she was attracted by the fact that the programme is free \u2013 students have not only their tuition and travel paid and accommodation and meals supplied but receive a stipend of $3,500 and a laptop and smartphone \u2013 and the chance to interact with a broad and interesting cohort. The programme takes 45% of its scholars from the US, 20% from China and 35% from the rest of the world. Only 30% of successful applicants are women \u2013 reflecting the proportion applying. Thrift is confident that this will be addressed in the next cohort, interviews for which begin this week with the aim of recruiting 125 students. Harvard has the most successful candidates, with six, closely followed by Tsinghua, Princeton and Yale, with five each. Of UK institutions, Oxford and Cambridge have three graduates each, while two will be from the London School of Economics and one each from Durham, Imperial, University College London and King\u2019s College London. They will travel to Beijing next month to stay in a new purpose-built college. Days will be spent studying Chinese culture, history and values, leadership and comparative government, plus a number of elective courses related to public policy, economics and business and international studies. They will also spend time on placements with companies and organisations in China, on which they will be assessed. There have been reports of a crackdown on academic freedom in China\u2019s universities, with the country\u2019s education minister, Yuan Guiren, urging greater controls over textbooks that spread \u201cwestern values\u201d. The course these students can choose on global media and communications could prove to be a challenge in a country ranked 176th out of 180 in the most recent Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index.     Noam Chomsky: unimpressed by Schwarzman Scholars\u2019 advisory board. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    Rachman says she is aware this is potentially an issue \u2013 and one of the things that interests her in the programme is the chance to discuss whether China is becoming more authoritarian \u2013 but students have been assured that within the walls of the campus they will have academic freedom. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you are going to go and study and work in a country you have to acknowledge that you will be bound by laws there.\u201d Thrift says: \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t had any issues about academic freedom. No one can say there are never going to be these issues \u2013 where you are working in a different country with different expectations it would be na\u00efve to think otherwise \u2013 but we also think it is important for the Chinese and they will want to make sure these things will be able to be worked through.\u201d The programme has an academic board of scholars who advise on the curriculum and suitable professors. One of these is Peter Tufano, dean of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, who advised on organising student-life elements of the programme. He says the secret will be not to over-engineer student life but leave enterprising students to organise some activities for themselves. \u201cThese are exceptional students and I\u2019m used to dealing with other exceptional students,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir lives don\u2019t stop when they leave the classroom.\u201d However, Noam Chomsky, emeritus professor of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and commentator on global affairs, is more concerned about the example set by the main advisory board. He says: \u201cWith that choice of\u00a0advisers I frankly wouldn\u2019t expect much.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-07-05T11:00:13Z", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "Master's degrees", "US education", "Australian education", "US universities", "Tony Blair", "Condoleezza Rice", "US news", "Education policy", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Colin Powell"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/05/new-world-leader-schwarzman-scholars-masters-course-tony-blair", "title": "Apply now to become a world leader, in just one year", "sentences": ["The 300 \u201csemi-finalists\u201d were then invited for interviews in Beijing, Bangkok, London or New York before panels including such figures as Brian Mulroney, former prime minister of Canada; David Walker, former chairman of Barclays; Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times, and \u00d3lafur Gr\u00edmsson, president of Iceland."]}, {"article": "Longtime devotees of the Melbourne international film festival feel a mixture of nostalgia and horror when recalling the now-closed Greater Union complex on Russell Street, where before 2014 they congregated every year to sit on back-breaking seats with stains the world\u2019s most advanced cleaning technologies couldn\u2019t hope to remove.

The Neon Demon Nicolas Winding Refn is another film-maker whose name is catnip on the festival circuit. His last film was the notoriously controversial albeit sumptuously shot Bangkok-set Ryan Gosling bloodbath, Only God Forgives. On the PR circuit for it, the rabble-rousing Danish writer/director described himself as \u201ca pornographer\u201d with all the kiddish pride of a child wearing a shiny new fake sheriff\u2019s badge. Refn\u2019s latest poke in the eye of decency is a slow-burning horror movie about a model (Elle Fanning) who encounters a rather \u2026 unpleasant time when she moves to Los Angeles.             3. Emo the Musical In 2013 the writer/director Neil Triffett and the producer Lee Matthews cobbled together $10,000 to make a short high school-set musical film about bible bashers picked on by prank-pulling emos. Triffett memorably took the mickey out of two groups of people while making a serious point about bullying and tolerance. His reward was funding for a feature film expansion, with a budget pegged at $1.5m.             4. Notes on Blindness When the theologian John Hull started losing his eyesight in the early 1980s, he began recording a series of deeply personal cassette tapes that form the foundation of a remarkable documentary from co-directors James Spinney and Peter Middleton. The film-makers recruited actors to provide the voices of Hull and his wife. This technique creates an oddly compelling blend \u2013 it\u2019s not quite re-enactment, given the presence of straight-from-the-horse\u2019s-mouth audio, and not quite documentary, given the presence of actors. A highly original and utterly sublime work, Notes on Blindness is a soul-stirring portrait of a man who viewed disability as an opportunity to become a better and more complete person.            5. Paris 05:59 The French directors Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau helm a touching Paris-set romantic drama about love at first sight. But before you say \u201csounds like a Hallmark greeting card\u201d, bear this rather racy caveat in mind: 05:59 begins with an explicit 18-minute gay orgy sequence. Thus it is assured instant water-cooler classic status.              Related: 'Every Australian film-maker owes something to director Paul Cox' | Luke Buckmaster    6. Innocence The prolific Australian auteur Paul Cox passed away last month. In his honour, the Melbourne international film festival is screening Cox\u2019s 2000 drama Innocence, with a panel discussion afterwards featuring two of its stars: national treasures Julia Blake and Terry Norris, who play a married couple in the film and are married in real life. Innocence begins with a Before Sunset-esque premise \u2013 two lovers meet up years down the track \u2013 and morphs into a story of late-age infidelity.     The late Paul Cox\u2019s 2000 film Innocence. Two of its stars, Julia Blake and Terry Norris, will join a panel discussion after the screening    7. A New Leaf The ultra deadpan screwball genius of the writer/director Elaine May\u2019s 1971 debut, starring herself and Walter Matthau, has been criminally overlooked over the years. Matthau plays a broke middle-aged playboy with a plan to marry and murder a wealthy heiress in a deliciously dark and dry but, sadly, studio-tampered with classic (the original version was rumoured to be three hours long). The film is playing in the Gaining Ground program of the Melbourne international film festival, which spotlights the art of female directors working in New York in the 70s and 80s.      Elaine May\u2019s criminally overlooked 1971 debut A New Leaf.    8. The Family, and Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation I\u2019m grouping these two titles together given they share an unusual commonality: both are Australian crime films exploring subjects injected with drugs and the people who wielded the needles. In 1997 a law student, Anu Singh, killed her boyfriend, Joe Cinque, by spiking his coffee with Rohypnol then injecting him with a massive dose of heroin; the author Helen Garner immortalised the story in her true-crime book Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation. Singh has already spoken out against first-time feature film-maker Sotiris Dounoukos\u2019s incoming adaptation. The Family, directed by Rosie Jones, documents Australia\u2019s most notorious cult. It was created by the yoga teacher Anne Hamilton-Byrne, regarded by her followers as a reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Hamilton-Byrne\u2019s sect was raided in 1987 after a Victorian detective discovered 13-year-olds were being injected with LSD.      First-time feature film-maker Sotiris Dounoukos has adapted Helen Garner\u2019s true-crime book Joe Cinque\u2019s Consolation    9. Weiner Is there a better political campaign movie than Weiner? Is anything else even on the podium? Co-directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg came on board to document the 2013 mayoral race of disgraced New York congressman Anthony Weiner, determined to recover his career after a sexting scandal. What they got was a slow-moving train crash; what they made is a jaw-dropping stranger-than-fiction yarn with access so extensive you\u2019ll wonder how they were allowed to keep filming.            10. Personal Shopper The stars of Twilight seem to advocate the theory that actors ought to sell out early rather than later, then bask in the glow of a career renaissance (otherwise known as \u201cthe Matthew McConaughey\u201d). Kristen Stewart continues to turn heads in Personal Shopper, a ghost movie from the French director Olivier Assayas. Meanwhile, Robert Pattinson stands his ground in the highbrow \u2013 and at times infuriatingly pretentious \u2013 drama The Childhood of a Leader.

Their inept attempts to launch a nine-metre boat with multiple mechanical problems provided one clue. The fact they were also offering locals large amounts of cash for help was another. \u201cI knew something dodgy was up,\u201d says Peter Furze, a surfer who watched the men try and fail to get their boat into the rough seas off Ninety Mile Beach.   Related: New Zealand police seize record haul of meth in drug bust    When a new boat was purchased for NZ$98,000 (\u00a355,000) in cash and then abandoned on the shore, locals demanded police investigate. Their instincts were right. Inside the boat, buried in the sand dunes nearby, and in a campervan also belonging to the group, officers discovered nearly 500kg of methamphetamine or \u201cP\u201d as it is known in New Zealand.  The record haul \u2013 worth half a billion dollars on the street \u2013 seized last month has made headlines and focused the country\u2019s attention on its insidious problem with a drug that is easy to make at home and cheaper than marijuana to buy. Methamphetamine \u2013 often referred to as \u201cthe poor man\u2019s cocaine\u201d \u2013 has become the class A drug of choice for Kiwis.     A boat, found on Ninety Mile Beach in New Zealand, containing a record haul of methamphetamine. Photograph: New Zealand police    \u201cP is a huge problem here,\u201d says Furze. \u201cThere are so many desolate places you can cook it, so many places to hide away.\u201d New Zealand is 10,000km (6,00o miles) from Bangkok, 18,000km from Amsterdam and surrounded by sea. Hard drugs rarely make it into the country \u2013 and when they do prices are high and quality is low. But the advent of pop-up, easily transportable labs (some that fit inside a suitcase) have made P a booming nationwide business. From holiday homes in Wanaka, to milking sheds in the Waikato, many Kiwis have turned their hand to DIY meth manufacture.  \u201cI think because Kiwis are so innovative in so many good ways, that can lead to us being innovative in bad ways as well,\u201d says Anita Meyer, a former P cook from Auckland. \u201cWe definitely punch above our weight in what we manage to do in a fairly restricted drug scene.\u201d      Anita Meyer, a former P cook in Auckland. Photograph: Anita Meyer    Ross Bell, executive director of the New Zealand Drug Foundation, believes New Zealanders have proven themselves to be skilled drug manufacturers over many decades \u2013 a talent born out of distance and necessity, and honed through years of trial and error. \u201cWe are very good at covertly growing cannabis, we are very good at cooking P ... this all links back to New Zealand\u2019s do-it-yourself drug culture,\u201d says Bell. \u201cLabs blow up, labs get busted, but they always re-emerge. The rise of recreational drug use in New Zealand is quite unique and deeply founded in our geographic isolation.\u201d The socioeconomic diversity of P addicts in New Zealand suggest it has become an everyman\u2019s drug; as attractive to high-powered businessman as it is to adolescents. \u201cNew Zealanders are quite trusting and that\u2019s usually a good thing,\u201d says Miles Stratford from MethSolutions, a meth testing company in Auckland. \u201cBut that can make them quite blind to what is happening around them and how entrenched the P problem has become.\u201d According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, New Zealanders are among the highest users of methamphetamine in the world, alongside Australia and parts of south-east Asia. The most recent figures from the New Zealand government indicate that P use has declined from a high of 2.7% of the population using in 2003, to fewer than 1% of the population today. But according to Det Supt Virginia Le Bas, national manager of organised crime, her officers on the street are reporting increasing evidence of P use \u2013 be it equipment discovered in private homes for manufacture, or being called to violent incidents involving P users. \u201cOverall we are seeing less clan labs [secret drug labs] in residential homes, but more mobile labs \u2013 and they can be everywhere and anywhere, all around the country,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there is the perception from police in the field that there is more meth in the community, more utensils discovered for cooking, and attending more violent crime involving meth addicts.\u201d     Bottles used in the manufacture of meth in a New Zealand home-based P lab. Photograph: NZ Police    According to Massey University\u2019s senior drug researcher Dr Chris Wilkins, P manufacture and use is concentrated in Auckland and Christchurch \u2013 another disastrous side-effect of 2011\u2019s deadly earthquake. Interview subjects in both cities say P is easier to purchase than marijuana and can usually be bought in under an hour.   Ian Hastings, a retired senior drug squad detective, says the P epidemic concerns him more than any drug he encountered during his long career with the police. \u201cWe are surrounded by water and have strong border controls that have always made it challenging for drugs like cocaine and heroin to get into New Zealand,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways that is a blessing, but in many other ways it\u2019s not.\u201d In the 1970s New Zealand was flooded with heroin through the infamous Mr Asia drug syndicate. But when police shut down imports, addicts were left desperate for a fix.    If we can\u2019t get it, we\u2019ll make it ourselves  Ian Hastings, retired drug squad detective     \u201cIf we can\u2019t get it we\u2019ll make it ourselves,\u201d says Hastings. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how homebake came about.\u201d Homebake was a substitute for heroin. Codeine tablets available from chemists were cooked up and purified into morphine most commonly, or heroin. According to police and users at the time it was never a big money-spinner or a very sophisticated operation. But it was an early indication of what was to come. Anne Carroll, a former drug addict, works as a nurse in a drug rehab facility, where 67% of her patients are meth addicts. Carroll had returned home to New Zealand from Australia to ween herself off heroin. But she found the temptations of homebake too great to resist. \u201cThe bad addicts would go home to New Zealand to try and get clean, but then Kiwis invented homebake,\u201d recalls Carroll. \u201cIt could be made overnight, it was really easy. And it was fascinating because it was something that was peculiar to New Zealand.\u201d At Higher Ground, a leading drug rehab centre in Auckland, the majority of clients are addicted to meth. Despite government assurances that the P epidemic is waning, the waiting list to get into Higher Ground is months long, as it is for other drug treatment centres around the country. \u201cIn our experience there are more P addicts every week, they are more addicted, and they are getting younger,\u201d says director Johnny Dow. At the clinic, situated in suburban West Auckland, many of the recovering clients are baby-faced. The dining room looks less like a treatment centre than a residential university hall.     A home-based P lab in New Zealand. Photograph: NZ Police    \u201cP is so destructive because addicts hit rock bottom so much quicker and so much younger,\u201d says Dow. \u201cBefore, heroin addicts could last 20 or 30 years before burning out, but P wears addicts out in five to 10 years. Its effects are just horrendous and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen its peak yet.\u201d Former P cook Meyer was a poor science student in high school and says the demand for her P cook-ups was \u201ca major ego boost\u201d. \u201cWhen people hear you\u2019re a good cook, word spreads and suddenly you\u2019re in demand,\u201d she says. Since New Zealand gangs have taken over the large-scale production of P, both in-house and imported, the police have turned their attention to the increasingly close ties between New Zealand gangs and overseas drug syndicates, particularly in Asia. Former detective Hastings has followed the rise and rise of P with a heavy heart. He has no idea how, or when, it will end. \u201cThe taste for P is a reflection of the age we live in,\u201d says Hastings, who now runs a casino party business.  \u201cWe need every experience to be faster, bigger, better, now. Anything criminal that is locally made and produced is very hard to get on top of. And P has no natural ceiling.

The tree overhead offers little respite from the blistering sun, but he needs to earn a living, so he lowers his kickstand to the pavement and waits. Across the street, some new competition is being built. T-shaped beams tower above the narrow, clogged road: the beginnings of Vietnam\u2019s first metro system.  The thirty-something driver isn\u2019t worried about job security, though. Like so many of his compatriots, he has accustomed to flitting from one job to the next, according to the whims of the nation\u2019s rapidly growing economy. \u201cIf Vietnam wants to develop, we should get the metro,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will reduce vehicles on the roadsand make our society more modern.\u201d Hanoi, a city with more motorbikes than households, has to contend with heavy congestion and frequent traffic accidents. In recent years, studies have named it among the worst cities in Asia for air pollution. In May this year, Vietnamese media reported that the US embassy\u2019s air quality monitor in Hanoi registered a \u201chazardous\u201d spike in particulate matter, reportedly reaching a level seven times that recommended by the World Health Organisation. Though the government hopes the metro can tackle both traffic and environmental issues at once, the project has faced numerous delays and setbacks. What\u2019s more, convincing Hanoians to give up their motorbikes could turn out to be the biggest challenge yet.     A girl cycles through smoke created by burning waste in a street in Hanoi, where air pollution has reached dangerous levels. Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/EPA    In 2008, more than 80% of journeys in the city were carried out by motorbikes and scooters \u2013 and a fast-growing share of the population is opting for cars. Currently there are roughly 4.9 million motorbikes and scooters on Hanoi\u2019s roads. The use of bicycles, once the dominant transport mode in the city, decreased dramatically as motorbikes and cars became more popular: in 1995, 47% of journeys were made by bicycle; in 2008, the figure had dropped to only 3%. Hanoi\u2019s Transport Plan aims to increase the share of public transport from the current low figure of 9% of trips, to above 60% by 2030, by which time Hanoi is slated to have six new metro lines and three Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines. But the ambitions get even steeper. Last month, Hanoi\u2019s Party Committee outlined plans to ban motorbikes from the downtown area by 2025, in line with improved public transport. A total downtown ban of the vehicles would require a huge lifestyle shift for most residents \u2013 and put an enormous amount of pressure on the new metro system. None of the locals I speak to regard the 2025 plan as feasible. Ho Chi Minh City is planning a metro project of its own, with two of the eight planned lines currently under construction and the first due to open in 2020. Both the Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi projects have been described as Vietnam\u2019s first metro systems, but which network will open first remains to be seen. In Hanoi, a 12.5km line connecting the Nhon area to the downtown railway station was supposed to be operational by December 2016, but the expected completion date has been pushed back to 2020.     More than 80% of trips in Hanoi are made by motorbikes and scooters. Photograph: Alamy    According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a funding source of the project, about 15% of construction had been completed by the end of 2015. The line, which will be partially underground, will have 12 stations and is expected to accommodate 754,000 passengers a day by 2030. Hanoi-based urban planner Floriane Ortega, who worked on the planning of metro lines one and two, says the project has faced delays for several reasons. For one, there are resettlement and compensation issues involved in the construction project, and Vietnam lacks an overarching transport authority to streamline efforts. Hanoi Metropolitan Railway Management Board, the governmental body that oversees the metro project, did not respond to requests for comment.    In 10 years, I think Hanoi will be like Bangkok. There will be more cars and fewer motorbikes  Nguyen Xuan Gioi     A line being constructed by Chinese contractor China Railway has encountered deadline delays, funding shortages and safety problems from falling construction debris. Ortega explains that overall coordination between the contractors on different lines \u2013 French, South Korean, Japanese and Chinese firms \u2013 is lacking. There are issues with contractors wanting to use different ticketing systems, as well as a lack of consensus on how to best integrate stations, which could force pedestrians to exit one station and enter another if the problem is left unresolved, she says. If these obstacles are overcome \u201cthe metro will dramatically change the notion of public space in this country,\u201d Ortega says, explaining that public spaces and pavements are currently used more for motorbike parking than for pedestrians. But once the metro opens, commuters who walk from stations to their destinations could force the pavements to be used for their intended purpose once again. But there\u2019s one more caveat to a thriving public transport system: Vietnam must first conquer its car problem.     The rise of cars in Vietnam\u2019s capital has exacerbated congestion issues on the streets. Photograph: Kham/Reuters    The country has agreed to eliminate all import duties by 2018 on cars originating from the 10 nations within the Asean Economic Community, of which it is a member. In addition, a reduced luxury tax on cars, which went into effect on 1 July this year, slashed the price tag for vehicles with engines of less than 1.5 litres. \u201cThe Vietnamese have a huge demand for cars, especially family cars,\u201d says salesman Nguyen Xuan Gioi, who works in a Toyota dealership near the Cau Giay metro line. \u201cIn 10 years, I think Hanoi will be like Bangkok. There will be more cars and fewer motorbikes.\u201d Hanoi\u2019s urban layout begs to differ. Many streets, especially around the expansive West Lake, can only accommodate one vehicle at a time, forcing drivers on to pavements. In one neighbourhood, paths have been torn out and the roads widened to meet anticipated demand from car drivers once a nearby housing development is constructed. Jason Rush, communication specialist for ADB\u2019s south-east Asia branch, says the car craze is problematic for a city trying to sell the virtues of public transportation. \u201cHanoi over the past 10 years has gone through somewhat of a car renaissance,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people are purchasing automobiles for the first time who were never able to afford them in the past.\u201d Currently, less than 10% of Hanoians use public transportation. The public bus is cheap, but petrol to fill up a motorbike is even cheaper. Some residents are questioning whether an unspoken motivation for the metro project and the planned motorbike ban is to clear bikes off the streets to make room for more cars.  Steve Jackson, head of communications for an international NGO who has lived in Hanoi since 2004, says the transition to cars has made him nostalgic for the waning days of the motorbike. At least traffic moved before cars came around, he muses. \u201cIt\u2019s great if comfortable affordable public transport can be provided for the less well off \u001f\u2013 but not if it means the aim is to leave the roads for the wealthy and their cars,\u201d he says.     Scooters are part of daily life for most Hanoians. Photograph: Hemis/Alamy    It\u2019s hard to envision a Vietnamese city without motorbikes. It\u2019s not uncommon for locals to drive to the bakery at the end of their alley or to \u201cwalk\u201d their dogs while steering their bikes with one hand, canines trotting alongside. Part of that attachment is driven by notions of economic progress. \u201cIt represents freedom, it represents status sometimes, and it\u2019s hard to convince people to make the switch from that to public transport,\u201d Rush says. ADB\u2019s marketing efforts will focus on changing public sentiment about mass transportation. They are taking a page from the metro systems in Seoul, Los Angeles and Bangkok, all of which marketed the metro as trendy and increased the number of discretionary riders.   Related: Inside Hanoi's gated communities: rich enclaves where even the air is cleaner    At the end of the day, Rush says, whether or not people use the metro depends on several factors: accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and amenities. The system should have accommodating parking lots, Wi-Fi and inviting and accessible spaces surrounding metro stations, he says. Another approach is to market the metro as a lifestyle choice. One idea being tossed around is to issue multipurpose metro cards, allowing electronic payments to be made at businesses around the city, similar to Hong Kong\u2019s octopus card. This change won\u2019t happen overnight, and ADB will conduct studies over the next 12 to 18 months to determine which demographics are most likely to use the metro and for what reasons. Convincing residents to take the metro will likely get easier in time, once the system is more far-reaching. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to do when you have a big vibrant train system that penetrates every neighbourhood,\u201d Rush says. \u201cObviously in Hanoi there\u2019s only going to be a few lines initially, so you have to have a medium-term trajectory for this.\u201d For now, Hanoians will just have to keep donning their traffic fatigues \u001f\u2013 face masks and Hello Kitty helmets \u2013 and battling it out for their spot on the streets.

The Portuguese follows David Moyes in July 2013 and Louis van Gaal in July 2014. Mourinho is confident he can be the man to take the club into a new era of sustained success following the fallow years after Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement in 2013.   Related: Warm welcome for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as new era opens for Manchester United | Paul Wilson    Yet Van Gaal and Moyes, as they set off for Thailand and America respectively, also felt they could deliver glory. Below is a snapshot of where each manager was as his first tour began \u2026 1 Itinerary DM 10 July\u201330 July Moyes\u2019s sole summer trip was a three-continent, four-country, five-city slog that took in Thailand, Australia, Japan and China, and remains the longest in United\u2019s history. The schedule was inherited from Ferguson and Moyes could have done without it as he grappled with succeeding a manager par excellence at one of the world\u2019s largest clubs. As the former Everton man flew off with his new squad the issue of a disaffected Wayne Rooney loomed large and there was also an ageing defence to consider: two problems \u201cbequeathed\u201d him by his predecessor. And in Ed Woodward, Moyes also had a new executive vice-chairman who was a novice in the transfer market. LVG 18 July\u20134 August This was shorter in time but still took in California, Colorado, Washington DC, Michigan and Florida and had Van Gaal already complaining at his opening press conference in Pasadena before the curtain-raiser against LA Galaxy. The Dutchman\u2019s mood was further soured by in-tour logistics he believed hampered his preparations. A prime illustration was Van Gaal being half an hour late for that media briefing at the Rose Bowl due to the team being located in a Beverly Hills hotel and having to fight gridlocked traffic out of the city. JM 19\u201326 July By United\u2019s standards this is a lightning affair and Mourinho has Van Gaal to thank due to his predecessor\u2019s unhappiness with the previous tour. United travel between only two cities \u2013 Shanghai and Beijing \u2013 and have only two games, against Borussia Dortmund on Friday and Manchester City on Monday. Conversely Mourinho added Saturday\u2019s friendly at Wigan Athletic to the schedule because he felt Van Gaal\u2019s build-up was a little light. 2 Expectation DM  As the six-year contract Moyes signed with United suggests, his task in his first season was merely to show he could handle following Ferguson by ensuring the champions finished in a Champions League place. After 34 Premier League games Moyes was sacked, the Scot lasting a mere nine months. Welcomed as \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d he left, in what is a cruel business, as \u201cThe Failed One\u201d. LVG After the disastrous Moyes tenure Van Gaal\u2019s initial challenge was to take United back into the Champions League. He did so at the end of 2014-15, in fourth place, but then fell down by overseeing elimination at the group stage of the competition and a fifth-place Premier League finish last season in a campaign that from December onwards was a long and difficult-to-watch stumble towards his sacking. Not even winning the club a 12th FA Cup in May could save him. JM   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola: five key challenges each manager faces    When Mourinho began his second tenure at Chelsea in the summer of 2013 he was clear that winning the Premier League would be the aim for 12 months down the line (which he delivered). There has been no similar calming of expectation with United, so it seems fair to conclude the 53-year-old is targeting a 21st title for the club this season. If not, his side must be serious contenders in May or Mourinho has failed. 3 Transfers by time of tour DM Moyes can \u2013 and did \u2013 curse his luck that United\u2019s chief executive, David Gill, also stepped down when Ferguson left as this left the inexperienced Woodward to work for him in the transfer market. The new manager was culpable of blunders, though, especially over the summer-long attempt to buy Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini as a package from his former club, Everton. All of this meant Moyes had no major new signings with him as United landed in Bangkok, none as they returned to Manchester three weeks later and, at the close of the window on 31 August, only Fellaini had arrived. But as there was no World Cup, Copa Am\u00e9rica or European Championship that summer, Moyes\u2019s only absentees for the tour were due to injury. LVG As United flew into LAX Airport two years ago, Van Gaal had already acquired Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera so could have no complaints about Woodward, though this did not stop him moaning at the new arrivals for their play on tour. This was a World Cup summer but, as England were knocked out of Brazil 2014 in the group stage, Shaw plus Rooney and the rest of his international team-mates were present. The early recruitment of Herrera and Shaw kicked off a transfer window in which \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, Radamel Falcao, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind were also added. JM Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Eric Bailly and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were all signed by 6 July and Mourinho believes he has a good chance of buying Juventus\u2019s Paul Pogba. This has to put several springs in the manager\u2019s step as United fly out despite those players involved in Euro 2016 and the Copa Am\u00e9rica being absent. Ibrahimovic is one of those afforded further rest. 4 The Ferguson shadow factor DM Being Ferguson\u2019s first choice proved an arsenic-dripping chalice once Moyes\u2019s results went south. As he was the man who followed the man, the last thing the Glaswegian needed was to be backed by him. Furthermore United were reigning champions which made their plunge to the seventh place Moyes left the side in when sacked seem all the more dismal. LVG   Related: Louis van Gaal tactics left Manchester United players close to mutiny | Daniel Taylor    Ferguson\u2019s shadow receded after Moyes\u2019 failure and this allowed Van Gaal extra grace. Yet finishing fourth in the first season would never be enough to dissipate the Scot\u2019s aura. What the Dutchman required was a title triumph. Instead United regressed into fifth position and Ferguson was again a key powerbroker in the club\u2019s saga over appointing Mourinho. JM Until Mourinho \u2013 or anyone \u2013 claims that first league title since Ferguson\u2019s 13th in 2013, the knight\u2019s legacy will always hover over United. For the moment Ferguson may have been edged to the periphery by Woodward finally giving Mourinho the job, despite the Scot\u2019s indifference to this decision. But fail like Moyes and Van Gaal and Mourinho will be gone, too \u2013 while the Ferguson legend will be even stronger. 5 Auguries as the tour plane was boarded DM Moyes\u2019s unveiling was littered with declarations of faint-hearted \u201chope\u201d regarding what his team would do. This may have been an attempt to respect Ferguson and the institution he was taking over but the result was the new man sounded cowed. It became the story of his tenure. LVG Van Gaal was the diametric opposite in his opening display. He was not daunted by the size of the club and came across as the archetypal chest-out, alpha-male manager United were desperate for. Yet the giveaway here was the one-eyed stance regarding the club\u2019s commercial operation. His players liked him as a man but as a man-manager they found Van Gaal difficult to fathom and hard to play for. Dismal displays and results followed. JM Unlike Moyes and Van Gaal, Mourinho has squeezed a game in before United took off on Tuesday. Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win at Wigan was largely academic apart from a telling caveat: the instant rapport between the away fans and Mourinho. Unlike the permanently seated Van Gaal, Mourinho virtually lives in the technical area so this allowed him to respond to their chants. His opening press conference was laced with what felt like a good blend of charm and pugnaciousness: again in contrast to his two predecessors. But, as always, all that matters is results. If he wins, he is doing all the right things brilliantly.

It required her to curl up into a ball and place herself in bed between her mother\u2019s naked thighs while she puffed and groaned as if in the throes of labour. Eventually her mother would shout \u201cPop!\u201d, fling back the sheets and, lo, a child was born. One afternoon Ariel had a friend around and the three of them played Being Born together, with Ariel\u2019s mother giving birth to them alternately. \u201cAfter that day,\u201d Leve recalls, \u201cDanielle was never allowed to come over again.\u201d Leve didn\u2019t realise this wasn\u2019t the kind of game that most mothers played with their children, and would simply delight in being the centre of attention. These moments were rare. Her parents were divorced and her father, whom she saw in the summer holidays, lived on the other side of the world, in Bangkok. Meanwhile, her mother spent most evenings out dining with friends, or hosting parties in their apartment, or picking physical fights with her boyfriends, or yelling at her daughter for her ingratitude. \u201cWhen I am dead, you will be all alone because your father doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d she would tell her. \u201cJust remember that and treat me nicely.\u201d   Related: Ariel Leve: 'I was the parent and my mother was the child'    An Abbreviated Life is a powerful and frequently devastating account of a childhood without boundaries and dominated by loneliness, chaos and fear. Along with recounting her early years spent on New York\u2019s Upper East Side at the mercy of her mother\u2019s moodswings, Leve tells of her efforts to repair the damage in her 40s through therapy, neuroscience and a relationship with a preternaturally serene Italian named Mario. Leve is a journalist and she brings a reporter\u2019s curiosity and diligence to her subject. Not always trusting her own version of events, she seeks the testimony of others, among them her father\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Rita, who frequently visited Leve in New York and wrote concerned letters to her father about his ex-wife\u2019s antics. With Rita\u2019s corroboration comes relief. For the adult Leve, the most enduring pain comes not from the cruelty itself but from her mother\u2019s consistent denial of what took place. \u201cThe erasure of the abuse was worse than the abuse,\u201d she writes. Rather than trudging chronologically through her life, Leve jumps backwards and forwards in time, sharing brief snapshots, snippets of conversation, jumbled thoughts and meditations. This is, of course, how memory works, moments in time haphazardly stitched together, their significance only understood later. There are parallels here with Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?, Jeanette Winterson\u2019s chronicle of a childhood lived under the rule of a tyrannical mother and an adulthood dominated by a need to make peace with it. Like Winterson\u2019s, Leve\u2019s recollections can be brutal but are made digestible by the elegant sparseness of her prose. There are times, however, when the injustice of it all overwhelms her and her sentences begin to bubble and spit. You get a sense of a writer forever trying keep a lid on her fury.     Andy Warhol was a visitor to Ariel\u2019s house. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex/Shutterstock    Perhaps in a bid to allow her some dignity, Leve never names her mother though it is not hard to discover her identity online. We are told she is a published poet and noted feminist campaigner, who made a cult documentary on the women\u2019s movement. There are giveaways, too, in her lofty social circle. Saul Bellow, Philip Roth and Andy Warhol were among the visitors to their apartment, and for whom Leve would be frequently dragged out of bed in the small hours to say hello. \u201cIt\u2019s midnight. Can everyone go home now?\u201d she would ask, pitifully. Attending a work dinner in 2002, Leve met an old associate of her mother\u2019s who had been a guest at several of her parties. After Leve left, the man told her editor: \u201cI always wondered how that little girl would survive. I thought her only choices were suicide or murder.\u201d The catalyst for change in Leve, what makes her truly want to escape the horrors of her past, is becoming de facto stepmother to twin girls. Observing their blitheness and innocence, she notes how she \u201ccan\u2019t imagine wanting these little girls to identify with sorrow. I can\u2019t imagine hitting them. Or slapping them across the face. Or kicking them or jerking them or squeezing their arm so tight it leaves a bruise. I can\u2019t imagine promising them something I don\u2019t deliver. I can\u2019t imagine accusing them of trying to hurt me or hating me or being jealous.\u201d This book, then, is her attempt to ensure that none of these things come to pass, to re-examine her childhood through the wisdom of adulthood and overcome her lifelong insecurity and dread.

He had spent the past three years building the luxurious white-stone complex of chalets and apartments overlooking the shimmering sea and was almost ready to open for business. All he needed was a licence. Justo had arrived in Thailand four years earlier, having fled the drab world of finance in London. In 2011, he and his girlfriend Laura toured the country on a motorbike and, two years later, they got married on a secluded beach. The couple eventually settled down in Koh Samui, a tourist hotspot, just an hour\u2019s flight south of Bangkok. After trying out a couple of entrepreneurial ventures, Justo eventually decided that he would go into the hotel business. He bought a plot with an imposing house and began building: adding a gym, villas and a tennis court.   Related: The Guardian view on Malaysian politics: a scandal meriting the world\u2019s attention | Editorial    That June afternoon, he was expecting a visit from the tourism authorities to sign off on the paperwork. Instead, a squad of armed Thai police burst through the unlocked door, bundling Justo to the ground. The officers tied their plastic cuffs so tightly around Justo\u2019s wrists that he bled on the dark tiled floor. The police quickly moved into his office, ripping out the computers and emptying the filing cabinets. After two days in a ramshackle local jail, Justo was flown to Bangkok and paraded before the media, in a press conference befitting a mafia kingpin. Still wearing shorts and flip-flops, he was flanked by four commandos holding machine guns, while a quartet of senior Royal Thai Police officers briefed the assembled reporters on the charges against him. Justo was charged with an attempt to blackmail his former employer, a little-known London-based oil-services company named PetroSaudi. But behind this seemingly mundane charge lay a much bigger story. Six months earlier, Justo had handed a British journalist named Clare Rewcastle Brown thousands of documents, including 227,000 emails, from the servers of his former employer, PetroSaudi, which appeared to shed light on the alleged theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state-owned Malaysian investment fund known as 1MDB. The documents that Justo leaked have set off a chain reaction of investigations in at least half a dozen countries, and led to what Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, described last week as \u201cthe largest kleptocracy case\u201d in US history. According to lawsuits filed last week by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ), at least $3.5bn has been stolen from 1MDB. The purpose of the fund, which was set up by Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Najib Razak, in 2009, was to promote economic development in a country where the median income stands at approximately \u00a3300 per month. Instead, the DoJ alleged that stolen money from 1MDB found its way to numerous associates of Prime Minister Najib, who subsequently went on a lavish spending spree across the world. It also accused Najib of receiving $681m of cash from 1MDB \u2013 a claim he denied. Money from 1MDB, the US also claimed, helped to purchase luxury apartments in Manhattan, mansions in Los Angeles, paintings by Monet, a corporate jet, and even financed a major Hollywood movie. The US justice department breaks the alleged theft down into three distinct phases: the first $1bn defrauded under the \u201cpretence of investing in a joint venture between 1MDB and PetroSaudi\u201d; another $1.4bn, raised by Goldman Sachs in a bond issue, misappropriated and fraudulently diverted to a Swiss offshore company; and $1.3bn, also from money Goldman Sachs raised on the market, which was diverted to a Singapore account.     United States Department of Justice alleges that money from 1MDB was used to buy Claude Monet\u2019s Nymph\u00e9as Avec Reflets de Hautes Herbes, valued at $57.5m. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    \u201cA number of corrupt 1MDB officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account,\u201d Lynch told the press last week. \u201cThe co-conspirators laundered their stolen funds through a complex web of opaque transactions and fraudulent shell companies, with bank accounts in countries around the world, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States.\u201d PetroSaudi, which is not a party to the lawsuit, denied the US allegations and said that the DoJ\u2019s asset-forfeiture claims are \u201cno more than untested allegations\u201d. Najib, who has used every ounce of his power to obstruct investigations into the scandal \u2013 a charge he denies \u2013 is not mentioned by name in the US lawsuits, which refer to him as \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d. But the man at the centre of the intricate swindle depicted in the US lawsuits is an adviser to Najib: Jho Low, a Harrow-educated 29-year-old friend of the prime minister\u2019s stepson. Low, a babyfaced young man who likes to party with Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton \u2013 and calls his Goldman Sachs banker \u201cbro\u201d, according to the DoJ \u2013 is accused by the US of masterminding the theft of $2bn from 1MDB, which was sent to bank accounts in Switzerland, Singapore and the Virgin Islands. Low has said that he has not broken any laws and was not being investigated.    Jho Low likes to party with Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton \u2013 and calls his Goldman Sachs banker 'bro'    Low\u2019s sidekick is Riza Aziz, Najib\u2019s stepson. Riza produced The Wolf of Wall Street \u2013 Martin Scorsese\u2019s tale of corruption, decadence and greed \u2013 and both he and Low were thanked by name in Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Golden Globes acceptance speech for best actor. In 2011, Low took a 20% stake in EMI, the world\u2019s largest music-publishing company, for $106m \u2013 in the same year, he bought a $30m penthouse for his father at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, overlooking Central Park. Riza\u2019s Hollywood production company has said: \u201cThere has never been anything inappropriate about any of Red Granite Pictures or Riza Aziz\u2019s business activities.\u201d All this and more is laid out in the US filing, which details claims of an amazing heist, carried out by conspirators who rinsed billions from the people of Malaysia through offshore accounts and shell companies in tax havens such as the Seychelles and British Virgin Islands. The scale of the enterprise echoes Balzac\u2019s maxim that behind every great fortune lies a great crime.     Jho Low with Paris Hilton at an event in Paris. Photograph: GoffPhotos.com    The global effort to uncover Malaysia\u2019s missing billions began with Xavier Justo. He leaked 90GB of data, including 227,000 emails, from his former employer PetroSaudi, an oil services company that had signed the first major deal with 1MDB. (PetroSaudi denies any wrongdoing.) Without these files, there would have been no reckoning. * * * Justo\u2019s connection to PetroSaudi was his long friendship with one of the company\u2019s two founders, a Saudi national named Tarek Obaid. The two men had met back in the late 1990s, when they both partied regularly in the nightclubs of Geneva. By 2006, the two men were inseparable: Justo had become an established businessman, running a large financial services firm, Fininfor, and the owner of a Geneva nightspot named the Platinum Club. Justo regarded Obaid as a \u201cyounger brother\u201d, and in 2008, lent him $30,000 and a desk in the Fininfor offices to help start up PetroSaudi. Obaid and Justo were an unlikely pair, brought together by a love of the high life. Justo, the son of Spanish immigrants to Switzerland, did not go to university. Obaid is a graduate of Georgetown University\u2019s prestigious School of Foreign Service. His brother, Nawaf, served as a special adviser to the Saudi ambassador to the UK. Obaid\u2019s PetroSaudi co-founder, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, is the seventh son of the late King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, who ruled Saudi Arabia from 2005 until his death in 2015. When Justo left Geneva in 2009, PetroSaudi was little more than a name on a calling card, formally incorporated in London with an address at an anonymous business unit near Victoria. Two years later, it had taken in $1.83bn. PetroSaudi\u2019s business was access capitalism: opening doors with the help of friends in high places. The basic idea was to capture a piece of the huge oil revenues being generated by state-owned firms in developing countries \u2013 treasure chests waiting to be unlocked by a firm that was a \u201cvehicle of the Saudi royal family\u201d, which could count on the \u201cfull support from the kingdom\u2019s diplomatic corps\u201d. PetroSaudi told potential partners that it controlled oil fields in central Asia, which it would put up as collateral to secure cash from state investors. This was the pitch that landed PetroSaudi\u2019s founders a meeting with the Malaysian prime minister in August 2009. Aboard a 92m megayacht off the coast of Monaco, Obaid and Prince Turki spent the day with Najib, his adviser Jho Low, and other members of the prime minister\u2019s family. Snapshots taken at the meeting have the look of a holiday cruise \u2013 baseball caps and shorts \u2013 but their discussion was serious business. What resulted was a decision for Low and Obaid to work together on a deal that would allow them both to control mind-boggling sums of money. Although Low held no formal position in the Malaysian government, he had become a trusted confidant to the prime minister. Despite his youth, Low had been instrumental in working with Goldman Sachs to set up a sovereign wealth fund to invest the revenues of an oil-rich Malaysian state. Around the time that Low and Najib went boating with the PetroSaudi founders, the Malaysian central government took control of the wealth fund \u2013 which was soon renamed as 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and given a mandate to promote economic development in Malaysia. The fund had more than $1bn to spend, and Prime Minister Najib had the sole power to approve investments and to hire and fire board members and managers. Low appeared to facilitate transactions \u2013 according to the DoJ, he even attended board meetings of 1MDB and acted as a link with the PM. The new fund\u2019s first major deal was signed a few weeks after the meeting with PetroSaudi \u2013 a $2.5bn joint venture agreement between PetroSaudi and 1MDB, inked during a visit by Najib to Saudi Arabia in September 2009. The press release said that the joint venture would \u201cmake strategic investments in high-impact projects\u201d and \u201cunderscored the confidence Saudi Arabia has in Malaysia\u201d. But, according to the US justice department, the deal was merely a \u201cpretence\u201d for \u201cthe fraudulent transfer of more than $1bn from 1MDB to a Swiss bank account\u201d controlled by Low \u2013 \u201ca 29-year-old with no official position with 1MDB or PetroSaudi\u201d. PetroSaudi has always maintained that all 1MDB funds were paid to entities owned by its shareholders. The multibillion-dollar joint venture deal was completed with extraordinary speed \u2013 in less than a month. Shortly after the yacht meeting, on 28 August 2009, Obaid had introduced Low to Patrick Mahony \u2013 the company director who handled PetroSaudi\u2019s business affairs. According to documents seen by the Guardian, Low and Mahony met for lunch in New York on 9 September to discuss the joint venture.     This drawing by Vincent Van Gogh, worth $5.5m, was allegedly bought with money from 1MDB, according to the US authorities. Photograph: Frank Baron for the Guardian    After dining at Masa \u2013 a sushi restaurant where the set menu costs $540 a head \u2013 Mahony emailed Low the next day with an offer: \u201cWe know there are deals you are looking at where you may want to use PSI [PetroSaudi] \u2026 we would be happy to do that. You need to let us know where.\u201d PetroSaudi said the documents seen by the Guardian are unreliable, stolen, fake and that they have been selectively quoted. Less than three weeks later, the deal was done. PetroSaudi would contribute $1.5bn in oil and gas assets to the joint venture, while 1MDB would inject $1bn in cash. According to the US court filing, 1MDB transferred $300m into an account belonging to the PetroSaudi joint venture, but the remaining $700m was sent to a Swiss account at RBS Coutts, controlled by a Seychelles-registered shell company named Good Star. The US justice department complaint alleges that Jho Low, and not PetroSaudi, was the beneficial owner and sole authorised signatory of Good Star. US authorities claim that officials at 1MDB provided false information to banks about the ownership of the Good Star account in order to divert the $700m. In documents seen by the Guardian, on 30 September 2009 PetroSaudi appears to direct that the $700m be paid into an account controlled by the company \u2013 but three days later, when the compliance department at RBS Coutts requested further details about the name of the beneficiary account, the address given by 1MDB was the Good Star account. On the same day, 2 October, Low emailed Mahony to say \u201cShld be cleared soon\u201d. PetroSaudi told the Guardian: \u201cNo money put into the joint venture by 1MDB was misappropriated or is missing. Its investment was repaid with profit \u2026 All transfers from 1MDB were paid with the full approval of the 1MDB board.\u201d According to documents seen by the Guardian, the Good Star transaction made Obaid, then 32, and Mahony, then 33, very rich men. Records indicate that on 30 September 2009, Good Star agreed to pay $85m to Obaid, which the Seychelles company described as a fee for \u201cbrokering services\u201d. The money was deposited into Obaid\u2019s Swiss JP Morgan account. At the same time, emails and legal documents indicate that Mahony was given a contract as \u201cinvestment manager\u201d for Good Star. On 20 October, Obaid emailed his contact at JP Morgan to request that $33m be transferred into an account belonging to Mahony. Four days later, Mahony began discussions to set up an offshore company to buy a \u00a36.7m townhouse in Notting Hill \u2013 and by 12 November, contracts for the house had been exchanged. The former banker created a numbered bank account in Switzerland, and all payments for the purchase were made from this account, via a British Virgin Islands company that Mahony had set up. In response to questions from the Guardian, PetroSaudi said the payment to Obaid was not a brokerage fee and that the transfer of $33m to Mahony had nothing to do with the PetroSaudi-1MDB joint venture. * * * Laura and Xavier Justo were blissfully unaware of their friend Obaid\u2019s changing fortunes. The couple were sunning themselves on Thailand\u2019s Andaman coast in December 2009 when Obaid rang Justo offering him a director\u2019s position in London with PetroSaudi. He told Justo the company had become an overnight success, but it needed someone who could help it grow. Justo rejected Obaid\u2019s initial offer, but he was eventually persuaded by the temptation of a well-paid \u201cadventure\u201d. According to Justo, Obaid promised him a salary of \u00a3400,000, \u201cmillions in bonuses\u201d and the perk of a \u00a310,000-a-week flat in Mayfair, central London. Justo pitched up in London in spring 2010, and by June was a PetroSaudi director. But he was kept out of the lucrative Asian business. Instead, Justo, a native Spanish speaker, was tasked with launching a new operation in Venezuela, and spent much of 2011 flying between London and Caracas.     Xavier and Laura Justo. Photograph: Javier Justo for the Guardian    Between September 2010 and May 2011, 1MDB agreed to lend an additional $830m to the joint venture with PetroSaudi \u2013 bringing 1MDB\u2019s total investment to $1.83bn. Of these new payments, US officials allege, $330m was paid into the Swiss account they say was controlled by Low, on the basis of a request by Obaid \u2013 who is identified in the US legal complaint as \u201cPetroSaudi CEO\u201d. Emails and bank records seen by the Guardian suggest that in the nine months from September 2010, Obaid transferred $77m from his Swiss JP Morgan account to his PetroSaudi co-founder, Prince Turki bin Abdullah. According to the US authorities, banking records show that in the spring of 2011, Prince Turki also received $24m from the Good Star account controlled by Low \u2013 and that \u201cwithin days\u201d, $20m from these funds was transferred to an account belonging to the Malaysian prime minister, Najib. Meanwhile, Low was becoming known on the New York club scene as a fixer for the global super-rich \u2013 snapped by paparazzi swigging magnums of Cristal with R&amp;B singers and Hollywood stars. According to US authorities, Low spent $100m from the joint venture transactions on properties in Hollywood and $40m on New York apartments. The funding for The Wolf of Wall Street, the US complaint alleges, can be directly traced to the billion dollars diverted from the PetroSaudi joint venture. In the meantime, Justo was growing disaffected with working conditions at PetroSaudi. According to his wife, Laura, the first sign of discontent was his discovery that his salary payments were only about half of what Justo said Obaid had offered him \u2013 a slight that was compounded when he learned that the promised multimillion-pound bonus would be considerably less than that \u2013 more like six figures than seven. There were other niggles, too. He complained to Laura that he was often paid late, and sometimes not at all. He claimed that he ended up paying rent on the flat in Mayfair that was supposed to be covered by his employers.     Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street. Photograph: Allstar/Paramount Pictures    At first, Justo told Laura, he thought these were just mishaps \u2013 nothing malicious, just poor corporate bookkeeping. But he became increasingly dismayed by Obaid\u2019s behaviour. Justo told friends that Obaid had become \u201carrogant\u201d after striking it rich. Justo was especially disturbed by what he described as changes in his younger Saudi friend \u2013 telling other people that Obaid had become irrational, and displayed \u201cuncontrollable\u201d rage. Justo and Obaid\u2019s long friendship, stretched to breaking point over 12 months of highly charged corporate life, finally snapped. At the end of 2010, Justo missed a flight for an important meeting. He apologised to Obaid, but according to Justo, his friend \u201cwent mad\u201d, sending him a stream of abuse, via text messages and emails. Sick with worry, Justo decided to resign in March 2011. In the angry email exchanges that followed, Obaid called Justo \u201carrogant\u201d and a \u201csmart ass\u201d. In April, things came to a head in Mayfair. Amid the marble, dark leather and metal art deco detailing of the exclusive Connaught hotel bar, Mahony and Justo hammered out the terms of his departure. According to Justo, Mahony had agreed to pay him about 6.5m Swiss francs (\u00a35m) in severance. However, in the midst of a heated conversation, Mahony\u2019s phone rang. It was Obaid, who apparently told Mahony to settle on 5m Swiss francs (\u00a33.85m). Justo, who had poured his heart out to Mahony, telling him he was at his \u201clowest point emotionally\u201d, shed tears. A day later, Justo claims that he was told his severance package would, in fact, be 4m Swiss francs (\u00a33m). As the rancour set in, Justo took a copy of the data on the PetroSaudi servers. In September 2013, a little more than two years after he had left PetroSaudi, Justo sent a fateful email to Mahony. Justo was insistent that he be paid what was owed to him, warning that he had a file of information on PetroSaudi. \u201cThe official side paints a nice picture but the reality is commissions, commissions, commissions,\u201d he wrote.    What troubles me so much is the way in which I see this situation ending \u2013 with the destruction of you  Patrick Mahony     In the furious exchanges that followed, Mahony accused Justo of blackmail. Mahony presciently told his former colleague: \u201cWhat troubles me so much is the way in which I see this situation ending \u2013 with the destruction of you.\u201d * * * A few months later, over a Chinese meal in London, the journalist who would break open the 1MDB scandal first heard rumours about an extraordinary heist in Malaysia. Clare Rewcastle Brown met a contact at a restaurant in Bayswater who showed her screen grabs of internal documents from PetroSaudi: on a single printed page, there were highlights of PetroSaudi\u2019s dealings with 1MDB, under the heading \u201cThousands of documents related to the deal (emails, faxes and transcripts)\u201d. She recognised the names and the deal. Her heart skipped a beat. \u201cA bomb went off in my head,\u201d Brown recalled. She knew right away that this was a huge story. Rewcastle Brown is a classic British rebel at the heart of the establishment. She was born on the island of Borneo \u2013 part of which now belongs to Malaysia \u2013 when it was still part of the British empire, where her father was a colonial policeman and head of the local intelligence service. Her brother-in-law is the former British prime minister Gordon Brown. After working as a reporter for the BBC, in 2010 Rewcastle Brown set up Sarawak Report, a website dedicated to uncovering corruption in the place of her birth. Working out of her tiny kitchen in central London, she published story after story exposing corruption in the timber and oil industries that were despoiling the country\u2019s rainforests for profit. Her email was hacked and she received death threats, but she carried on, regardless. Early in 2013, Malaysian politicians labelled her an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d. Rather than be cowed, she considered this a badge of honour. In person, Rewcastle Brown is a curious mix of the bawdy and the brave, almost to the point of recklessness. Her mantra: \u201cI just want the story.\u201d After the meeting in Bayswater, Rewcastle Brown knew she needed to get the 1MDB documents. The first hurdle was that the source of the PetroSaudi papers apparently wanted millions for the information. It was money she did not have. Another stumbling block was that no journalist in Malaysia wanted to touch the story. In Malaysia, Prime Minister Najib had just won a tightly contested election, and was flush with power. Rumours were swirling around the cache of PetroSaudi documents \u2013 some said the Russian mafia was behind the data dump, while others speculated that it might be an elaborate trap, set by the prime minister to ensnare his critics. Undeterred, Rewcastle Brown arranged with her contact to meet the source in Thailand. In October 2014, she pitched up at the lobby of the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e hotel, in Bangkok. She had told her husband she was hoping to meet a \u201cbalding bespectacled short Swiss guy\u201d. Instead, into the foyer stepped Xavier Justo \u2013 muscular and 6ft 6in tall. Rewcastle Brown was faced with a \u201cphysically imposing, extremely elegant\u201d man. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she thought. \u201cThis guy is going to duff me up.\u201d But Justo admitted that he was just as scared as she was. According to Rewcastle Brown, he seemed \u201cvery, very nervous\u201d and repeatedly warned her that \u201cthe people we were dealing with were ruthless, had huge amounts of money and were very, very powerful \u2013 and they could do what they liked to us\u201d. Justo told Rewcastle Brown that he wanted $2m in exchange for the PetroSaudi-1MDB documents. It was, he said, the money he should have been paid when he left PetroSaudi. Although he shared a few documents at the meeting, Justo was adamant: no cash, no data. Rewcastle Brown needed to find a rich person prepared to pay for the papers. At around this time, concerns about 1MDB had begun to spread in Malaysia. Financial analysts pointed out that the fund was not generating enough cash to cover interest payments on the billions of dollars of debt it had acquired. The hundreds of millions that had been spent on art work, jewellery, real estate, gambling and parties did not realise any return on the \u201cinvestment\u201d. By 2014, Prime Minister Najib\u2019s political opponents had taken to taunting him with the accusation that the wealth fund should be renamed \u201c1Malaysia\u2019s Debt of Billions\u201d. In August 2014, Najib received another political blow. Mahathir Mohamad, the towering figure of modern Malaysian politics who served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, announced that he was withdrawing support for Najib, his former protege. In the weeks that followed, Mahathir became more vocal in his criticism, warning that 1MDB was adding to Malaysia\u2019s dangerously high debt levels. This warning went unheeded. The fund\u2019s debt swelled. By November 2014, 1MDB owed almost $11bn. Najib, who chaired the fund\u2019s advisory board, appeared unconcerned, telling the state news agency that the government was not liable for the debt if the fund went bankrupt.      The journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown helped uncover the Malaysian money trail. Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian    As the crisis deepened, Rewcastle Brown continued her quest for a person willing to pay Justo for the PetroSaudi-1MDB documents. She noticed that some of the most searching reporting on the scandal had appeared in Malaysia\u2019s best-selling business weekly, the Edge. Sensing that she may have found a wealthy ally, Rewcastle Brown contacted the Edge\u2019s owner, Tong Kooi Ong, a former banker turned media tycoon, who owned a number of business publications. In January 2015, Tong, Rewcastle Brown and Justo met in a five-star Singapore hotel, the Fullerton. Tong booked a conference room, and brought a number of IT experts, as well as the editor of the Edge, Kay Tat. At the meeting, Justo laid out the 1MDB joint venture, making the same claims that the US Department of Justice would set out 18 months later: namely that hundreds of millions of dollars that were intended for economic development in Malaysia had instead been diverted into a Seychelles-based company. The man at the centre of the transaction was alleged to be Najib\u2019s adviser and family friend, Jho Low. It was a potentially huge scoop. Tong agreed to pay Justo $2m. Tong and Rewcastle Brown were immediately handed disk drives with the data. But the payment was never made. Justo did not want the money in cash, and he worried that a large transfer of funds into his account would look suspicious. Tong offered Justo one of his Monets as collateral \u2013 but Justo declined, and said \u201cno, I trust you\u201d. Rewcastle Brown finally had the documents she had been chasing for more than six months. * * * On 28 February 2015, Rewcastle Brown posted the first big story online \u2013 under a typically unrestrained headline: \u201cHEIST OF THE CENTURY!\u201d The article claimed to show how $700m had disappeared from the 1MDB joint venture and found its way into various offshore companies and Swiss bank accounts. The impact of the article was felt around the world. In the US, law enforcement officials who had been alerted to reports that Low was spending huge amounts on New York apartments now had a fix on the possible source of his wealth. While researching the story, Rewcastle Brown had teamed up with the Sunday Times, which helped her decrypt the files Justo had given to her. The paper ran an interview with Mahathir, the former Malaysian prime minister, who called for an immediate investigation and a full audit. \u201cSomebody must be doing something stupid to part with $700m for no very good reason as far as I can see,\u201d he said. In Malaysia, the response was immediate. On 1 March 2015, 1MDB\u2019s management claimed that it had exited the joint venture in 2012, and that it had received back its investment in full, with an additional profit of $488m. PetroSaudi claimed that the $700m had all gone to \u201cPetroSaudi-owned entities\u201d \u2013 denying, in other words, that companies controlled by Jho Low had received payments in the deal. Not long before Rewcastle Brown\u2019s story broke, 1MDB\u2019s bonds had been effectively downgraded to junk. After another \u00a3200m of Malaysian government funds were required to plug a hole in 1MDB\u2019s finances, Najib bowed to the inevitable and ordered investigations by the country\u2019s auditor general and the parliamentary accounts committee. Soon, the country\u2019s central bank and anti-corruption agency were also looking at 1MDB. Malaysia\u2019s top policeman was reported as saying that the prime minister would also be investigated. Najib tightened his grip on power. As prime minister and finance minister, he wielded enormous authority: in April, the government pushed through harsh penalties and restrictions on free speech, particularly on social media. Five executives of Tong\u2019s The Edge Media Group \u2013 which had also published details of the PetroSaudi deal \u2013 were arrested for sedition. The government also introduced a new law, ostensibly aimed at terrorists, which allowed suspects to be detained indefinitely. In July 2015, the Edge weekly was banned from publishing. Although the scandal only seemed to be getting bigger, it had not ensnared Prime Minister Najib personally. Then, on 2 July, Rewcastle Brown and the Wall Street Journal reported that Malaysian government investigators had discovered that $681m from banks, agencies and companies with ties to 1MDB had been deposited in Najib\u2019s private accounts in 2013. A few days later, investigators raided the offices of 1MDB. Najib was now at the centre of a corruption probe relating to allegations that billions of dollars had disappeared from a Malaysian investment fund he controlled. Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, once a supporter of Najib, publicly called on him to answer questions about the fund. It seemed that Najib was cornered.     Malaysia\u2019s Prime Minister Najib Razak strengthened his grip on power as the 1MDB scandal gathered pace. Photograph: Reuters    On the morning of Monday 28 July, the attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail \u2013 a party loyalist who had previously gone after the prime minister\u2019s opponents \u2013 arrived at his office expecting to finalise corruption charges against Najib. The indictment, which Rewcastle Brown later obtained and published, would have charged the prime minister with corruption resulting from the investigations into 1MDB. The attorney general never got to press those charges. On reaching his office, he was summarily dismissed by a civil servant. In a public statement, Najib said the country\u2019s top legal officer was too ill to continue in the role. Also relieved of their posts were the head of special branch and the deputy prime minister. Meanwhile, four members of the investigating parliamentary accounts committee were promoted, without any choice, to cabinet positions, which left them with no power to continue investigating, and the committee\u2019s work was declared suspended. The next day, a mysterious fire swept through police headquarters, where records of white-collar crimes were kept. It seemed that Najib was in control again. * * *  The crackdown revealed a ruthless side to Najib. However, there was a loose end that could unravel everything: Xavier Justo. Not only had Justo leaked information about 1MDB\u2019s dealings with PetroSaudi, he was also a potential star witness in any future court proceedings about the financial scandal.    Justo was placed in a cell with 70 other prisoners. The floor was covered with sweat and urine    After Justo was arrested for blackmail and flown to Bangkok in June 2015, he was placed in a cell with 70 other prisoners. The floor was covered with sweat and urine, and the room was so tightly packed that prisoners could not sleep on their backs. According to Justo\u2019s wife Laura, her husband\u2019s first foreign visitor was his former friend, colleague and PetroSaudi director, Patrick Mahony. Smooth and charming, Mahony flashed a smile and said he was there to help. Laura says that Mahony offered Justo a deal: confess and plead guilty, and PetroSaudi will get you out of here by the end of the year. Justo reluctantly agreed. He signed a confession \u2013 without a lawyer present \u2013 which claimed that he had attempted to blackmail his former employers, and apologised to Mahony and Obaid \u201cfor the harm stress and anxiety I caused them\u201d. According to Laura, a man who claimed to be a Scotland Yard detective \u2013 and later told her he had been hired by PetroSaudi \u2013 took down Justo\u2019s confession. (PetroSaudi told the Guardian that Justo had \u201cillegally obtained commercially sensitive, confidential and private documentation\u201d and was in prison for \u201cblackmail and extortion\u201d.) Justo was sentenced on 17 August 2015 at Southern Bangkok criminal court. At the trial he was granted a translator, but his lawyer did not turn up, sending an assistant instead. The trial and sentencing took 15 minutes. Justo got three years in a Thai jail for attempting to blackmail a UK company out of $2m. Life behind bars in Klong Prem Central prison, where Justo is incarcerated, is not for the fainthearted. In a city where temperatures rarely drop below 26C, Justo shares a cramped \u201cVIP\u201d cell with 25 other prisoners. Breakfast is at 7am. Water is rationed. Prisoners have no food after 3pm. There is a small bathroom area at the rear of the cell, which consists of a tap and a hole in the floor for a lavatory. As 2015 wore on and it became clear that her husband was not going to be out of jail by the end of the year, Laura grew increasingly suspicious of her contacts at PetroSaudi. A series of stories in the Swiss and Malaysian press purporting to tell Justo\u2019s side of the story depicted him as an unwitting pawn in a political plot against the Malaysian prime minister. Things were not getting better for Justo \u2013 they were getting worse. In his prison cell, Justo was now sleeping on a thin blanket \u2013 his mattress was withdrawn a few months after he arrived, as was his exercise hour. Laura came to believe that Justo was a victim of a deceit by his former friends, who tricked him into confessing and handing over copies of PetroSaudi\u2019s servers, in an attempt to protect themselves and their Malaysian associates by burying the case. In May 2016, in a last-gasp effort to save her husband, Laura turned to the one person who she knew Justo trusted: Rewcastle Brown, who brought her to the Guardian. When I met Laura in June 2016, she was at first calm and composed, but broke into tears when speaking about her husband, her voice cracking with emotion. Justo has not seen their son since he was eight months old. \u201cI only want justice to be done,\u201d Laura recently wrote in an email. \u201cXavier was no thief, he was only asking for what he had been promised. Even through this darkest and most difficult time of his life, which is right now, he writes to me that he is keeping strong for our son and I \u2013 that he will fight for us whatever it takes.\u201d Since reaching out to Rewcastle Brown and the Guardian, Laura has handed over notes smuggled out of prison in which Justo says he has been framed. Laura believes that Patrick Mahony of PetroSaudi has controlled Justo\u2019s life behind bars, deciding how comfortable his living space would be and who could visit him. (Foreign prisoners have a list posted outside the prison of permitted visitors. Mahony is listed as number two. Laura is number five.) Laura says she has emails and WhatsApp messages, as well as recordings of phone calls from last year that suggest that Mahony is under increasing pressure from Najib, on one hand, and from US and Swiss investigators combing through 1MDB\u2019s deals, on the other. In taped telephone conversations with Laura, Mahony appears obsessed with Rewcastle Brown, whom he refers to as a \u201cbitch\u201d. In a recorded conversation with Laura from November 2015, Mahony refers obliquely to a powerful person whom he claims could help reduce Justo\u2019s sentence: \u201cI told you the other evening, who the ultimate person is controlling this, and I am due to have another meeting with him soon \u2026 This guy is still stressed because it\u2019s his political career on the line. He\u2019s in deep shit and that\u2019s all he cares about, nothing else.\u201d When Laura asks what she should tell her husband, Mahony says: \u201cThe only way that you can show that you\u2019re on his side \u2013 to be a team player \u2013 is if you\u2019re ready to put yourself out in the media. You are ready to denounce all the people who are conspiring against him \u2026 I am not going to lie to you \u2026 You can help the situation or you cannot help the situation.\u201d           Patrick Mahony calls Xavier Justo\u2019s wife, Laura \u2014 audio    When Laura presses for Justo\u2019s release, Mahony snaps. \u201cI\u2019m still dealing with this shit every day. You need to remember we are all in the shit. I know he\u2019s in prison and you are alone with the baby. And I looked at you the other day and I told you I feel for you. But me, I\u2019m also in the shit. And a lot of other people are in the shit. A prime minister of a country is in deep shit because he has been put in this shit.\u201d By December, Mahony admits in another phone call that he had been to the US, where \u201cthe FBI is looking at all this shit\u201d and that he had been pulled in by the Swiss attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cThe Swiss are continuing to really give us shit \u2026 They know they have nothing \u2026 But they say they are fearful of being accused of not doing anything.\u201d PetroSaudi said that it will cooperate with any official authority in any jurisdiction and added that it is not the subject of any investigation in any jurisdiction. Mahony has not been interviewed by US or Swiss officials. * * *  The consequences of Justo\u2019s leaks are still reverberating around the world. When the US Department of Justice laid out the case against 1MDB last week, it pulled no punches. \u201cThe Malaysian people were defrauded on an enormous scale,\u201d said Andrew McCabe, the FBI\u2019s deputy director. US officials told the Guardian that any party who wanted to contest the attorney general\u2019s claim must file a response in a federal court within 60 days to answer the factual allegations.     Xavier Justo leaves court in Bangkok on August 17, 2015. He was jailed for three years and remains in prison. Photograph: Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP    In a separate case, the DoJ is also investigating whether Goldman Sachs violated US banking law in its handling of $6.5bn in bond offerings that it carried out for 1MDB. The Wall Street behemoth earned $593m in fees for the issue. Goldman Sachs denied any wrongdoing. The bank told the Guardian: \u201cWe helped raise money for a sovereign wealth fund that was designed to invest in Malaysia. We had no visibility into whether some of those funds may have been subsequently diverted to other purposes.\u201d Most important was that the DoJ allegations directly contradicted repeated assertions by Prime Minister Najib about the origins and purpose of hundreds of millions of dollars that ended up in his personal bank accounts \u2013 which he had claimed was a gift from a Saudi benefactor. The DoJ filing was released at a critical moment for democracy in Malaysia. On 1 August, a draconian national security act introduced by Najib comes into force \u2013 allowing the Malaysian government to establish martial law in any designated geographic area. The law will dramatically expand the powers of Malaysia\u2019s security forces \u2013 allowing for arrests, searches and seizures without warrants and the bulldozing of buildings. But in the rest of the world, investigations into the sprawling corruption scandal are continuing to expand. In Switzerland, the US justice department identified RBS Coutts and Rothschild Bank as conduits for transactions in the corruption complaint. The Swiss attorney general is probing the billion-dollar fraud. The banks declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Singapore found \u201clapses and weaknesses\u201d in anti-money-laundering controls at major banks. For the first time in the island state\u2019s history, the authorities shut down a merchant bank. In April the United Arab Emirates froze hundreds of millions of dollars in accounts held by alleged conspirators in the 1MDB fraud and banned the account holders from travelling abroad. The board of 1MDB said that it was \u201cconfident that no wrongdoing had been committed\u201d but as a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d, its accounts for 2013 and 2014 should no longer be \u201crelied on by any party\u201d. Najib has said that he did not commit \u201cany offence or malpractice\u201d. His attorney general cleared him of corruption earlier this year. For now, the man whose revelations enabled the exposure of this vast fraud remains in a Bangkok prison. Xavier Justo was motivated by a mixture of morality and revenge \u2013 the desire to settle scores with a friend who betrayed him. To get even, he chose to blow the whistle, for a price. He may not go down in history as a hero who selflessly risked ruin to expose the truth. But in doing so, he did unwittingly sacrifice himself.  \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.  On 7 October 2016 Mr Obaid and Mr Mahony stated through their lawyers that they strongly deny claims that they deceived Mr Justo into confessing to the Thai authorities in order to bury the case, and that Mr Justo confessed because he knew there was no way out of the charges he was facing. They also deny having any control over Thai judicial or penal authorities, Mr Justo\u2019s prison conditions or the length of his sentence. They also state that as regards his employment at PetroSaudi, Mr Justo was always paid on time and in accordance with his contract, left by mutual agreement and was paid 4 million Swiss francs under a binding severance agreement.  23 December 2016: PetroSaudi, Mr Obaid and Mr Mahony also deny that a confession by Mr Justo was taken down by a former Scotland Yard detective hired by them.

When she wrote this, in her seminal work A Voice from the South, Cooper understood that progress and equality in the US could not be achieved until African-American women, who faced multiple forms of oppression, were put front and centre.  Her words ring true today as we consider those who experience intersecting oppressions and have been ignored in global efforts to achieve gender equality and end the HIV epidemic: women of colour, transgender people, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs, adolescent girls and young women, people in prison, individuals living with HIV, and sex workers. Realising that Aids cannot be stopped without putting the health and rights of those who have been neglected at the centre of our efforts, the UN, international donors, advocates and others have stepped up commitments to address the health and rights of these \u201ckey populations\u201d. Last month, the US government announced a new $100m (\u00a376m) fund to expand access to HIV prevention and treatment for these people.    Related: Private arts: Bangkok museum celebrates Thai sex industry and its workers | Oliver Holmes    While the individuals who make up these groups are diverse, with distinct health needs, they share a common experience of stigma and discrimination that prevents them from accessing health services and realising their rights. When it comes to female sex workers, there is significant work to be done to bring them to the centre of the global Aids response. The stigma they face as sex workers and women can be compounded by poverty, class, race, ethnicity, drug use, gender identity and expression, and sexual orientation. Female sex workers bear a disproportionate burden of HIV and Aids, but also have unmet needs such as family planning, safe pregnancy, abortion access and gender-based violence prevention. The causes of poor health for female sex workers are diverse but structural barriers such as criminalisation and systemic human rights violations are common. A report by the Centre for Health and Gender Equity (Change) explores the many barriers to health and rights that female sex workers face. The report highlights evidence that laws criminalising sex work put female sex workers at disproportionately high risk of harassment and violence by police, clients and intimate partners.  Criminalisation also encourages female sex workers to move their work \u201cunderground\u201d where they have less control of their working conditions, including condom use and client screening, and are less able to access essential health services. Adolescent girls who sell sex and engage in transactional sex are at especially high risk of exploitation and abuse, and face greater difficulty accessing treatment and prevention services. Based on Change\u2019s examination of peer-reviewed articles and extensive interviews with practitioners and advocates, the report concludes that decriminalisation of sex work is necessary for female sex workers to fully realise their rights and is necessary for an effective global HIV response.  However, decriminalisation is not a cure-all. National health plans should recognise female sex workers and ensure that healthcare is available, accessible and acceptable. Legal services must be on hand to address rights violations. HIV prevention, treatment and care \u2013 and other health services \u2013 must be made available to adolescent girls who sell sex and engage in transactional sex, while efforts to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse must be improved and perpetrators brought to justice. The promotion of community empowerment and partnerships between sex worker-led organisations, governments and civil society must be strengthened and sustained.   Related: Amnesty International in global programme to decriminalise sex work    The report also flags US policies that are barriers to the health and rights of female sex workers, such as the anti-prostitution loyalty oath (APLO) and national security presidential directive 22 (NSPD-22). The APLO is a provision in US law that requires organisations that receive US global HIV and Aids funding to have a policy opposing prostitution.

It\u2019s a coffee shop with rough-hewn wooden tables, plentiful sunlight from wide windows, and austere pendant lighting. Then head to Takk in Manchester. It\u2019s a coffee shop with a big glass storefront, reclaimed wood furniture, and hanging Edison bulbs. Compare the two: You might not even know you\u2019re in different spaces. It\u2019s no accident that these places look similar. Though they\u2019re not part of a chain and don\u2019t have their interior design directed by a single corporate overlord, these coffee shops have a way of mimicking the same tired style, a hipster reduction obsessed with a superficial sense of history and the remnants of industrial machinery that once occupied the neighbourhoods they take over. And it\u2019s not just London and Manchester \u2013 this style is spreading across the world, from Bangkok to Beijing, Seoul to San Francisco. It\u2019s not just coffee shops, either. Everywhere you go, seemingly hip, unique spaces have a way of looking the same, whether it\u2019s bars or restaurants, fashion boutiques or shared office spaces. A coffee roaster resembles a WeWork office space. How can all that homogeneity possibly be cool? In an essay for the American tech website The Verge, I called this style \u201cAirSpace\u201d. It\u2019s marked by an easily recognisable mix of symbols \u2013 like reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and refurbished industrial lighting \u2013 that\u2019s meant to provide familiar, comforting surroundings for a wealthy, mobile elite, who want to feel like they\u2019re visiting somewhere \u201cauthentic\u201d while they travel, but who actually just crave more of the same: more rustic interiors and sans-serif logos and splashes of cliche accent colours on rugs and walls.   Related: Am I a hipster? You asked Google \u2013 here\u2019s the answer | Joel Golby    Hence the replicability: if a hip creative travels to Berlin or Tallinn, they seek out a place that looks like AirSpace, perhaps recommending it on Foursquare or posting a photo of it to Instagram to gain the approval of culturally savvy friends. Gradually, an entire AirSpace geography grows, in which you can travel all the way around the world and never leave it. You can hop from cookie-cutter bar to office space to apartment building, and be surrounded by those same AirSpace tropes I described above. You\u2019ll be guaranteed fast internet, strong coffee, and a comfortable chair from which to do your telecommuting. What you won\u2019t get is anything interesting or actually unique. There are several causes of AirSpace. The first is that mobility is increasing: more people move more quickly around the world than ever before, mostly passing through the same urban hotspots (London, New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong), and carrying their sense of style with them. It\u2019s globalisation, but intensified, made more accessible to a wider economic spectrum of people, more of the time. Mobility is not just for the rich any more: working remotely is increasingly common; you can take a sabbatical to work from Bali and not miss a beat. Taste is also becoming globalised, as more people around the world share their aesthetic aspirations on the same massive social media platforms, whether it\u2019s Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or Foursquare, with their hundreds of millions or billions of users. As algorithms shape which content we consume on our feeds, we all learn to desire the same things, which often happens to involve austere interiors, reclaimed wood, and Edison bulbs, like a metastasised real-life version of Kinfolk magazine or Monocle. Startups are also growing to provide these experiences of sameness as a product, predicated on the fact that we now prefer consuming ready-made generic spaces to creating new ones of our own. We\u2019ve been infantilised. The companies use technology to foster a sense of easy placelessness; Roam, for example, is an international chain of co-living and working spaces that offers the same lifestyle (and same furniture) in Madrid, Miami and Ubud, and residents can live anywhere for \u00a31,500 per month. WeWork\u2019s WeLive branch creates wan dormitories for mobile tech workers, each with its own raw-wood furniture and mandated techno-kitsch interior decorating.   Related: Airbnb: from homesharing cool to commercial giant    But the king of AirSpace is Airbnb. The platform enables users to travel seamlessly between places, staying in locals\u2019 apartments. Its slogan is \u201cyou can belong anywhere\u201d. But all Airbnbs have a way of looking like AirSpace, too \u2013 consultants who work with Airbnb hosts as well as the company\u2019s own architects told me that a certain sameness is spreading, as users come to demand convenience and frictionlessness in lieu of meaningful engagement with a different place. Heading to yet another copycat coffee shop with your laptop isn\u2019t \u201clocal\u201d. Why go anywhere if it just ends up looking the same as whatever global city you started from? It\u2019s not just boring aesthetics, however. AirSpace creates a division between those who belong in the slick, interchangeable places and those who don\u2019t. The platforms that enable this geography are themselves biased: a Harvard Business School study showed that Airbnb hosts are less likely to accept guests with stereotypically African-American names. There\u2019s also the economic divide: access to AirSpace is expensive, whether it\u2019s a \u00a33 cortado or the rent on a WeLive or Roam apartment. If you can\u2019t afford it, you are shut out. AirSpace is convenient, yes. It helps its occupants feel comfortable wherever they are, settled in amid recognisable reminders that they are relevant, interesting, mobile and global. You can change places within it with a single click, the same anonymous seamlessness of an airport lounge but distributed everywhere, behind the facades of local buildings that don\u2019t look like hotels, but act like them. Yet the discontent of this phenomenon is a creeping anxiety. Is everywhere really starting to look just the same? Glance around and you might be surprised. The next time you pick out a cafe or bar based on Yelp recommendations or Foursquare tips, or check into an Airbnb, each system driven by an audience of similar people, check if you see reclaimed wood furniture, industrial lighting, or a certain faux-Scandinavian minimalism.

The Election Commission of Thailand released its \u201cunofficial\u201d results just hours after the polls closed on Sunday.  With 90% of the votes counted, about 61% of voters had backed the new charter \u2013 the country\u2019s 20th constitution since 1932. A 55% turnout fell well short of the 80% the commission had forecast, falling short even of the 57% who voted in the country\u2019s last referendum in 2007.   Related: Thailand constitutional referendum: all your questions answered    Wantana Kasetsalee, a Thai parliamentary officer overseeing a polling station in Bangkok\u2019s Ekkamai neighbourhood, told the Guardian there were fewer voters at her station than previous elections, yet she never doubted the outcome, and laughed when asked which way she voted. \u201cYes! Of course yes, [this constitution is] more useful for the people.\u201d The commission said the unofficial tally meant some 27.6 million Thais had voted atmore than 95,000 polling stations. Having taken power in a 2014 coup, Thailand\u2019s interim, military-backed National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) had presented the referendum as a major step on its roadmap to \u201cfully functioning democracy\u201d. It claims the new constitution will enhance the ability of the next government to fight against corruption, while ensuring that the current programme of reforms will not be cut short. However, rights groups say the constitution extends too much power to the unelected NCPO, meaning its influence would remain well past its interim tenure.  The NCPO, which toppled the government of Yingluck Shinawatra in a coup in May 2014, has stifled the media and banned political gatherings. Ahead of the referendum, political rallies and open discussion about the constitution were banned, and criticism of the draft was made punishable by 10 years in jail. The targeted suppression of no vote campaigners resulted in what Amnesty International called \u201cexcessive, unnecessary and unjustifiable restrictions.\u201d  On Sunday morning, in the Phaya Thai district of central Bangkok, the interim premier and leader of the NCPO, Prayuth Chan-ocha, cast his ballot before urging the country\u2019s 50 million-strong electorate to follow his lead. \u201cThis is about the future of Thailand \u2026 let\u2019s create a landslide [turnout] and make history.\u201d One woman in the crowd interrupted Prayuth, shouting: \u201cCan you manage the country? Can you protect the country?\u201d She was then quickly taken away by security.

A tomboy in her youth, she loved the physicality of the martial art, quickly won her black belt and made the Iranian national team. Then, aged 18, she got hit by a car. Her spine was shattered and she lost the use of both legs. Thirteen years later and Nemati is at her first Olympic Games. She has not made a Lazarus-like recovery; she uses a wheelchair to get around, which makes navigating the cracked pavements and high kerbs of Rio a particular trial. It also makes her stand out from every other athlete in competition. None of them will be returning to Rio in September to compete in the Paralympics as well. That is what is on Nemati\u2019s agenda, when she hopes to defend the Paralympic title she won in London in 2012, when she became the first Iranian woman to win a gold in either the Olympics or Paralympics. Nemati\u2019s Paralympic gold was in archery, not taekwondo. Below-the-waist paralysis put paid to her dreams of being world No1 in a sport based around kicking someone else in the face. It was not easy to accept she could no longer do the sport she loved, she recently told a Japanese documentary crew. \u201cAs a taekwondo athlete, not being able to use my legs was like a pianist losing their arms,\u201d she told WowWow TV.   Related: Rio 2016 Olympics: green diving pool mystery, boxing and hockey \u2013 live!    After winning in London she said: \u201cI wanted to show the Iranian youth, especially girls, that the Iranian women are no worse than others, and we may even win the Paralympic and receive medals. I wanted to break the stereotype and I\u2019m very glad that I did it.\u201d In another first, she was chosen to be the flag-bearer for Iran at Friday\u2019s opening ceremony in the Maracan\u00e3 stadium, leading out a team dominated by men. Though winning another Paralympic gold is a realistic target, Nemati dared to dream big before making her Olympic debut, despite ranking 49th after her qualifying round at the Samb\u00f3dromo on Tuesday. Though far from a favourite, she insisted she was going for gold: \u201cThe most important thing is to believe in yourself, then anything can come true,\u201d she said. Determination has always been Nemati\u2019s strong suit. That and not feeling sorry for herself. After her accident, she refused to mope about being miserable, her mum, Fatemeh, told the documentary: \u201cShe was always smiling. Never complained or cried. Can you believe that?\u201d The only bad thing about having Nemati on the squad is that she makes everyone else look lazy, one team-mate told the WowWow director: \u201cI get embarrassed because Zahra is always training even when her able-bodied team-mates are tired. She really encourages us,\u201d he said, somewhat sheepishly. When it became clear that Nemati was going to have to switch sports, it was on the archery field that she found her new home. She picked up her bow in 2007, three years after her accident. \u201cArchery made me strong \u2014 and taught me the meaning of strength,\u201d the 31-year-old said in the documentary. \u201cWhen I was 18 I lost the ability to walk in a car accident. I was close to losing my life. But I had a chance to live.\u201d The London Paralympics were special\u00a0to Nemati for reasons that transcend sport. The night she won gold she got engaged to another Iranian para\u00a0star, fellow archer Roham Shahabipour, and celebrated in the Olympic village with the rest of the national squad. The couple had met at an association for athletes many years earlier. They had a lot in common: he too had been born without disabilities. A former electrician, he damaged his spine in 2001 when he was hit by a falling pole. Only a very select group of athletes have competed in both an Olympics and a Paralympics in the same year. Oscar Pistorius is the most famous, having done the double in London 2012, now notorious for all the wrong reasons. The last archer to take part in both was Italy\u2019s Paola Fantato at Atlanta 1996. Nemati qualified fair and square. She won her Olympic place last year with a superb performance at the 2015 Asian Archery Championships in Bangkok, Thailand, where she won silver in the women\u2019s recurve. When she was pushed on to the fake grass at the Samb\u00f3dromo on Tuesdayyesterday, Nemati looked calm and composed beneath her tight white headscarf and glasses. She started well, scoring a maximum 10 points with her first arrow against the Russian, Inna Stepanova. The sparse crowd quickly took sides, greeting the Russian\u2019s first winning set with near silence and then cheering the Iranian wildly when she won the second set with an eight and two perfect 10s. \u201cArchery needs a calm heart,\u201d Nemati said beforehand. Alas, it was not to be, and Stepanova won three sets to one. Afterwards Nemati was too tearful to talk straight away. Her translator coaxed her round and she answered questions from reporters. \u201cI did my best but my opponent was really good,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she beat me.\u201d It felt different from the Paralympics, she said. \u201cThe difference is the stress that I had here. The Olympics are more stressful.\u201d Asked what message she would like to send to other people with disabilities around the world, she\u00a0perked up: \u201cDon\u2019t let disability defeat you.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-08-09T22:06:01Z", "tags": ["Rio 2016", "Olympic Games", "Paralympics 2016", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/zahra-nemati-olympics-heart-and-minds-archery", "title": "Trail-blazer Zahra Nemati wins hearts and minds with stirring effort in archery", "sentences": ["She won her Olympic place last year with a superb performance at the 2015 Asian Archery Championships in Bangkok, Thailand, where she won silver in the women\u2019s recurve."]}, {"article": "The coordinated bomb and arson attacks across Thailand\u2019s southern provinces may signal a new phase of confrontation and brinkmanship, following the vote in favour of a military-backed constitution in a referendum on Sunday. Such incidents are not unheard of in Thailand. Violence and mayhem is an almost daily occurrence in the three southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat, where a deadly Malay-Muslim insurgency pushing for greater administrative autonomy from Bangkok has raged for more than a decade.  However, with few exceptions, the insurgents have operated in these stronghold provinces, where they can perpetrate violence at will, and have not targeted tourists. If they had wanted to send a message to the junta, the insurgents would more likely have attacked Bangkok, or major cities such as Chiang Mai or Phuket City.   Related: Tourist towns of Phuket and Hua Hin in Thailand hit by deadly explosions    Thailand\u2019s deadliest bomb blast, the attack on the Erawan shrine in August 2015 that killed 20 people, has been linked to the deportation of Muslim Uighur migrants to China and seen as a one-off.  External militant groups such as Islamic State have been unable to make inroads into the insurgency, which suggests that international terrorism is not to blame for the attacks late on Thursday and Friday.  Domestic political unrest, a major source of small-scale bomb blasts over the past decade, since the ousting of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, is therefore the most likely explanation. As the Shinawatra family and its political machinery have fought back against the generals, the resultant red versus yellow divide and accompanying street demonstrations by both sides have been marred by periodic gunshots and small explosions. What sets apart the latest attacks is their timing and selected targets. The violence has come within a week of the passage of a constitution that vests substantial power and authority in a 250-member senate appointed by the junta to keep elected representatives in check. Against a backdrop of stifled media and a ban on political gatherings, and with a 59% turnout (61% in favour), Thai voters endorsed a constitution that will set the political direction for the coming years. The anti-junta forces who lost out in the referendum have an incentive to show bold defiance and lay down a challenge against the regime.  Furthermore, the tourist resorts that have been targeted, including major destinations such as Phuket island and Hua Hin, are located in the southern provinces that voted overwhelmingly for the pro-military charter. Tourism is a key part of the Thai economy. Targeting these destinations discredits the military\u2019s vaunted ability to maintain law and order, and dampens economic prospects under the junta\u2019s rule. Finally, the bombs went off around the 84th birthday celebrations of Queen Sirikit. Given that the junta has declared defending the monarchy to be its priority, the timing of the attacks is unlikely to be coincidental.

Thailand map   Friday was a national holiday in Thailand, celebrating the birthday of the queen, Sirikit, and some of the bombs were reported to have gone off after the national anthem was played on loudspeakers. Many hotels in Hua Hin, where Sirikit and her husband, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, keep a palace, were fully booked. European retirees who have bought small apartments walk up and down the miles of sand. Beachgoers from Bangkok arrive on weekends and western backpackers use the town as a party stop before heading further south to the islands.

Authorities told tourists and residents to avoid the centre of town, which was close to empty apart from a few journalists, police and locals. Thailand\u2019s explosive ordinance disposal teams combed the town looking for unexploded bombs. The teams destroyed one bomb near the railway station, which still functions but is also one of the town\u2019s main attractions. \u201cIt is chaotic as there were reports of suspicious objects in various locations,\u201d Hua Hin\u2019s chief police office, Suttipong Klay-Udom, said. \u201cEverybody is scared of danger.\u201d One hotel manager said he had stopped taking reservations as he expected guests to extend their stay over the weekend for fear of leaving the building. Staff at another hotel were being joined by guards to tighten security around the premises and check the entrances and exits. \u201cOutsiders aren\u2019t allowed to come in. We just have to keep the guests in the hotel and not let them go outside,\u201d an employee said. Prawit Wongsuwan, the deputy prime minister, said the blasts were \u201cabsolutely conducted by the same network\u201d, but added that authorities did not who was responsible, and why they attacked.

You have to listen out \u2013 as well as making your own choices. With 3,269 shows in 294 venues this year, some quadruple checking seems in order. And the whispers are sure to be in every language (although I\u2019ve just read Richard Demarco, co-founder of the Traverse, in Scotland on Sunday, lamenting Brexit\u2019s likely effect on the international diversity of the festival\u2019s future). My first stop \u2013 international festival, not fringe \u2013 is The Glass Menagerie (King\u2019s theatre). A hit on Broadway, this Tony-nominated production, attentively directed by John Tiffany, makes me see this broken ornament of a play afresh \u2013 as a tragedy of parental interference. The actors never lose sight of its emotional core: Tennessee Williams understood pity, that most uncomfortable of human emotions, better than any playwright. Cherry Jones is splendid as Amanda, a faded bloom in the bouquet of family. Kate O\u2019Flynn is excellently troubling as Laura, her handicapped daughter, with a high, helpless voice as lame as her gait. Michael Esper\u2019s Tom has an exuberance born of despair, and gentlemen callers don\u2019t come nicer or more devastatingly tactless than Seth Numrich. Designer Bob Crowley\u2019s set is dominated by a black fire escape to one side of a hexagonal room, surrounded by a hem of water. This turns the sitting room into an island, reinforcing the sense that, at least for the two women on stage, escape is impossible.     \u2018Escape is impossible\u2019: Michael Esper and Cherry Jones in The Glass Menagerie at King\u2019s theatre. Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images    The play\u2019s most cheerful line is about a moon rising over a delicatessen. Leaving the theatre, in lieu of a moon, a high wind \u2013 this is an Edinburgh summer \u2013 blows through the city and threatens to upend the tents in which the Ladyboys of Bangkok are lip-synching their way through the afternoons. Two shows I see early on have this in common: the living voice is not used without mediation on stage. This is anti-theatre \u2013 and surprisingly powerful. The subject of refugees is in the air, and in Last Dream (on Earth) (Assembly Hall, part of the Made in Scotland showcase), the audience listens through headphones. The effect is of distance from performers, displacement, a sense that the story is happening inside one\u2019s head. It is a bold, unusual, moving piece about two journeys; the epic ascent of astronaut Yuri Gagarin contrasted with the frantic anonymous traversing of refugees between Morocco and Spain in a dinghy. The atmosphere is intent, peaceful \u2013 the cast is united. Suspense builds and music is used inventively \u2013 skittish riffs on a guitar stand in as the panicky reactions of a mother to her refugee daughter\u2019s plight. The contrast between the astronaut coached to stay positive, although possibly under-explored, is suggestively set against the untaught fortitude of the refugees. The Destroyed Room (Lyceum, also international festival) could almost have been devised as a commentary on Last Dream. It is a discomfiting conversation piece from Scotland\u2019s artist-led independent theatre company, Vanishing Point, in which three middle-class people discuss their reactions not so much to terrorism and refugees as to the way that news comes to \u2013 and at \u2013 us. It looks into the complicated reasons that people might look at images of, say, the Paris killings. Cameras on stage film the conversation (which we can also see on screen) and mediate it. Does watching other people\u2019s disasters make us feel more alive? I admired the way the piece swerves between the lives of the speakers and the subjects scrutinised. It was a subdued audience that left the theatre \u2013 a compliment to the material\u2019s thought-provoking, conscience-stirring power.     \u2018Hugely enjoyable\u2019: Madame Bovary gets a hi-tech makeover in Infinity Pool. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Observer    Writer-performer Bea Roberts goes one further in Infinity Pool: a Modern Retelling of Madame Bovary (Bedlam). This is hugely enjoyable, offbeat installation theatre, made with two screens, a projector, a TV monitor and a sound deck\u2026 and no live speech at all. Roberts is the technician, a silent operator working away busily at the front of the stage, at one point rifling through and unspooling images of beautiful women and letting them pour over her body in streamers of light. The show begins with a projected quote from the novel; \u201cPoor little woman! She is gaping after love like a carp on a kitchen table.\u201d The modern Emma is a lustful, overweight anti-heroine who works for a plumber in Plymouth. The show has a panicky comedy and pain about it. It begins unforgettably with what seems to be a fight to the death with a duvet \u2013 you cannot see \u201cEmma\u201d at all as she gyrates frantically beneath it, enacting a fantasy to one of her pop idols. Flaubert would turn in his grave, but surely \u2013 if he had any sense \u2013 with pleasure.    Satie hated critics. At one point McGowan surprised me by swiping the notebook out of my lap and holding it on high    I\u2019ve always loved one-man shows that succeed in summing up a life. Erik Satie\u2019s Faction (Pleasance), performed by Alistair McGowan and directed by his wife, Charlotte Page, is one of my top fringe experiences: a beautifully polished portrait of the French composer (whose music haunted the film Last Tango in Paris). Satie was an eccentric, a misanthrope and a hypochondriac \u2013 prone to despair about his compositions and his life. He would only eat white food, liked what he perceived as a whiteness in his own music, and wore a black bowler hat. McGowan has skilfully filleted Satie\u2019s essays and poems and performs him with a gimlet-eyed facetiousness and relish. And he plays piano splendidly. Each time he plays Satie\u2019s music \u2013 icy, melancholy, eerie \u2013 the lighting becomes glacial to mark the change in mood. Listening to it, you feel you are meeting the truest version of the man. Satie hated his critics \u2013 with reason. At one point McGowan took me by surprise by swiping the notebook out of my lap and holding it up on high \u2013 Exhibit A \u2013 to the mirth of the crowd. Waves (Summerhall), which I see on the same day, is another life-in-an-hour, gracefully enacted. Alice Mary Cooper remembers Elizabeth Moncello, Australian inventor of the butterfly stroke, who ended her days in an Edinburgh hospice where Cooper worked. It is a (butterfly) stroke of luck happening upon this show (it has early morning timing on its side). A miniaturist gem, a must for swimmers and a reminder that simple story-telling still works. Familie Fl\u00f6z is a Berlin-based company that uses masks to formidable effect, and its Teatro Delusio (Pleasance) attracts a deservedly packed house. The masks have a family likeness: beige, with vast noses and expressions varying between uncomprehending and outraged. And yet, as with all the best mask work, you could swear their expressions keep changing.     \u2018A family likeness\u2019: Familie Fl\u00f6z\u2019s Teatro Delusio.    The show is based on life backstage at an Italian opera house where the stagehands are, often disastrously, ad hoc performers in their own right. It is about runaway bodies, uncertain intentions, hilarious results. Again, it is a wordless show but relatively lo-tech (just as well, given that the stagehands play poor electricians, their wires in a permanent tangle). The single most beautiful moment is at the start as a puppet catches sight of a puppeteer and shies away. She then slowly turns her anguished papier mache face to stare cautiously into his eyes. The following day I saw two rough-at-the-edges pieces that had the courage to explore ideas that one looks for on the fringe. The first was Tank (Pleasance). This intelligent, zany, disturbing piece is based on the strange story of an American researcher and college dropout in the 60s who undertook an ill-judged experiment, living with and trying to teach English to a dolphin. A powerful extended metaphor about imperialism, the story was told with pluck, a plastic dolphin mask and yards of masking tape. Faslane (Summerhall), written and performed by Jenna Watt, was a courageous, humane, penetrating piece about Trident. Watt has relatives who work at Faslane, where Trident is based. She interviewed them, and the anti-nuclear protesters camping there. What emerged \u2013 unnervingly \u2013 was evasion (\u201cThis is my job \u2013 I don\u2019t have an opinion.\u201d) This included a protester who told Watt he was there for \u201cprivate reasons\u201d. It makes a piece like this \u2013 thinking about the unthinkable \u2013 all the more precious and necessary.    I succumb to the fancy that these performers are immortal    The sheer miscellany of the fringe has an almost addictive pleasure\u2026 and yet, if you see more than four shows a day, your mind starts to whirl. I was grateful for a calm interlude with Ockham\u2019s Razor: Tipping Point (Venue 166), five mesmerising acrobats performing within a chalk circle with long white poles that support and, at times, obstruct them \u2013 like an elegantly graphic metaphor for life. They play with the idea of betrayal: there is a not-always-to-be-trusted affection between them \u2013 a hand caressing another\u2019s head, a smile, an I\u2019ll-be-there-to-catch-you-when-you-fall glance. It is magical, at one point, to see the gigantic climbing shadow of one of the acrobats (looking disconcertingly like Ralph Fiennes) projected against the wall. Sitting on the rim of their circle, I succumb to the fancy that these performers are immortal. The following day, asylum-seekers rule once more. David Greig and Cora Bissett\u2019s buoyant musical Glasgow Girls (Assembly Hall) lets us into a secret: Glasgow girls can come from anywhere. Callum Cuthbertson is great as Mr Girvan, an unconventional teacher who delights us by setting Burns\u2019s poem about a mouse to music (there is a touch of Alan Bennett\u2019s Hector in The History Boys about him). He teaches English/Scottish to his asylum-seeker pupils, makes them feel at home. The musical\u2019s achievement is to wear its generous Glaswegian heart on its sleeve without losing the seriousness of its plot to sentimentality. I loved Terry Neason\u2019s Noreen, a working-class matron who claims to have been dragooned into the show by mistake. Her singing, when it eventually comes, brings tears to the eyes. A lovely, spirited anti-bigotry romp to make Scots proud and the rest of us wonder whether to move up north.     \u2018Fidgety brightness\u2019: Shvorne Marks as the \u2018prodigal daughter\u2019 in House. Photograph: Jane Hobson    Clean Break, the company founded in 1979 by two women prisoners, offers us an impressive, absorbing and intimate (Box is a small venue)double bill. House, by Somalia Seaton, is about a prodigal daughter. Shvorne Marks plays Patricia with a fidgety brightness that reveals her nerves about coming home. Michelle Greenidge is her rejecting mother and Rebecca Omogbehin is Jemima, her peace-seeking sister. The performances are perfectly focused and every word compels. Amongst the Reeds, by Chino Odimba, is a snapshot of a story about what happens to a pregnant Vietnamese asylum-seeker (Jan Le\u2019s affecting Gillian), holed up with her 17-year-old friend, Oni (the charismatic Omogbehin again). Gillian thinks only of her unborn child. Oni worries persistently about deportation. This is moving work of unmistakable integrity and not to be missed.    Her version of Bob Dylan\u2019s Simple Twist of Fate tells you more than the riddling original    On my final evening, I see Camille O\u2019Sullivan in her extraordinary new show, The Carny Dream (Circus Hub). Her charm as a singer is irresistible, although she insists on describing herself as an \u201cIrish chancer\u201d. It is not her voice, grand though it is, that makes her. It is her interpretation of lyrics \u2013 she seems to live the songs she sings. Her version of Bob Dylan\u2019s Simple Twist of Fate tells you more than the riddling original. Her homage to Bowie is thrilling. And when she sings Peggy Lee\u2019s Is That All There Is? while flying overhead on a circus swing, she makes you want to answer that \u201call there is\u201d, in her company, is quite enough.", "publicationDate": "2016-08-14T07:00:30Z", "tags": ["Edinburgh festival 2016", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Musicals", "Tennessee Williams", "Edinburgh festival", "Fringe theatre", "Political theatre", "Trident", "Refugees"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/14/edinburgh-fringe-theatre-observer-roundup-glass-menagerie-destroyed-room-infinity-pool-familie-floz", "title": "Edinburgh theatre review \u2013 a week of masks, music - and a swiped notebook", "sentences": ["Leaving the theatre, in lieu of a moon, a high wind \u2013 this is an Edinburgh summer \u2013 blows through the city and threatens to upend the tents in which the Ladyboys of Bangkok are lip-synching their way through the afternoons."]}, {"article": "Police in Thailand have arrested two men over multiple blasts that targeted a central bar district and clock tower in the seaside resort of Hua Hin.

Resentment in other sectors of society has also been growing against the military junta, which wrestled power from the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. Military chief and self-installed prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, has promised elections but not until next year. Last week, the junta won a country-wide referendum that entrenches its power in government even if a civilian administration returns to high office. Supporters of Shinawatra and her brother Thaksin, who also served as prime minister until 2006 when the military ousted him, have been arrested and questioned by the army during its rule, causing outcries from civil rights groups. The timings of the attacks, on a national holiday for Queen Sirikit\u2019s birthday, has also been flagged as significant by analysts. The military has promoted itself as the champion of the much-revered monarchy. Hua Hin, normally full of Thai and foreign tourists, holds a large palace that King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his family use as a retreat.

In Turkey, notorious for cracking down on the media long before July\u2019s attempted coup, authorities have closed more than 130 outlets and issued warrants for 89 reporters and other media workers since the coup a month ago; 17 journalists have been charged with membership of a terror group. The journalist Can D\u00fcndar, facing six years in prison for reporting allegations of arms sales to Syrian rebel forces, is a recipient of one of this year\u2019s International Press Freedom awards from the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, together with journalists from Egypt, El Salvador and India. In China, where the Communist party has always determined which news is fit to print, authorities have ordered internet portals to abandon original reporting on political or social topics because of its \u201cextremely vile effect\u201d. There are growing concerns, too, about the editorial independence of papers in Hong Kong, which has historically enjoyed far more freedom than the mainland. Its chief executive has just appointed his dentist, a man who described editorial independence as \u201cmythologised\u201d, to chair the public broadcaster\u2019s board of advisers. Journalists are not only curbed but killed. Unesco, which tallies deaths of media workers, lists more than 50 already this year. They include Pavel Sheremet, killed by a car bomb in Kiev in July. Colleagues believe the pioneering journalist, an outspoken critic of leaders in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, was murdered in retribution for his work. In Burundi, where government attacks on independent media appear relentless, relatives of reporter Jean Bigirimana, arrested in late July, fear he is dead. At other times pressure is directed at friends and families; police in Bangkok recently detained the Thai wife of British journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall, apparently in response to a Facebook post he made from outside the country. In western democracies, too, there are challenges, including the detention of reporters covering Black Lives Matter protests and the intimidation or barring of media from campaign events in the US presidential race. The varying nature of these cases underlines the array of threats \u2013 legal, physical, even psychological \u2013 that the media face, and their various origins. The danger may come from religious, financial or even criminal sources as well as from political authorities. Clearly, some instances are more alarming than others. The common theme is that the media face pressure when they encroach upon powerful interests. The worst excesses of journalists \u2013 carelessness, callousness, sensationalism, bias \u2013 have given the trade a poor reputation. But around the world there are others working tirelessly and selflessly to inform their communities, with no prospect of wealth or glory but at considerable risk of intimidation or punishment. Journalists do not deserve protection because they constitute a privileged group; they need it because they can show the world as it really is and allow the unheard to find a voice. There is a reason why people so often want to shut them up. Halting print runs, closing down websites, silencing radio stations and blacking out TV screens are all ways of concealing misdeeds, preventing scrutiny or simply blocking alternative viewpoints. But such actions also serve to remind us all why press freedom matters. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2016.

Related: Tourist towns of Phuket and Hua Hin in Thailand hit by fatal explosions    No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks but analysts point to political enemies of the ruling junta or members of an ongoing insurgency in the Malay-Muslim-majority south. The strikes, a series of small improvised bombs that also left 10 Europeans wounded, came less than a week after the country\u2019s military rulers, who took power in 2014 coup, won a country-wide referendum on a constitution that entrenches their power in any future government.  The results antagonised the junta\u2019s political foes across the country. Hua Hin, where miles of high-rise hotels line the Gulf of Thailand coast, was the scene of the worst wave of bombs. Explosives hidden in plant pots detonated late on Thursday in the high-density bar district and again on Friday morning by the central clock tower. Another fire bomb was also found on the island of Phuket on Sunday, police said, and two devices in Phang Nga. Explosives had detonated in both those areas on Friday, as well as Surat Thani, a provincial capital used as a land route for island hopper visitors. The attacks were not linked to international terrorism but planned to create \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d, coup leader and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said. When a devastating bomb hit Bangkok a year ago, killing 22 people and wounding more than 125, the government issued several contradictory statements over the ensuing weeks, eventually announcing it was the work of a human smuggling network. However, no group ever claimed the attack. Senior figures in the main opposition Pheu Thai party said on Saturday their members were not to blame for last week\u2019s strikes. Political violence is common in Thailand and two Pheu Thai former prime ministers and siblings, Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra, were overthrown in coups in 2006 and 2014. Members of the 12-year insurgency in the south, which has left more than 6,000 people dead in a fight for greater autonomy, have also been considered as potential culprits.

Here, surrogacy packages start at $33,000 (\u00a325,400), compared with $90,000-$150,000 in the US. On agency websites, \u201ctravelling surrogates\u201d like Kew are advertised. But, like her, these women may lack clear information about the job they have signed up for.  \u201cWe have to be aware that surrogacy is a foreign concept in Cambodia. No laws are in place to regulate the process, leaving both parents and surrogates unprotected,\u201d warns Everingham. For Preeti Bista, owner of the Nepalese surrogacy agency My Fertility Angel, the unclear rules and low costs are precisely what make Cambodia an attractive place to set up what she says will be an ethical surrogacy business. \u201cSince surrogacy has been put on hold in Nepal, I have both desperate surrogates and parents calling me non-stop, asking me if I can help them. I am now trying to do just that in Cambodia. The key is to provide transparency to all parties involved.\u201d    After they left I cried for three days straight \u2026 I miss this little girl like she is my own  Surrogate mother Por, from Bangkok     Bista has been accused of exploiting people\u2019s poverty and lack of options. She says all she does is to help people have babies \u2013 \u201cthe most beautiful thing in the world\u201d. There is no doubt that the money for poorer surrogates can be life-changing. The fee from surrogacy for Baimon, 33, a fish farmer, meant she and her husband were able to invest in a new commercial fish pond, south of Bangkok. \u201cI also bought new freezers,\u201d she says. \u201cFish prices are low, so the only way for us to survive is to invest.\u201d  Baimon has delivered surrogate twins for two couples \u2013 the second C-section took place 4,000 miles from home, in Moscow. She is aware of the ban in Thailand and is hesitant about a third pregnancy, saying the new regulations make the endeavour more risky. \u201cWhy can we not protect surrogate mothers better instead of banning the practice?\u2019\u2019 she asks. \u201cNow we will lose all this money to other countries. But to some young women, making a family happy is still better than being a prostitute or dancing in the go-go bars.\u2019\u2019  Por, a corn picker from a town five hours south of Bangkok, keeps a photo of her surrogate child. \u201cA big nose and light-coloured hair, just like her daddy,\u201d she whispers. \u201cAfter they left I cried for three days straight.\u2019\u2019 Even now, says Por, \u201cI miss this little girl like she is my own.\u201d Despite the heartache, the 33-year-old is eager to do a second commercial pregnancy. Filling 100kg bags of corn in the sun every day is hard work. \u201cAs a surrogate I feared the hospital visits and medicines \u2013 but still, life was easier,\u201d she says. In addition to the main fee of 250,000 baht, each month there was a payment of 15,000 baht, which the agency encouraged her to spend on healthy groceries.   Besides the required hospital visits, Por doesn\u2019t recall any other instructions from her agency. She did not receive any counselling on the potential emotional toll of surrogacy, or any explanation on the legal (guardianship) papers she had to sign. \u201cOccasionally, my contact person would give me a call to check how I was feeling, but that was all.\u201d In the meantime, she was working in the fields and taking care of her own two boys. \u201cI will do it a second time, even if I have to travel to another country for it,\u201d she says, adding that she does it for the money, but also because the baby\u2019s Australian parents told her she had given them a precious gift.  But how long Cambodia can be Asia\u2019s new surrogate haven remains to be seen. \u201cOnly one scandal has to surface and the whole thing will fall apart,\u201d says Bista. And when that happens, the agencies, clinics and travelling surrogates will pack their bags and head elsewhere. \u201cI am sure [they] will,\u201d she adds, \u201cbecause no matter how many bans there are, you can never make people\u2019s wish to start a family disappear.\u201d  Some names have been changed  ", "publicationDate": "2016-08-19T04:00:07Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Cambodia", "Thailand", "Surrogacy", "Pregnancy", "Asia Pacific", "Life and style", "Maternal health"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/19/cambodia-foreign-surrogacy-thailand-ban", "title": "Cambodia proves fertile ground for foreign surrogacy after Thailand ban | Sarah Haaij", "sentences": ["After a long day of selling snacks at her son\u2019s primary school, Kew, who is seven months pregnant, squats on the Bangkok pavement to take a rest.", "The key is to provide transparency to all parties involved.\u201d    After they left I cried for three days straight \u2026 I miss this little girl like she is my own  Surrogate mother Por, from Bangkok     Bista has been accused of exploiting people\u2019s poverty and lack of options.", "The fee from surrogacy for Baimon, 33, a fish farmer, meant she and her husband were able to invest in a new commercial fish pond, south of Bangkok.", "But to some young women, making a family happy is still better than being a prostitute or dancing in the go-go bars.\u2019\u2019  Por, a corn picker from a town five hours south of Bangkok, keeps a photo of her surrogate child."]}, {"article": "Thai police say they are looking for a man from southern Thailand as part of an investigation into multiple bomb attacks that killed four people a week ago. Deputy national police spokesman Kissana Phatanacharoen said authorities were searching for Ahama Lengha, from Narathiwat province near Thailand\u2019s border with Malaysia. \u201cWe have only issued one arrest warrant in relation to the bomb attacks, and that is for Ahama. It\u2019s because it is clear that he is linked to what happened,\u201d Kissana said in comments to journalists. He added that Ahama had not yet been detained and police were unsure if he was still in Thailand. Ahama is the first person to be named by police since small improvised explosive devices and firebombs were detonated last Thursday and Friday in seven provinces across Thailand\u2019s south.   Related: The Guardian view on Thailand: The military is in control \u2013 but for how long? | Editorial    No group claimed responsibility for the attacks, which appeared aimed at hitting tourist sites including the island of Phuket and the beachside resort of Hua Hin. The ensuing investigation has been confusing, with the government almost immediately declaring the strikes were not the work of international terrorists but not suggesting which domestic group might be responsible. Observers increasingly point to members of an ongoing insurgency in the Malay-Muslim-majority south, a conflict that has left more than 6,000 people dead in the past 12 years.  But the Thai defence minister, Prawit Wongsuwan, said on Monday that the attacks were \u201cdefinitely not an extension\u201d of the southern insurgency. Police said they knew orders came from one individual.  The chaotic nature of the investigation mirrors the inquiry conducted after last year\u2019s bombing in Bangkok, which killed 22 people and wounded more than 125 at a Hindu shrine. The government issued contradictory statements in the weeks after the attack, eventually announcing it was the work of a people-smuggling network. However, no group ever claimed responsibility for the attack. Kissana said on Friday that police were working with Malaysia to track down other suspects in relation to last week\u2019s attacks. \u201cWe have received some answers from Malaysia that are useful and move the case forward,\u201d he said. Southern militants have focused strikes on the police and army presence in Thailand\u2019s three southernmost provinces. But the latest bombs, which also left dozens wounded, including 10 Europeans, hit provinces further north. The strikes came less than a week after the country\u2019s military rulers, who took power in a 2014 coup, won a countrywide referendum on a constitution that entrenches their power in any future government. The coup leader and prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the aim of the attacks, carried out by individuals he described as \u201cbad people\u201d, was to create \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d. The opposition was quick to deny any involvement in the bombings and accused the junta of suggesting its political foes were responsible.

Related: World heading for catastrophe over natural disasters, risk expert warns    Using analysis of floods, typhoons, earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural disasters, the 2016 world risk report (pdf), claims that decrepit infrastructure and logistics systems can become a \u201cdirect threat\u201d to societies because they can trap or injure victims, as well as impeding the delivery of humanitarian relief.  \u201cOnce you have a disaster situation, you need infrastructure to deal with it in the short term and long term, to get supplies and relief into the right places,\u201d says report co-author Dr Matthias Garschagen of the UN University \u2013 Institute of Environment and Human Security, which publishes the annual reports. \u201cNot only are the quality and quantity of the infrastructure important, but issues of redundancy are important as well: if you only have one main highway into a disaster area and that highway is blocked, do you have a helicopter, an alternative railway line, or elephant or donkey even in really remote areas, to get there?\u201d Last year\u2019s series of devastating earthquakes in Nepal are a case in point: half a million homes were destroyed, and another 250,000 badly damaged as entire villages were reduced to rubble; roads into remote mountain regions were blocked by landslides and avalanches; power supplies were cut off and telephone lines destroyed; and eight million people, nearly a quarter of Nepal\u2019s population, needed urgent humanitarian relief.      Traffic bearing evacuees in Nepal is brought to a standstill after a landslide caused by an earthquake. Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters    Although Nepal\u2019s international airport at Kathmandu escaped major damage, the volume of relief goods received was so high \u2013 and the road networks out to the areas affected so damaged \u2013 that aid effectively languished for days in the capital as a result, leaving millions of people in need of sanitation, shelter, food and water, and urgent medical care.  Poor infrastructure systems can also have far-reaching effects that go beyond the scope of the natural disaster itself, the report says. The 2011 floods that effectively shut down huge swaths of Bangkok also crippled the city\u2019s regional airport and deluged major industrial parks, costing billions of dollars in damage and lost revenue. Such situations demonstrate just how much infrastructure can shape disaster risk, says Garschagen. As natural disasters have increased dramatically  and intensity over the past three decades, investment in better logistics and infrastructure systems would not only save lives but also billions of dollars annually. According to UN figures [PDF], 346 natural disasters were recorded worldwide last year, killing 22,000 people, affecting another 100 million, and costing $66.5bn (\u00a350bn) in total. The world risk report analyses various data each year in an attempt to rate 171 countries by their disaster risk. This year\u2019s focus was on logistics and infrastructure. A number of developing countries, like Vietnam and Bangladesh, are now looking at designing and implementing disaster-resilient infrastructure systems, says Garschagen, taking into particular account flood patterns over the past few years and projections for the next 20 years. While this is a major step in the right direction, effective law enforcement is also needed, says Garschagen, pointing to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China that killed thousands of children when school buildings collapsed, effectively because the schools had not been built to code.     Partially submerged vehicles are seen stranded in floodwaters at a roundabout in Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok, in October 2011. Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images    According to World Bank estimates, additional investments of up to $1.5tn in low- and middle-income countries are needed annually until 2020, simply to establish an \u201cadequate level\u201d of infrastructure. This could be an opportunity for humanitarian organisations to branch out and look at investing in preventative areas instead of focusing solely on relief after a natural disaster has already occurred, says Garschagen. The world risk report also commends the use of new technologies \u2013 such as smart phones and drones \u2013 in sharing logistics information and mapping out relief zones, for example in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan. But the authors warn that depending on these advances as a \u201cpanacea\u201d for disaster efforts is a short-sighted mistake. \u201cA lot of the humanitarian assistance from many of the organisations today are so keen to jump on these new technologies that they forget the more political story that needs to be told,\u201d says Garschagen. \u201cSmart phones and drones will only take you so far if you don\u2019t even have the basics in place.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-08-25T09:00:07Z", "tags": ["Humanitarian response", "Global development", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Nepal earthquake 2015", "Aid"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/25/decrepit-infrastructure-denies-millions-urgent-natural-disaster-aid-report-says", "title": "Decrepit infrastructure denies millions urgent natural disaster aid, study says", "sentences": ["The 2011 floods that effectively shut down huge swaths of Bangkok also crippled the city\u2019s regional airport and deluged major industrial parks, costing billions of dollars in damage and lost revenue.", "Partially submerged vehicles are seen stranded in floodwaters at a roundabout in Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok, in October 2011."]}, {"article": "Australia fans still missing Oceania after 10 years in Asia should take a look at New Zealand. While the Socceroos prepare for Iraq on Thursday, the first of 10 intense games in the final round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup, the All Whites have no competitive action until back-to-back games with New Caledonia in November. The past two Asian campaigns under Pim Verbeek and Holger Osieck have been free from stress \u2013 but also excitement. Under Ange Postecoglou, the football should be easier on the eye but whether they will be as easy on the heart remains to be seen.   Related: Josh Risdon called up for Socceroos with Bailey Wright out of Iraq clash    The format is pretty much the same. The top two teams go through automatically while the third-placed enters the play-offs. Japan and Australia are the favourites but in contrast to the past, this time there are other teams with genuine hopes of going to the World Cup. The United Arab Emirates, where Australia will appear five days after Perth, is one. The Whites showed their talent at the 2015 Asian Cup, finishing third and are desperate to make hay while the so-called \u201cgolden generation\u201d shines. Most of their stars \u2013 Omar Abdulrahman, Ali Mabkhout and Ahmed Khalil \u2013 were not even born in 1990, the last and only time the country featured at the World Cup. They have come through the ranks together, and most recently met up at a month-long training camp in Spain. The UAE are better prepared than anyone. October brings Saudi Arabia. Coach Bert Van Marwijk has introduced a certain level of organisation and pragmatism to the Green Falcons who have lost their way and Asian powerhouse status in recent years. There will be danger in Jeddah. Striker Mohammad Al-Sahlawi scores a goal a game for his country and there will also be a strong desire, in some parts, for revenge on Australia after Al Hilal lost to Western Sydney Wanderers in a bitter final of the 2o14 Asian Champions League. Five days after that is a game in Melbourne and the usual 1-1 draw with Japan. The Samurai Blue are looking to forget disappointing performances at the 2014 World Cup and the 2015 Asian Cup \u2013 and to a lesser extent the Rio Olympics. These games will be the biggest test so far for coach Vahid Halilhodzic after 18 months in the job but the talent is there to reach a sixth successive World Cup. The first half of the final round of qualification is completed in Bangkok in November.\u00a0Officially\u00a0the weakest of the six on paper, Thailand are\u00a0much-improved from the team that pushed Osieck\u2019s side all the way in two qualifiers four years ago. Coach Kiatisuk Senamuang is close to his players and has introduced a pass and move groove inevitably labelled \u201cThai tiki-taka\u201d. The whole set-up is more professional, organised and co-ordinated than in the past with players that are better, fitter and familiar with each other. In the past there was perhaps too much respect shown to Australia but that will no longer be the case. But first up is Iraq, that most mercurial of Middle Eastern teams. In terms of raw talent, few in Asia come close but there is also an impressive ability to put bullets in their own twinkle toes. Younis Mahmoud has retired and this time it could be permanent. Despite his ability to get a goal when it is really needed, not all will miss the Desert Fox. A succession of foreign coaches have left Iraq muttering about the oversized influence of the striker. In a recent game against Syria, was it a coincidence that he turned to the bench during the game and held up seven fingers only for number seven to be substituted moments later?   Related: David Squires on ... the Socceroos' 2005 World Cup playoff against Uruguay    Without Younis, the team is more fluid, flexible and free. The football played at the Olympics was, at times, a delight to watch and while the team may have left Brazil unbeaten, there was frustration at missing out on the quarter-finals. The inability to score was the problem and that could well be the same with the senior team too. There are some excellent players. You can have Dhurgham Ismael, the young left-back and stand out at the 2015 Asian Cup and Udinese\u2019s Ali Adnan whose rampaging runs have earned the nickname of \u201cAsia\u2019s Gareth Bale\u201d.

Lance Whitmore    Jeffrey Stevens, a lawyer whose firm Thailand Bail works with both men, said he was disappointed by what he said was a severe sentence. \u201cEveryone was hoping the sentence would be reduced further,\u201d he said. He said the pair had the option to take the case to the supreme court but did not plan to do so as further appeals would also delay them from applying to be transferred to prisons in the UK and Australia. Under Thai law, Whitmore can begin that process in 23 months once he has served four years in prison, although it is not guaranteed to be successful. Mastroianni\u2019s harsher sentence means he can apply to be transferred to Australia in six years\u2019 time. However, because Whitmore pleaded guilty last year, his sentence is half as long as Matroianni\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve done every thing we can,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cAt the end of the day, Lance did plead guilty.

Mastroianni was caught with 61 pills, Stevens said. Nathan Feeney, a legal consultant for Mastroianni, said his client would have received a much lighter sentence if he had pleaded guilty, similar to Whitmore, but his previous lawyers advised him not to. The court ruled on Tuesday that the duo would not have to pay 3.3m baht (\u00a371,000) in fines, Feeney said.

Mark Allen, the head of counter-terrorism at the agency at the time of the so-called rendition operations, had set out his role in a letter to the Gaddafi government that came to light during the 2011 Libyan revolution.  However the Crown Prosecution Service decided earlier this year that Allen \u2013 now Sir Mark \u2013 should face no criminal charges, a ruling that the victims said reflected poorly on British justice. Lawyers for the couple are now seeking a judicial review of the CPS decision, which they have denounced as a \u201csee no evil, hear no evil\u201d ruling that has put the government and its intelligence agencies above the rule of law. Cori Crider of the legal charity Reprieve said: \u201cIt\u2019s sad that the CPS will aggressively prosecute journalists for \u2018misconduct in public office\u2019, but a top MI6 officer who helped render kids and a pregnant woman to Gaddafi walks free. It\u2019s sadder still that prosecutors felt victim families should have no role in the \u2018victims\u2019 review.\u2019 The family\u2019s view is clear. Justice was denied. The decision leaves the UK\u2019s security services basically exempt from British law. That\u2019s why they are fighting it.\u201d Abdel Hakim Belhaj, an opponent of Gaddafi, and his wife Fatima Bouchar, were abducted in Thailand in March 2004 while en route from Malaysia to the UK, where they had planned to apply for political asylum.  They were held briefly at an American detention facility in Bangkok, and allegedly tortured, before being bound and gagged and flown to Tripoli. Bouchar, who was pregnant, says she was taped head to foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight. Evidence of MI6 involvement emerged in correspondence between Allen and Gaddafi\u2019s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, that was discovered during the Libyan revolution. Other documents included a fax from the CIA to Tripoli, which gave details of a second UK-Libyan rendition operation, in which another opponent of Gaddafi, Sami al-Saadi, was kidnapped in Hong Kong and flown to Tripoli along with his wife and four children.  Scotland Yard spent four years investigating the kidnappings and sent a 28,000-page file to the CPS. Police are understood to believe that they had built a particularly formidable case against MI6 in the Saadi case. Detectives are said to have been dismayed that the CPS concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against Allen or anyone else. In making public their decision, the CPS disclosed that Allen had \u201csought political authority for some of his actions\u201d.  In a letter to the CPS, Belhaj\u2019s lawyers at the London firm Leigh Day claim that the decision is unreasonable.

It\u2019s believed that Brexit could put the scheme under threat and David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the EU, is being urged to protect it. Here, six people talk about their experiences of the programme. Sophie, 26, Reading: \u2018I learned that I was a lot tougher than I originally thought\u2019      I did a joint honours degree in French and Spanish, and was given the opportunity to do an Erasmus semester in each country. I first spent five months in Montpellier in the south of France and then five months in Granada in Spain.  One memory that really sticks out for me is my first evening in Granada: I had moved into my new flat earlier that day and my new French and Belgian housemates took me up to the Mirador St Nicolas, which looks over the Alhambra Palace, to watch the sunset. Anyone who has been there before will know just how stunning the view is. I remember feeling like I\u2019d won the lottery knowing that I\u2019d get to spend the next five months living and studying in such a beautiful city. My year as an Erasmus student was honestly one of the best years of my life.  If I hadn\u2019t done an Erasmus year, I would have left university not knowing all the intricacies of the language and colloquialisms that you learn from native speakers. You can learn the fundamentals of grammar in class but every language student will tell you that what really sets you apart is knowing the local lingo.  But it was about so much more than that. I had such a blast getting to know so many other people from all different nationalities and I grew so much in confidence as the year progressed.  Many people see Erasmus students as being drunken party animals. While I can\u2019t deny that I enjoyed going out and had a great time with my new international friends, the experience was also tough at times. My first six weeks in France, for example, were a huge test of patience, mental strength and perseverance. Everything from opening a bank account to getting enrolled at university was a bureaucratic nightmare.  I learned that I was a lot tougher than I originally thought. My first six weeks in Spain were an absolute breeze in comparison. I hope Erasmus isn\u2019t scrapped because it would be such a tragedy for UK students not to have the opportunity to study in Europe.  Emily Goodier, 21, Manchester: \u2018My year abroad helped me grow up and become an adult\u2019        I went to Lund University in Sweden for a year as part of my degree. Before I left, getting everything sorted involved filling in lots of paperwork and this taught me to be more organised. When I arrived, I found the programme challenging both academically and personally, but living on my own, in a foreign country (and being immersed in a new culture) taught me how to be an adult. I didn\u2019t have my mum and dad, friends or family there for support, but learned to look after myself. I also learned how to talk to people from all over the world. I had to be financially careful and one of the most valuable lessons from my time away was that it\u2019s important to seize any opportunities that come your way. I grew in confidence that year. Losing the Erasmus programme would have a huge impact on students from working-class families, such as me. I could never have afforded to study abroad without financial support. My university fees would have been much higher if I hadn\u2019t gone away for a year and I also wouldn\u2019t have been able to take a range of exciting new topics: there was much more on offer on Lund\u2019s programme. This helped me get a first-class degree.  Stephen Devincenzi, 25, Bangkok: \u2018I can\u2019t stress how awful losing this programme could be for the next generation\u2019      I spent one semester in Luxembourg as part of my degree. While there, I had all my courses in French (although there were plenty available in German, too). It was an invaluable experience to study under a different education system and I made lots of friends from across Europe (many of whom I continue to see to this day).  My dissertation was about how to implement foreign-language teaching in the primary curriculum. I spent many hours in the university library in Luxembourg working on this, speaking to teachers, professors, and students who lived through a multilingual education system. My dissertation wouldn\u2019t have been as interesting if it hadn\u2019t been for Erasmus.   I cannot stress how awful losing this programme could be for a generation of young people. The loss of Erasmus would be a huge missed opportunity and could stop young people making new friends and forming relationships that could last a lifetime.  Helen Carnac, 48, London: \u2018My experiences mean I will always have close ties and connections in Germany\u2019      I spent four months in Germany in 1993. I was studying for a degree in silversmithing, jewellery and related arts at the time.  The Erasmus programme was fantastic. One highlight was studying with lots of other students from Europe, some of whom have become lifelong friends. It had an incredible effect on my future career. When I went away I was in my sixth year of studying, post-A-levels, and needed a break from London. Going abroad helped me develop ideas in different ways and perhaps I, and other Erasmus students, had a fuller education because of it.  My experiences mean I have always had close ties and connections in Germany \u2013 I now regularly show my work there and was a professor in Berlin for six months in 2011. A highlight of my Erasmus experience was doing a residency with the Munich-based artist and gallery owner Marianne Schliwinski. We have kept in touch since and I have valued this enormously.  It would be so damaging to lose Erasmus; studying abroad can really help you develop in new ways you might never have imagined.  Martin Hunt, 48, Cambridge: \u2018My year in France helped shape my future. I discovered a taste for living abroad\u2019      In my second year at Bristol we were told that an Erasmus exchange was being set up with the University of Bordeaux, and anyone who had a French A-level could apply. Even though I got a miserable E grade, I thought, why not? So I sent off my application and got a place. I was in my third year (it was 1989-90) when I found myself in Bordeaux for the year. It was interesting because the history I studied there was (a) very French (a course on, say, European culture quickly became a course on French culture) and (b) involved memorising a lot of facts rather than the analysis we did at Bristol.  It was a great opportunity and one that all students should get to experience. I guess there is a counter-argument that it\u2019s an opportunity only open to a university-educated elite, but even so it\u2019s well worth keeping.  My year in France definitely helped shape my future. I discovered a taste for living abroad, so after graduation I taught English in Greece and then Singapore. I saw an awful lot more of the world than I would have done otherwise. I gained a real interest in and appreciation of different cultures. James, 30, London: \u2018Without Erasmus I would not have met my girlfriend\u2019 I was the only person in my entire faculty who wanted to add an exchange year to my course, so it took a bit of persuading for the course director to let me go. He said: \u201cWell, I guess we should be offering more of this kind of thing.\u201d I had a year to learn enough German to understand lectures, so the pressure was on, but it also helped to have a goal to work towards. I spent two unforgettable semesters at Bremen university. Erasmus can be a bit of a bubble \u2013 I made many, many friends from other countries but not that many Germans. However, it is what you make it and many people do immerse themselves fully in their exchange city; it depends partly on where you go. Upon returning to Liverpool for my final year I was fluent in German, had a network of friends across Europe and a completely different perspective of my home country. My language skills were stretched to their limits in the intimidating German style of oral exams, but pushing myself meant I became fluent. Last but not least, without Erasmus I would not have met my girlfriend. Our lives have very much been shaped by the exchange programme \u2013 after graduating, I moved to Berlin during the recession of 2009. We had met once in Bremen but started dating in Berlin. She had dreamed for years of studying in London and Erasmus made it possible for her to do so in 2012-13. The following year, circumstances brought us both together to the UK for work. Brexit may force us back to Germany. Either way, one of us is always the marginal man, living in our adopted home country.

Limited bookings for four or more. Meal for two including drinks and service: \u00a375-\u00a3120 You join me in the smallest room in the house as I sit contemplating one of the biggest pieces of grit in life\u2019s pearly oyster, which is to say consequences. For if my job has taught me anything, it is this: certain ingredients can deliver as much of a kick coming out as they did going in. A few years back one of my so-called rivals concluded a review of an especially spicy Sichuan place with the instruction to put the wet wipes in the fridge overnight. I am wishing now that I had recalled the advice a good 12 hours earlier. And yet I do not regret a second of my meal at Som Saa. Some eating experiences reveal their virtues like courtroom dramas, the evidence in support of the case building slowly. Others are like romances, the true loving emotion presenting itself in gentle, soothing waves. Dinner at Som Saa \u2013 it\u2019s the name of a Thai fruit, apparently \u2013 is neither of these. It\u2019s an action movie full of crash, bang and wallop. It\u2019s the friendliest slap around the chops; a throw-you-back-in-your-seat ride which draws you in and spits you out again at the end gasping and, if you\u2019re me, with your collar drenched. In response to chilli I break out in a sweat. At the finish I looked like I\u2019d taken a shower.     \u2018Buried under drifts of foliage and smokey chillies\u2019: sea bass. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    Som Saa started life last year as a Thai food pop-up in a filthy east London railway arch, but I didn\u2019t go. Too many pop-ups are people playing at grown-up restaurants, and who knows whether they\u2019ll ever be heard of again? This one, however, was clearly a proof of concept. The chefs, Mark Dobbie and Andy Oliver, cut their teeth with Thai food oracle David Thompson. Oliver later worked in a renowned Bangkok restaurant. Their partner front of house is Tom George, with experience at Hawksmoor and with the Polpo Group, which have together written the textbook on what modern, relaxed restaurant service should look like. So here they now are, following a crowd-funding campaign, located in a former fabrics warehouse just south of Spitalfields market. Naturally they don\u2019t take bookings, unless for tables of four or more. I thought of inventing a couple of friends I would later mislay so I could reserve, but decided in the end to be a good boy and queue at the bar. I\u2019m glad I did, because the bar snacks are shamelessly, raucously, look-at-me brilliant. There are addictive bowls of toasted cashews with chilli and kaffir lime leaves, practically smoking in the dish in front of you. Better still is the jan naem \u2013 minced pork which has been fermented for four days with garlic and rice until it reaches a meaty lactic sourness. It\u2019s then pressed with fresh chillies and grilled. It is one of the best things ever done to the minced end of a pig. It is sausage in classy hobnail boots.     \u2018Edges of massaman\u2019: salted beef cheek curry. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    Certainly, it will take your mind off the noise, which is at aircraft take-off levels. There are distressed brick walls, for the sounds to bounce off, and rock-hard bits of panelling in whatever the eco-alternative to teak is these days. There are metal girders and high ceilings just to make sure the clamour echoes properly. At one point I joked that I was the oldest man in the room. Then I looked about and realised that I really was the oldest man there. Oh, for the sweet, untroubled hearing of the young. But again, for this food, I\u2019ll take the battering. Abandon any expectations encouraged by the tooth-achingly sweet offerings in Anglo-Thai restaurants. As this magazine reported a couple of months back, there\u2019s a new take on Thai food gaining purchase in Britain right now and it\u2019s a green curry-free zone. The food wanders restlessly from north to south. It is a deliriously fearsome bash of fire and sour and salt and smoke; of the high ethereal waft of Thai basil and lemongrass, of mint and coriander and pungent fish sauces, and their own coconut creams to lend soothing depths where needed.     \u2018All hot and sour loveliness\u2019: duck soup. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    On the specials board is a duck soup, complete with the offals. It is the worrying colour of dish water, an uncompromising grey; but it is the flavour of Technicolor, all hot and sour loveliness of a sort which would make a heavy cold simply throw up its hands and shout, \u201cSod it, I surrender.\u201d We follow it with a whole sea bass, curved round on itself in the heat of a deep-fat fryer, until the bones are crisp enough to be nibbled as a snack. It\u2019s buried under drifts of foliage and smokey chillies, the crunch of toasted rice and the intensity of more fish sauce. From the same section headed simply \u201cwok\u201d comes a perfect mess of crisp-roasted belly pork with sliced snake beans in a thick, dry red curry that shouts at you and shouts at you again until you have spooned up every last smear. The only step on to almost familiar ground is a slightly sweeter Penang curry of salted beef cheeks, cooked until spoonable, which with its dollop of coconut has edges of a massaman about it, but with more serious and savoury intent. Note: don\u2019t drop these down your shirt, or your clothes will recall your dinner for as long as you do. A salad of prawn, pork, peanuts and Asian pennywort, dressed with glugs of lime juice and \u2013 but of course \u2013 more fish sauce, is like a breath of cool air after hours in the sun. It is bright and fresh but still, of course, has a chilli kick. Once more the sweat runs. I mop my brow.     \u2018Startlingly weird\u2019: duck-egg custard. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    Apart from a fruit plate there are just two desserts. A salted palm sugar ice cream with toasted bananas is a revelation, full of deep caramel tones; it\u2019s what salted caramel wants to be when it grows up. A heavily set duck-egg custard served with crispy shallots is startlingly weird, verging on the unpleasant. The custard is split and, while I imagine it\u2019s a Thai combination, I could happily live without having onions on my dessert ever again. Prices range from \u00a36.50 to \u00a316 for the whole fish, but what struck me was that I could slip in here alone, just for the duck soup or the crispy pork dish or the beef cheek curry. And some of the fermented pork. That and a beer and I\u2019d be very happy. And yes, I\u2019d pay for it the next morning. But really, who cares? Jay\u2019s news bites \u25a0 Jane-Tira, a Thai restaurant in London\u2019s Soho, is a canteen-like space which has become famous for one particular dish: a mackerel curry made with fermented fish guts. If the decision to eat was based solely on smell you wouldn\u2019t; think a cross between a drain and the fishmongers at day\u2019s end. But it tastes terrific. There are many other good things, too, including the thrillingly named \u2018son-in-law balls\u2019: deep- fried eggs with tamarind sauce (jane-tira.co.uk). \u25a0 Fergus Henderson of St John is relaunching his brilliant product Trotter Gear.

This illicit trade in wildlife is well organised, transnational and happening across every region. As countries prepare to meet in Johannesburgthis weekend for the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to Cites (CoP17), there is increasing recognition that to curb the global surge in wildlife trafficking we must counter the corrosive corruption that enables it. Corruption aids and abets transnational organised crime, and is particularly rife where there is high-volume wildlife trafficking, such as with raw elephant ivory.   Related: Kenya's new front in poaching battle: 'the future is in the hands of our communities'    The first ever World Wildlife Crime report, published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) earlier this year, says more than 7,000 species of wild animals and plants are threatened by this illicit trade. It highlights that certain forms of illegal wildlife trade, such as the international illicit trade in rhino horn, would not be possible without corruption.  It is well established that corruption harms people, undermining the rule of law, institutions and sustainable development. By enabling wildlife trafficking, it is also helping to drive species of wild animals and plants to extinction.  Animals like elephants and rhinos are being slaughtered for their ivory and horn. Corruption often enables the passage of goods from source, through transit, to illicit markets and the unscrupulous dealers who may be many thousands of kilometres away from where the specimens were stolen.  It\u2019s not just iconic species being affected. Pangolins are being wiped out for their meat and scales. Rosewood is being plundered from forests for timber. Smuggling of rare iguanas for the pet trade is decimating wild populations, an illicit trade that spans three continents, with the animals being poached in the Bahamas, trafficked into Europe and south-east Asia, and involving nationals from at least five countries. Illicit trade affects every country across the globe. The vast majority of officials are honest and committed. We salute them. Yet we also see customs and police officials bribed, logging and hunting licences forged, and poachers and wildlife traffickers set free due to obstructed prosecutions. We must root out the \u201cbad apples\u201d and deepen efforts to build and maintain properly paid, trained and equipped civil services, in every country, including Cites and enforcement authorities and park rangers.  We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to this serious challenge. We have no option but to confront corruption head-on by fully deploying the international agreements created to combat corruption and to regulate wildlife trade in a coherent manner.  That is why, in December 2015, corruption and wildlife and forest crime was the focus of a dedicated side event that we co-hosted at the sixth session of the Meeting of the Parties to the UN Convention Against Corruption. Cooperation between the UN Convention against Corruption and Cites is strong and we look forward to achieving universal membership for both conventions in the near future. UNODC and Cites are working together to integrate the tools to prevent corruption, and to facilitate the prosecution and punishment of offenders, with the international rules set for trade in wildlife.  We are determined to help countries shatter the international criminal networks that supply this illicit trade and we are united in the belief that by aggressively addressing corruption, we can deal a lethal blow to all those involved in these highly destructive transnational organised crimes. Since Cites parties last met in Bangkok in 2013, discussions of the scourge of corruption has shifted from the corridors into open plenary and at this month\u2019s meeting parties will have before them, for the first time, a dedicated resolution on prohibiting, preventing and countering corruption.

Hall\u2019s suspended sentence means he is unlikely to serve any time in jail but the ruling in Bangkok will set a precedent for Thai firms accused of worker\u2019s rights issues being able to go after activists with defamation cases, a criminal charge in Thailand.   Related: Human rights in Thailand: Andy Hall's legal battle to defend migrant workers    The trial related to the publication of a report Hall researched for the Finnish NGO Finnwatch, released in January 2013 and titled Cheap Has a High Price.

Bangkok\u2019s south criminal court ordered Hall to pay a 150,000 baht (\u00a33,330) fine, as part of a sentencing that ended hearings stretching over almost four years. The charges brought against him carried maximum penalties of up to seven years imprisonment. In addition to the two criminal cases, Natural Fruit has also filed two civil claims for damages against Hall totalling 400m baht (close to \u00a39m).  Natural Fruit denies all allegations set against it in the report. It asserts that Hall damaged the company by \u201cbroadcasting false statements to public media.\u201d  Hall, 36 from Spalding, Lincolnshire, told the Guardian before the verdict he was confident of an acquittal. \u201cI believe the court will see there is a very strong public interest in the report,\u201d he said. With a PhD from Cardiff University, Hall has worked in Myanmar and Thailand on migration policy issues and speaks Thai fluently. He is also supporting the defence of two Burmese migrant workers accused of murdering two Britons on the Thai island of Koh Tao last year as well as other cases involving expatriate workers in Thailand.

He was given a three-year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and fined 150,000 baht (\u00a33,330). The charges related to the publication of a report based on the worker interviews that he carried out in 2012 for Finnwatch, the Finnish civil society organisation of which I am the director. Migrant workers interviewed by Andy alleged that rights violations were occurring during the production of the pineapple juice products made by Natural Fruits that have been sold in Finland and other European countries.     Without people like Andy, who exposes challenges and proposes solutions, Thailand's export industries are at risk    Natural Fruit denies the allegations in the report. But rather than fully engaging with us as we prepared it, they instead sued Andy for his research. He was personally accused of defaming Natural Fruit, distributing Finnwatch report\u2019s findings on the internet and creating serious business impacts and loss of face for the company.  During the long court hearings over this summer, Finland\u2019s largest retailer, S Group, who had stopped purchasing from Natural Fruit, testified that their decision had not been because of the Finnwatch report, but because Natural Fruit refused internationally recognised social responsibility audits. Thai companies testified that Andy\u2019s research was beneficial to improving labour practices. I testified that Finnwatch was responsible for both writing the report and publishing it \u2013 not Andy Hall. Still, in a surprise to the whole world, Andy was found guilty, even seemingly for events that didn\u2019t appear on the charge sheet he was indicted for.  The court verdict is a clear sign that Thailand wants to stop Andy\u2019s work and his criticism of conditions in the country\u2019s labour-intensive export industries, which contribute so much to the Thai GDP. Andy is everything that a good human rights activist is: loud, persistent and undoubtedly annoying to those who end up on the wrong side of his criticism. He has lived in Thailand for more than 10 years and knows the domestic media, key civil society and business actors well. He is just as comfortable at the grassroots level, listening to migrant workers talk about their real-life challenges, as he is working within international forums, and on high-level diplomatic and media terrains. He is just as convincing in Thai as he is in English. The exposure of human rights violations, human trafficking and forced labour has cast a shadow over Thailand\u2019s reputation over the last decade. Diminishing trust has led to business enterprises changing their attitudes towards the country, which has become subject to increased scrutiny. Independent auditing of Thai factories has become more frequent. Some companies have stopped purchasing from the country altogether. But boycotts do not help to solve the problems and Thailand is too big an exporter for most businesses to replace in the short term. Thai and international companies have therefore turned to civil society for assistance \u2013 and one of those people they have asked for assistance is Andy Hall. He has been instrumental in building a dialogue between European companies and Thailand\u2019s labour intensive export industries.    Related: Human rights activists are being portrayed as terrorists and foreign puppets  | Danny Sriskandarajah    Maina Kiai, a UN special rapporteur, has warned about closing space for people to engage with governments. He says that civil society can play a role like unlocking the lid on a pressure cooker, just as the heat is increasing and the cooker is about to explode. Andy has been keeping an eye on Thailand\u2019s own pressure cooker, voicing the concerns of millions of migrant workers, who are invaluable to the Thai economy but remain unorganised and without their own voice. Without people like Andy, who exposes challenges and proposes workable solutions, Thailand\u2019s export industries are at risk and that ambition to reach consumer markets in Europe is unlikely to be achieved. Several organisations in Europe have publicly stated their support for Andy. The UK\u2019s Ethical Trading Initiative expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d over the guilty verdict. The Foreign Trade Association, which represents 1,500 European companies, said it considered his guilty verdict \u201ca sad setback for human rights\u201d. That business enterprises take a stand in support of a human rights defender is unprecedented. When I spoke with Andy, he was adamant that we should not think that this case was just about him. Many migrant workers with whom he works closely with have been devastated by the verdict. If this can happen to Andy, who has a British passport and the support of the world behind him, what chance do they have to stand up for their rights, they ask? Thailand should wake up and realise before it\u2019s too late that the justice system and medieval laws that can be abused to stifle freedom of expression are about to lose the keys to the solution.

It is the reason why the US air force came here during the Vietnam war, and the reason why this dull and dusty town in north-east Thailand now serves as a primary gateway on the global animal trafficking highway. It is all to do with geography. Nakhon Phanom, population 30,000, sits on the western bank of the Mekong river and is directly opposite the shortest route across Laos, on the other side of the river, and into Vietnam. For the US air force it was the closest allied territory to Hanoi, 380km (236 miles) away as the bomber flies. For the wildlife traffickers, it is the perfect place for business. To the west, Thailand has some of the best air and sea connections in South East Asia; and to the east, across the narrow strip of Laos, are the markets of Vietnam and China, bursting with the wealth of their new economies and hungry for the flesh, skin, claws and bones of exotic wildlife.   The trafficking network   Today the Guardian exposes the crime family that controls this gateway. And we name three mainstream Lao companies with powerful political connections as leading brokers in the global trafficking of wildlife. Together with other suppliers they have been trading many tonnes of elephant tusk, rhino horn and lion bone from Africa and truckloads of tigers, turtles, snakes, monkeys and pangolin anteaters from Asia. A substantial amount of their business is illegal. All of these traders earn a good living; the kingpins are millionaires. All the animals they handle lose their freedom; almost all of them also lose their lives. Some species are now facing extinction as they are shovelled relentlessly into this booming black market.   Related: Animal trafficking: the $23bn criminal industry policed by a toothless regulator    The investigation has been led by a counter-trafficking organisation, Freeland, which is based in Bangkok and has previously exposed key players in this trafficking network. But when law enforcement agencies failed to act, Freeland pushed deeper, working with a Thai government surveillance team, persuading some of the traffickers to talk to them and stepping round the corrupt public officials who guard the network to gather intelligence from reliable police sources in Africa and Asia. Freeland has shared its evidence with the Guardian in the hope it will finally jumpstart cross-border police action against this and other networks. Over the past year, we have followed Freeland\u2019s work, met key informants and the head of the surveillance team, and widened the investigation into other parts of the supply lines that link African bush and Asian forest to the plush new suburbs of Hanoi and Beijing. Told now in full for the first time, this is the story of the Asian connection. The Asian connection The secret life of Nakhon Phanom revolves around one crime family, the Bachs. Four wildlife traffickers, speaking independently, name two of the Bach brothers as the key players who control the smuggling gateway from Thailand into Laos: Bach Mai, known to his friends as \u2018Boonchai\u2019, 38; and his older brother, Bach Van Limh, 45. Although they are active in Thailand, the brothers are originally Vietnamese and have networks in both countries.     The Bachs\u2019 base in Nakhon Phanom.

The surveillance team has seen them meeting African wildlife traders, unloading meat from refrigerated trucks, loading cars with hidden compartments and delivering a package to local police. Bank records show Boonchai\u2019s girlfriend, who acts as cashier for the business, has sent money to Asian wildlife suppliers. Apart from the export of wildlife through Laos, Thai police intelligence reports also link Boonchai with the importing of drugs from Laos into Thailand.     Boonchai poses with elephant tusks. Photograph: Handout    His older brother, Bach Van Limh, runs the Vietnamese end, from a town called Son Tay, which is strategically placed just inside the border from Laos and a few hours by road from Hanoi. He originally set up the family business in Nakhon Phanom some 15 years ago but recently left, allegedly after Thai police started investigating his involvement in the drugs trade. In Son Tay, according to Vietnamese police sources, Bach Van Limh is involved in running prostitutes and in smuggling cars as well as wildlife. He owns a hotel, a cafe and legitimate businesses trading gold and placing migrant workers. The Bachs are key players in a busy market, buying from whoever will sell to them. Among numerous smaller suppliers, three Lao companies have been operating for as long as the Bach brothers. One is already notorious in the animal world: the Xeosavang Trading Company run by Vixay Keosavang, who has been hammered by a combination of policing and publicity, much of it organised by Freeland. But just as the Bachs, until now, have escaped public attention, so too have the other Lao companies. Vinasakhone and Vannaseng are big players \u2013 both breaking the law and both still enjoying one of the world\u2019s most destructive trades. All three Lao companies opened wildlife farms in the early 2000s. They imported tigers bred in captivity, which was legal so long as they were used for science and education, not for commercial trade. One of them \u2013 Vannaseng \u2013 illegally imported 2,000 macaque monkeys captured and sold by villagers in Cambodia, according to an internal Lao government report. All three companies went on to break international and Lao law.     Leuthai Tiewcharoen aka \u2018Fatty\u2019.    At that time, the Bach brothers were already smuggling wildlife, primarily from a dealer widely known as \u2018Fatty\u2019, though his real name is Leuthai Tiewcharoen. He ran a farm in Nonthaburi, just outside Bangkok, where he stored and bred animals he had illegally smuggled into the country \u2013 tigers from Myanmar and Malaysia as well as bears, snakes and turtles. According to a source who worked at the farm, Fatty was earning 500,000 Thai baht ($14,400) a week killing these animals in a special slaughter area and shipping the carcasses eastwards to be used in food and medicine and as jewellery and home decoration. Sometimes, he sent them across the Mekong himself. There was a standard technique that Fatty and other Thai traffickers used, according to the source. The trafficker would go to a remote spot on the Thai side of the river, signal to a contact on the Lao side and drop a carcass in a sealed body bag into the water. The Lao contact would row over, haul the bag back across the river, weigh it and then make a phone call to send money to the trafficker\u2019s bank account. Some of these consignments would go straight into the farms set up on the Lao side of the Mekong by the three big companies. But, according to the source, Fatty also routinely sent carcasses direct to his best smuggling contacts \u2013 the Bach brothers. The South African link One day late in 2002 or early in 2003, Fatty came up with a new scheme. He had met an ambitious man called Chumlong Lemonthai, then aged 35, who had been earning a living selling fruit in a street market in Bangkok but who wanted to move into the wildlife trade. Chumlong reckoned he knew somebody who could provide rhino horn, originally sourced from Africa, and bones of big cats from the dry forests of central Thailand. Fatty set up a meeting between Chumlong and the Bach brothers at his farm, hoping to earn a commission as a middleman. At first, it went well. The Bachs brought with them a suitcase containing 40 million baht (about $1m), which impressed Chumlong. He agreed to supply the horn and bones. Then it went bad for Fatty: the Bachs cut him out of the deal.     Chumlong Lemonthai. Photograph: Handout    Chumlong went on to thrive in the trade and, apart from selling to the Bachs, he made a connection to one of the big Lao companies, Xeosavang, owned by Vixay Keosavang, who was to become notorious as a wildlife trafficker. From his base in Paksan, western Laos, Keosavang was sucking in animals from all over Asia and illegally churning out body parts at up to ten tonnes a week, investing his profit in hotels and a transport business. By 2005, Chumlong was having trouble supplying his customers from the dwindling sources of wildlife in South East Asia, and he decided to move to the biggest potential source in the world, South Africa. There, Chumlong rapidly made friends with Thai sex workers in the bars of Pretoria. Through them, he got to know white South African landowners who bred lions on their ranches. Chumlong commissioned the killing of hundreds of lions and supervised the boiling of their corpses to separate the bones from the flesh. He then parceled up the bones in ten-kilo bags - roughly one bag for each dead animal - and shipped them back to the Bachs and to Keosavang, who variously sold them onwards to Vietnam and China to be boiled and brewed as a cheap substitute for tiger bones in health tonics (although there is no evidence of its medicinal effect). This was potentially illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which allows commercial trade in lions only within set limits. The first two white farmers he dealt with had a licence to export a limited quantity of lion bone, which could be sent to Thailand under cover of official Cites paperwork. However, the evidence also suggests that some of Chumlong\u2019s lion trade was illegal. Often, he would have the teeth and claws of lions smuggled out of South Africa by Thai sex workers; they were helped through Johannesburg airport by an airline worker whose identity is known to the Guardian. In Bangkok, a corrupt airport official guarded Chumlong\u2019s packages as they arrived in Thailand. The \u2018pseudo\u2019 hunt With his lion bone business flourishing, Chumlong turned his attention to rhino horn, which was in huge demand in Vietnam after 2007 when a rumour spread that a government official had used it to cure his cancer. The international sale of rhino products is prohibited in Cites, but Chumlong and other Vietnamese traffickers now started to exploit a loophole which allowed hunters in South Africa to take home one set of rhino horns each year as a trophy. They set up \u201cpseudo\u201d hunts in which a willing stooge was paid to stand next to a professional hunter while a rhino was shot dead and had its horn removed. The stooge would then have a photo taken with the corpse and allow their name to be used on the paperwork to take the horn to Asia. There, instead of being displayed as a trophy, it would be sold and ground down for traditional medicine, although rhino horn is materially no different to fingernails and no more effective as medicine.     Lion bones are ground and used as a tonic in alternative medicines desired by wealthy Chinese. Photograph: Alamy    Chumlong started to import stooges from Thailand, paying them 5,000 rand (about $350) for their help. The Bach brothers sponsored some of these pseudo hunts. Paperwork seen by the Guardian shows that at least six members of their extended family travelled from Vietnam to South Africa to take part. Then in a neat money-saving manoeuvre, Chumlong substituted Thai prostitutes from his favourite bar in Pretoria, who played the same role for him without the cost of the international air fare. In this way, Chumlong arranged the killing of dozens of rhinos, earning himself $20,000 a time for their horns, which were shipped back to Keosavang and the Bachs. All this was illegal, though the pseudo hunts gave him the bogus protection of Cites paperwork for their export as trophies. The evidence suggests that Chumlong was also trafficking rhino horn from poachers, whose killing of rhinos in southern Africa escalated fast from 2008 as the demand from Vietnam and China increased. By this time, Chumlong, the former street trader, had bought himself two new houses in Bangkok.   High profit margins   In June 2011, following work by Freeland and a Johannesburg private investigator called Paul O\u2019Sullivan, Chumlong Lemtongthai was arrested by South African revenue officers in a high-profile operation. They seized his laptop, which contained commercial records and photographs recording the death of hundreds of animals and the despatch to Asia of millions of dollars worth of ivory, lion bone, and rhino horn. During one six-month period, the laptop documents revealed, Chumlong had paid a total of $1,394,282.40 to a white South African hunter who was shooting rhinos in his pseudo hunts. The same documents show that Chumlong was paying $6,500 per kg for the horn \u2013 a tenth of the end-user price in China, meaning that for that six-month period his rhino traffic alone was potentially worth $13.9m to those involved. Invoices also revealed the rate at which he was commissioning the death of lions: 327 of them during one two-year period, roughly one every couple of days, for which he personally received some $350,000. A kingpin falls, but the trade continues In November 2012, a South African court jailed Chumlong for 40 years, though this was reduced to 13 years on appeal. Bach Van Limh tried to save him, offering $600,000 to a key official in Johannesburg to release him. Chumlong has since claimed that the official was willing to accept the bribe if his money could be paid into an offshore account, but that this alarmed Bach Van Limh, who feared that with no record of the payment, the official would renege on the deal. So Chumlong stayed behind bars. Keosavang was hit hard by the documents in Chumlong\u2019s laptop. A combination of publicity and pressure from the US government finally forced him to step back in early 2014. At the time, his fall was celebrated as a turning point; the removal of the kingpin from the global machine. But when Freeland followed up on their investigation, they found that the Asian connection was as busy as ever.     A rhino mutilated by poachers for its horn.    They started to focus on the Bach brothers, who had not been exposed, realising that they were key players. It emerged that Keosavang was not the only kingpin, that the other two Lao companies had been working alongside him for years and were still busy. The Guardian has reviewed compelling evidence that since Keosavang\u2019s decline, Vinasakhone and Vannaseng have been involved in the illegal trafficking of hundreds of tonnes of wildlife from Africa as well as Asia, following the same route used by Keosavang and the Bachs, through Laos and into Vietnam and China. During 2014 \u2013 the first year after Keosavang\u2019s departure \u2013 the evidence suggests that between them they traded $45m of animal body parts including derivatives from three iconic endangered species: tigers, rhinos and elephants.  Other evidence separately suggests that both companies have been breaking the law on the farms they opened in Laos in 2002; that Vinasakhone has been illegally killing and selling tigers to order for buyers in Vietnam and China and also selling tigers to the notorious Golden Triangle area on Laos\u2019s borders with Myanmar and Thailand where they are sold as meat, drink and decorative skins; and that Vannaseng, on one of its farms, has been breaching Cites by trafficking hundreds of tigers and bears.

According to police sources in the region, he has switched his attention to smuggling cars across the border into Vietnam. But he is certainly close to the Bachs. Pictures obtained by the Guardian show him on holiday with Bach Vam Limh and stripped to the waist in a drunken embrace with both brothers. The surveillance team have reported that the Bachs continue to trade from their base on the main street of Nakhon Phanom in a three-storey block of flats whose upper floors \u2013 unlike any other building in the street \u2013 are defended by security bars. The team have photographed multiple visits by two South African lion bone merchants with whom Chumlong was working. They have also identified one of Boonchai\u2019s men as a Thai courier, known as \u2018Jimmy\u2019, who was caught at Johannesburg airport after Chumlong\u2019s arrest and convicted of attempting to bring undeclared cash into the country.

Thai police have traced a sequence of payments from the Bachs to other animal dealers including a 40-year-old Thai woman, Jay Daoreung Chaimat, whose \u201czoo\u201d was raided by Thai police in 2010. She was married to a police officer and was said to have other good police contacts. After the raid, she travelled to Bangkok and lobbied senior officials to sack the officer who had organised it. Following an inquiry by the Thai Anti Money Laundering Organisation, Amlo, a court in May 2014 ordered her to hand over $35.6m as the proceeds of crime. This year the order was revoked. Her Facebook page displays a photo of her smiling over a basket full of cash. In a town with few sources of wealth, the surveillance teams have identified warehouses, apartment buildings and a nightclub as Bach properties and videoed the Bachs and their men driving a fleet of new high-end vehicles, some of which have had their licence plates changed. Members of the surveillance teams have backgrounds in military and police work and believe that some of the network are carrying firearms and using sophisticated anti-surveillance tactics, putting two or three people on their boss\u2019s route to see if he is being followed.

But it is highly destructive, and its scale is threatening the extinction of some of the world\u2019s most iconic species. It is also grotesquely cruel: poachers slice off the faces of live rhinos to steal their horns; militia groups use helicopters to shoot down elephants for their tusks; factory farmers breed captive tigers to marinate their bones for medicinal wine and fry their flesh for the dinner plate; bears are kept for a lifetime in tiny cages to have their gall bladders regularly drained for liver tonic. But for any criminal who wants maximum money for minimum risk, it is most attractive. At every stage in the supply lines, the systems that are supposed to defend the animals against this global butchery are no match for the organised crime groups that dominate the trade.   Profit margins   This is a vast business, valued by the UN Environment Programme at $23bn (\u00a318bn) a year \u2013 twice the gross domestic product of poached countries such as Tanzania or Kenya. The profit margins are enormous. The poacher in Africa sells ivory at up to $150 a kilo. At the other end of the supply line, in Beijing, it sells for well over ten times as much, with some sales reaching $2,025 a kilo, according to research by Chatham House. The markup is even bigger with rhino horn: from $1,000 for a pair of horns (average weight 6kg each) at poacher level to upwards of $66,000 a kilo in China. Profits have increased dramatically over the past decade, driven by the wealthy new elites in Asia, accumulating ivory carvings and tiger skins as status symbols for their homes; buying ground powder of rhino horn and tiger-bone wine as traditional remedies for almost every ailment from hangovers to cancer, none of it based on any scientific evidence. This is a demand driven by two things: greed and superstition.  For a gangster, these animals are like bundles of cash lying almost unprotected in the wilderness.  This is a profit-hungry global crime conducted by some of the same ruthless and violent groups that traffic drugs and guns. And up against this collection of highly organised and well-resourced criminals, we currently deploy some of the world\u2019s weakest law enforcement. The only global body tasked with protecting the world\u2019s wildlife is a network of officials in each of the nations signed up to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which is co-ordinated by a small secretariat in Geneva.     Animal rights activists carry placards outside the Sandton convention centre in Johannesburg, where the Cites summit is being held. Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA    Cites was written in 1973 when the main threat to wildlife was the encroachment of human settlements on vulnerable habitat. Now it finds itself confronting these criminal networks, even though it has no detectives, no police powers and no firearms. In short, Cites is not a law enforcement agency. It is there to regulate trade. It can try to punish rogue governments by asking its members to stop trading Cites species with them, but it has no tools to punish the criminals who have already decided to defy those governments.   Related: The crime family at the centre of Asia's animal trafficking network    The global agencies set up to fight organised crime have bigger priorities: terrorists, arms traffic, narcotics, counterfeit goods. Other agencies try to fill the gap. Interpol distributes intelligence on the worst wildlife offenders; the UN Office on Drugs and Crime publishes research; the World Bank advises on the tracing of laundered money. None of them goes out to catch criminals. The few specialists who try to work internationally find themselves swimming against a tide of inertia. A senior law enforcement figure in southern Africa who specialised in wildlife crime told the Guardian that the crime groups enjoyed far better international links than he does. \u201cI have to rely on people I meet at conferences,\u201d said John Sellar, who spent 14 years as enforcement support officer for Cites before he took early retirement. \u201cA major reason for that,\u201d he told the Guardian, \u201cwas that I was fed up with the complete hypocrisy of people coming to Cites meetings and passing resolutions and then going home and, frankly, doing bugger all about them \u2013 politicians and law enforcement people.\u201d The few traffickers who are caught are dealt with by prosecution systems riddled with failure. When the international law firm DLA Piper in 2014 investigated criminal justice in ten countries on the frontline of wildlife traffic, it found \u201ca host of weaknesses\u201d including legal loopholes, chronic shortage of funds for prosecutors and courts, low rates of conviction, inadequate penalties and corruption. \u201cThe only consistent theme,\u201d it concluded, \u201cis that significant work needs to be done in every country in order to effectively tackle the illegal wildlife trade.\u201d   Trafficking network   Currently, the void is being filled to some extent by a loose network of volunteers, journalists and NGOs running their own investigations and attempting to get local law enforcement agencies to make arrests and prosecute. This includes NGOs like Freeland in Bangkok running long-term investigations of the kind whose results we are publishing today. That investigation was paid for by a small English charity that has sent tens of thousands of pounds across the world to pay Freeland to do the policing that was otherwise absent. The effect of this law enforcement void is traumatic. From African bush to Asian jungle to Russian steppe, the valuable parts of animals are ripped and sliced from their skeletal sockets and shovelled onto invisible conveyor belts, almost all headed for the same destinations in South East Asia and China. They leave Africa by sea, most often from Mombasa, Kenya, where the Elephant Action League last year ran a 12-month undercover investigation, which concluded that \u201cmassive amounts of ivory continue to pass unhindered\u201d; or by air, from Johannesburg, where the Guardian found a long-term airline employee who was part of a smuggling network, or through Maputo, Mozambique, which was described to us by a South African policing source as \u201ca major security problem\u201d.     Elephants gather at Big Toms waterhole in Hwange national park, Zimbabwe. Just 450,000 elephants exist in the whole of Africa. Photograph: Alamy    There are only 30,000 rhinos in the wild, just 5% of the number 40 years ago. Several sub-species are already extinct. Others are officially \u2018critically endangered\u2019. The biggest surviving population is the 21,000 southern white rhino, most of whom are in South Africa. And that is where the rhino poachers are busiest: 88% of the rhinos killed last year were in South Africa. The attack on elephants is even more frenzied. The conveyor belt to Asia sags under the weight of the ivory from something like 90 dead African elephants every day. In 2013, a single seizure in Guangzhou uncovered 1,913 tusks, the product of nearly 1,000 dead animals. The US National Academy of Sciences in 2014 found that in the previous three years poachers had killed 100,000 elephants, reducing the species to a total of only 450,000 in all Africa. And the numbers are still falling: the kill rate has exceeded the birth rate every year since 2010. Central Africa has lost 76% of its elephants since 2002. Tanzania has lost 66% in the last six years alone. Mozambique has lost 48% in five years.  The scale of ivory poaching is so colossal that the UN Office of Drugs and Crimethis year concluded that it could not be explained simply by looking at its sales, legal or illegal. In his time at Cites, Sellar speculated that financial and/or criminal elites were hoarding ivory as a long-term investment and method of laundering cash.     A Zimbabwe National Parks official inspects the country\u2019s ivory stockpile in Harare. Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP    On the conveyor belt alongside these iconic creatures there are the remains of hundreds of other animals: paws for ashtrays; teeth for pendants; genitals for sex drive; the skins of snakes; the scales of pangolin anteaters to be roasted and chewed for a health fad, 275 of them a day, 100,000 a year. There is a steady flow of tiger corpses, sometimes whole, sometimes only the skin and bones. A hundred years ago, there were some 100,000 wild tigers spread all across Asia and into eastern Russia: now there are an estimated 3,500, only 2,200 of whom are in populations big enough to make breeding and survival viable. This trade has been allowed to grow not only because of the failure of law enforcement but because it is inextricably linked with power. The wealthy elite in Asia that consumes illegal animal products overlaps with the political elite, and the commercial elite. The criminal entrepreneurs who run the supply lines are able to conceal their identity behind front companies, and hide their enormous profits by using the same secretive offshore jurisdictions exploited for tax avoidance by multinational corporations. This week, the 182 signatories to Cites are debating the future of the animals currently being wiped out in their thousands by this criminal industry. Cites secretary general John Scanlon knows the road ahead will be tough. \u201cCites sets the rules that these crime syndicates are trying to avoid. We do work with law-enforcement partners. I have told them: \u2018This is crime, this is transnational, this is your core business.\u2019 \u201cThey have now all bought into this. The good side is that we are in there with these agencies. The bad side is that they are not yet investing heavily in it.\u201d Additional reporting by Calvin Godfrey", "publicationDate": "2016-09-26T13:52:41Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Animals", "Conservation", "Environment", "Wildlife", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/animal-trafficking-cites-criminal-industry-policed-toothless-regulator", "title": "Animal trafficking: the $23bn criminal industry policed by a toothless regulator", "sentences": ["This includes NGOs like Freeland in Bangkok running long-term investigations of the kind whose results we are publishing today."]}, {"article": "Officials at the highest level of an Asian government have been helping wildlife criminals smuggle millions of dollars worth of endangered species through their territory, the Guardian can reveal.  In an apparent breach of current national and international law, for more than a decade the office of the prime minister of Laos has cut deals with three leading traffickers to move hundreds of tonnes of wildlife through selected border crossings. In 2014 alone, these deals covered $45m (\u00a335m) worth of animal body parts and included agreed quotas requiring the disabling or killing of 165 tigers, more than 650 rhinos and more than 16,000 elephants.  Trading in all three of those species is prohibited by Lao law and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species(Cites) which came into force in Laos in 2004. The Lao government has publicly paraded its commitment to the convention.   Trafficking network   The Guardian\u2019s evidence indicates that the agreements have yielded a profit of hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Lao government treasury. The extent of the knowledge of the prime ministers is not known. The Guardian contacted the Lao government three times last week detailing the findings and attempted to obtain comment for the story. A member of the foreign ministry\u2019s media team confirmed the request, sent in English and Lao, had been received. However, no response to the allegations was provided. Separately, Lao agriculture inspectors have submitted official reports about farms run by two of the traffickers, clearly stating that their own government has given approval for the farms to illegally kill captive tigers to be sold for their bones, skin and claws. The Lao government failed to act on these reports until last week, when it announced it was planning to shut down all commercial tiger farms in its territory. Its announcement did not acknowledge its own historic role in approving them.   Related: The crime family at the centre of Asia's animal trafficking network    The involvement of a national leader\u2019s office is one particularly big link in a global chain of exploitation that binds the supply lines of illegal wildlife trafficking. Steve Galster, executive director of the anti-trafficking campaign group Freeland, said: \u201cThis is a public-private partnership with law enforcement agencies acting as partners to crime syndicates.\u201d \u2018Nobody can arrest him in Laos\u2019  Laos is a key country in the global wildlife trade. Its wild areas and farms are home to animals that are supposed to be protected from commerce. And it is a crucial transit country for animal goods travelling illegally along well-trodden smuggling routes from Africa and other parts of Asia. The Guardian has already exposed the role of the Bach crime family in running a gateway for the smuggling of animal products from Thailand through Laos into the lucrative markets of Vietnam and China. Three Lao companies who were also named yesterday by the Guardian have been deeply involved in the traffic, both legal and illegal. Our evidence shows that each of them has been supported by deals with the Lao government. The earliest deal that we have seen involved the Xaysavang Trading Company, which was established in October 2002 by a Lao businessman, Vixay Keosavang. He is \u201cso well protected that nobody can arrest him in Laos\u201d, according to a source who has worked closely with Keosavang.     Vixay Keosavang (centre) pictured shirtless and on holiday with the Bach brothers, \u2018Boonchai\u2019 and Van Limh. Photograph: Handout    A report by Thai intelligence, seen by the Guardian, shows Keosavang signed formal agreements with the finance department of the Lao government that allowed his company during 2003, its first year of business, to traffic more than $11m worth of animals through the country into Vietnam and China to be eaten in restaurants, displayed as decoration or blended into supposedly medicinal tonics. These agreements granted Keosavang permission to trade twelve different species including crocodiles, monkeys and pangolin anteaters; the skins of 100,000 pythons; 250 tonnes of soft-shelled turtles (which would mean killing about 45,000 of them); 100 tonnes of dogs, which are commonly cooked in Vietnamese restaurants; 1,000 magpies; and 20 tonnes of animal bones, which are used in supposedly medicinal wine. The agreements called for Keosavang to pay a tax of 2% of the value of the transactions \u2013 4% in the case of the python skins \u2013 yielding $246,550 for the Lao treasury. These 2003 agreements appear not to have broken Lao or international law, which came into effect soon afterwards. However, they set a precedent for future animal trades.     A Thai customs agent stands over a seized shipment of ivory from Uganda and Kenya worth more than $500,000. Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPA    Keosavang\u2019s business survived and thrived for 12 years in spite of a torrent of evidence that should have led to his arrest. Nobody in Laos lifted a finger when Kenyan police, in July 2009, seized 280kg of ivory from Mozambique that was clearly labelled with his company\u2019s name as its destination; nor when other illegal consignments were intercepted in Bangkok on their way to him in November 2010 and February 2011; nor when his right-hand man in Africa, Chumlong Lemongthai, was arrested in June 2011 and later sentenced to 40 years in prison, despite a welter of evidence that Keosavang was his biggest customer.   Keosavang   Freeland, an anti-trafficking campaign group, passed detailed information about Keosavang to authorities in Thailand, Vietnam and Laos variously in 2003, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2012, and also to Interpol and the CITES secretariat in Geneva. Finally, in March 2013, they passed it to the New York Times, which exposed him on their front page, quoting Freeland\u2019s executive director Steve Galster as saying Keosavang was \u201cthe Pablo Escobar of wildlife trafficking\u201d. That finally provoked the Thai police into denouncing him as \u201cthe big boss\u201d and, a few months later in November 2013, the US government offered a $1m reward for information that led to the dismantling of his syndicate.  Yet still the Lao authorities did not arrest Keosavang, who continued to bring in animal parts from southern Africa. Finally, in January 2014, the Lao government revoked his licence to trade wildlife. By that time, however, the Lao prime minister\u2019s office had silently snubbed the international community by signing off on more agreements to help two other companies replace him. The Guardian has had access to compelling evidence that in December 2013 the then Lao prime minister\u2019s office ordered four government ministries and two provincial governors to help these companies traffic wildlife with huge annual quotas. The agreements were worth a fortune \u2013 up to $30m in a single month for one company \u2013 with the government once again taking its 2%. Unlike the original deal with Keosavang, these agreements specifically sanctioned the sale of the three iconic species that are closest to extinction as a result of this trade: tigers, rhinos and elephants. And in vast quantities.     Thai officials display dead tigers, leopards and pangolins seized after a raid on an illegal wildlife trader in Nakhon Phanom province in 2008. Photograph: Anonymous/AP    One company, Vinasakhone Trading, was authorised for the calendar year 2014 to traffic $16.9m of animal products through Laos. This included 20 tonnes of ivory, valued at $5m \u2013 a straightforward breach of international law. The Environmental Investigation Agency in London estimates that one elephant yields an average of 6.7kg of ivory, meaning that the Lao government that year was allowing Vinasakhone to trade on the criminal death of 2,985 dead elephants. The quotas also included 10 tonnes of lion bone, which is used in tonic wine; and 1,300 tonnes of live turtles, snakes, lizards and pangolin ant-eaters whose scales are used in traditional medicine \u2013 all of it potentially illegal by breaching CITES quotas. The other company, Vannaseng Trading, was authorised to traffic even more. In ivory alone, according to our evidence, the government agreed that during 2014 they could traffic 90 tonnes of ivory with an estimated value of $22.5m. That equates to 13,432 elephants lying dead in the African bush; also 4 tonnes of rhino horn that was valued at only $240,000; and 20 tonnes of tiger skin and bone and claws worth $1.2m. All of that trade in all three of those species is illegal. Also agreed was potentially illegal trade in live turtles, water monitors, pangolins and exotic birds; 6 tonnes of python skin and 120 tonnes of dead and frozen pangolin. The total package agreed with Vannaseng for 2014 was worth $28.2m \u2013 all to be officially taxed at 2% for the government\u2019s treasury. Both Vinaskhone and Vannaseng have a track record of wildlife crime. Until last week, the Lao government had failed to take action against them even though some of this crime has been recorded in internal government reports.     Animal rights activists carry placards outside the Sandton convention centre in Johannesburg, where the Cites summit is being held. Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA    When inspectors from the Ministry of Agriculture checked the companies\u2019 farm records in October 2014, they found that so far that year, they had traded a combined total of 7.7 tonnes of lion and tiger bone. At least some of that trade must have been illegal. All international trade in tiger bone is illegal under Cites; trade in lion bone is allowed only if it is covered by Cites permits. Even if the entire 7.7 tonnes was lion bone, at an average weight of 10kg per skeleton that would represent 770 dead lions. But Cites records show that during the whole calendar year of 2014, Laos had permits to import the skeletons of only 360 lions. If there was any doubt, the inspector\u2019s report explicitly accused both farms of breaching Cites by importing and exporting endangered species without having any paperwork to show that it was within legal limits. Crucially, the inspectors added that the law could not be enforced against them \u201cbecause they have got approval from government\u201d. In March this year, inspectors from the Ministry of Natural Resources went to the farm run by Vinasakhone since 2002 near the town of Thakek in central Laos. According to the report, seen by the Guardian, the farm, which houses about 400 tigers in pens, is involved in speed-breeding \u2013 using females as young as two years old to produce cubs twice each year. The inspectors note that this is regarded as bad practice. But their report goes on to make a much more serious allegation: that Vinasakhone has been killing its tigers to order for sale to Vietnam and China \u2013 a brazen breach of the law. The report says: \u201cTraders usually come to the farm to select the animal they want, take pictures and record an identity. The selection is whether that animal is pretty, pretty teeth, paws and tail, basically no scar on its body. The animal is killed at the farm by injection, all intestines are removed so they keep only the body with skin, bones and meat, covered with plastic sheet for shipment.\u201d The report adds that Vinasakhone managers admitted selling a hundred tigers to the notorious Golden Triangle on Laos\u2019s borders with Myanmar and Thailand. A 2015 investigation by the Environmental Investigation Agency described this area as \u201ca playground catering to the desires of visiting Chinese\u201d where \u201ca combination of weak laws, poor enforcement and official complicity allows the illegal wildlife trade to flourish\u201d. The EIA found traders openly selling tiger skins and stuffed tigers while restaurants sold bottles of tiger bone wine and \u201dsauteed tiger meat\u201d. All are illegal.     A female tiger and her cubs. The Lao government granted Vinasakhone\u2019s farm permission to sell up to 100 tigers a year. Photograph: Andy Rouse/Barcroft Images    The inspectors noted that Vinasakhone\u2019s farm had originally been given a permit to breed tigers for scientific research but that it was \u201cexactly not\u201d being used for that purpose; and that the commercial sale of tigers, including those bred in captivity, is \u201cillegal according to international law (CITES) and also to the law of Laos\u201d. And yet in a further act of criminal collusion, it also recorded that the Lao government had granted the farm permission to sell up to 100 tigers a year.   Related: Animal trafficking: the $23bn criminal industry policed by a toothless regulator    By contrast, in its public pose, the Lao government in 2010 solemnly reported to Cites that \u201cthe potential threat to wild tigers caused by tiger farms is very high\u201d and warned that they must not legalise any trade in the products of tiger farms because this might \u201callow smugglers to exploit loopholes and take opportunities to sell wild tiger products\u201d. Last week, at the international Cites meeting in Johannesburg, the Lao delegation announced a significant change of approach, saying that its government would close down any facility that kept and bred tigers for any commercial purpose. Vannaseng Trading has run its tiger farm since 2002, outside the town of Thaphabat, 80km (50 miles) east of the capital, Vientiane, where it is believed to keep about 200 tigers, as well as turtles and bears. In March this year the company successfully refused to allow the inspectors to visit to check on their compliance with the law.  However, Vannaseng did give the inspectors access to a second farm where they found some 6,000 macaque monkeys waiting to be sold to China or the US for medical experiments. In their report, the inspectors said they suspected the farm had been involved in the illegal purchase of monkeys captured in the wild. This echoed a 2010 report by the the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, which published emails in which the manager of the farm said that the business had been started with monkeys caught in the wild in Cambodia and smuggled into Laos, adding that he was planning to apparently break the law again by bringing in more wild monkeys in the near future. Laos remains a full member of Cites, although it was briefly suspended early in 2015 for failing to to deliver a national plan to deal with the ivory trade. It then delivered the report and was re-instated only to be suspended again in January this year for failing to submit a second report on implementing the ivory plan. A special CITES mission, led by their chief of compliance, visited the country in June. At that time, a source who has been closely involved with the two companies told us: \u201cThe government has told them to lie low, to start work again in a few months.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s evidence does not establish the extent to which any individual prime minister may have known about the actions taken in his name by some of his officials. The office of the Lao prime minister failed to respond to a request for comment.  Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive - but supporting us isn\u2019t.

Wong now appears less fidgety than at the height of the 2014 protests when he spent nearly three months camped on the streets outside Hong Kong\u2019s government headquarters. He smiles frequently and no longer checks his smartphone every 15 seconds. What hasn\u2019t changed is his signature bowl haircut and heavy-framed spectacles. His denim shirt and cargo pants are those of a typical Hong Kong teenager.   Related: Screened out?

He will lose his status as a student leader when he graduates from the Open University in 2018, and he said his thoughts were now turning to the future.

That\u2019s not correct. Across the continent, the bulk of population growth comes from natural population growth. Undesa figures from 1950-2050 show that in the case of Uganda \u2013 the outlier \u2013 its population in one century will multiply 20 times. That has never happened in human history.\u201d Tanzania will grow 18 times and Nigeria 10.5. \u201cMost local authorities don\u2019t have the capacity to deal with this, so there is no forward planning to make provisions for this population growth, which we know is going to happen.\u201d   His organisation is trying to combat the mindset that you can\u2019t plan for increased slum population, by supporting the creation of municipal development forums in a number of Ugandan cities. These are structured discussions where the local authority, local private sector companies and slum dwellers meet and deliberate about the future of the city.  Having the capacity to plan for future slum populations isn\u2019t just a problem limited to Africa though.      Cable cars travel over the Complexo do Alemao slum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Photograph: Felipe Dana/AP    Population explosions in many developing countries mean by 2030, 3 billion people \u2013 roughly 40% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 will need proper housing, according to UN-Habitat. The fact that slums exist in the first place is just evidence of places where urban planners and governments have already failed to keep up with the demand for homes. Myth 2: Slum residents would always rather live in formal housing   The bulldozing of slums and the eviction of their residents used to be seen as a good thing. Why would people want to live in squalid, overcrowded spaces with no access to municipal services like water or waste collection? These places were a blight on cities so, if offered an alternative, people would jump at the chance to leave them, right? Actually, no \u2013 especially as traditionally poor planning has sometimes not only left former slum residents in worse housing situations, but crucially also cut off from their old support network.     An aerial view of Africa\u2019s largest slum, Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2008 Photograph: Halden Krog/EPA    The social upheaval that can come with moving people out of improvised housing and into apartment blocks is well documented. Kenyan slum Kibera is a case in point, with reports of locals regretting making the move from their shacks to hi-rise blocks. Originally excited about the opportunity of moving to a complex nicknamed The Promised Land, some ended up moving out of the flats following water shortages while others saw a business opportunity renting out their new homes to middle-class Kenyans at several times the subsidised rate. Those who stayed still shop in the slum, where food is cheaper. The importance of proper planning is a logistical nightmare across Latin America too. Delicate social structures can be torn down faster than the shacks the communities lived in. Claudio Acioly Jr, head of capacity development at UN-Habitat, says many delicate human factors are often overlooked: \u201cFor example, in Brazil, the number of women-headed households is enormous and there is a rich network of informal arrangements. So when you move them, you move the location of the school and remove their arrangements for someone to look after the house and kids while they\u2019re out.\u201d Poor planning puts extra pressures on residents. \u201cIn Mexico, where the slums were 7km away from the city centre, the housing scheme was 37km away.\u201d Nearly 5m housing units were unoccupied 10 years on, he says. \u201c[Residents moved out] because they found they had to take two methods of transport to get to work and they\u2019re in a housing estate without any shops, in the middle of nowhere.\u201d  Myth 3: Slums should be treated differently to the rest of a city Slums are part of the fabric of many cities and many have mighty populations. The informal areas in Cairo are a good example of this. They have among the biggest populations in the region and are given names such as \u2018The City of The Dead\u2019. Out of a population of 90 million people, the Housing and Land Rights Network says at least 30% of Greater Cairo\u2019s residents live in slums.      \u2018The City of the Dead\u2019 in Cairo, Egypt Photograph: Alamy    Ahmed Mansour of the Housing and Land Rights Network argues that a holistic approach is needed: \u201cFor decades, Egypt has been facing a housing crisis that governments have mismanaged and the private sector has exploited.  \u201cThe problems within slums or informal areas cannot be treated in isolation from the rest of the city since they show structural inequalities that should be tackled integrally.\u201d  This is where slum upgrading could help, as the philosophy behind the urban renewal strategy is to gradually improve informal settlements, formalising and incorporating them into cities so residents have the same rights as everyone else there. Projects vary from place to place but the idea is to provide more durable housing, increase residents\u2019 rights and connect them to infrastructure and services that other citizens have such as access to clean water. Myth 4: It\u2019s possible to discourage people from moving into slums Alongside population growth, urbanisation is also driving slum growth \u2013 people moving to cities to find work. Here, India is a good example \u2013 the slum situation there is so vast that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to build 20 million homes. As implausible as this seems \u2013 where? how? \u2013 it doesn\u2019t change the fact that 41% of the population of Mumbai lives in some kind of slum.  Tony Soares, director of volunteer organisation SlumAid, works primarily with the Baiganwadi slum, which is situated near Mumbai\u2019s largest waste dumping ground.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a different solution that takes in the needs of the people who are currently living there. But people keep coming from the villages looking for work and people will find a way to rest their head any way they can,\u201d Soares says.

The 1989 UN ban on international ivory trading was supposed to protect elephants. The result has been counterproductive because restricting supply in a time of increasing wealth in Asia has driven up prices, dramatically increasing incentives and rewards for poachers. Since 2008, large-scale elephant poaching has restarted, driven by high prices in Asia. The trade ban is part of a prohibitionist approach that focuses on enhancing law enforcement, while constricting supply by confiscating and destroying ivory. But some of Africa\u2019s biggest range states \u2013 Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe \u2013 support a legal trade.     A Zimbabwe National Parks official inspects the country\u2019s ivory stockpile at its headquarters in Harare. Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP    The 2009 one-off commercial sale of 102 tonnes of stockpiled ivory generated more than $15m that benefitted elephant conservation and local communities. Further such sales were then banned until 2017. Advocates of the prohibitionist approach argue that this one-off sale has led to increased demand for ivory in Asia and, consequently, stimulated poaching levels in Africa. There is no evidence to support this claim (pdf) despite numerous assertions by animal welfare groups. Rather, the restrictions under which this one-off sale was permitted might have triggered large-scale poaching of elephants. Market speculators, who probably started investing in raw ivory during the global financial crisis, started stockpiling in anticipation the black-market price would increase because of scarcity during the sale moratorium. Indeed, the black market price of ivory skyrocketed between 2008 and 2014.   Related: Saving Africa's elephants: 'Can you imagine them no longer existing?'    In pure economic terms, limiting the supply of ivory can have negative consequences for elephant conservation. Supply reduction, by burning ivory stockpiles and implementing sale moratoria when demand for ivory remains unchanged, can drive prices up and escalate elephant poaching. As the market is controlled by criminals and investors who have no interest in conservation and are influenced primarily by price, elephant poaching can be predicted to increase. Despite recent investment in demand reduction in Asia, it is unlikely demand will be driven to zero within the short time frame required to save the species from extinction in the wild. A more practical approach would be to combine demand reduction campaigns with a legal and regulated supply of ivory, which would keep the price of ivory from rising higher and reduce the incentives for gangs to kill elephants.  If this doesn\u2019t happen then African countries might choose to withdraw their participation from Cites and decide for themselves what to do with their elephants and other species.   Related: Wildlife trade summit is a 'do or die' moment for endangered animals    \u2018Legal trade backfired badly in 2008. So why try again?\u2019 Dr Nitin Sekar, science policy fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Professor Solomon Hsiang, associate professor of public policy at UC Berkeley Whether or not legal sales of otherwise illegal products will undercut harmful black markets is a classic question in economics. It seems to have worked when the US repealed the prohibition of alcohol and legal booze flooded markets previously dominated by bootleggers. It\u2019s less clear whether it is working in places that have experimented with legalising marijuana or prostitution. Will it work for ivory? This question pits two sets of economic theories against each other.     Elephants help an elephant calf up a slope after fording the Ewaso Nyiro river in Samburu game reserve. Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images    In the standard economic model, the best way to prevent poaching is to establish a market for the ivory collected from elephants that have died naturally. Alternatively, in a dynamic economic model where demand and supply can change in response to legalisation, poaching may be worsened by legal ivory trade. This can happen in two ways. First, the conspicuous trade of legal ivory could draw new consumers. Individuals seeing ivory promotions on TV or their peers making purchases may become more interested in buying some themselves. But this growing demand might not be satisfied by the legal supply, incentivising more poaching. Second, with more legal ivory in circulation, it becomes tougher for authorities to distinguish legal from illegal ivory, reducing the risk of detection for illegal traders. This makes it possible for illegal traders to supply more illegal ivory.    As far as we can tell, the legal sale caused elephant poaching rates to rise and stay high.  Dr Nitin Sekar and Professor Solomon Hsiang     Which of these economic theories is correct? In most black markets, this is a challenging question as they are almost impossible to observe. But thanks to Cites, we have data stretching back to 2003 that provides a window into the shadowy illegal ivory trade. At 79 large sites in 40 countries across Africa and Asia, Cites collects data on how many elephants are poached and how many died naturally. In a recent analysis, we used these data to see which economic model is right.  Using the Cites global poaching data, we examined whether the \u201cone-time legal sale\u201d of ivory to China and Japan caused changes in global markets for poached ivory. What we found surprised us: the sale announcement corresponded with an abrupt, global and lasting 65% increase in poaching. These findings are further supported by reports on the ground. With the new influx of legal ivory, the Chinese government promoted the product, the Chinese media trumpeted the investment value of ivory, and a Chinese periodical noted that the one-time sale \u201cstimulated new consumption instead of slowing down illegal ivory trades\u201d. A secondary market for legal ivory permits has emerged to help launder illegal ivory. We tested many alternatives to the \u201cdynamic\u201d theories, but none of them could explain the dramatic 2008 increase in poaching. For instance, there was no greater Chinese investment in valuable raw commodities (such as gold) due to the financial crisis. As far as we can tell, the legal sale and the persisting legal markets caused elephant poaching rates to rise and stay high.      We can\u2019t know all the intricacies of the ivory black market, but the evidence suggests that the legal sale of ivory in 2008 led to more poaching, not less. Bans are imperfect, but they\u2019ve worked in western markets. With presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping\u2019s recent promises to enact \u201cnearly complete bans\u201d on trade in ivory, combined with data-driven demand reduction campaigns and law enforcement efforts, there is an unprecedented opportunity to try andto make them work in the east as well. \u2018Lifting Africans from poverty is the only way to save elephants\u2019 Rowan Martin, Zimbabwe delegate to the Cites meeting in Johannesburg Ivory has been part of Africa\u2019s wealth for centuries, and the colonial powers of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries went to war with each other in the attempt to gain control of it. No decree from these same powers banning ivory trade is likely to resonate with the African owners of the resource today.    We should be pleasantly surprised at how well elephants are surviving amongst a burgeoning human population.  Rowan Martin     And quite rightly. In a developmental context there can be no balance of trade if Africa needs to import all the specialised products manufactured by overseas countries but, in turn, is restricted by a cartel of overseas NGOs from exporting the specialised products that give it a global competitive advantage. What will keep elephants on the land in Africa? At the outset, the Malthusian problem needs to be recognised. Some 855 million people live in the countries making up the elephant range in Africa, of which 546 million live in the rural areas. Elephants generally cannot co-exist with people when the human population density exceeds 20/km2. This density has been exceeded in 21 of the 37 countries in the range.     As cities grow - such as this informal settlement outside Johannesburg - the elephant range shrinks. Photograph: Richard du Toit/Getty Images/Gallo Images    As a result, the elephant range in Africa has shrunk by 41% since 1995. However, far from being alarmed at their present status, we should be pleasantly surprised at how well elephants are surviving among a burgeoning human population. This year, southern Africa will experience an environmental disaster of extraordinary magnitude. Millions of people will be without food and water before the end of the year. Unless southern Africa can find higher-valued land uses than the present subsistence agriculture and marginal livestock husbandry, disaster appears inevitable. Those preoccupied with Cites trade bans do not see this bigger picture. The incentives needed to ensure a future for elephants outside state protected areas are, first, a full devolution of authority to those on whose lands elephants live to enable them manage the elephants to their own long-term advantage. Second, for the state to actively promote a high value for elephants and remove all restrictive legislation and bureaucracy that creates perverse incentives.  An annual budget of $1.5m is required to protect 5,000 elephants in a national park of 10,000km2, which can easily be met from the trade in ivory produced from natural mortality and a low level of problem animal control. Cites has had 27 years to assess the efficacy of the ivory trade ban and it is clear to any impartial observer that it has not worked. \u2018There is no evidence that ivory sales provide any significant benefit for local people or elephants\u2019 Dr Andrew Seguya, executive director, Uganda Wildlife Authority and member of the African Elephant Coalition who have put forward a proposal that would strengthen the ivory ban Once again, elephants face a threat to their survival from the ivory trade. Results released by the Great Elephant Census confirm that  around 144,000 savannah elephants \u2013 30% of the continental population \u2013 were lost between 2007-14. There is a clear answer to this crisis: ban the ivory trade. This would break the chain linking legal and illegal markets, eliminate demand and stop the killing. An earlier total ban by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) parties in 1989 put African elephants on the most protected Appendix I. Ivory markets crashed, prices dropped and poaching stopped almost overnight. Yet in 1997, parties weakened the ban by \u201csplit-listing\u201d some elephants on the less-restrictive Appendix II, contradicting the convention\u2019s own rules.

Photograph: Vichan P/Pacific/Barcroft Images    At the insistence of four southern African countries \u2013 Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe \u2013 Cites agreed to experimental ivory sales from their stockpiles. The largest of these sales to Japan and China in 2008 provoked a dramatic acceleration in elephant poaching across Africa (pdf). The main beneficiaries have been ivory poachers, smugglers and traders. Nevertheless, some libertarian economists continue to argue for ivory sales.  Such arguments assume there are simple market solutions to all the world\u2019s problems and that wild animals and their body parts should be treated like agricultural commodities. Perhaps these economists also live in ivory towers, oblivious to the real world where criminal syndicates operate as multi-product firms in complex markets.   Related: Saving Africa's elephants: 'Can you imagine them no longer existing?'      The tide is turning: China, Hong Kong and the US have already pledged to close their major markets. Since 2011, 21 countries have destroyed about 20% of the world\u2019s stockpiled ivory at public events, sensitising people to the threat from poaching and ivory smuggling, and the determination of Cites parties to end it.    Evidence that ivory sales provide any significant benefit to local communities or elephant conservation is lacking  Andrew Seguya     Through its members, the African Elephant Coalition of 29 countries has submitted a proposal to Cites CoP17 [the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties], which meets in South Africa this week, to remove ambiguity by putting elephants from southern Africa back on Appendix I.  Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe have submitted counter proposals to resume ivory trading, with Botswana now a notable exception in southern Africa. These proposals are likely to be rejected by an overwhelming majority of Cites parties, but some governments, NGOs and the European commission seek a diplomatic \u201csolution\u201d by getting all the proposals withdrawn and maintaining the unsatisfactory status quo. A legal ivory trade cannot save elephants, now or ever. As the saying goes: \u201cIvory belongs on elephants; in national heritage, not in markets or ornaments.\u201d For the next year the Guardian will be running a year-long focus on the plight of elephants; get in touch with your stories here, and read more of our coverage here.

If they are quick, they will beat the municipal cleaners to the detritus left overnight by revellers in the newly hip neighbourhoods of South Africa\u2019s sprawling commercial capital.  There is little solidarity among the 100 residents of the burned-out building where Phololo, 58, has lived unlawfully for nearly 20 years. Each races to the shattered bottles left on the pavements outside the bars and restaurants. Sold by the kilo for recycling, the glass provides the residents with enough money to eat.   \u201cIt\u2019s not easy at my age, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got,\u201d Phololo says.  By dawn, the residents of 54 Soper Road are back home. They rest in overcrowded, windowless rooms or on the verandah, enjoying the few rays of sun that pierce the wall of tower blocks surrounding their small, derelict building. There is no gas, electricity or sanitation. Water comes from a single standpipe. Children play in the rubbish-strewn yard. \u201cNothing really has changed here for years,\u201d says Mandla Kayise, 50, who moved into the squat a decade ago when he arrived jobless in Johannesburg from his poor village in KwaZulu-Natal, 350 miles south.  But soon he, Phololo and the others will be gone. An eviction is scheduled later this year. Despite the length of time many have been living there, no law in South Africa guarantees occupiers security after a set period.

Photograph: James Oatway for the Guardian     Once infamous for violence, crime and so-called \u201chijacked\u201d buildings or squats, the centre of Johannesburg has undergone an astonishing transformation in recent years. Blocks that were once no-go zones now house art galleries, cafes and museums. New businesses are opening. Neighbourhoods such as Braamfontein and Maboneng are now seen as hubs of creativity and cool. But the change, though real, is limited \u2013 and exactly how widely its benefits will be shared is not yet clear.  \u201cRegeneration has to be for everyone \u2026 I have no problem with land for luxury apartments, as long as there is commensurate land for the poor,\u201d says Stuart Wilson, of the local NGO Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa. Many have dated the decline of the 18 sq km inner city of Johannesburg to the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994, which saw the African National Congress (ANC) take power.  But this is unfair, says Gerald Garner, a local historian and guide. Racist measures adopted by the apartheid regime from the 1950s gradually forced industries out of Johannesburg\u2019s centre in search of labour. Then international sanctions led to the exodus of global companies and their staff in the mid 1980s.   The cumulative effect was devastating, according to Garner. Apartment blocks and homes emptied, the doors of multi-storey offices were locked, luxury hotels closed. Basic utilities were disconnected.     \u2018Jay Jay\u2019 makes traditional beer to sell from his room inside 54 Soper Road. Photograph: James Oatway for the Guardian    When racist laws restricting movement were reluctantly eased by the beleaguered apartheid regime, tens of thousands of poor migrants rushed to the city. Others came, and still come, from elsewhere in Africa. About 1,000 vacant buildings became vast squats, often run by violent gangs. The centre became an internationally infamous no-go zone.  Fitful regeneration efforts began around 15 years ago with major public projects funded by the ANC-run town hall, central government and overseas aid. Momentum gathered as South Africa prepared to host the 2010 World Cup, and private developers began buying up the \u201chijacked\u201d buildings, evicting squatters and constructing apartments.  Sometimes this occurred peacefully, but in the past the process of emptying occupied buildings has, on occasion, involved significant violence. This was directed both at South African citizens, some of them long-term residents, and the large numbers of migrants who continued to flow in from poorer, less stable neighbouring countries and beyond.  Now only 100 or so illegally occupied buildings remain, though these still provide accommodation for about 60,000 people. The residents of 54 Soper Road, in the tough neighbourhood of Berea, are among them. Berea has proved resistant to regeneration. There are many illegally occupied buildings and few of the signs of economic growth seen elsewhere. Pawnshops, nail parlours and liquor stores line dirty streets. Violent crime and prostitution is rife. \u201cThe washing gets stolen before it dries,\u201d says Majozi Thembezile, 57.     A security guard outside the new Joziburg Lane development in central Johannesburg. Photograph: James Oatway for the Guardian    For the last three years the residents have faced eviction but, despite the appalling conditions, they do not want to leave. \u201cWe have very little hope from our side,\u201d says Thembezile, who like many residents at 54 Soper Road came to Johannesburg from a rural village 20 years ago. A last-ditch legal battle may delay the eviction, but is unlikely to halt it. The fate of Thembezile\u2019s home raises important questions about the future regeneration of Johannesburg, and has implications across South Africa and beyond. One is how to find alternative accommodation for thousands of very poor people living in neighbourhoods that are now being gentrified. Current provision is grossly inadequate. Since a landmark court ruling in 2011, the local council is obliged by law to house anyone evicted to make room for either private or public developments. Campaigners and experts, however, say authorities have provided only a handful of squalid and overcrowded blocks where families are forcibly split up. Even these can only meet a fraction of the demand.     Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba. Photograph: Gianluigi Guercia/AFP/Getty Images    As a result, the development of the city centre is forcing the very poor living there, who are almost all black,  to the distant edges of Johannesburg where rents are cheaper. Many end up in the crowded townships the apartheid regime originally established to house black workers away from neighbourhoods designated for whites, which occupy the prime locations.   Some say the new exodus recalls that darker, earlier period: \u201cWe are replicating the apartheid city. Obviously there is no racial segregation any more \u2026 but we are entrenching historical inequality,\u201d says Wilson. Eviction would mean ruin for the residents of 54 Soper Road. They say the city council has told them there is no money to rehouse them locally, when most make a living within walking distance of their home as security guards, day labourers or recyclers. Commuting from rented accommodation further out, even if they could find something affordable, would be prohibitively expensive. Much depends on the city\u2019s new mayor, Herman Mashaba, a self-made tycoon from the centre-right Democratic Alliance who makes no secret of his belief in the power of the private sector.  Mashaba took office just weeks ago, ending decades of ANC civic rule. In an interview with the Guardian, he said living conditions at places such as 54 Soper Road amounted to human rights abuses and that the city had \u201ca responsibility to help the destitute\u201d. It is unclear, however, whether local authorities can find the funds, administrative capacity and, most importantly, the political will to adequately rehouse those rendered homeless by development. Mashaba certainly has an uncompromising message for those who are trying to halt the evictions, and a welcoming one for investors.

We want to work with you. We are starting with local investors, but at the end of the day we need international investors.\u201d  One of the newest developments in the city centre is Joziburg Lane, a small alley beside a 60-year-old former department store that, having stood empty for many years, is now being rapidly converted into 320 \u201cloft-style apartments\u201d to be let to young professionals. Local authorities impose very few conditions, such as the provision of social housing, on new projects.  \u201cIt\u2019s very much the free market, which I suppose is a good thing,\u201d says Geoff Jardine, the 34-year-old developer of the complex.   At 10am each weekday on Joziburg Lane, coffee beans are roasted, pomegranate juice poured, craft cheeses sliced and hipster fashions hung on rails by bearded men in checked shirts and Bermuda shorts.

The ministry was looking into why Wong had not been allowed into Thailand, adding that the decision involved \u201cvarious factors\u201d. Prominent members of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement accused Beijing of being behind Wong\u2019s deportation.  Agnes Chow, the deputy secretary general of Demosist\u014d, said: \u201cWe believe that the Chinese government is using all ways to stop us spreading democratic ideas from Hong Kong to other countries. But bigger suppression makes a stronger fight.  \u201cWe just hope that Joshua is safe,\u201d the 19-year-old activist added. \u201cWe will not give up the fight for democracy and the fight against the Chinese government which disrespects human rights.\u201d  Nathan Law, Demosist\u014d\u2019s president, told Hong Kong radio he believed there was \u201csome connection\u201d between Wong\u2019s detention and Beijing.

Wong, 19, was due to address students at Chulalongkorn University at an event to mark the 40th anniversary of a massacre of pro-democracy students by security forces and royalist militias in 1976. The Thammasat massacre of 6 October 6 1976, remains a deeply sensitive issue in Thailand\u2019s turbulent recent history, and was the prelude to a military coup. He was expected to talk about his experiences during the 79-day umbrella movement protests in Hong Kong in 2014. Jason Ng, a Hong Kong-based writer who knows Wong, said that before leaving Hong Kong the student activist had voiced concerns that he might not be allowed to enter Thailand.  The suspected abduction of Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai last year by Chinese agents had also left Wong nervous about potential risks to his well-being.    Related: Gui Minhai: the strange disappearance of a publisher who riled China's elite    \u201cHe was\u2026 most concerned about his personal safety, being abducted or attacked. Being turned back is one thing, getting hurt or disappearing is another,\u201d said Ng, the author of a book on Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement protests. To guard against such threats, ahead of Wong\u2019s trip to Thailand supporters set up an encrypted group on the messaging service WhatsApp through which the activist could notify Bangkok-based academics and journalists of any problems.  Wong\u2019s detention appeared to be the latest example of the closer ties between Thailand\u2019s military regime and China\u2019s Communist rulers, who consider the student activist a subversive. Since the 2014 coup in Thailand, a series of incidents have underlined Beijing\u2019s influence in the south-east Asian country. In October last year a Hong Kong publisher who specialised in salacious books about the Communist party elite vanished from his seafront apartment in the Thai resort town Pattaya, only to reappear in custody in mainland China where he is now being held. At around the same time, a Chinese journalist and campaigner called Li Xin fled China, hoping to claim political asylum in Thailand. However, he disappeared while traveling from Thailand to Laos. \u201cI warned him to be very careful in Thailand. It is very dangerous here,\u201d one Chinese exile living in Bangkok said at the time. A number of other Chinese dissidents and members of the Uighur ethnic minority from western China have also been deported back to China at the request of its government.

Has it become an anti-democracy ally for the Beijing government? \u201cWe need a full explanation and we demand an apology from the Thai government to Hong Kong people,\u201d added Mo, a Civic party politician who was among those who had gathered to greet Wong at the airport on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cIf this becomes a precedent it means it could happen to you or me at any time if somehow Beijing thinks you are a dangerous, unwelcome person.\u201d Netiwit Chotipatpaisal, the Thai student activist organising Wong\u2019s visit, criticised his country\u2019s growing embrace of the Communist party. \u201cThailand should stay out of the Chinese sphere of power, but we\u2019re not able to do this,\u201d he said.

I had been invited to share my experiences of Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement at two universities in Bangkok and to talk about becoming a young politician.  But as I left the plane, I started to feel paranoid that officials at the immigration counter might take me away and deport me back to Hong Kong on the very same flight. A strange feeling came over me. I could see more staff than usual ahead of me. But there was nowhere else to go. When I stepped on to the bridge leading off the plane, I saw a crowd of immigration police. I knew something was wrong. What surprised me was that, unlike when I was refused entry to Malaysia \u2013 in May 2015, this time I didn\u2019t have to go to the counter to be taken away. This time the officials came to meet me.  They asked if I was Joshua Wong. I told them I was.  And as soon as I had acknowledged my identity, they announced the order from Thai authorities to detain me and asked me to hand over my passport. I was very nervous. I never would have expected this to happen having barely stepped off the plane.  The unfamiliar environment knocked me off balance. The last time I felt this sensation \u2013 that my heart was about to leap out from my chest \u2013 had been two years ago, in 2014, when I was arrested during the umbrella movement protests.  Had this been happening in Hong Kong, I would at least have been able to contact lawyers or the media to buy some time. But Bangkok airport was a foreign place to me, and my phone wouldn\u2019t connect to the airport Wi-Fi. I couldn\u2019t reach anyone for help. I had no choice but to surrender my passport.  The customs officer told me I had been blacklisted by the Thai government and would not be permitted to enter the country. After handing over my passport, I was made to follow more than 20 customs and police officers to an unknown location. My heartbeat quickened and I was filled with a feeling of helplessness. We had been walking all over the place since my arrival and the only word I had been able to understand from them was \u201cblacklist\u201d.  After they took me to the detention cell, I couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. I asked which articles of their law allowed them to put a foreign citizen in a detention cell without good reason. I asked to be allowed to contact my family, or even just a local lawyer.  But my passport had been taken away, and I had been forbidden to use my phones or computers, so I could not contact anyone. They could do as they pleased. My two requests \u2013 to contact a lawyer and for them to explain the legality of their action \u2013 were both rejected with a simple \u201cNo\u201d.  I criticised them for detaining me without any legal basis as something that was a violation of human rights and they replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you why once we have you detained.\u201d I continued to point out that they were violating proper police procedure, but they simply replied: \u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d  I repeated those words to myself. \u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d  \u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d  \u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d  He was right, I thought. It is like China \u2013 not like Hong Kong. After all, the Hong Kong publisher Gui Minhai was kidnapped in Thailand last year and was eventually sent to mainland China.  My discussion with the police officer ended with him making the assertion: \u201cYou know we can treat you nicely like we are now. But we can also make it hard for you. We believe you understand how far we can go.\u201d I was fully aware of this. In fact, everyone in Hong Kong is fully aware of the bookseller scandal, which saw five local booksellers taken away to mainland China.  At about two o\u2019clock in the morning I was put in a cell at the airport.  At first I thought the worst that could happen would be that the 20 police officers would \u201ckeep me company\u201d in the airport waiting room before putting me on a flight back to Hong Kong.  What I never expected was that I was about to be locked up in a foreign country merely for agreeing to speak at the top university there.  Detention cells in Hong Kong are not pleasant. In Thailand they are even worse. In Hong Kong you are at least allowed to see your lawyers. Two years ago I was arrested in Hong Kong for storming the Civic Square two days before the umbrella movement erupted and I was able to seek release by filing a habeas corpus petition in court.  In Thailand detention centres are far more unpleasant. The lack of hygiene and the language barrier were not even the main problems. The worst thing was being cut off from the outside world in this tightly sealed cell. You can\u2019t see the light and you don\u2019t know what time it is. You don\u2019t know how long you will have to wait. But you do know that you won\u2019t have the chance to help yourself through any legal means \u2013 because there is no rule of law. In this 50sq ft cell, my mind was troubled; I felt terrified and uneasy. I wondered if my friends and colleagues from my political party Demosisto would be worried, seeing that I had not appeared online; I wondered what my family and girlfriend might be thinking, having heard nothing from me; I wondered if my friends from Thai student movements might be able to get me out having not seen me at the airport; I wondered how the Hong Kong government might respond to this, or if it would simply ignore it as if it never happened. I felt frightened. I wanted to cry.  Being cut off from the outside world is scary. But I told myself not to cry. No matter what happened, I should not cry. I could not let the police \u2013 the tools of the government \u2013 feel like they had defeated me. Looking at the walls of the cell, I kept thinking about when I might be able to go home. Would it be tomorrow morning? At noon? Or perhaps a day later?  It sounds crazy, but I was truly worried that the Thai government might take me off to one of its courts, under some national security article, and wait a couple of weeks before deporting me home. Or perhaps worse, they might find me guilty and keep me in jail for years. The worst that I imagined could happen \u2013 although just for an instant \u2013 was that they might deport me to mainland China, as they had done to the five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing last year.  You may think I was overreacting by thinking that I would never be able to go home. When I started having these negative thoughts, I tried to remind myself that \u2013 even in the worst-case scenario \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be jailed in Thailand, let alone deported to mainland China. My voice of reason told me such scenarios were far-fetched.  But you know what? When the physical conditions are so hostile, and you can\u2019t breathe because of the repressive atmosphere around you, this kind of fear grows inside you. Because the reality was that I was detained in a foreign country, with no access to legal assistance or the media, and I was not even sure I would be permitted to return home.  My mind became so troubled that I wasn\u2019t able to sleep. Finally I realised what \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d actually means. This detention experience was 100 times more terrifying than the five previous times I was arrested in Hong Kong.  By noon the following day I was told I would be put on the next flight home. A huge load was lifted off my shoulders. Just before I left I was given a document from the immigration office, declaring that they had rejected my entry into the country according to Sections 19, 22 and 54 of the Immigration Act B.E. 2522. So after China, Macau and Malaysia, there is now another territory I know I cannot enter. In fact, I still don\u2019t understand why. I have never criticised the Thai government. I was only invited there to share my experiences of being a young man who took part in the umbrella movement. And this led to me being detained as soon as I stepped off the plane and being treated in a way that goes completely against human rights and the law. I spent almost 12 hours in detention and was deprived of my passport and of contact with others.  I am absolutely certain that my unlawful detention by the Thai authorities was motivated by their fear of youth movements around the world. Indeed, young people right across the globe will only become more united and engaged as our collective yearning for democracy, civil liberties and other universal values strengthens. So too will our commitment to street activism. Our hopes and dreams transcend culture, language, country and political realities.  My political party and I will continue to work with civic groups in the region to chart a new path towards liberty and justice.

As with greatness, some men are born to it, some achieve it, and some have it thrust upon them: others, like the footballer Joey Barton, appear to have decided to dispense with it altogether. Here he is, resolved to confront his manager at Queens Park Rangers, Harry Redknapp, about the team\u2019s terrible form: \u201cHe was watching the Racing Channel, and it was pointless hedging my bets. \u201c\u2018Gaffer, I need to speak with you. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve managed to do this, but everyone hates you.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s not hedging your bets, and then there\u2019s walking in with an actual hedge and setting fire to it. But if Redknapp felt himself to be staring into the abyss of social isolation at that moment, Barton was also on hand with a glimmer of hope. He actually liked\u00a0him. Barton, of course, makes great play of the fact that he doesn\u2019t care whether he is liked or not. A famously enthusiastic user of Twitter, his sales pitch for his autobiography advised his followers: \u201cIf you want to buy it, buy it. If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t. But don\u2019t come on here moaning at me today. I can\u2019t be arsed with you. Have a day off.\u201d (He had even shorter shrift for golfer Bubba Watson in the wake of America\u2019s recent Ryder Cup victory: \u201cWhy is Bubba crying? Never even played.\u00a0Dickhead!\u201d)       Full disclosure: I do like him. I interviewed him for the Observer four years ago, when an editor\u2019s wheeze was to film us going round the Lucian Freud exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery \u2013 the idea being to reflect Barton\u2019s apparent rebirth as a culture vulture. Charitably, you could call it a bid to disrupt expectations; but you might also suspect a little de haut en bas teasing. Anyway, we had a nice time, and afterwards we went for a spot of lunch at an unglamorous little cafe of Barton\u2019s choosing, where he ate vegetable soup and hummus: he was swerving meat, he explained, having been reading up on it.     Barton during his Manchester City days, 2006. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA    But a pleasant promenade can\u2019t magically vanish Barton\u2019s baggage. His combative personality has caused him problems at all his clubs, from Manchester City to Newcastle United, where he called caretaker manager Alan Shearer a cheat and accused him of wanting to surround himself with sycophants, to Glasgow Rangers, where he is nearing the end of a suspension for rowing with a team-mate following a 5-1 tonking in an Old Firm match. Last week he was also charged with allegedly placing 44 bets on football matches between July and September, in contravention of the Scottish Football Association\u2019s rules on gambling. Off the pitch, there have been serious outbreaks of violence involving team-mates \u2013 Jamie Tandy, Ousmane Dabo \u2013 a teenage fan and his father while on a trip to Bangkok, not to mention various off-duty city-centre bust-ups with members of the public. Barton is a serial adopter of the fresh start; over the years, he has repeatedly declared himself a new man, wiser, more mature, in control of the destructive impulses that assail him. Now, perhaps more realistically, he has alighted on the Japanese theory of kaizen, or gradual and continuous improvement, and his book bustles with the frequently overblown verbal tics of self-development.           Footballer Joey Barton on life, philosophy and art    It would be unfair to dismiss it because of that. Barton\u2019s exploration of his childhood, which, despite close relationships with many family members and particularly his grandmother, was permeated with violence, will be rejected by his detractors as the search for an excuse. But killing and GBH were all around him; his brother Michael and a cousin are serving jail sentences for the racist murder of 18-year-old Anthony Walker in 2005. After the pair fled the country, Barton appealed to them to return and give themselves up but, he says, he still continually asks himself whether he could have done anything \u2013 presumably by exerting greater influence on them \u2013 to prevent the murder. Swagger though he might, those experiences have clearly marked him. But there is still humour. When Barton joined the England squad in 2007 to gain his one senior cap, he was greeted with a certain amount of frostiness by those of his new team-mates who had published autobiographies following a shabby showing in the previous year\u2019s World Cup; Barton lampooned their efforts as \u201cWe got beat in the quarter-finals. I played like shit. Here\u2019s my book.\u201d It is to Barton\u2019s credit that he captions a photograph of himself training with \u201cmy fellow authors, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard\u201d.

Their high-arched branches and luminous green canopies form \u2013 as historian Jill Jones puts it \u2013 \u201ca beautiful cathedral of shade\u201d. When she started researching her new book, Urban Forests, she\u2019d have struggled to identify the species \u2013 but now, she says, \u201cwhen I see one, I say \u2018Oh my goodness, this is a rare survivor,\u2019 and deeply appreciate the fact that it\u2019s there.\u201d The American elm was once America\u2019s most beloved and abundant city tree. It liked urban soil, and its branches spread out a safe distance above traffic, to provide the dappled shade that cities depended on before air conditioning.  Now, however, most of the big, old elms have been wiped out by Dutch elm disease. Many of them were replaced by ash, which have in turn been killed by another imported pest: the emerald ash borer. By the 1970s, writes Jones, much of America\u2019s urban tree cover had fallen victim to \u201cdisease, development and shrinking municipal budgets\u201d. Thousands of miles away, in Bangkok, the main threat is construction work. After a group of residents tried in vain to save several mature trees on their lane, which were felled to make way for a car park, they formed a tree advocacy group, the Big Trees Project. Within weeks, membership swelled to 16,000. Forestry officer at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), Simone Borelli tells me of similar tree advocacy groups in Malaysia, India and Central African Republic, where the capital, Bangui, has \u201cgrown out of the forest and is eating it up\u201d.     Elm trees line Fifth Avenue by Central Park in New York. Photograph: Alamy    This month will see representatives from the world\u2019s cities convene in Quito, Ecuador, for the United Nations conference on sustainable urban development, Habitat III. An agreement called the New Urban Agenda will be launched, to address the challenges facing a growing global urban population that already accounts for over 50% of us. The document is littered with references to green spaces being essential for mental and physical health, community building and performing urgent ecological tasks. Research has turned up fascinating evidence as to why town councils, planners and developers \u2013 in whose hands the fate of urban trees lies \u2013 should take heed. Until recently, says Jones, city officials saw trees as \u201cexpensive ornaments\u201d. But what is now known about the ecological services that trees provide is staggering.    Until recently, city officials saw trees as expensive ornaments.    Trees can cool cities by between 2C and 8C. When planted near buildings, trees can cut air conditioning use by 30%, and, according to the UN Urban Forestry office, reduce heating energy use by a further 20-50%. One large tree can absorb 150kg of carbon dioxide a year, as well as filter some of the airborne pollutants, including fine particulates. It\u2019s hard to put a price on how an avenue of plane trees can muffle the roar of a main road, although trees do on average increase the value of property by 20%. Perhaps money does grow on them after all.  When the New York City park department measured the economic impact of its trees, the benefits added up to $120m a year. (Compare that to the $22m annual parks department expenditure.) There were $28m worth of energy savings, $5m worth of air quality improvements and $36m of costs avoided in mitigating storm water flooding. If you look at a big tree, says Jones, \u201cit\u2019s intercepting 1,432 gallons of water in the course of a year.\u201d     A canopy of signs \u2026 Khao San Road in Bangkok. Photograph: Neil Setchfield/Alamy    Use of the open source software, i-Tree, has spread all over the world (from China to the UK, via Brazil and Taiwan) to assess canopy size \u2013 ideally, cities should have 40% coverage \u2013 and calculate its economic worth. \u201cTo be able to monetise those benefits is really useful,\u201d says Jones. \u201cTrees are economic drivers. Everyone knows, if you look at fancy neighbourhoods, they are the ones with the most trees.\u201d By the same token, she observes that underprivileged neighbourhoods are often also undercanopied. Humans are drawn to trees by more than aesthetics. It can bring down cortisol levels in walkers, which means less stress. The effect on our brains is a subject that fascinates UK-based GP and public health expert William Bird.    Related: More trees on your street means fewer health problems, says study    \u201cThe parts of our brain we use change when we connect with nature,\u201d he says. Even in lab-based studies, MRI scanning shows that when viewing urban scenes, blood flow to the amygdala \u2013 the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d part of the brain \u2013 increases. Our brains view cities as hostile environments. Natural scenes, by contrast, light up the anterior cingulate and the insula, where empathy and altruism happen. \u201cIn areas with more trees,\u201d says Bird, \u201cpeople get out more, they know their neighbours more, they have less anxiety and depression.\u201d (Here in the UK, the annual mental health bill is around \u00a370bn.) \u201cBeing less stressed,\u201d he continues, \u201cgives them more energy to be active\u201d. But you can\u2019t fob people off with an empty playing field, he says. \u201cPeople won\u2019t want to go there. We are still programmed as hunter gatherers who look for trees, biodiversity, water and safety.\u201d Research suggests people are less violent when they live near trees. One of the oft-cited examples is a study that looked at women in a Chicago housing estate. Those who lived near the trees reported less mental fatigue and less violent tendencies than those in barren areas of the same estate.     \u2018In areas with more trees, people get out more\u2019: a tree-lined street in Gothenburg. Photograph: Souvid Datta for the Guardian    \u201cWe still know very little about the mechanisms linking trees and health,\u201d says Geoffrey Donovan, research forester with the US Forest Service. But there are theories. One is that nature is so mentally restorative that it gives our minds a rest from the forced, direct attention that modern life and urban environments increasingly call for. It relieves mental fatigue.  A tree psychology study that particularly tickles Jones was done in Toronto by psychology professor Marc Berman, using data sets from the national health system. \u201cHe discovered that, if you have 10 more trees on a city block, it improves health perception as much as having \u00a310,000 more in income, or feeling seven years younger,\u201d she says. Perhaps one of the most striking studies on urban trees is one that showed that they reduce health inequality. In 2008, Rich Mitchell, a public health professor at the University of Glasgow, compared income deprivation and green space exposure across England and his study found \u201chealth inequalities related to income deprivation in all-cause mortality and mortality from circulatory diseases were lower in populations living in the greenest areas\u201d.    Related: 'I\u2019ve known this tree all my life': your photos of urban trees around the world    Back at the US Forest Service, Donovan refers to trees as \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d. \u201cI looked at the impact of trees on birth outcomes and found that mothers with more trees within 50m of their homes are less likely to have underweight babies,\u201d he says. For another study, he looked at mortality rates in areas which have lost millions of trees to emerald ash borer, and identified \u201ca corresponding increase in human mortality\u201d. The value we place on trees and nature is informed by childhood experience. Children growing up dislocated from nature results in, say some researchers, an \u201cextinction of experience\u201d. These children will ultimately understand and value nature less. \u201cThis means,\u201d writes Bird, \u201cthat each generation will pass on less experience of the natural environment \u2013 and as policymakers and future environmentalists they will have a poorer understanding of nature and so give it less value\u201d. Which would not bode well for the FAO Forestry Department\u2019s vision of \u201cgreener, happier, healthier cities\u201d. As Jones says, \u201cbeing an amateur tree appreciator, as I now am, really does transform your enjoyment of being out and about\u201d.

Photograph: Vincent Jary/Getty Images    Opposite Wat Xieng Thong is Queen Design, where you can buy handmade Hmong batik wrap skirts, and Article 22 peacebomb jewellery, fashioned from war scrap metal; next door, Noi sells baskets and cases from Khmu communities in remote Sam Neua. Lunch at L\u2019Elephant Vert with its \u201cliving\u201d cuisine set menus (from \u00a312) serving tomato carpaccio and coriander and mustard mousse, or at small Cafe Toui where friendly Toui serves souisi pa (fresh fish poached in coconut, basil and a red-chilli broth) for about \u00a34 and a twist on the Cuban mojito, a \u201ccojito\u201d, made with Lao basil, lemongrass and Malibu rum. Afternoon After lunch, wander through the myriad alleys and streets. Close to L\u2019Elephant Vert is Gallery Asiama where south-east Asian textiles specialist Dr Linda S McIntosh sells select wares; next door, Alain M\u00e9noni sells his digital and silver print photographs of Laos.     Wat Xieng Thong temple with its famous roof. Photograph: Ketkarn Sakultap/Getty Images    Returning to the main road, you\u2019ll find Ock Pop Tok Heritage (selling vintage Laos textiles) and Passa Paa store (in the same alley as the Artisans Cafe and selling bags and cloth stitched with modern takes on indigenous motifs). Try silkworm poo tea (with a nutty edge!) in its pretty garden. Tuk tuk out to Ock Pop Tok\u2019s riverside location to learn weaving, Hmong batik and bamboo weaving (from \u00a324). Hungry after class? Begin Backstreet Academy\u2019s Fear Factor Food Tour (\u00a314), a three-hour munch through chicken feet, goat\u2019s blood, duck foetus and pig\u2019s intestine at street stalls and roadside pit stops; its khaipen (Mekong riverweed snack) cooking class is fascinating too (\u00a315). For a tranquil take on Luang Prabang, glide out on a new, stylish Bounmi cruise along the Mekong with expat Adele Frigon, who provides insider info on sights along the river (from \u00a316) accompanied by red lao lao (rice whisky made from purple sticky rice). Post sunset, head into town to graze around the night market (tasting grilled chicken or fish on bamboo skewers from \u00a31.50-\u00a35), a bowl of noodle soup (\u00a31.50), and sweets made from coconut (80p-\u00a31.60), or dine on tilapia ceviche at hotspot Tangor. Later, settle in for a cocktail and offbeat conversation at Elizabeth Vongsaravanh\u2019s artsy Icon Klub, followed by gourmet tapas for the peckish (the pulled-pork sliders are great) and full cocktail repertoire at Brit-owned 525. DAY TWO: FOOD, MUSIC AND DRINK Morning     Woman making saa paper in Ban Xang Khong. Photograph: John Elk III/Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images    Rise early to take part in a sacred ritual: the giving of alms. There are some 35 wats in town and every morning the saffron-robed monks walk through the centre, collecting rice for their day\u2019s food. (There are strict rules on participation, observation and photography so seek advice so as not to disrupt the monks). Afterwards, browse at the morning market (6.30-10am): rice lollipops, wasp cocoons (the pupae are considered a delicacy), buffalo lung, betel-nut bark and leaves, live toads and catfish. For an insight into Laos\u2019 culinary staple, sticky rice, enrol at Living Land, 5km from Luang Prabang, for a lesson and a chance to work in a paddy field (\u00a323.50). Lunch at Khaiphaen restaurant, supported by Friends International which trains young people for employment, for a good chicken laap (minced chicken with diced veg and mint) and pandan panna cotta. Afternoon Cycle out to the village of Ban Xang Khong, 1km north, and watch the conversion of mulberry tree bark into homemade, petal-spattered saa paper before buying at the handful of shops. Back in town, bike or walk to Taec, an excellent non-profit museum where exhibitions showcase Laos\u2019s ethnic groups\u2019 clothes and crafts (entry \u00a32.50). It also offers Hmong embroidery and Khmu bamboo-weaving classes (from \u00a310). From here, make your way to the south side of Mount Phousi to Wat Visoun (entry \u00a32), crowded with golden buddhas and housing a jumbled cluster of artefacts. Search out the ceremonial swan, a huge, carved wooden red-eyed bird vessel, whose purpose was to channel holy water in a purification ritual for a Lao king on coronation. Spend the rest of the afternoon drinking at the bars that line the Nam Khan river back road, or zone out at Utopia, overlooking the water. For even more relaxation, book in for a massage. There are spas for all budgets: near Wat Visoun is the no-frills Lao Red Cross massage (a few pounds); the affordable L\u2019Hibiscus Spa (from \u00a36); or the indulgent Lao Coffee Body Wrap (\u00a350) at the Sofitel Luang Prabang.     Kuang Si Falls. Photograph: Getty Images    At Garavek, hear folk tales in English at a small theatre at 6.30pm (\u00a34) to the backdrop of khene music played on a bamboo-reed instrument. With tour guide Saeng Touly, you can visit the last Hmong khene maker in Luang Prabang province, who will show you his craft and play soulful tunes. Saeng can then take you around the corner for khao piak (tapioca and rice noodle soup with herbs, spices, chicken or beef) on a street known to locals as \u201cnoodle soup road\u201d. Khene devotees should look up The Paradise Bangkok Molam International Band, featuring a 70-year-old player. Laos is famous for its do-it-yourself barbecues, known as sindat. Pitch up on the Mekong River road, lined with mango, tamarind and coconut trees, as well as huge fig trees prickled by bromeliads, and look for the \u201cBBQ Buffet Mekong\u201d sign. Tuck in from 6-10pm for \u00a36 per person. If you feel like being waited on, cross the Nam Khan river to Dyen Saba\u00ed (bamboo bridge access is 50p return crossing before 6pm), set in a lantern-festooned garden. For western fare, track down fun Secret Pizza, run by an Italian-Lao couple. After dinner, bar hop \u201cbar street\u201d. The Red Bul Bar is a guaranteed party spot.     Ock Pop Tok.    DAY THREE: OUT OF TOWN Morning Thirty kilometres from Luang Prabang (\u00a35 in a tuk tuk) are the turquoise, postcard-perfect Kuang Si Falls (8.30am-5pm). Head out on your own early to see them empty of visitors and glittering in the sunlight at the beginning of the day. On site is Free the Bears, where more than 20 Asian black moon bears, rescued from the illegal wildlife trade, are kept in enclosures. Close by is the vibrant Kuang Si Butterfly Park, opened two years ago by a Dutch couple. For a great Lao lunch, or a few Japanese dishes, head back to town to Sonphao run by the delightful Shingo. Afternoon There are a couple of choices. Either, take the vehicle-carrying boat (50p per foreigner) from behind the Royal Palace to the left bank of the Mekong. Climb up the hill and turn right onto a pebble path to a string of temples which each cost about \u00a31 to enter \u2013 the pretty 16th-century sloping-roofed Wat Xiengman, hilltop Wat Chomphet, and the historic Wat Long Khoun, which boasts extraordinary colourful murals and was the meditation retreat of Laos kings before their coronations. Hidden in the Chomphet district jungle, for those tenacious enough to track it down, is the royal cemetery (with the tomb of the mother of the last king of Laos). Then take a boat 25km upstream (from \u00a320) to the Pak Ou caves, where thousands of Buddha statues are secreted inside. During Lao New Year (Pi Mai), the caves are thronged with pilgrims.     Buddhist monks collecting alms early in the morning. Photograph: Santiago Urquijo/Getty Images    Alternatively, end the day with the fun Tamarind Cooking Class at its lakeside school (\u00a321) and experience a great entr\u00e9e into cooking some of Laos\u2019s most emblematic and tasty foods, such as the above-mentioned laap. Opening in November, 2km downstream, the Pha Tad Ke Botanical Gardens, the first in Laos, will brim with Lao plants and flowers and offer a cafe, restaurant, shop and workshops (\u00a328 for boat transport and garden entry). Return for de rigeur beerlao on the Mekong at sunset at any one of the bars lining the Mekong Road. Purchase your souvenirs at the night market (5-10pm), which sets up from the post office roundabout to the Royal Palace on Sisavang Vong Road. Buy embroidered story books, cloth purses, paper parasols, upcycled cement bags, tea and spices.

As public mourning starts and the crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn, readies himself for the throne, Thailand will be thrust into uncertainly in the coming weeks. Here is what is expected to happen.

Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPA    A multi-day funeral In the coming days, the king\u2019s body will be ceremoniously embalmed and tied in the traditional foetal position while it waits to be cremated. Heads of state will send their condolences to the royal family and some are likely to fly in for ceremonies in the capital and around the country.  Royal funerals last seven days but are normally not held for months or years after the death to allow the state to prepare an ornate ceremony. Although there have been several royal funerals in Thailand, giving hints at the pomp and ceremony that will engulf the country in the coming months, the king\u2019s will be much larger. An edition of Life magazine published in 1950 detailed the funeral of King Bhumibol\u2019s elder brother, King Ananda Mahidol, who died aged 19 of a gunshot wound to the head. The investigation was never resolved. Bhumibol was confirmed as successor the same evening but not crowned. The funeral took place four years after the king\u2019s death so Bhumibol could complete his schooling in Switzerland. He returned to cheering crowds and three aeroplanes that dropped flowers by parachute. \u201cDespite Ananda\u2019s popularity and the national mourning, the Siamese watched the rites without wailing or many tears. They respect their kings deeply but quietly,\u201d the Life article said. \u201cTheir school lessons tell them that one never directly addresses the king but speaks to the dust beneath his feet.\u201d     King Bhumibol, left, with his wife Queen Sirikit and Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn in 2007.

Royal attendants dressed in white sat on the chariot and shaded the urn containing his body from the sun.   Thailand atom   The urn was placed at a cremation altar made of gilt, plaster, paper and glue and participants walked around three times, going counterclockwise, \u201cwhich in Siam signifies mourning\u201d. The altar was burned later during the night. An ancient tradition of entertainment at royal ceremonies, which had been phased out, was revived by King Bhumibol. The 2008 cremation of Princess Galyani Vadhana included plays, Thai puppet shows and traditional Khon dancing by more than 2,000 artists. Expect a grander show for the king. Coronation of a new king Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn was named as successor in the moments after the king\u2019s death, but a formal coronation might be months or years away. Thailand\u2019s prime minister said on Thursday that Vajiralongkorn had asked for time to mourn with his country before he is appointed.  During the process of appointing the new sovereign the privy council chair, now Prem Tinsulanonda, will serve as regent of the country. In May 1950, the Bangkok Post described King Bhumibol\u2019s coronation thus: \u201cThree days of elaborate rituals began in the morning of 5 May, with a ceremonial bath within the vast courtyard of the Amerind Hall, where the king, dressed in the attire of a Brahmin priest, faced east and had holy water poured over his shoulders. Later, the king, in full coronation attire, received eight representatives of the government in the large reception hall.     Bhumibol at his coronation in 1950.

Thailand has had 11 successful military coups since 1932, when the absolute monarchy became a constitutional monarchy. The royal family has remained in many ways above politics, commanding huge respect from the country\u2019s leaders, and many Thais believe it to be a balancing force, preventing politicians from exploiting the masses. Although the constitutional monarchy has few formal powers, the king\u2019s influence is critical. The crown prince does not command the same popularity his father enjoyed over his decades of rule. There are concerns that political instability could ensue as the status quo changes. \u201cIf the current junta is still in power, then it might use the possible instability during the succession to stay in power longer. Ultimately, royal succession will help the forces of authoritarianism in Thailand to legitimise their grip on power,\u201d Chambers said.", "publicationDate": "2016-10-13T13:49:54Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/thailand-king-bhumibol-adulyadej-dies-what-happens-next-death", "title": "What will happen next after the death of Thailand's king?", "sentences": ["Women weep outside a hospital where Bhumibol was treated in Bangkok.", "In May 1950, the Bangkok Post described King Bhumibol\u2019s coronation thus: \u201cThree days of elaborate rituals began in the morning of 5 May, with a ceremonial bath within the vast courtyard of the Amerind Hall, where the king, dressed in the attire of a Brahmin priest, faced east and had holy water poured over his shoulders."]}, {"article": "Thailand\u2019s King Bhumibol Adulyadej has died aged 88, ending seven decades on the throne during which he became a unifying father figure and rare source of stability in a country that has weathered more than a dozen coups since he came to power in 1946 aged just 18.

Related: What will happen next after the death of Thailand's king?    As soon as the palace confirmed the news, the crowd outside Siriraj hospital let out a cry and mourners hugged each other. Some people were wearing yellow \u2013 the king\u2019s colour \u2013 but many more wore pink, which was named years ago by royal astrologers as a colour beneficial for the monarch\u2019s wellbeing. They had been chanting \u201clong live the king\u201d for much of the day. Although Bhumibol had been ill for much of the past decade, some people were shocked on hearing he had died. Dozens of mourners who had spent much of the past week at the hospital on the west side of the Chao Phraya river made their way back to central Bangkok dazed and fatigued. \u201cWhen we saw the news that he was ill, we just hoped it was fake news,\u201d said a woman after stepping off the boat. Another mourner, 24-year-old student Tachpon Techarang, said Thais had spent the evening sending consoling messages to friends and family.  During the king\u2019s reign, there have been close to 20 attempted or successful coups \u2013 the last one in May 2014 when a military junta seized power \u2013 but the monarchy has remained revered. That Thailand\u2019s many civilian and military leaders crawled on the floor in the presence of the king illustrated how Bhumibol kept the executive in check even with the country ostensibly in a continual state of flux.   Related: Thailand's heir apparent Maha Vajiralongkorn raises fears \u2013 and eyebrows    His constant presence made Thailand one of the most widely cited development successes, becoming an upper-income country in less than a generation. He successfully negotiated many times with military leaders to return democracy to the country, but finally left Thailand to the army. Critics of the military junta say it used its support for the monarchy as a pretext for grabbing power from the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra, the sister of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was also deposed by the military in 2006 and fled the country. The constitutional monarch had been treated by doctors for \u201cwater on the brain\u201d and a chest infection in August 2015. On Sunday, the palace said his condition had become unstable. During the closing years of his life, he was mostly hidden from the public, occasionally wheeled out on a bespoke sandy-coloured chair to tour a new supermarket or visit a palace. During these outings, Thais kneeled on the road, some crying as their expressionless and silent monarch passed by.  His wife, Queen Sirikit, has also suffered declining health. They have three children, but Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, their only son and heir, does not command the same affection as his father, causing fears of a rupture in the state\u2019s structure.   Les Majeste law atom   However, open discussion of the monarchy is restricted by a strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law that makes criticism of the royal family punishable by years in jail, so it is hard to gauge the popularity of the son. Any Thai can bring a legal case against a person under the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law. In 2014, complaints were filed against a woman who wore black on the king\u2019s birthday. In August last year, military courts jailed two people under the law, one for 30 years and the other for 28 years, the heaviest sentences for the crime in the country\u2019s history, for Facebook posts. Critics of the law say it has been used by the military against political opponents. Bhumibol\u2019s death means Queen Elizabeth II is now the longest reigning living monarch.  The king ascended to the throne after the still unexplained death of his older brother, Ananda Mahidol. His brother, also known as King Rama VIII of Siam, was found shot dead in his bedroom in the Boromphiman throne hall in the Grand Palace. Bhumibol later said \u201cit was proved that it was not an accident or a suicide\u201d.   Related: King Bhumibol Adulyadej obituary    Bhumibol postponed his coronation until 1950 to finish his studies in Switzerland. Many of his subjects regarded the king as close to divine. His image is displayed in shops, restaurants and homes across the country. The royal anthem is played in cinemas before films are shown and people are expected to stand. The anthem is also frequently broadcast in parks and on the metro, causing a temporary standstill. The king played the saxophone and loved jazz. He was rarely seen in pictures without a camera around his neck and was a fan of black and white photography, which many suggested stemmed from his preference for simplicity in life.

Traffic in the modernised areas of the Thai capital remained heavy and people walked the streets as normal on Thursday. Most signals that the country had lost its most beloved figure were subtle: restaurants were emptier than usual, some advertising billboards had been turned off, and fewer street stalls had opened. On Khao San Road, a backpackers\u2019 hotspot in the capital, the pavement was full of people selling massages, fake DVDs and bottles of cheap spirits. Tourists in flip-flops were drinking beers in bars, but the usually constant blaring music was absent. Asked if the sound systems had been turned off out of respect for the king, a waitress responded by crying and nodding.

Jikoni\u2019s website says they \u201ccelebrate the legacy of the many maternal figures who shared their kitchen\u201d, so we get a cockle-warming place to sink into and dream, perhaps, of soft, embracing, motherly bosoms scented with cinnamon and vanilla. \nBhogal herself is far from matronly. In her open kitchen, she\u2019s as chic and beautiful as her surroundings. A TV regular, appearing with everyone from our own Jay Rayner to Big Sweary Gordon, her book, Cook In Boots, featured headings such as Fork Me, Spoon Me: The Food Of Love And Rude Food. Post a number of \u201cresidencies\u201d in the likes of Hix and Trishna (which is right next door; I\u2019m not sure whether this is chumminess or chutzpah), Jikoni is her first restaurant. Pot plants and mismatched lampshades made from jewel-coloured saris and handmade Indian tablecloths notwithstanding, the girliest element is the food, which is light years from the usual Brit curry machismo. It\u2019s not pretending to be traditional or authentic; it is, apparently, \u201cinspired by our rich heritage, our travels and by London\u201d, which explains outbreaks of Ovaltine and shepherd\u2019s pie. \nYou can\u2019t escape the cuteness: tiny little prawn puffs are like an elf\u2019s Cornish pasty, the light-squidgy pastry flecked with cumin seeds and stuffed with the merest suggestion of prawn; a dinky collection of scotch eggs are like a savoury version of cupcakes, bijoux little quails\u2019 jobs perched on decorative flourishes \u2013 prawn toast scotch egg (shades of meaty prawn cracker) with banana ketchup (like salty, liquidised maltloaf) and pickled cucumber; a pumpkin version given a Middle Eastern spin with tahini, a scattering of dukkah and curls of pickled chilli; and (our favourite) slow-cooked, rich, ripe pork thick with mustard seed and topped with sticky batons of carrot and a slick of sweet-sharp tamarind. All are expertly fried, the teensy yolks perfectly, oozingly mollet (not an easy feat with eggs this size). \n \n  \n \nThere are lots of little dishes, and we get through most of them without denting the desire to keep on eating. Rounds of sweetcorn, just-charred into smokiness, come with \u201cKenyan peanut sauce\u201d (a stiffer satay) and topped with flounces of coriander. Street-food favourite bhel is an explosion of sev, puffed rice, tamarind, rubies of pomegranate, mango, chickpeas and God knows what else: it\u2019s a riot of flavour and texture. Cauliflower \u201cpopcorn\u201d, a cross between tempura and Chinese salt\u2019n\u2019pepper, is dusted with the thinnest chilli and translucent fried curry leaves, and entirely addictive. \nIt\u2019s hard to resist a main course called \u201cspiced scrag end pie\u201d, which turns out to be a hectically sloppy mess in a decorative chafing dish, featuring potato lurid with cream and butter, and scrag end (an unsung cut from the animal\u2019s neck, perfect for low, slow cooking) packed with ginger, cinnamon, chilli and cumin. This shepherd\u2019s pie on steroids I\u2019d quite happily inhale through a tube. Not sloppy enough? Here\u2019s a Sloppy Joe brioche bun rammed full of minced Herdwick mutton keema that leaches spiced fat through its bready base, the richness jolted by pickled red onion (like Mexican cebollas curtidas) and a side of padr\u00f3n peppers fried in crisp, wispy batter. This is one for burger heads looking for a harder hit. More sophisticated is lobster tail khichdee (sic: the ancestor of kedgeree) with \u201cmoilee broth\u201d, a Keralan number humming with mustard seed, turmeric and coconut, with more coconut in the dhosa-style chutney on top, little dark lentils and flawless rice. The idea of ruffian lentils with prissy lobster is an odd one, but it comes off beautifully. \n \n  Related: Bronte, London WC2: \u2018It doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s in Bangkok or Beirut, nor does it much care\u2019 \u2013 restaurant review | Marina O\u2019Loughlin  \n \n\u201cWe hope you find the food soothing and nourishing,\u201d croons the website, and if I have a criticism, it\u2019s that \u201csoothing\u201d: many plates rather disappear from consciousness as soon as they\u2019ve disappeared down necks.

In unimaginable pain, I thought, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve broken my back again. Twice in six months. Earlier that year, I\u2019d been on a skiing trip with my mate Matthew to Les Arcs, France. On the third day, bombing down black and red runs, I had underestimated my speed as we\u2019d approached the bottom of the mountain. I\u2019d stopped dead in the snow; my skis planted and I smashed down on my backside. Oddly, I remember laughing from the rush of endorphins still pumping through my brain, but there was a sharp pain, like a terrible muscle spasm. Matthew made an X with his skis to signal for help and I was swiftly taken by stretcher to the nearby medical unit, then by ambulance to hospital. I\u2019m an anaesthetist at a hospital in Yorkshire, so it was pretty sobering to see an x-ray of my own spine with a collapsed L2 vertebra. The doctors made me a back brace and I stayed in hospital for three days, getting by on GCSE French. When I was repatriated to the UK by air ambulance, I couldn\u2019t do a whole lot. I was signed off work and whiled away most of my two-month recuperation playing on the PSP, but as things picked up, my girlfriend Emma and I booked a trip to Thailand and Laos for the summer. My back was fully recovered and I cautiously agreed to go tubing down the Nam Song river in the thick of the Laos jungle. The river was muddy and fast-flowing. I was walking sideways, in flip-flops, along the top of the bank when I lost my footing and crashed, hard, 12 feet to the bottom. I felt a shock through my spine and I couldn\u2019t move. I was scared: I thought this break would leave me paralysed. A crowd gathered around me. I told them to line up the buoyancy aids and roll me on to them. They borrowed a fruit cart from a farmer nearby and used the wooden board on the top as a stretcher. I was hoisted up the bank and wheeled through mud to the main road, where they flagged a tuk-tuk to take me 4km to a two-room hospital. My muscles were seizing up and there were no painkillers other than the ibuprofen and paracetamol in our rucksacks. When they x-rayed me, there was no sign of a break. They had x-rayed too low but I wouldn\u2019t find that out for another 10 days, until I reached the Bumrungrad hospital in Bangkok, where a CT scan revealed a piece of my thoracic spine (disc T12) was smashed to pieces.   Related: Experience: my dad set me on fire    The worst was the days in between. We found out our travel insurance was defunct by five days, due to an overlooked T&amp;C about the length of our trip, and I endured a four-hour ambulance ride to Vientiane (Laos\u2019s capital), gritting my teeth over pothole after pothole in the worst pain I have known. We felt isolated and lonely, and it took everything in me to sit through the agony of that one-hour flight to Bangkok for the luxury of fully functioning healthcare. As I went for surgery the next morning, I was told that one knock could have paralysed me. I thought of all those potholes. After 10 days in Bangkok, I flew home with titanium rods in my back. Sedatives ensured that I didn\u2019t remember much of the flight but I do remember the enormous relief when Dad picked us up from the airport. I was signed off work again, this time for three months. Until now, I haven\u2019t been able to recount the story without feeling horror and a shudder through my spine. In the short term, I sold my skis and Emma wouldn\u2019t go away with me the following year: she thought I was bad luck. My fitness has taken eight years to return and I\u2019m half an inch shorter due to the surgery. I\u2019ve since been told by doctors that I have thin bones, which goes some way to explaining why this happened twice. I\u2019m a more cautious man now. We\u2019ve since had a little boy, Theo, two, and our second child is due in December. You won\u2019t ever get me on a rollercoaster with them.

As a sign of deference, all Thais \u2013 including prime ministers \u2013 make sure they remain physically below members of the monarchy.

The king\u2019s body will lie at the Temple of the Emerald Buddha inside the palace complex for an undisclosed duration, to allow people to pay their respects.

The prime minister confirmed that Vajiralongkorn would ascend to the throne, though in a later statement he said there would be a delay in appointing the new king as he had asked for time to mourn with the country. The privy council president, Prem Tinsulanonda, a 96-year-old former prime minister, will act as regent during the transition period. He leads the council, which acts to advise the monarch. Vajiralongkorn, the late king\u2019s only son and heir, does not command the same national affection as his father. Prayuth said the country was in \u201cimmeasurable grief\u201d but ended his Thursday evening broadcast with: \u201cLong live His Majesty the new king.\u201d The UN general assembly held a minute\u2019s silence while the British Foreign Office said that all union flags on government buildings were to be flown at half mast. It asked UK citizens, of which there are 50,000 residents and roughly 100,000 visitors in Thailand at any time, to behave respectfully and \u201cwear sombre and respectful clothing when in public\u201d. Over the past few years, there had been speculation of a complete nationwide shutdown in the event of the king\u2019s death. But the military junta, which took power from a democratically elected government in 2014, has indicated that it wants to keep the country open and running smoothly.   Thailand's l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws.   Prayuth said security was his top priority and asked businesses to stay active and stock investors not to dump shares. Banks remained open on Friday. The country\u2019s stock market and currency remained stable, despite jitters earlier this week after the palace declared the king\u2019s condition unstable on Sunday.  Open discussion of the monarchy is restricted by a strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law that makes criticism of the royal family punishable by years in prison. In practice, this means open discussion of the succession is considered illegal. \u201cThe death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej is a landmark event in Thai politics, with stark implications for that country\u2019s political stability. The vast majority of living Thais has no memory of any other king, and also only knows the monarchy as an almost sacred institution that pervades Thai politics and society,\u201d said Tom Pepinsky, a south-east Asia expert at Cornell University. \u201cThe dominant narrative among many observers is that the king has been a stabilising force, but this belies the decades of coups that have plagued modern Thai history. His death means that the Thai political system must find an alternative focal point around which to unite the country\u2019s factionalised population.\u201d           Thailand\u2019s celebrated monarch dies after 70 years on the throne \u2013 video report ", "publicationDate": "2016-10-14T16:32:25Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/thailand-year-of-mourning-death-king-bhumibol", "title": "Thai king's funeral held at palace as mourners line streets of Bangkok", "sentences": ["Buddhist funeral ceremonies have been held at Bangkok\u2019s grand palace for Thailand\u2019s revered king Bhumibol Adulyadej, as the country began an extended period of mourning for the monarch, who ruled for 70 years.", "pic.twitter.com/qP0F6xOk1L&mdash; Oliver Holmes (@olireports) October 14, 2016    Troops and armoured vehicles have been deployed around Bangkok\u2019s old quarters since late on Thursday.", "Women crying as they heard the news of the death of Thai king Bhumibol Adulyadej outside the Siriraj hospital in Bangkok on Thursday."]}, {"article": "Vayable     Night photography in Paris.

All countries agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, keeping the world \u201cwell below\u201d 2\u00b0C or even at 1.5\u00b0C of warming. By including the 1.5\u00b0C target, the Agreement has become more ambitious than many observers had expected. And the party is still not over: against the odds, countries required less than a year for the Agreement to enter into force. This seems a triumph for climate diplomacy. However, there is to date not a good understanding of how the world could swiftly enter into a period of substantial and sustained emission reductions. Therefore, the adoption of the 1.5\u00b0C target went along with an invitation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to map out the state of the scientific knowledge on the 1.5\u00b0C goal in a report due in autumn 2018. A scoping meeting in Geneva in August of this year convened more than 60 experts and government officials to determine the outline of such an assessment. While the IPCC had a pivotal role in generating a shared understanding of the nature and risks of climate change, it now needs to be more focused on responses to climate change. The costs, benefits and risks of political decisions need more systematic analysis and evaluation. The science so far suggests enormous challenges: the remaining net amount of CO2 that can still be released to the atmosphere in order to keep temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C is at best 200 Gigatons of CO2. With yearly emissions at around 40 Gt CO2, this leaves no more than five years at current rates of emissions. After this point, every single ton of carbon released by households, factories or cars would need to be taken back out of the atmosphere. Furthermore, countries\u2019 pledges to reduce emissions in the short-term - the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) - are insufficient. In fact, the new energy infrastructure that is already in the pipeline for the coming years \u2013 most importantly coal-fired power plants - will quickly eat up the remaining budget.  The suggested outline for the IPCC Special Report on the 1.5\u00b0C goal, which is currently under discussion at the IPCC\u2019s plenary in Bangkok, includes a separate chapter that deals with the matter of how we can address these challenges. This would mean that finally the dissonance between ambition and action would be tackled. This dissonance is especially prevalent in three areas: First, achievement of the 1.5\u00b0C target is fundamentally dependent on our ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at large-scale: the available science suggests that 10 to 25 years of current emissions will need to be stored under the Earth\u2019s crust. If possible at all, this will require a range of CO2 removal technologies. Despite agreeing on highly ambitious climate targets, policymakers and negotiators show limited awareness of this technological dependence: none of the INDCs mentions negative emissions or carbon removal and very few have plans for advancing carbon capture and storage (CCS). So far, science has not come forward with systematic explorations of the role of carbon dioxide removal technology portfolios in climate change mitigation. How much carbon dioxide removal we need depending on alternative policy packages is still largely unexplored. For example, slower decarbonization in key sectors like transport, industry and agriculture will likely lead to a larger dependence on CO2 removal. Second, negative emissions technologies such as carbon capture and storage and other large-scale climate change mitigation strategies have been subject to intense criticism, mostly due to the pressure on land that is needed for food and shelter for a growing world population.  Above all, however, the IPCC will need to make progress in evaluating climate and energy policies. The entire focus of the climate debate is now shifting towards the question of how the required emission reductions can be achieved quickly enough. A precondition for supporting short-term action with robust science is to learn fast what policies work well and what policies do not. Unless the IPCC manages to put a new emphasis on solving the climate change challenge right at the core of its assessments, it risks becoming increasingly irrelevant. Given the immense, almost inconceivable challenges imposed by the 1.5\u00b0C, the Special Report is the ideal starting point for this shift. The risk is that the report will be business-as-usual, shedding little light on policy performance: the short-term features of mitigation and development pathways are present in the suggested outline, but are not prominent. It is therefore critical for the approval of the report outline to keep in mind that the Special Report does not only cover what would be needed in the second half of the century, but also takes into account the short term, including the amount of carbon-intensive infrastructure currently planned or under construction.  For the IPCC - a hybrid organization that brings together scientists and policymakers in a well-formalized dialogue - conducting insightful policy assessments will bring new challenges. Rather than deepening conflict between scientists and policymakers, finding ways to synthesise knowledge without blaming and shaming countries needs to be the focus now. The IPCC Special Report on 1.5\u00b0C is an opportunity for the scientific community to deliver the insight needed by negotiators. An adoption of the suggested outline in Bangkok will already send the right signals to scientists and negotiators at when they meet next month in Marrakech.

You can join millions of like-minded subjects who venerate King Bhumibol Adulyadej. You feel like a member of a gigantic family, as the king is often referred to by these loyal subjects as their \u201croyal father\u201d.   Related: The Guardian view on the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej: a nation can be renewed | Editorial    And when the king passed away last week, the grief and mourning was shared by millions. Royalists praised his more than 4,000 projects that helped to improve the lives of many Thais over the seven decades of his reign. Most Thais have known no other monarch than Bhumibol. Decades of media exposure to positive stores about the king also means royalists are convinced that he was like a walking angel, and venerate him as a semi-divine figure. Tears and the extreme public display of grief by royalist Thais over the past few days around the Grand Palace in Bangkok where the king\u2019s body lies, and elsewhere, are genuine. Some wish they could die, instead of their beloved monarch. Others pray they could continue to be his loyal subjects through an endless cycle of reincarnation. Strictly speaking, there is no god in Buddhism, which is the religion of the vast majority of the near-70 million Thais. Perhaps many were longing for the comfort of having a god-like figure that is perfect and beyond doubt. Thus anyone, particularly Thai, who casts doubt on this idealised relationship between the king and his loyal subjects are regarded as unpatriotic and ungrateful. To them, to be Thai is to be loyal to the king. However, Thailand in the 21st century is, in reality, a pluralistic society. That means it\u2019s impossible to expect all Thais to share the same royalist ideology. The struggle to break the hegemony on what constitutes Thai identity has been going on since the time of communist insurgency during the cold war. Liberal ideology has taken root among Thais, some of whom want to see the monarchy become more transparent and subject to scrutiny, alongside traditional royalism. It would be inaccurate to regard all Thais as royalists. Beyond the genuine grief expressed by the hundreds of thousands who have been paying their last respects, life goes on almost as normal for many. Those who stepped over the line by criticising or defaming the monarch, violating the draconian l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law, face heavy punishment, with the maximum penalty being 15 years in prison. Over 60 people have been prosecuted under the law since the May 2014 military coup. One of the reasons why those who think differently about the monarchy must be censored, silenced or prosecuted is because it challenges the dominant discourse that all Thais love and revere the king. Royalist Thais love to imagine that the kingdom of Thailand is unique and regard the late king as \u201cthe king of kings\u201d. It is somewhat like the pride in believing that your favourite football team is the best in the world. Any challenge must be suppressed.    Beyond the media sphere, royalist vigilante pressure for all to wear black to mourn is growing    Three days after the passing of the king, Khaosod English, the online English-language news website I work for, reported that the kingdom\u2019s main cable TV provider, True Visions, admitted to censoring the BBC and al-Jazeera news coverage of the death and its repercussion for Thailand to comply with the mourning period reporting guidelines issued by the state\u2019s broadcast regulator. Khaosod English\u2019s reporter Sasiwan Mokkhasen obtained what appeared to be a recruitment message for freelancers to monitor news. \u201cThe job is to watch al-Jazeera and BBC. If they broadcast some negative news about the king, tell the person sitting next to you to cut it off the air,\u201d read the message. \u201cWhen that news ends, you switch it back.\u201d As if this is not enough, the regulator has also asked internet providers to set up 24/7 monitoring centres to search for \u201cinappropriate content\u201d across all social media platforms including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, according to the online news website Prachatai. Beyond the media sphere, royalist vigilante pressure for all to wear black to mourn is growing to the point where the spokesman of the military government urged the public to tolerate those who may not be in black. One of my friends asked her father, a former diplomat, whether they had to wear black for a year. Fearing negative repercussion, she was told to \u201cshut up\u201d. \u201cIf we cannot ask about basic questions on clothing, then we cannot ask more serious questions,\u201d she told me. Apparently, voices that do not fit the utopian discourse must not be allowed to disturb the royalists\u2019 vision of the late king and the kingdom of Thailand.", "publicationDate": "2016-10-17T13:22:01Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Freedom of speech"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/thailand-royalists-king-bhumibol-adulyadej-died", "title": "In Thailand, royalists\u2019 vision of the late king still reigns | Pravit Rojanaphruk", "sentences": ["Tears and the extreme public display of grief by royalist Thais over the past few days around the Grand Palace in Bangkok where the king\u2019s body lies, and elsewhere, are genuine."]}, {"article": "About halfway into his introduction to Death: an Oral History, Casey Jarman lets the reader in on the impetus of the project: \u201cI wrote this [book] in the hopes of beating death altogether.\u201d It\u2019s an impossible objective \u2013 the reader knows it, the writer knows it \u2013 but not a disingenuous one, and Jarman\u2019s literary debut is a testament to the value of doggedly pursuing a goal that has never and can never be realized. We can\u2019t beat death, but maybe we can beat fear of it. The 18 interviews contained within Death are Jarman\u2019s investigation into the possibility. For a writer responsible for a work so ambitious in scope and often devastating in content, Jarman is disarmingly humble and upbeat. When we speak on the phone, he immediately acknowledges his discomfort with being the interviewee and offers a precautionary apology should he come across as trying to steer the conversation. (He doesn\u2019t.) He pokes fun at himself for his desire \u2013 which he describes as being born of inherent laziness \u2013 to \u201cget out of\u201d dealing with death, and he speaks on the subject more with wonder than authority.   Related: Let's talk about death: what does it mean to you?    Perhaps this is because Jarman\u2019s background is not in philosophy, or science, or any death-specific discipline. He received his journalism degree from the University of Oregon, and has since focused primarily on music, holding positions as music editor for the Portland, Oregon-based alt-weekly Willamette Week and as managing editor at the Believer. When his friend Adam Grano, art director at Zest Books, suggested he pitch an idea to Zest\u2019s editors, Jarman decided to pivot. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to spend a year thinking about albums or doing music criticism, which is kind of the most natural thing for me, and the one thing that\u2019s constantly on my mind is death,\u201d Jarman says. \u201cWhen I do interviews, I always wind up talking to artists who tackle that subject. One day I\u2019m not going to exist and none of the things I\u2019m doing now are going to matter \u2013 how do you come back from that? How does anybody make art or build houses or wash dishes? That\u2019s the thought I linger on every single day, and sometimes it\u2019s positive, and sometime it\u2019s negative, but it\u2019s just always been there.\u201d     Mourners, wearing black clothing after the death of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, exit from the subway in Bangkok, Thailand. Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/AP    His was a simple pitch on a broad theme (\u201cWhat if I talked about death with a bunch of people \u2013 people who work in death-related industries and people who\u2019ve had close emotional experiences with death?\u201d) but his limiting factors came in the form of convictions about what he didn\u2019t want the book to be. It wouldn\u2019t be \u201cX celebrity\u2019s thoughts on this or Y celebrity\u2019s thoughts on that\u201d, nor would it stray too far from the humanity of the stories. Jarman didn\u2019t speak with funeral directors or undertakers about the physicality of death. He wasn\u2019t necessarily interested in the gritty details; he wanted an inroad to the emotions surrounding it \u2013 emotions often silenced or self-censored by notions of propriety. Perhaps most significantly, it wouldn\u2019t be about Jarman himself, because Jarman hasn\u2019t yet been affected by a profound loss. \u201cI tried to be upfront about this being a curiosity to me, and I did have a certain sense of feeling like an imposter,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so grateful to everyone that I spoke with for giving me such emotional access, but there were a lot of times when I\u2019d be sitting in a room with someone and we both knew there was that bridge that neither of us could fully cross. Nobody could really explain loss to me in a way that I would fully understand, and I couldn\u2019t quite ask the right questions. It was a lot of fumbling.\u201d The fumbling is one way in which the format mirrors the content \u2013 meandering stories about groping for a clear path through grief. Jarman largely steps out of the way of the narratives, removing his voice save for his introductions to the book and each interview. The result is an unhindered intimacy with each subject: the scientist whose sister\u2019s death spurred her research in a \u201cpsychedelic hospice\u201d, the former death row warden now working to repeal the death penalty, the Black Lives Matter activist trying to find solace in proactive grief, the social worker grappling with her mother\u2019s recent death, to name just a few. Still, Jarman\u2019s presence is felt through the reader\u2019s experience of yearning for a solution that simply doesn\u2019t exist. His curation keeps the book agnostic, not only in the literal sense of presenting the possibilities of multiple belief systems, but also in its refusal to settle on any one ritual, coping mechanism, or method of grieving as the correct or optimal action in the face of death \u2013 whether one\u2019s own, or of a loved one. The frustrating fact is there is no right way of handling it, but perhaps the most consistent theme throughout each interview is a collective impulse toward preparation, a desire to do work now that would ensure future resilience.     Ivy and other plants grow over the gravestones at Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol, England. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images    Usually this prep work is in deliberate exposure. In one interview, Holly Pruett, a memorial officiant and organizer of Death Cafes in Portland, Oregon, says she became interested in social gatherings built around discussions of death because, \u201cI thought at the time, maybe I could befriend the concept of death and just develop a greater capacity to handle it, be more prepared.\u201d Undoubtedly this book is Jarman\u2019s own exercise in preparation for the inevitability of death, though he now acknowledges its futility. \u201cThe reality of the situation is that there are muscles you have that you don\u2019t know exist until you\u2019re grieving for someone,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom what I learned from everyone I talked to, if you try to prepare for the steps you\u2019re going to have to take when something awful happens, 99% of the time you\u2019re going to find yourself taking wholly unexpected steps when you actually confront the terrible thing. Grief isn\u2019t something that you do, it\u2019s something that happens to you. The best you can do is prepare to be moved how everything moves you.\u201d But all hope is not lost. The collection never falls into the gratuitously maudlin or morbid. Yes, it will make you cry in public, but those hoping for tragedy porn should look elsewhere. Jarman recalls being surprised often throughout the interviews, but most keenly when subjects \u2013 especially those who \u201chad more than a professional relationship with death\u201d \u2013 found their way to a discussion of the beautiful moments, or as Jarman calls it, the \u201cart to death\u201d. \u201cSo many people talked about a kind of beauty that\u2019s inherent in the process of being there as someone\u2019s dying, or going through the grieving process. There\u2019s a lot of garbage, of course, but there are also these beautiful moments, and especially in the outpouring of support and sympathy and love.\u201d And though Jarman isn\u2019t cured of his fear of death, he at least has mitigated it \u2013 thanks, in large part, to his conscious attempt at breaking through the silence that usually surrounds it. \u201cSix months ago, I don\u2019t know that I would\u2019ve had this answer, but now I do feel a little more at peace with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we have real conversations about what death means to us, and what our friends and family members have gone through around death, then suddenly it\u2019s not such a crazy albatross to drag around any more. I left this process with a bigger toolkit, not even so much to deal with death but just to be a human being. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to solve this riddle,\u201d he adds, laughing. \u201cThat used to frustrate the hell out of me. Now I\u2019m kind of intrigued by it.\u201d  Death: An Oral History is available in the US from Zest Books.

Muangthong United were crowned Thai League champions, while two of the three clubs to be relegated might have stayed up had the remaining three rounds of matches been played.  King Bhumibol Adulyadej died last week aged 88, after seven decades on the throne. The government announced a 30-day mourning period during which people were expected to wear black or dark clothing and abstain from entertainment including concerts and sports events.    Thailand laws   The football association initially announced that the season was over, but a day later it said further discussions would take place after the relegated teams lodged appeals. When all the league clubs then met, 17 out of 18 agreed to end the season early. It is likely there was strong pressure to vote in favour of the ruling. Strict lese-majesty laws in Thailand make it a crime to criticise members of the royal family, and it would be risky for a football club or any other business to be seen as prioritising its ambitions over a period of national mourning. Advertisers have turned their billboards black for a month and dozens of events, including the annual Bangkok world film festival and a Morrissey concert, have been postponed.  Chainat Hornbill, one of the relegated clubs, voted in favour of the cancellation, but its vice-president said he would consider raising the case with Fifa.  \u201cI would like to inform you that we do agree with the decision to cancel matches, because we can mourn for the loss of the king, and to remember his majesty\u2019s boundless and gracious kindness.

More often than not straight out of school, such journalists would begin in their teens as reporters indentured to a local newspaper, which would undertake to train them hands-on in the trade. Once they had passed a proficiency test, they would usually move on to fresh fields, either remaining a reporter or, perhaps tempted by more regular hours, becoming a subeditor. So Mark, while he had a relatively privileged upbringing \u2013 his parents sent him to Winchester college \u2013 rejected the dreaming spires for the hard reality of ordinary men and women whose lives were chronicled by the local press. He was born in Leek, Staffordshire, the son of Elvine (nee Clowes) and Colin Stanway, an engineer and partner in a firm manufacturing bespoke electric motors at a factory in Stoke-on-Trent.

The following day, on the pitch at their stadium, they posed for a rather unusual pre-match team picture. Front and centre, held by their captain, Wes Morgan, was a large gold\u2011framed photograph of the monarch. The players were wearing black armbands. It was one of the strangest images in the history of English football \u2013 and, coming in the week of the first signs of a threat to the prosperity of the Premier League, perhaps one of the most significant. In the six years since the Bangkok\u2011based duty-free magnate Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought the club, Leicester have gone from the lower reaches of the Championship to the Champions League, while acquiring a substantial following in Thailand. This is a great success story and probably not a single fan will begrudge the chairman\u2019s decision to put himself \u2013 rather than, say, Claudio Ranieri \u2013 on the cover of the programme for their first Champions League match, or question the team\u2019s public show of mourning for the late Thai king. To anyone outside the Leicester ranks, however, it might look a bit odd, even a bit uncomfortable, to see a 132-year-old English football club acknowledging its new allegiance so explicitly.   Related: Is the unthinkable happening \u2013 are people finally switching the football off? | Owen Gibson    The widespread takeover of English football clubs by foreign owners over the past 20 years has resulted in many outcomes. Leicester\u2019s story has been a happy one, as has the partnership of Manchester City and Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, whose infinite riches bankrolled not just a Premier League\u2011winning all-star squad but a new campus in east Manchester. The first of the new generation of foreign owners was Mohamed Al Fayed, who took Fulham from the third tier to a solid existence in the top flight and a European final during his 16 years of flamboyant stewardship. At Watford the Pozzo family assumed control in 2012 and, despite getting through managers at an indecent rate, succeeded in returning the club to the Premier League. For others the experience has been rather different. Massimo Cellino at Leeds United, Fawaz al-Hasawi at Nottingham Forest and Roland Duch\u00e2telet at Charlton Athletic have enraged their supporters with quixotic and sometimes downright ignorant decisions and have demonstrated little sense of responsibility towards the stewardship of historic and much cherished institutions. Shahid Khan, to whom Fayed sold Fulham in 2013, has shown nothing of his predecessor\u2019s ability to listen to and act on the right advice.     Leicester players paid their respects to the deceased Thai king, Bhumibol Adulyade, before their home game against Crystal Palace.    It is important to recognise that supporters never revolt against success. The protests in 2010 against the Glazer family\u2019s financial stewardship of Manchester United, symbolised by the wearing of green and yellow Newton Heath FC scarves, quickly died away. But in a wider and more profound sense the ownership of clubs rooted in their communities by foreign entities, whether as investment vehicles or trophy purchases, may be having the effect of disengaging the emotions of the domestic football fan base from the game as a whole. In the phrase currently fashionable in political debate, it is \u201chollowing out\u201d the feeling that fans have for their sport. What is to be made of the situation in the West Midlands, a virtual petri dish for the ownership of English football clubs by Chinese businessmen, with Guochuan Lai at West Brom, Paul Suen Cho Hung at Birmingham City, Tony Xia at Aston Villa and Guo Guangchang at Wolves? If any of those owners were to bring real success to their clubs, they would receive the grateful adoration of their season-ticket holders. But the suspicion that they are not in it simply for the pleasure of owning a football club, or even for the local prestige that motivated the chairmen of earlier eras, is seeping like a slow-acting poison into the body of the league. Perhaps it helps to explain the recently announced decline in TV\u00a0viewing figures for live matches transmitted by Sky and BT this season. No doubt several factors are in play, including the feeling that the introduction of the regular Friday night match has finally created a surfeit of live football. The rebranding of the unloved League Cup as the EFL Cup has succeeding in making the competition even more of an irritating irrelevance, cluttering up the fixture list in a way that no major American sport would permit. And there may also be a growing boredom with the domination of the narrative by the small group of celebrity managers \u2013 Mourinho, Guardiola, Klopp, Wenger, Conte, Pochettino \u2013 at the top clubs, created and fuelled by the media. By other measurements, the Premier League is as healthy as it is wealthy. TV income continues to enrich many participants, deserving and otherwise. Stadiums remain full because fans are committed to their individual clubs.

The country\u2019s l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 (wounded majesty) laws are among the world\u2019s strictest, meaning anyone who \u201cdefames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir-apparent or regent\u201d can face up to 15\u00a0years on each charge. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who spent seven decades on the throne, was seen as a unifying figure in a politically turbulent country. But his death, at the age of 88, on 13 October has led to both uncertainty and a heightened sensitivity over any discussion of the monarchy\u2019s role. Crowds have gathered outside the palace since the king died and, in an attempt to relieve tension, the authorities announced on Saturday that 10,000 mourners would be allowed to enter the throne hall of Bangkok\u2019s Grand Palace \u2013 where the king\u2019s body is lying \u2013 every day. The ruling junta, which took power in a military coup in 2014, positions itself as being closely aligned with the monarchy and has sought to appease ultra-royalist factions by pursuing anyone deemed to have breached l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws. National police chief Jakthip Chaijinda told reporters last week that arrest warrants had already been issued for eight of 20 suspects in Thailand. \u201cFor l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 cases, if people don\u2019t want to live in Thailand they should go abroad,\u201d Jakthip told journalists. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have money for the air fare, I will pay for it.

It said last week that it had asked several foreign countries to extradite people accused of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. While it did not name the countries, a Cambodian official said that authorities were working on an appeal to extradite three Thais accused of insulting the monarchy. The Cambodian foreign ministry spokesman, Chum Sounary, told reporters that its government \u201cis processing the extradition request\u201d.

Political opponents of the military say they have used the law, Article 112, to silence opponents. In 2014 complaints were filed against a woman who wore black on the king\u2019s birthday, and last year military courts jailed two people under the law, one for 30 years and the other for 28, for posts on Facebook. Sensitivity about the monarchy is at a high point and the government has been under pressure to show that it is upholding the royal family\u2019s reputation. Shortly after Bhumibol\u2019s death, the prime minister declared a year of mourning, under which civil servants are expected to wear black. Thais and foreigners in the country have been told to wear black, white or grey for a month. A high-level delegation \u2013 including the deputy prime minister \u2013 was sent to meet Google executives to push the company to remove any content that defames the royal family, including videos posted on its subsidiary, YouTube. Public displays of grief have also been significant. Many websites, from the Bangkok Post newspaper to Tesco\u2019s Thai site, have turned their homepages black. Thai Airways has waived fees for rescheduling flights for a month, and foreign leaders have flown to Bangkok to pay their respects. Hollywood actor Steven Seagal met the prime minister, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, to express his condolences. The domestic football season was cancelled to show respect for the late king. But there have also been incidents since 13 October that highlight how deeply taboo any objective discussion of the monarchy has become. Last week the justice minister said Thai people should \u201csocially sanction\u201d those who defame the monarchy. Days before, a Thai woman accused of insulting the late king on social media was forced to kneel before his portrait outside a police station in front of jeering crowds. Bhumibol was formally known as King Rama IX, and was the ninth of the 234-year-old Chakri dynasty. His son and crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn, 64, is in line to become the next king but has asked that his ascension to the throne be delayed while he grieves with the Thai people. General Prayuth later told the country that the heir apparent could become king between seven and 15 days after the king\u2019s death, or later. An official coronation will not happen until after the funeral for the king, in a year\u2019s time.

I was tidying the park as part of my duties when I came across a beautiful, solitary elephant with a badly deformed front leg. Concerned as to why she was alone and curious about her physical health, I asked a guide. Kabu was 26 years old, like me. She had been rescued about a year before but sadly never settled with a herd. She had been used for the illegal logging trade since infancy, pulling huge weights up and down steep mountain ravines. During one of these tortuous journeys, a log came loose, rolled into her and badly broke her leg. Forced to continue working, her injury never healed. When Kabu was finally rescued she was weak and traumatised. When she arrived at the park she had tears rolling from her eyes \u2013 from relief, said the guide.   Related: Why the Guardian is spending a year reporting on the plight of elephants    Wanting a photograph with her, I stood next to her, as I had done with the other elephants. I was not prepared for what happened next; Kabu mirrored my movement and leant into me. As she moved in closer, I could feel her sheer strength against my body. This gave me a sense of safety and security, so I pressed against her further as if to hug her. Moving closer towards her head, I looked into her dark eyes for several moments, and rubbed the top of her trunk. As she looked back at me, I was amazed. Here was an animal who had gone through unspeakable horrors, yet was still willing to trust and give affection to a human. We were in the Elephant Nature Park (ENP), a 250-acre sanctuary for rescued Asian elephants like Kabu, founded by award-winning conservationist Lek Chailert (known as the \u201celephant whisperer\u201d). Chailert was born in a mountain village in northern Thailand and grew up in a family that owned an elephant. From a young age, she was devoted to their care. She witnessed the traumatic circumstances in which many Asian elephants live and set about creating safe spaces for them.     An elephant is chained while performing in Yangon zoo during a special celebration in front of a crowd. Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP/Getty    It is a little-known fact that Asian elephants are even more endangered than their African cousins. Perhaps just 50,000 are left. In Thailand there are about 6,000, half of which live in captivity. The ancient tradition of capture and domestication not only raises welfare problems, it is also a strain on the dwindling wild stock. On top of this many, some Asian elephants are subjected to a centuries-old domestication ritual known as \u201cthe crush\u201d, which breaks the spirit of a baby elephant to make it submit to human control.    Here was an animal who had gone through unspeakable horrors, yet was still willing to trust a human    Animal rights groups report that some elephants in the south-east Asian tourism industry \u2013 whether being used for riding or appearing to calmly paint pictures in the street \u2013 have gone through some form of the crush. In the most extreme examples of the crush wild calves are separated from their mothers and tied in a pen so constrictive it cannot move or lie down. This treatment may last for several weeks, and observers describe cases where food, water and sleep are restricted, and injuries are inflicted on the animals. Elephants are highly sentient, evolved animals, who form lifelong relationships with their families. Anyone who has spent any time with these beautiful creatures cannot doubt their sensitivity and intelligence, and the risk of lifelong damage from treatment such as the crush. Some elephants become withdrawn or behave aggressively towards humans \u2013 both examples of how psychological damage can be manifested.               Sangduen \u2018Lek\u2019 Chailert, the founder of Chiang Mai\u2019s Elephant Nature Park, sings lullabies to the elephants in her care.    The ethos of the ENP sanctuary, surrounded by rainforest and rivers, is for rescued elephants to roam completely free, for them never to work and to live out their lives in peace, happiness and fun. They form new family bonds, and some even have calves. While it is still visible how much pain and suffering these animals have endured \u2013 some are blind and others are too emotionally unpredictable to interact with humans \u2013 most of the elephants are relaxed and enjoy their freedom. ENP largely raises money through sponsorship and tourism. Visitors can stay for one day, or volunteer for up to two weeks (as I did). And how had I ended up here? A few months earlier I had been sitting in therapy, wrestling with conflicting urges to harm myself or to help myself. After experiences of abuse in my childhood, I began self-harming before I was 13. At this particular moment I was wrestling with hallucinations and beliefs that by hurting myself the disturbing images would go away. This time, however, I realised there could be another solution. I needed to do something life-changing, something that would take me out of my own head and into the world.    Anyone who has spent any time with these beautiful creatures cannot doubt their sensitivity and intelligence    I didn\u2019t initially know where to go. But after some research I found the Elephant Nature Park. Being a vegan and animal advocate, I felt it had the right ethos. While both my therapist and my wife were encouraging, they did have some concerns. Would I be well enough to travel far away? Would I be able to stay safe if I encountered anything that triggered urges to self-harm? What if being in such an environment were disheartening as opposed to inspirational, as I hoped? Although I was giddy with excitement about my grand adventure, I had to admit that these were concerns I shared. It took an overnight train ride from Bangkok to reach Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand, near the border with Burma. On the first day, everyone met at the ENP office in Chiang Mai city centre for registration and transport to the sanctuary itself. Our minivans were equipped with DVDs about how not to get trodden on by an elephant, something which had fleetingly crossed my mind before but was now crystallised as a legitimate possibility.     \u2018Elephants are highly sentient, evolved animals, who form lifelong relationships with their families.\u2019 Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters    Upon arrival, 50 or so excitable individuals waited to be paired up with roommates and organised into our volunteering groups. They were a lovely group of various ages from all over the world.  Our first task was unloading the watermelon truck and filling up the \u201celephant kitchen\u201d. We each got into single file, passing along watermelons from the van to the many giant shelves that housed the elephant food. I was hit with the heady aroma of sweet fruit, and willed my body to adapt to the heat while shifting the heavy loads.   Related: Why the Guardian is spending a year reporting on the plight of elephants    My first elephant encounter was in fact rather unexpected; a sneaky trunk peeking around from the back of the kitchen, curious to identify any chopped up pieces of fruit ready for eating. I instantly knew that this was going to be a wonderful fortnight. The volunteering itself focuses on providing care for the elephants such as bathing, food preparation (I have seen enough watermelons to last a lifetime), and accompanying them to the vets. Volunteers also look after the park; scooping poop (there is a proper technique to this; shovel from the back of the pile, lift up from the centre) tidying shelters and planting trees.  All of us as volunteers were incredibly touched to have the opportunity to stay here and look after the elephants. My group of new friends and I would come together each meal time with new stories and experiences to share, and certain times of day became graced with new importance: 3pm, time to help bathe the elephants; 4pm, feeding time opposite our own dinner table. It would be unrealistic to say that I did not experience intrusive thoughts or that my hallucinations stopped outright, but I felt no need to act upon them, and my happiness far outweighed any negative emotions. The routine and the socialising was important, but the fact that I was helping these amazing creatures was by far the most important factor.   Range of Asian elephants   I think being in such an environment was therapeutic for all. There is a wealth of anecdotal evidence that animal assisted therapy can have a real impact on the social and psychological wellbeing of those struggling from both physical and psychological problems. I have a degree in psychology, and being here highlighted to me that there is a need for more formal studies to be conducted to build up the evidence base. I have returned from ENP with a renewed sense of wanting to face and survive my own pain, actively working towards giving up self-harm. Although I have had challenging moments, I have not self-harmed once since coming back and I am approaching a year free of self-harm altogether. Kabu continues to be a source of inspiration. If an elephant can go through the crush and survive forced labour without giving up hope and trust, then there is no reason why I cannot overcome my own trauma.

It could again be at 98% capacity once the  third runway is built, and without further capacity its relative decline will continue.  In contrast, Singapore has built its infrastructure for the future. When an impoverished Singapore became independent 51 years ago, its prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, took the decision that investing in infrastructure was key to economic growth.

Many countries consider hydroelectricity a clean source of power because it doesn\u2019t involve burning dirty fossil fuels. But that\u2019s far from true. Hydropower is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions: a new study shows that the world\u2019s hydroelectric dams are responsible for as much methane emissions as Canada. The study from Washington State University finds that methane, which is at least 34 times more potent than another greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, makes up 80% of the emissions from water storage reservoirs created by dams. What\u2019s more, none of these emissions are currently included in global greenhouse gas inventories. These are already revealing a worrisome future in which rising global temperatures will likely cause environmental changes such as rising sea levels and stronger hurricanes, which could uproot communities and intensify competition for food and other resources. \u201cI think this study shows that dams as a source of energy aren\u2019t without their greenhouse gas costs,\u201d says Bridget Deemer, a research ecologist at the US Geologic Survey, who led the study during her prior position as a research associate at Washington State. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a renewable source of energy, people should keep the greenhouse gas side of the picture in mind when making planning and policy decisions regarding dams.\u201d The research, which examines 100 recent studies on greenhouse gas emissions from 267 large reservoirs around the world, also calls into question the wisdom of building more hydroelectric dams as countries try to nix their dependence on coal, natural gas and oil. An estimated 3,700 new dams are proposed or under construction around the globe, the study reports. It suggests the hydropower industry will need to control its emissions.   Related: This new technology could save the troubled nuclear power industry    But industry officials in the US say the study misrepresents the benefit of hydropower in the fight to rein in global warming. \u201cSingling out hydropower is irresponsible and inaccurate, to say the least,\u201d says LeRoy Coleman, a spokesman for the National Hydropower Association, based in Washington DC. \u201cHydropower is needed to meet federal and state clean energy goals.\u201d Hydropower represents 6% of all energy generation in America, according to the US Energy Information Administration. For newly built power plants, hydropower\u2019s total cost of construction and operation runs about $68 per megawat-hour, which is comparable to solar, slightly more expensive than wind, and cheaper than coal and natural gas when those sources incorporate technology to capture carbon emissions. Hydropower is often considered a source of renewable electricity because its fuel, water, is constantly replenished by nature. By that standard, hydropower produces 52% of all renewable electricity in the US, according to the National Hydropower Association. Only 3% of reservoirs in the US are equipped to produce hydropower, Coleman says. Others are limited to water storage and flood protection duties, and some of them are good candidates for electricity generation, he adds. \u201cThe responsible and logical approach would be to capture the energy potential of these reservoirs and combat climate change by installing hydropower equipment,\u201d Coleman says.     Top 10 power plants in the world/ Illustration: Ucilia Wang/The Guardian    As recently as a decade ago, little was known about emissions from water storage reservoirs. But understanding has evolved rapidly. For instance, researchers initially thought shallow reservoirs in tropical regions were the largest emitters because their stored water was more prone to heating up, which could fuel greenhouse gas production. But analysis by Deemer and her colleagues shows that the latitude and depth of water are not leading factors. Instead, \u201cbiological activities\u201d in a reservoir \u2013 such as decaying vegetation and nutrient runoff from watersheds upstream \u2013 are more important indicators of greenhouse gas emissions. The nutrient runoff can be from natural processes or from farming, logging and land development. Using data from the 267 reservoirs, the authors estimate total emissions from all reservoirs worldwide and conclude that those water storage facilities account for 1.3% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions. Another new study published by the journal PLOS One reaches similar conclusions, although it finds carbon dioxide to be a bigger share of emissions than methane. After examining data from more than 1,400 dams worldwide, it identifies the rate of soil erosion into a reservoir as a leading predictor of carbon dioxide emissions. Led by Laura Scherer, a research associate at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, that study concludes the \u201ccarbon footprint of hydropower is far higher than previously assumed\u201d. \u201cThese are massive emissions, and we can\u2019t ignore that,\u201d says Kate Horner, executive director of the environmental group International Rivers, based in Berkeley, California. \u201cThere are a massive number of dams that are currently proposed to be built. It would be a grave mistake to continue to finance those with the impression that they were part of the solution to the climate crisis.\u201d Coleman contends that it\u2019s premature to use data from these studies to criticize hydropower because the science remains uncertain. It is challenging to measure reservoir emissions because so many factors can play a role, Deemer acknowledges. The scientific community also doesn\u2019t follow a standard practice for counting emissions, even though the International Hydropower Association and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) published a set of guidelines in 2010.   Related: Can America's first floating wind farm shake off environmental concerns?    Emissions vary according to a wide variety of factors, including water and air temperatures, season and time of day, vegetation and soil types in both the reservoir and the upstream watershed, and watershed management practices. Hydropower dams constantly manipulate water levels to make electricity, a process that also affects the amount of emissions that make their way into the atmosphere from the reservoir. As water levels decline, the hydrostatic pressure on submerged soils also lowers and allows gas bubbles to escape. Sometimes the methane in these bubbles is absorbed by the water column and never reaches the surface. Other times it makes the great escape into the air. Deemer and her colleagues note that many studies don\u2019t sample emissions thoroughly enough both across reservoir surface area and over time. As a result, she says, the emissions estimates in her study are probably low. The challenge in measuring emissions also makes it difficult to figure out how to reduce them. Researchers speculate it may be possible to reduce emissions by managing water levels in a reservoir differently. This, however, could affect electricity generation, fishery and flood protection, and other operations. Protecting watersheds to reduce erosion into reservoirs could also reduce emissions as well as improve water quality, forest health and aquatic habitat. Global greenhouse gas inventories currently do not include emissions from reservoirs at all, but that is changing. At an October meeting in Bangkok, a committee of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change took a first step by agreeing to include reservoirs, which it categorizes as \u201cflooded lands\u201d, in an updated guidance document that instructs nations on accounting for their greenhouse gas emissions. But it may be several more years until that document is formally approved. The US government does not account for reservoir emissions in its own greenhouse gas inventory. The country is dotted with roughly 79,000 dams, including more than 2,200 private and public hydropower plants. The US Bureau of Reclamation, for example, manages 337 reservoirs, and a science advisor to the agency, Dave Raff, says the bureau is taking on the emissions accounting task. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged in trying to understand what the different mechanisms are for reservoirs as they generate these greenhouse gases,\u201d Raff says. \u201cAnd ultimately, what are the management levers we have to pull that could mitigate those. I do think we feel a sense of urgency to be on that path.\u201d  The article was amended on 6 November 2016 to show that the cost of building and operating a hydropower plant is about $68 per megawtt-hour, not kilowatt-hour.

Nato  The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he was looking forward to working with Trump and that US leadership was vital to the world\u2019s biggest military alliance.  \u201cIt is important that the transatlantic bond remains strong\u201d, he said, adding that \u201cUS leadership is as important as ever\u201d. Stoltenberg said he was looking forward to welcoming Trump at next spring\u2019s Nato summit, to be held in the alliance\u2019s new premises in Brussels. Europe UK  Theresa May congratulated Trump on his victory in a hard-fought campaign, saying Britain and the US have \u201can enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise\u201d. She added: \u201cWe are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence. I look forward to working with president-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead.\u201d   Related: Europe\u2019s far right has been boosted by Trump\u2019s win \u2013 for now | Cas Mudde    Number 10 policymakers are already viewing the result through the same prism as Brexit. The head of the No 10 policy board, George Freeman, tweeted: \u201cat its heart this is about a broken contract through the failure of globalised market economics to serve the interests of domestic workers.\u201d He said the result was \u201ca stunning demonstration of how disempowered low income Americans feel by Washington politics and globalisation\u201d. \u201cThe insurgency is a big test for the constitutional protections for liberty and democracy in the UK and the US. It is clear we are living through a genuine crisis of legitimacy sweeping through western political economy\u201d. He asked whether the EU leaders will wake up to \u201cthe roar of anger at globalisation, machine politics, and out of touch elites\u201d. Freeman, who was a fierce critic of the tone of Trump\u2019s campaign and at one point described him as Trumpolini, added: \u201cthe key now is how he governs, and who he appoints to his administration\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon urged Trump to prove that he can act for all US citizens regardless of their heritage. The Scottish first minister said many US voters and others around the world would feel \u201ca real sense of anxiety\u201d at his victory, adding: \u201cI hope the president-elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalised by his campaign and make clear - in deeds as well as words - that he will be a president for everyone in modern, multicultural America.\u201d \u201cToday must also be a moment for those who share progressive values - all of us who believe in tolerance and diversity - to speak up loudly and clearly for the values we hold dear.\u201d France French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said Trump\u2019s win \u201copens up a period of uncertainty\u201d that \u201cmust be faced with lucidity and clarity\u201d.  Hollande congratulated Trump \u201cas is natural between two heads of state\u201d, but showed little enthusiasm. Hollande had openly endorsed Clinton. \u201cCertain positions taken by Donald Trump during the American campaign must be confronted with the values and interests we share with the United States,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhat is at stake is peace, the fight against terrorism, the situation in the Middle East. It is economic relations and the preservation of the planet.\u201d Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said European politicians should heed the message from Trump votes. \u201cThere is a part of our electorate that feels \u2026abandoned\u201d, including people who feel \u201cleft behind by globalisation,\u201d he said. Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel said:   There\u2019s no country outside the European Union we Germans have as close a relationship with as the United States of America. Whoever rules this vast country, with its enormous economic strength, its military potential, its cultural influence, carries a responsibility which is felt all over the world.  Americans have decided that the person to carry this responsibility for the next four years is Donald Trump. Germany and America are connected by common values: democracy, freedom, respect for the law and for human dignity irrespective of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political conviction. On the basis of these values, I offer the future president of America, Donald Trump, a close working relationship.  Partnership with the USA remains a basic pillar of German foreign policy in order for us to meet the great challenges of our time: striving for economic and social wellbeing and a forward-looking climate policy, the fight against terrorism, hunger and disease, engagement for peace and freedom, in Germany, Europe and all over the world.\u201d  The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said:   I believe the biggest challenge will be to meet the high expectations that Trump himself has created: to make America great again, also with a view to the economy, to create new jobs in the current economic environment, all that won\u2019t be easy. Above all I hope that we aren\u2019t facing bigger tectonic shifts in international politics.  During his campaign Donald Trump has spoken critically not just about Europe, but particularly about Germany. I think we have to prepare for the fact that American foreign policy will be less predictable for us in the future. We have to be prepared for the fact [...] that America will be more inclined to make unilateral decisions in the future.\u201d  The German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, said the results were a \u201chuge shock\u201d. She told broadcaster ARD: \u201cI think Trump knows that this was not a vote for him but rather against Washington, against the establishment.\u201d Italy Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton even before she secured the Democratic nomination, offered his congratulations to Trump \u201cin the name of Italy\u201d and said he was convinced that the friendship between Italy and the US was strong and solid. \u201cIt\u2019s a new political fact that along with other things demonstrates that we are in a new stage,\u201d Renzi said. \u201cWho would say that Trump would win? It is that way and we respect it, we will cooperate with the new American president and have a relationship between the EU and Italy.\u201d Pope Francis did not mention the US elections during his Wednesday audience, but secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, offered Trump congratulations in a statement to Vatican Radio that \u201chis government can be truly fruitful\u201d. He added the Vatican offered its prayers \u201cthat the Lord illuminates and sustains him in service of his country, naturally, but also in service of the well-being and peace of the world\u201d. Parolin concluded by noting that \u201cthere is need for everyone to work to change the global situation, which is in a situation of severe lacerations and great conflict.\u201d Slovenia Boris Pahor, the president of the Alpine nation that is the home country of Melania Trump, said: \u201cWe are allied as part of Nato and I will strive for the friendship and the alliance to deepen further.\u201d Spain The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, congratulated the new president on his victory and vowed to work with him to strengthen Spain\u2019s relationship with an \u201cindispensable ally\u201d. Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said it was confident that the new era of bilateral relations would serve to \u201creinforce and consolidate\u201d Spain\u2019s partnership with the US and \u201cdeepen the friendship between our countries and peoples\u201d. But Pablo Iglesias, leader of the anti-austerity Podemos party was less welcoming. Above a picture of the famous black power salute at the 1968 Olympics and an emoji of a clenched fist, he tweeted: \u201cThe vaccine against Trump\u2019s fascism is social justice and human rights, not more establishment. There are people in the US who will resist.\u201d Sweden Sweden\u2019s former prime minister Carl Bildt said 2016 was the year of \u201cdouble disaster\u201d for the west. He tweeted: \u201cAt least Richard Nixon had a solid understanding of world affairs. Manoeuvred skilfully. But morally corrupt. And collapsed in disgrace.\u201d Russia Vladimir Putin sent Trump a telegram to congratulate him. Speaking at a ceremony in the Kremlin, the Russian president said:   We heard the campaign slogans when he was still a candidate which were aimed at restoring relations between Russia and the United States. We understand that it will not be an easy path given the current state of degradation in the relations. And as I have repeatedly said, it\u2019s not our fault that Russian-American relations are in such a poor state. But Russia wants and is ready to restore full-fledged relations with the United States. I repeat we understand that this will be difficult, but we are ready to play our part, and do everything to return Russian-American relations to stable and sustainable development track. This would serve the interests of both the Russian and American peoples, and would have a positive effect on the general climate of global affairs given the special responsibility of Russia and the US to sustain global security.\u201d  Garry Kasparov, former world champion turned vocal opponent of Putin, tweeted simply: \u201cWinter is here.\u201d At a morning reception his residence in Moscow held as Trump edged ever closer to the White House, US ambassador to Russia John Tefft reminded visitors that diplomats are unable to give personal opinions on elections. He added: \u201cWhether you\u2019re happy or not, one of the key things here is to understand that our institutions in America will continue.\u201d Privately, however, many US diplomats in the country will be wondering whether a President Trump means a total reversal on Russia policy. Tefft\u2019s predecessor in the role, Michael McFaul, wrote on Twitter: \u201cPutin intervened in our elections and succeeded.\u201d Ukraine Officials expressed fear prior to the vote that a Trump presidency could see Ukraine thrown under the bus in favour of improved ties with Russia.  In a statement, President Petro Poroshenko offered \u201csincere congratulations to Donald Trump on being elected president of the United States and to the friendly American nation on democratic expression of will\u201d.  Poroshenko said he had met the US ambassador on Wednesday and been assured that \u201cthe new US administration would remain a reliable partner in the struggle for democracy\u201d. Czech Republic President Milo\u0161 Zeman declared he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with Trump\u2019s election victory, saying he cut through political correctness and addressed key issues like migration.  Zeman, who endorsed Trump in September, said: \u201cI would like to cordially congratulate Donald Trump. I had, as one of few European politicians, declared public support for this candidate \u2026 because I agree with his opinions on migration as well as the fight against Islamic terrorism. \u201cI appreciate Donald Trump\u2019s public demeanour, he speaks clearly, sometimes roughly, but understandably, and avoids what is sometimes called political correctness.\u201d Middle East Egypt President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi said Cairo wanted to see more \u201ccooperation and coordination\u201d between the two nations to bolster stability and peace in the Middle East. He telephoned Trump to offer his congratulations and invited him to visit Egypt. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump and called him a \u201ctrue friend of the State of Israel\u201d. Netanyahu said that he believes the two leaders \u201cwill continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights\u201d. The news was met with jubilation by politicians on the Israeli right, including the country\u2019s education minister Naftali Bennett, who declared that Trump\u2019s victory meant \u201cthe era of a Palestinian state is over\u201d.  \u201cTrump\u2019s victory is an opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the centre of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause. This is the position of the president-elect, as written in his platform, and it should be our policy, plain and simple.\u201d Trump is popular among the Israeli rightwing not least for having said that one of his first acts would be to reverse years of American government policy and move the US embassy to Jerusalem.  Commenting explicitly on that promise, Jerusalem\u2019s mayor Nir Barkat congratulated Trump as a \u201cdevoted supporter of Jerusalem\u201d, adding that he expected the Trump to move the US embassy to the capital. \u201cI am full of hope for your support for our activities for building in and developing Jerusalem for all her residents, and I invite you to visit the capital of Israel.\u201d Palestine The news of Trump\u2019s election was greeted cautiously by Palestinian figures. A spokesman for the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbassaid: \u201cWe will deal with any president elected by the American people on the principle of achieving permanent peace in the Middle East based on the two state solution on June 4 1967 lines with east Jerusalem as its capital.\u201d Saudi Arabia King Salman expressed hope that Trump would bring stability to the Middle East. \u201cWe wish your excellency success in your mission to achieve security and stability in the Middle East and worldwide,\u201d he said, praising US-Saudi relations, which are \u201chistoric and tight between the two friendly countries, that all parties aspire to develop and reinforce\u201d.  Turkey In a statement, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said:   The election marks the beginning of a new era in the United States. I hope that the American people\u2019s decision will facilitate audacious steps being taken regarding fundamental rights and liberties and democracy in the world and regional developments. Personally and on behalf of the nation, I wish to consider this decision by the American people a positive sign and wish them a successful future.\u201d   Iran President Hassan Rouhani reacted to Trump\u2019s win by saying that it would not change the trajectory of his country\u2019s foreign policy:   The US election results will have no impact on the policies of the Islamic Republic. Because of wrong policies, the position of America in the international community and world\u2019s public opinion has diminished and [the US\u2019s] growing rift with Europe and the world will exacerbate that position.\u201d   The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the US had to continue respecting last year\u2019s landmark nuclear agreement. \u201cAmerica has to implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal.\u201d  Iraq Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated Trump and said he was looking forward to continued support in his country\u2019s fight against Islamic State. In a statement on his website, Abadi said he hopes the \u201cworld and the United States will continue to support Iraq in fighting terrorism\u201d.  Americas Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he was ready to work with Trump to help bilateral relations, and that the two countries would continue to tighten bonds of cooperation and mutual respect.  Pe\u00f1a Nieto was heavily criticised for receiving Trump in Mexico during the campaign, after the Republican candidate called Mexican immigrants rapists and vowed to build a wall between the two countries.            Mexico president congratulates Trump during \u2018friendly conversation\u2019    \u201cMexico and the United States are friends, partners and allies and we should keep collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North America,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto said on his Twitter account.  Mexico\u2019s former presidential candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador called for calm. In a video on Facebook he said Mexico was \u201ca free, independent, sovereign country\u201d. \u201cIt is not a colony, it is not a protectorate, it does not depend on any foreign government.\u201d Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Trump and stressed the close friendship and ties between the two nations. The US accounted for 60% of Canada\u2019s global trade in 2014, a relationship underpinned by Nafta.  Trump, who has described the agreement as \u201cthe worst trade deal in history\u201d, has vowed to renegotiate the terms and would move to withdraw the US from the deal if Canada and Mexico refuse. According to the Canadian government, nearly 400,000 people a day cross the shared border between Canada and the US.  Trudeau\u2019s statement said:   On behalf of the Government of Canada, I would like to congratulate Donald J Trump on his election as the next President of the United States. Canada has no closer friend, partner, and ally than the United States. We look forward to working very closely with President-elect Trump, his administration, and with the United States Congress in the years ahead, including on issues such as trade, investment, and international peace and security. The relationship between our two countries serves as a model for the world. Our shared values, deep cultural ties, and strong integrated economies will continue to provide the basis for advancing our strong and prosperous partnership.\u201d  Asia Cambodia The country\u2019s long-serving, authoritarian prime minister Hun Sen congratulated Trump. On his official Facebook page, Hun Sen pointed out that he had announced his support for the Republican candidate several days earlier. \u201cAmerican voters have shown their choice to elect your excellency,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy support for your candidacy is not wrong either.\u201d China Chinese state media said President Xi Jinping had called Trump to congratulate him on his victory.  \u201cI place great importance on the China-US relationship, and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,\u201d Xi was reported to have told Trump. Xi also told Trump he hoped the two sides could avoid \u201cconflict and confrontation [and] instead achieve cooperation and a win-win [relationship]\u201d.

Lu said any future disputes over trade could be settled \u201cin a responsible manner\u201d and hinted at Chinese concerns over the possibility that Trump might introduce protectionist measures. \u201cI would like to say that China and US trade cooperation has benefited the US people rather than hurting their interests,\u201d he said. The state-run Xinhua news agency said the campaign highlighted that \u201cthe majority of Americans are rebelling against the US\u2019s political class and financial elites\u201d. The official Communist party newspaper People\u2019s Daily said the presidential election reveals an \u201cill democracy\u201d. Indonesia President Joko Widodo said the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation would work with the Trump administration. \u201cWe will keep good relations, especially in trade and investment as we know the US is one of Indonesia\u2019s major investors,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be no change.\u201d Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent his \u201cheartfelt congratulations\u201d to Trump.

Katsuyuki Kawai, an aide to Abe, said he was planning to fly to Washington to meet Trump officials as early as next week. Officials in Tokyo denied that Abe had decided to send Kawai to the US because Japan had failed to prepare for a Trump victory. \u201cWe have been preparing to respond to any situation, because our stance is that our alliance with the US remains the cornerstone of our diplomacy, whoever becomes the next president,\u201d Suga said. Malaysia Prime minister Najib Razak \u2013 embroiled in a corruption scandal at home that is being investigated in the United States \u2013 sent a congratulatory message to Trump:  \u201cMr Trump\u2019s success shows that politicians should never take voters for granted. Opinion polls, and established political figures, all underestimated the strength of his support. His appeal to Americans who have been left behind \u2013 those who want to see their government more focused on their interests and welfare, and less embroiled in foreign interventions that proved to be against US interests \u2013 have won Mr Trump the White House.  He added the US and Malaysia \u201care firm allies in the worldwide fight against terrorism and extremism.\u201d Pakistan Pakistan\u2019s former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf congratulated Trump on \u201chis historic election\u201d.

Duterte, who has expressed outrage almost daily with the Obama administration and threatened repeatedly to end one of Washington\u2019s most important Asian alliances, hailed the success of US democratic system and the American way of life, according to his communications secretary Martin Andanar.

Meng Hongwei, vice minister for public security since 2004 and the first Chinese to hold the post, will serve as president for four years after he was elected at an Interpol meeting in Indonesia, the agency announced on Twitter. \u201cThis is extraordinarily worrying given China\u2019s longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad,\u201d Nicholas Bequelin, east Asia director at Amnesty International, said on Twitter. \u201cThe Chinese police have a terrible human rights record, including the endemic practice of coercing \u2018confessions\u2019 and the widespread use of torture,\u201d Bequelin said separately in an interview.  \u201cUnlike most law enforcement agencies around the world, the Chinese police have \u2013 in addition to the classic law and order mandate \u2013 a political mandate to protect the power of the Communist party.\u201d Meng was previously deputy director of China\u2019s armed police, a paramilitary force that is often deployed to the country\u2019s most unstable areas, including Tibet, the border with North Korea and the far western province of Xinjiang. Li Wei, head of the anti-terrorism centre at China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, said: \u201cAs the head of Interpol, Meng Hongwei will deepen the fight against transnational crime.\u201d Since taking power in 2012, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping has launched a sweeping crackdown on corruption, punishing more than a million officials. But critics say the anti-graft drive is merely a way for Xi to take down his political enemies. China has worked through Interpol to bring back officials it says fled overseas and last year issued 100 \u201cred notices\u201d, a type of international arrest warrant.  It says about a third have been returned to China, but many western countries are wary of complying with extradition requests given China\u2019s harsh treatment of prisoners, use of the death penalty for economic crimes and a lack of concrete evidence. Most officials on the list had fled to the US or Canada, and China does not have extradition treaties with either country. But in a surprise move in September, Canada announced it would start negotiating a treaty. Li said: \u201cWe see people who China has issued red notices for are still very active in Europe.\u201d With Meng at the head of Interpol \u201cthere will be closer cooperation between countries in fighting crime,\u201d he added.

They are running from Boko Haram, the jihadist militants who still control significant parts of the Lake Chad basin.  But ask about how Boko Haram gained momentum in the first place, and a more complex narrative emerges. The extremists capitalised on high levels of local poverty, alienation and unemployment in north-east Nigeria. And that in turn, many local residents argue, was fuelled \u2013 in part \u2013 by the shrinking of Lake Chad, and the desertification of the surrounding area. With global temperatures soaring ever higher, it\u2019s a trend unlikely to be reversed any time soon. \u201cIt\u2019s affected our livelihood, it\u2019s affected farming and fishing,\u201d says Mustapha Ali, a 50-year-old who grew up close to the lake\u2019s former shores, and who is now living in a camp for internally displaced people. \u201cWe used to farm watermelon here, wheat, and rice \u2013 but because of the shrinkage of the lake, we can\u2019t any more. Little by little it became harder and harder to [irrigate the] farm.\u201d     Women arrive in a camp in the village of Kidjendi after fleeing from Boko Haram attacks. Photograph: Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images    Since the 1970s, global warming has caused the lake to shrink by around 90%. Once one of the world\u2019s biggest lakes, at 25,000 sq km, it is now less than 2,500 sq km. Towns that Ali remembers reaching by boat can now be reached by car. At least one settlement has even been built on land that used to be underwater, Ali says. For residents like Ali, the desperation caused by the shrinking of the lake was clearly a contributing factor to the rise of extremism. \u201cIt\u2019s helped the rise of Boko Haram,\u201d Ali adds. \u201cA lot of the youth there were unemployed, and when they have nothing to do, Boko Haram becomes an option. If you\u2019re wealthy and you have things to do, you don\u2019t want things like [Boko Haram] to happen.\u201d Patrick Kingsley at Lake Chad US The Iditarod Trail Sled dog race is a fabled 1,000-mile-long trek through Alaska\u2019s frozen wilderness, held annually since 1967. Unusually warm weather prompted a change in the starting location for last year\u2019s race, while 7,000 gallons of snow was shipped in ahead of this year\u2019s event in case of a lack of powder. The race, held in March, followed Alaska\u2019s second warmest winter on record \u2013 the latest in a string of warm winters. Chas St George, chief operations officer at the Iditarod trail committee, said: \u201cYou have ups and downs in terms of snow but this year and the year before were very mild in terms of weather and snowfall. Our creeks are flowing earlier and we are also getting more sun, which provides its own challenge for the people racing. \u201cLast year we staged the race out of Fairbanks because of a lack of snow, which is quite a distance further north. It\u2019s cooler there, there\u2019s more snow. We\u2019ve only been forced to do that kind of thing in the last few years. There are times when these teams run on no snow at all. The question is whether you have enough snow at the start, until you get to the interior.     The ceremonial start of the course in Anchorage, Alaska, had to be shortened due to lack of snow. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    \u201cThis year for the ceremonial start, where people come out to watch the teams through Anchorage, we had to shorten the course from 11 miles to three miles. That was for safety reasons because there was only enough snow to get to a certain point. We haven\u2019t had to shorten the course like that before. \u201cWhen it thaws and then freezes, all what\u2019s left is ground that is still frozen, it\u2019s very slick ice. It becomes a safety issue. People want to go as far as they can, that\u2019s what they do this for, but they were very understanding. I\u2019m sure the dogs were disappointed. \u201cWe did have a contingency to get more snow in by rail this past year. It wasn\u2019t needed though, we had enough snow, thank goodness. In parts of the course there was very little snow and then suddenly a huge amount of it hit. \u201cIn Alaska there\u2019s a ton of research that shows we are sort of at ground zero here [for climate change]. There\u2019s been a clear warming trend. I don\u2019t see significant changes to the race in the next couple of years but over the next 20 to 30 years we might have to look at it through a different lens. We may have to do things differently. But we want to keep this tradition going.\u201d Oliver Milman in New York Russia     Rodion Sulyandziga of the Center for Support of Indigenous Peoples of the North. Photograph: Courtesy of Rodion Sulyandziga    Rodion Sulyandziga, who runs the Moscow-based Center for Support of Indigenous Peoples of the North, says climate change is now one of the key challenges facing Siberia\u2019s numerous indigenous communities. Many ordinary Russians laugh at the idea of global warming as a threat, pointing out that much of the country would benefit from warmer temperatures. But melting permafrost could create real problems for communities in the far north of the country. \u201cClimate change is already here and is already affecting the lives of most of the indigenous community populations in the far north and Siberia, in various different ways,\u201d said Sulyandziga. The dangers were brought into sharp focus earlier this year when an anthrax outbreak hit the Yamal peninsula which killed a child, left 23 people dead and also killed more than 2,000 reindeer. The Arctic region is mainly populated by nomadic reindeer herders. There have been discussions about reducing the reindeer population to insure against future outbreaks, with radical suggestions including culling 200,000 animals.     The Arctic region is mainly populated by nomadic reindeer herders. Photograph: Denis Sinyakov / Reuters/Reuters    The working hypothesis for the deaths is that the infection was started when the corpses of reindeer that died many years ago were uncovered due to melting permafrost. This summer was abnormally warm in Yamal. \u201cAt a governmental level, it\u2019s really important that Russia ratifies the Paris agreement and gets to work on developing a national strategy,\u201d said Sulyandziga. \u201cBut we are also trying to work on strategies in each region, and make sure local indigenous communities are involved, to help protect these traditional ways of life.\u201d  Sulyandziga\u2019s centre works to ensure representatives of the communities themselves also have a say in discussions with authorities on how to mitigate the consequences of climate change. Fighting for indigenous rights is not always easy in Russia: Sulyandziga has been, on various occasions, fined, banned from leaving the country, and forced to declare his organisation a \u201cforeign agent\u201d. Shaun Walker in Moscow India In the town of Phalodi, surrounded by the Rajasthani deserts of western India, the mercury hit 51C in May, the highest recorded temperature in Asia since 1956.

Firoz Khan: \u2018It was difficult even to leave the house.\u2019 Photograph: Vidhi Doshi    Firoz Khan, a nurse in the local hospital recalls that life in the village came to a standstill. \u201cIt was difficult even to leave the house,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone was fretting.\u201d The 100,000 residents of Phalodi are used to extreme heat in the summers, but this year was exceptionally bad, and the normal working routine was disrupted. \u201cIt was very, very hot. You\u2019d start sweating if you stepped out of your house,\u201d Khan recalled.  \u201cIn fact, most people only worked in the mornings, from dawn until 10-11am, and then they\u2019d have to stay in all day because of the heat. Then around 5-6pm, people would leave home again and do a few more hours of work. Farmers lost around half their crop because of the heat this year. But at the time, they didn\u2019t care. They just wanted to sit indoors, under the fan or air conditioner.\u201d At the hospital where he works, Khan saw dozens of people coming in with heatstroke. \u201cThey just couldn\u2019t take it. People were vomiting, they were suffering from diarrhoea or dysentery, and they were finding it difficult to urinate. A handful of people from the town died because of the heat. They were older people, including a couple of women.

Vidhi Doshi in Mumbai Finland French winemakers joke about harvesting grapes on skis. But Fredrik Slotte, 36, who has 850 vines on his farm in Finland, has the last laugh. Last autumn at a festival in the US his sparkling wines won a gold medal, beating competition from 2,000 wines from 12 countries, including French champagne.  \u201cIt is great to see that Finland can compete in blind tastings with France,\u201d Slotte said.  This summer has been a particularly good one for grapes on the Baltic island of \u00c5land, where Slotte has his vineyard. The spring came early, and there was no frost. May was very warm, so the flowering started quickly in June. \u201cWe got a long period from the flowering to the harvest, and it was very dry,\u201d Slotte said. \u201cDuring the maturing process I want the grapes to be as concentrated as possible, and every drop of rain dilutes my wine and risks mould.\u201d Slotte has been growing grapes in Finland since 1998, when everyone thought he was \u201ccrazy\u201d. But with an embryonic commercial wine industry in neighbouring Sweden and Denmark, no one thinks that any more.     Longer drier summers are boosting the Nordic wine industry. Photograph: Olivier Morin/AFP/Getty Images    Swedish winegrowers say that, thanks to climate change, they now have an extra month in the growing season each summer compared to 40 years ago, when the Septembers were not as warm as they are today. Some growers can even harvest their grapes at the end of August.  Ironically, while his grapes did well this year, Slotte was hit because he also grows wheat, which suffered from the heat and dryness. But he is expecting a good vintage from 2016.  \u201cThere are a lot of factors in making good wine, not just climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you want a deep style with a lot of body, you want a good year like this.\u201d David Crouch in Gothenburg Thailand Thailand suffered its worst drought in two decades this year, focused in the country\u2019s arid north-east where reservoirs are at record low levels.

At the annual Songkran festival in April, which transforms the streets of Bangkok into a giant water fight during the peak of the dry season, city officials tried to convince revellers to save water. They shortened the festival from four to three days. \u201cThis is partly symbolic, but we hope to save water too because our lakes have become deserts,\u201d deputy Bangkok governor, Amorn Kijchawengjul, said at the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t want city folk splashing water around carelessly while farmers struggle.\u201d Oliver Holmes in Bangkok Australia Vivien Thomson, 51, is a wool, lamb, cattle and hay farmer in central New South Wales in Australia, and an experienced firefighter. She lives there with her husband Robert Flint, 55, and her youngest son Shaun Flint, who is just finishing school this year. The hottest year on record hit them hard, Thompson says. But it\u2019s just another step in a scorching trend that she\u2019s been dealing with for years. \u201cYou expect to get one, two, maybe three days above 40C,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this year the heat was relentless. There never seemed to be a break. And then it all stopped \u2013 bang \u2013 and you go from one extreme to another.\u201d Thompson said it makes life on the farm hard for everyone \u2013 and everything. \u201cIt affects your capacity to do so much. And for me, more importantly, it affects the welfare of the animals on my farm,\u201d she said. Like people, they don\u2019t like to move around during the hottest times. And as the hot periods extend, she said the periods of the day when she can move the animals for a feed becomes shorter and shorter, making their management harder and harder. But even more worryingly, dealing with water through such hot and variable weather becomes a nightmare. Thompson said a cow might normally drink 20 litres of water a day. But on an extremely hot day it can be as much as 100 litres. \u201cSo you have 100 cows, each drinking between 40 and 80 litres extra each day \u2013 those dams are going to to drop pretty quickly,\u201d she said. To cope with that, she had to move all the cattle to the paddocks where the dams still had some water.     Sheep in a dry paddock at a drought-affected property near Lightning Ridge, NSW. Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP    At one point, of her 35 paddocks, only two of them had dams with any water left in them. But then the weather went from one extreme to another. She was moving her stock to paddocks that had access to bore water when suddenly a storm rolled in. \u201cIt only lasted for 15 minutes, my vehicle was aquaplaning across the paddocks, and by the time it was finished, every dam was full. I\u2019d ridden the whole farm that morning and literally two of the 35 paddocks had water.\u201d Moving the stock from one paddock to another to follow remaining water is what she describes as \u201creactive\u201d managing of the extreme heat. But she\u2019s also planning on longer timescales. Because the seasons aren\u2019t predictable anymore, they are planting their hay crops in three batches, hedging their bets. \u201cSo at least one will probably be productive,\u201d she said. Hovering over all of the animal and crop management issues is a big worry for Thompson: fire. She used to be a professional firefighter and still has a foot in the industry. She said she\u2019s always had a plan to fight fire when it approached her property, but the fire-weather has become so bad recently, that she no longer thinks she can always do that. \u201cMy husband is also a very experienced firefighter and we always believe we stand a reasonable chance. But there was one day a couple of years ago where the conditions were such that, we looked at each other and said for the first time in our lives: if there\u2019s a fire, we walk. We\u2019re not going to even try to fight it.\u201d \u201cWe had never felt like that before,\u201d she said. Michael Slezak Malawi Peter Phiri, a businessman in Lilongwe, Malawi, said: \u201cIt is always hot here but this year El Ni\u00f1o has made it worse. Last year we had floods and we lost crops. This year we had no rain. Two years\u2019 harvests have been hit hard and it has been disastrous for many people. Because 90% of Malawians are farmers, nearly half the country will need help with food.  \u201cThe lack of rain means we have water shortages and the rivers and lakes are low and the hydroelectric power does not work. There are long power cuts. People in rural areas do not have electricity, but in the cities this means homes and offices do not have air conditioning and people have no way to keep cool.     Members of the Majawa family walk to their church in the village of Mulele, which lies in one of the areas most affected by drought in Zomba, Malawi. Photograph: Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images    \u201cOld people say it is hotter now than years ago but it is hard for me to tell. The rains are about to come and the temperature reaches 38, 40C or more. Then it cools. \u201cOne reason for the heat could be that people have cut down trees to make charcoal to earn money to eat, or to cure tobacco. Another could be climate change. The cities may be getting hotter because they are growing in size and people live in concrete houses. \u201cOver the last 10 years people have noticed that the seasons are changing. In the past the rains would come in October. Now it is November. The \u2018lean\u2019 season when people have less food to eat used to last three months. Now it starts early and lasts longer.\u201d John Vidal Brazil For five years, the farmers of Po\u00e7o Redondo have suffered from a drought that has devastated the crops of corn and beans on which they depend.

Related: Thailand players offered $400,000 to beat Socceroos in World Cup qualifier    That resulted in the Thailand Premier League cutting its season short by three games and there was talk of this match being moved or played behind closed doors. The green light has been given, though fans have been asked to dress in sombre colours and to behave respectfully. After nine young Australians spent four days in a Kuala Lumpur jail for drinking beer in Malaysian-flag undies at the country\u2019s Formula One grand prix last month, it is a chance for visiting fans to recoup some standing in south-east Asia. What is best for Thailand is that those Socceroos supporters have nothing to shout about at all. This is a crucial game for both. Australia have dropped four points in their last two games \u2013 in Saudi Arabia and at home to Japan \u2013 and are keen to return to winning ways. Thailand just want to find a way to win. The War Elephants topped their group in the previous round to become the first south-east Asian nation to get to the final stage of qualification since 2002 (a time when South Korea and Japan were absent). To finish above 2007 Asian champions Iraq was a fine achievement but not all that surprising to those that have been watching the country\u2019s development. In the past three or four years, Thailand have emerged as the clear No1 in South-east Asia, playing an easy-on-the-eye passing game along the way. This has happened in the past but this time there is real hope that the Thais could finally break clear of the passionate, but at times claustrophobic, Asean football scene, and look to the continental stage first and the one closer to home second. As the final phase began, nobody in Thailand expected or demanded a place in the top two in Group B and automatic qualification for the competition in Russia, or even third and a play-off route. What was hoped for were signs that the team could be competitive against the best in Asia. It started well enough. Kiatisuk Senamuang\u2019s men were, just, the better team against Saudi Arabia in Riyadh on 1 September. The 1-0 loss came due to a late and fairly soft penalty given to Bert Van Marwijk\u2019s men. It was followed by a 2-0 defeat at home to a Japan side that was treated with too much respect. Therein may lie the Thais\u2019 issue. The talent is there but perhaps it will take a little time for confidence to catch up. Japan have not looked impressive in qualification so far and had the hosts been more aggressive, it could have been a different story. Then came a 3-1 loss in the United Arab Emirates before their first truly disappointing performance. Playing Iraq (in Iran) should have offered a fine chance of victory given the events of the previous round but defensively Thailand were at sixes and sevens and could have lost by that much too. In the end it was 4-0. The danger is that further defeats will, naturally, damage confidence and the team\u2019s future ambition may suffer. Losing a few is fine for a team looking for stronger tests, but to lose every game is understandably dispiriting. Long term though, the signs appear healthy. The widely-disliked Thai FA president, Worawi Makudi, is finally out after a corruption scandal too many and the local league is progressing well.  With 2015 champions Buriram United struggling this year, the likes of Bangkok United came to the fore but it was Muangthong United who won the league. Well-funded and well-supported, like a growing number of Thai clubs, the Kirins contain a number of internationals who will line-up against the Socceroos. Chanathip Songkrasin is one. The attacking midfielder, known as \u201cMessi Jay\u201d, is the biggest star in south-east Asian football and there is cool midfielder Sarach Yooyen, charismatic striker Teerasil Dangsa, highly-rated full-back Theerathon Bunmathan and Kawin Thamsatchanan, an athletic goalkeeper once linked to Manchester United. The talent, most of it still young, is there for Thailand, as are the ambitions. It remains to be seen if the team has the self-belief to stop the Asian champions, stop a fifth straight defeat and stop the Socceroos supporters from having anything to cheer at all.

Charity leaders will need to use every asset available to help their organisations and that task will be impossible without social media. In acknowledgement of the importance of social media, the Top 30 Charity CEOs on Social Media Awards [pdf] run by Social CEOs recognise the charity leaders who are excelling in social media. This year has seen a record number of nominations from charities across the full spectrum of sizes and causes. The winners, decided by an independent panel of judges, were announced on 17 November hosted by Justgiving. To coincide with this, Social CEOs has also published a briefing to help charity leaders develop their social media skills. Here are some of the key pointers every charity leader aspiring to develop a better social media presence should think about \u2013 and how some of the award-winning CEOs already put them into practice.  Have a distinctive voice The importance of this was demonstrated by the overall winner of the awards, Ruth Ibegbuna, chief executive of the Reclaim Project, a Manchester-based youth leadership charity. Ibeguna\u2019s passion for her charity\u2019s cause, and her bold and authentic tone of voice, was inspiring, said the judges, and her Twitter feed feels like a natural medium for the way she communicates as a leader.

The best charity leaders can discuss a range of topics on social media, from their cause, to policy, and to their interests outside of work. A key part of this skill set is breaking down complex subjects that are relevant to their charity, and making them accessible and memorable by highlighting details \u2013 such as this shocking statistic, tweeted below.

Long-form content can be particularly engaging as it allows leaders to discuss ideas in depth. The judges said Tom\u2019s blog is discursive, thought-provoking, and offers a new perspective on topical issues. Use social media to better manage stakeholders Our winners use social media to develop relationships and unite people around a common aim.

Set as the first instalment in a series of five films, fans of \u2018the boy who lived\u2019 have enjoyed the breath of fresh life that has been injected into the Potter franchise.  We asked you to tell us what you think of the film. Here\u2019s what some of you said.      \u2018I wish I could be obliviated just to feel the thrill of watching it again\u2019 Rating: 5 out of 5 The film was one of the most moving films that I have watched. The saddest scene is when Jacob Kowalski walks out into the obliviating rain, and all memory of the magical world is erased. Well ... not all of it. In the end, Kowalski starts a bakery (with some help from Newt Scamander), and his pastries are in the shape of all of the magical creatures he met.  The funniest scene was, above all, the scene in which the niffler gets loose in a muggle bank, causing Scamander and Kowalski to get into trouble with the No-Maj security. The niffler seems to be unable to restrain itself, whenever something shiny flashes nearby.  Overall, I would give the film a seven out of five (if you are a Harry Potter fan you will understand why seven), for everything. I loved how well the special effects are used, and the super filming. It was one of the best films that I have ever seen, and I wish that I could be obliviated, just to feel the thrill of re-watching the film. Josephine Aubrey Aiken, Connecticut      \u2018It was let down by its lack of story\u2019 Rating: 4.5 out of 5 Fantastic effects - it really triggered the children to ask how that was achieved. Also the creatures were amazing and loveable. We loved the bowtruckle. The film was let down though by its lack of story. We really didn\u2019t know why he was in New York. It seems just an excuse to show special effects - I can\u2019t believe it will be one of five films. It certainly didn\u2019t have the pure magic of Harry Potter - but then I doubt any film ever will.  Boyle family, Wirral  \u2018A welcome treat to take a train back to the world of innocence\u2019 Rating: 4.5 out of 5 Having grown-up, reading and re-reading JK Rowling it was a pleasant surprise to see another Harry Potter universe film on the cards. The Cursed Child felt like fan fiction. As I moved on to darker and more abstract shades of fiction, this was a welcome treat - to take a train back to the world of innocence. The visuals are wonderful, and the acting a joy to watch. Age brings wisdom, and a sense of appreciation, I see.  Vishnu, India       \u2018It teaches you to appreciate difference which is a message we badly need at the moment\u2019 Rating: 4 out of 5 I went to see this film with my 16-year-old son. As a disclaimer, I am not a JK Rowling or a Harry Potter fan so I did not have any background knowledge, yet I really enjoyed this movie because I think it can be interpreted in many different ways. I think, ultimately It is a story that teaches you to appreciate difference, which is a message that we badly need at the moment.  But there are more intimate angles to be found. The film can be enjoyed as a straightforward story and as a metaphor: my son and I both found the way teenage angst is portrayed in the film as very perceptive. Obscurials are angry kids! For us the family therapy angle struck a chord but there will be other approaches that evoke equally strong emotions. When a work speaks to people on different levels it is a really special endeavour and Fantastic Beasts does this so admirably.  Mother and son, Kent      \u2018Passionate and profound while very entertaining\u2019 Rating: 4.5 out of 5 I\u2019ve just seen the film with four friends aged from 16-70. JK Rowling is a genius for our time. Taking in hand all the techno and appealing potential of the film industry she creates a movie speaking to deep contemporary concerns with wonderful imagination and humour.  I recognised the fear of ruthless forces - not mythical but active and visible now, the protection of our planet (and its creatures) in the face of ignorance or power-lust, even sex abuse and how the fury pent up in the victim could be unleashed (the relationship between Credence (well-named) and the Colin Farrell character was not simple). All the relationships were plausible.  She isn\u2019t afraid of sweeteners (e.g. love-interest/ happy endings) which may be too much for some. The only player out of place was the leader of the wizards in New York who looked like a throwback to 1970s sci-fi: the actress didn\u2019t get the nature of the drama. And for me the blue furry monkey-thing was rather too Disney for me. Otherwise brilliantly cast and set. Passionate and profound while very entertaining. Fantastic. Tilly Young, Devon       \u2018It had no magical essence\u2019 Rating: 2.5 out of 5 Having just seen the film I have to say I am disappointed. It\u2019s by no means a bad film (I will most likely see the sequel) however, unlike the Potter films it had no magical essence, it was fairly bland. If you ask me, they should have focused on the Gellert Grindelwald and Obscurials story as that was far more interesting than what seemed more like a film about magical zoo animals. Oh and one more thing, I really do think JK should stick to books and not screenplays as this was WAY too episodic for my liking. I have my fingers crossed that the sequel will be more focused on Grindelwald and less about the beasts as they really do drag it down.  Tom Dix, Cardiff  \u2018Fogler totally stole the movie\u2019 Rating: 5 out of 5 I was never a Harry Potter fan, probably because I was in my 40s when they started, although my son is one. This movie, however, was not really a Potter movie, despite being set in the same universe. It featured a mostly adult cast and more adult themes. I thought it was excellent. The cast were very good, with Fogler totally stealing the movie. The soundtrack was superb. I\u2019m looking forward to the sequel!  Quicknstraight, Bangkok       \u2018A beautiful magical tale with some great humour for adults\u2019 Rating: 5 out of 5 We managed to secure tickets to the regional premiere and pretty much had mixed expectations. Both massive fans of the page turning literature JK Rowling created with Harry Potter and the film series (although we differ on our choice of favourite movie of the series) we were expecting to be entertained. And we were and then some! From the opening introduction to the denouement it was a beautiful magical tale with some great humour for adults and the night time setting for the majority of the film made New York look wondrous. Colin Farrell was a mysterious and mixed character and when he finally got his wand out (pardon the pun) - during battle it was exciting to say the least as he felt like a different villain in the magical world. The mentions of Dumbledore and Hogwarts made me eager for more movies in the series and I\u2019m excited to see how it will go.  Dan Westgarth, Darlington       \u2018It was a great way to pass a few hours\u2019 Rating: 5 out of 5 After a two day power cut we surrendered and decided to go to the pictures - me, my wife, daughter home from uni, son and two friends on a sleepover (in the cold and dark).  We\u2019re big Harry Potter fans anyway but did not know what to expect. It was great to hear the familiar opening music but soon my impression was it was a remake but this soon disappeared. Wow, what a great film. It ticked all the boxes and was a great way to pass a few hours. Thoroughly recommended. Now back home and still no electricity. Adam Grew, The Dark Ages AKA Uttoxeter \u2018It was so exciting I forgot to eat and drink all the way through!\u2019 Rating: 5 out of 5 Many of the characters were endearing and completely believable. The film was so exciting that I forgot to eat and drink all the way through it! There was plenty of humour and touching scenes, too. All the acting was very good. I particularly enjoyed watching how Newt interacted with the creatures.

The WWF said an infrastructure boom in coming years will lead to the construction of 11,000km of new transport projects, carving up the big cat\u2019s habitats and stopping them from travelling across the huge ranges they need. Previous approaches such as stopping poaching and looking after protected areas would no longer be enough to help tigers, WWF said in a report. It said growing human populations and trade are driving a road-and rail-building splurge valued in the trillions.  Tiger numbers have bounced back modestly since an all-time low of 3,200 in 2010, to an estimated 3,890 now. That has been driven partly by a target to double tiger numbers by 2022, set by Vladimir Putin, the then-Chinese premier Wen Jiabao and other leaders of tiger range states. \u201cThe potential impact of the linear infrastructure may be way beyond a setback - this could dismantle the progress we\u2019ve made over 20-30 years,\u201d said Dr Ashley Brooks, a co-author of the report, The Road Ahead. \u201cThe scale is astronomical.\u201d Brooks cited a series of huge national development projects, such as national highway seven in India, which will cut through a critical corridor between two tiger reserves. There are also plans for a transport link between Bangkok and a port slated for Dawei in Myanmar. In Sumatra, a north-south highway will dissect the whole island, while Nepal is planning a national railway upgrade and work on its \u201cpostal highway\u201d, which Brooks said posed a significant threat to a natural corridor for tigers between India and Nepal.   Related: Saving the pangolin: giant rats trained to sniff out world's most trafficked mammal    WWF will not try to block such infrastructure, some of which will be four- and eight -lane highways. Instead, it will try to ensure they are built in ways that tigers can still get through them, such as using animal underpasses, elevating roads or tunnelling. \u201cWe accept these developments should go ahead but we will lobby with governments so that they avoid as much as possible critical habitats and areas that can\u2019t be lost,\u201d said Brooks.  Not only are the roads direct threats to the tigers and their prey, but they will have knock-on or \u201ccascading\u201d effects, WWF said. \u201cRoads provide access to areas that previously weren\u2019t there. Poachers are the first people behind the road builders,\u201d said Brooks. While acknowledging that it would be hard to persuade some governments to spend more on making transport infrastructure tiger-friendly, he warned that he consequences would be grim for tigers if they did not. Brooks added: \u201cIf these measures aren\u2019t taken, if governments don\u2019t see the need to maintain connectivity at this kind of scale, and let infrastructure slice and dice these landscapes, you will have little pockets of tigers. They will always need active management.

Odd/even came in after a three-in-one car-pooling rule was scrapped in April after years of abuse. \u201cJockeys\u201d would stand at the side of the road, offering themselves for rent so the driver could get the required two passengers; many were children, who took huge risks getting into the vehicles of strangers. With the population of Greater Jakarta expected to increase from about 30 million today to more than 40 million by 2040 , wasting hours trapped in traffic looks set to become even more of a daily frustration for residents. Is Jakarta destined to be jammed forever, or does the city have an alternative?     A motorcycle taxi for smartphone app Go-Jek picks up a customer.

There\u2019s no reason for cars to exist in this city at all.\u201d Since Makarim\u2019s company revolutionised the motorcycle taxi \u2013 or ojek \u2013 industry with the launch of a smartphone app last year, numbers have risen dramatically. Along with Malaysian rival Grab, and Uber\u2019s Motor service, they have driven down fares \u2013 to the anger of some drivers.  The app has been downloaded 25 million times. As well as getting around, customers can get a massage therapist or a cleaner delivered to their door within 90 minutes.

We bring everything to you. If you didn\u2019t want to you wouldn\u2019t have to leave your apartment.\u201d Some in the city, though, are concerned the rise of motorbike taxi apps could tempt people away from buses and trains. \u201cMotorcycle taxis kill public transport,\u201d says Yoga Adiwinarto, country director of ITDP-Indonesia, the local branch of the non-profit Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. Makarim doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cOur customers are smartphone users,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are middle class people switching from private cars. They wouldn\u2019t have travelled on buses anyway.\u201d     A commuter train in East Jakarta in 2012. A recent crackdown means excess passengers no longer ride on the roof, or hang out of the doors, but inside the carriages the rush hour crush is as bad as ever. Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images    The largest south-east Asian city without a metro  Regional rivals Manila (1984), Singapore (1987), Kuala Lumpur (1995) and Bangkok (2004), all got there first. But four decades after it was first mooted, construction has at last begun on Jakarta\u2019s $1.7bn (\u00a31.4bn) metro line, known as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT).  Difficulties acquiring land rights in the south of the city have delayed the overground section of the project but, when the first stage opens in 2019, it is set to halve the hour it takes to travel 12 miles from Lebak Bulus to Bunderan Hotel Indonesia in the centre by car.    Commuter Line trains make the journey from Bogor to the city centre in 55 minutes \u2013 twice as fast as the car    A northern extension to Kampung Bandan near the waterfront is set to open in 2020. A second line running east-west, where many journeys are made, is under consideration. A long-awaited link from the airport is set to start operating next year and the first phase of a light rail system is due to open in 2018, in time for the Asian Games. The new network should boost rail capacity from 800,000 to 1.2 million passengers a day.  Jakarta\u2019s ageing Commuter Line trains make the journey from Bogor to the city centre in 55 minutes \u2013 twice as fast as the car. Excess passengers no longer ride on the roof or hang out of the doors after a recent crackdown, but inside the carriages the rush hour crush is as bad as ever. The metro, light rail, airport link \u2013 and a planned bullet train from Bandung 100 miles to the east \u2013 will centre on a new hub at Dukuh Atas. The inevitable swanky shopping mall is being planned. But is there a faster way to transform public transport in the city? Yoga says Jakarta\u2019s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, which the ITDP helped promote and design, took just two years to set up and the bill to the city was a fraction of the cost of the metro.     Passengers on a bus in Jakarta. Photograph: Beawiharta/Reuters    Bus Rapid Transit: \u2018It\u2019s quicker than cars for sure\u2019 Twelve years ago Jakarta became the first south-east Asian city to open a BRT, inspired by visits from former Bogot\u00e1 mayor Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa.  The 120-mile Transjakarta network gives good coverage, within the city at least, and carries 350,000 people a day. Buses are air conditioned, with a separate section for women at the front, and 10 pink women-only buses have recently started operation.  \u201cWithin Jakarta itself the BRT is quite good,\u201d says Yoga. \u201cIt\u2019s quicker than cars for sure \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s quicker than motorcycle \u2013 but only within the city of Jakarta.\u201d Commuters trying to get to and from the outer cities of Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi find the dedicated lanes stop as soon as they leave the city limits. A rush-hour BRT from Bogor to the centre takes two or three hours, and in Jakarta itself police officers turn a blind eye to cars and motorbikes using bus lanes when gridlock strikes. Better links to the wider Great Jakarta area are vital to get more people on BRT, says Yoga. \u201cGetting links to the outer city is problematic, with businesses pushing back and the government lacking political will. The city government is much more progressive in terms of mobility \u2013 they\u2019re bringing in MRT, pushing public transport, charging for parking \u2013 but the national government never takes any action.\u201d     Jakarta\u2019s weekly car-free mornings are hugely popular. Photograph: Romeo Gacad/AFP/Getty Images    Cycling: \u2018Cars are usually stopped so they\u2019re ok\u2019 Every Sunday morning thousands of people take to the main drags of Sudirman and Thamrin to take advantage of Jakarta\u2019s car-free day.  Spotting cyclists on other days is harder. One is Gandrie Ramadhan, who rides 10 miles a day to work as a transport associate at the ITDP. He uses smaller side streets where he can but says major roads are unavoidable. He takes me on a cycle around the expensive embassy district of Menteng, where light traffic and shady tree-lined streets make for a pleasant ride, but as soon as we get on the main thoroughfare of Sudirman it quickly gets more serious. Worst are the unpredictable, battered green Kopaja and orange/blue MetroMini buses which belch black smoke from poorly maintained diesel engines.   Related: Waiting for Glodok: the ghost street haunted by Indonesia\u2019s riots    \u201cCars are usually stopped so they\u2019re ok but it is motorbikes which make it most dangerous,\u201d says Gandrie. \u201cCycling has low status, and because we are seen as slow, the motorbikes always want to overtake us and get to the front. The Kopaja and MetroMinis are the worst, though. They make it horrible.\u201d Jakarta\u2019s existing three cycle lanes are painted a foot or two wide \u2013 and ignored by motorists. Gandrie believes installing protected bike infrastructure is the only way to get more people cycling in the city. \u201cAnd more offices with showers,\u201d he adds. Can Jakarta escape its nightmare traffic? Instead of providing showers, most companies are more concerned with subsidising parking for their employees, says Yoga. Meanwhile, the government has approved plans for six new elevated toll highways crisscrossing the centre of the city, and its Low Cost Green Car initiative encourages car use by offering zero deposit and low interest on small-engined vehicles. \u201cJakarta\u2019s moving in the right direction but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Yoga says. \u201cThe government is allowing low-density development outside the city, and the wider metro area is spreading. That makes it difficult for public transport because there isn\u2019t the coverage. We need high density development where your first option is walking or cycling, and for longer journeys you can use the bus or metro.\u201d That may seem a long way from the current reality in Jakarta, but the government has a target to increase the share of trips on public transport from 23% to 60% by 2030 \u2013 and there is an incentive. As Yoga says: \u201cFour hours every day wasted in a car is really not that pleasant.\u201d What are your experiences of transport in Jakarta and what do you think would make it better?

Having made his fortune creating and selling tech startups, Mars, 41, founded Epic Foundation two years ago. It aims to encourage tech-savvy investors to donate to children\u2019s and young people\u2019s charities it has selected. \u201cWe change the act of giving \u2026 Either I can go out and build schools myself. Or I can invest my money \u2026 leverage my skills, my network,\u201d he explains. He is putting $2m into Epic, which uses technology to allow wealthy donors to fund and track a charity\u2019s impact. Donors swipe an app to follow beneficiaries\u2019 progress. Mars says he aims to \u201cchange mindsets\u201d, and describes himself as a \u201cdisruptive philanthropist\u201d. It is the reason he funds Epic, rather than directly funding projects himself. The foundation, which has staff in London, New York, Paris and Bangkok, has exceeded its 2016 target to raise $1m. As a result, each of the 20 charities it has selected will receive at least $50,000. Charities apply online from all over the world and a selection team headed by a former United Nations head of policy analyses their impact, leadership and finances. In the UK, it supports education charity \u2013 and one of last year\u2019s Guardian charity awards winners \u2013 The Brilliant Club.   Related: 40 charities account for nearly 20% of total income for voluntary sector    Next year, a further 10 charities have been selected for support (from 2,000 applications), including two more UK charities, sport-based not-for-profit Street League and east London employment project ThinkForward. Mars is also launching a series of virtual reality films enabling donors to \u201cexperience\u201d the charities, and a new online donation function encouraging gifts of $25 upwards from anyone. The UK was recently ranked eighth in an annual global league table for individual giving. Figures from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations suggest we donated \u00a319.4bn to the UK voluntary sector in 2013-14. This is 44% of the voluntary sectors\u2019 income. Mars believes a debate is needed \u201cto explore opportunities and strategies for increasing giving\u201d. At at time when trust in charities is at an all-time low following criticism of some traditional fundraising practices, new ways of engaging donors through technology is surely needed. Such challenges are expected to feature in next year\u2019s House of Lords select committee report on charities, with its focus on digital innovation and financial sustainability. Mars says he always planned to \u201cdo good\u201d with money: \u201cI wasn\u2019t clear that the end would be Epic or to change the act of giving \u2026 but I knew the day would come when I\u2019d switch, and just do good.\u201d . He decided to develop Epic after fellow wealthy entrepreneurs told him of the problems they have with charitable giving. They said: \u201cWe don\u2019t trust [how to give], we don\u2019t have the time, we don\u2019t have the knowledge [of what to fund] \u2026 let\u2019s say you want to do something for cancer, which one to pick if you have 25 different charities? The biggest? The newest?\u201d So he set up a philanthropy middleman. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an entrepreneur, it\u2019s about finding a place where people are, and a place where people want to be ... If the gap is wide, you can build a business,\u201d he explains. Born in Paris and based in New York, Mars says his combination of enterprise and philanthropy comes from the dual influence of his businessman father and \u201chumanitarian\u201d mother. He recalls a recent visit to Paris, where he found his mother volunteering to teach French to a Chinese immigrant. The specific interest in youth inequality stems from visiting a Delhi orphanage in his 20s where his girlfriend, now wife, was volunteering. He spends 90% of his time on Epic, with the remainder split between his tech investment company Blisce and chairing the sport and society committee of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic bid. He laughs off the French media\u2019s comparison with Gates, but is clearly proud \u2013 and he has sought advice from the Gates Foundation.    In the US, no one is ashamed of success. In the UK  it\u2019s \u2018don\u2019t be too loud about it\u2019    What about criticisms that tech entrepreneurs\u2019 charitable aspirations are over-ambitious, such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $3bn initiative to cure all disease? Mars blames perception of ambition: \u201cIt is something different in UK than in the US. In the US, being successful is something good, something that no one has to be shy or ashamed of. In the UK it\u2019s \u2018don\u2019t be too loud about it\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s ambitious, I agree, to believe that we can change systems, but the good thing is, [this ambition] it\u2019s needed,\u201d he says. Silicon Valley philanthropists are also reproached for being unsympathetic to social problems on their doorstep and failing to help community-based organisations. Surely Epic\u2019s philanthropic radar fails to pick up smaller, community-based groups that, for example, lack capacity for its rigorous selection process? He replies saying Epic cannot \u201cfix everything\u201d, but that charities might indirectly benefit from its pro-giving mantra: \u201cWe have two impacts, one is very tangible [donations] the other is the mindset \u2026 so if you give through us or do whatever you do [volunteering or donating elsewhere], I\u2019m happy.\u201d He believes philanthropy is increasingly crucial as public finances shrink (\u201cstates and cities \u2013 they\u2019re under huge debt\u201d). So, how does he define the role of philanthropists versus the state? \u201cWe need policymakers, we need strong leaders \u2026 [but] they don\u2019t have enough money, so where is it [the money]? It\u2019s with the corporate world most of the time, so how can we [business] just step up?\u201d Then, sensing his wealthy peers might need a snappier rallying cry, he adds: \u201cSwitch on the television, watch the news \u2013 it\u2019s our role to do something.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age 41 Lives Brooklyn, New York Family Married, three children Education Florent Schmitt high school, HEC Paris [European business school \u2013 Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Paris] and Paris Dauphine University Career 2014-present: chief executive and founder, Epic Foundation; 2013-present: chief executive and founder, Blisce; 2007-13: head of mobile, Publicis Group; 2006-13: chief executive and founder, Scoon; 2001-07, chief executive and founder, Phonevalley; 1998-2002: chief executive and founder, Mars Capital (venture fund); 1997-99: co-founder and chief executive, A2X web agency.

The biography was published on Friday by BBC Thai a day after King Maha Vajiralongkorn accepted the title following the death of his father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, on 13 October.   Thailand's l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws   General Prawit Wongsuwan, deputy prime minister and minister of defence, said that authorities were investigating whether the article breached the country\u2019s strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 (wounded majesty) laws. Around 10 police officers visited the BBC office on Tuesday but found it closed. They reportedly helped themselves to a delivery of Yakult milk drink left at the door before leaving. Members of the army arrived later to ask about the police visit. The BBC did not provide a comment for this article. Anyone who \u201cdefames, insults or threatens\u201d a member of the Thai royal family can face three to 15 years in jail on each charge. Under the law, the government is compelled to investigate any case raised by a member of the public. The BBC profile explained how the new king was educated in Thailand, the UK and Australia, and flies his own Boeing 737 when travelling abroad. It said questions were raised about his fitness to succeed to the throne when he was formally titled as heir in 1972, adding that he does not command the same level of respect his father built during seven decades on the throne. When attempting to access the article in Thailand, a message appears from the ministry for digital economy and society, announcing that the website contains \u201cinappropriate information\u201d. Following its publication in Thai, angry comments were posted on Facebook including physical threats and the location of the BBC\u2019s Bangkok office. On Saturday, anti-government activist Jatupat Boonpattaraksa was arrested for sharing the article on his Facebook page. He was released on bail on Sunday. The ruling junta, which took power in a military coup in 2014, positions itself as a defender of the monarchy and has sought to appease ultra-royalist factions by pursuing anyone deemed to have breached l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. Last year, military courts jailed two people under the law, one for 30 years and the other for 28, for posts on Facebook.

Usually packed, this restaurant serves what\u2019s described as authentic southern-style Thai food: that means spicy as hell and heavier on the coconut cream than the sour, pungent dishes from further north, which we touched upon last week. We\u2019re feeling intrepid as we order, which the waiter clearly notices, cocking his head as we choose the dishes.    From a family of chillies known as \u2018rat\u2019s turd\u2019, they are small and relatively innocent-looking    First to arrive is the namesake khua kling, a dry pork-mince curry that\u2019s fried hard in a hot wok with a type of small red chilli called prik kee noo suan. From a family of chillies that translates as \u201cmouse-shit chillies\u201d or, specifically in this case, \u201crat\u2019s turd\u201d, they have an, err, knobbled appearance \u2013 small and relatively innocent-looking. They could pass for the more typical Thai bird\u2019s-eye varieties, but the small plate of curry in front of us is fiercely hot. For us farangs (foreigners) dumped here via the flavour vacuum that is long-haul air travel, this is a potentially lethal dosage. As I eyeball the nuclear hum that the khua kling emits, Luke dives straight in and scoops up a mouthful: whole chillies, stalks and all. Well, we\u2019re in this together now, I think, following his lead. It\u2019s spicy \u2013 sharp and laser-like \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t stop us going back for more. That\u2019s the thing with smaller fresh chillies \u2013 they burn bright for a short time, then you want more. Combined with the sweetness of palm sugar and rich umami of fermented shrimp, the dish\u2019s heat is balanced. Nonetheless, when a bowl of coconut soup \u2013 bai leang tom kati \u2013 arrives, we are extremely thankful. It\u2019s a fragrant antidote to the heat but also, we notice, something that tastes all the better for being eaten with a hot dish. The \u201crat\u2019s turd\u201d awakened our mouths to every single herbal, salty detail in the neighbouring dishes. Chilli heat lifts other flavours around it.   Related: Rural Thai recipes for mushroom salad and pork curry soup | Cook residency    The chillies described here are prized for being hot, but that is just the start of the story. In the world of small, hot chillies, you have green (white-peppery) and red (fruity) bird\u2019s-eyes, which you will be familiar with, while the chillies typical to Laos are lemony and sourly fruity, and the small Yunnanese bell-shaped chillies are extremely hot and floral. Each variety has not only a different level of heat but a different flavour. As you eat your way around Thailand, you start to notice how the chillies more typical of the region in which you\u2019re travelling affect the style of cooking. The very hot chillies you see in areas that border Laos tend to be used to create lighter, more herbal dishes. A good example is the Laos-style fish laap recipe below. Dried chillies tend to deliver their heat more slowly. That heat will last much longer in your mouth. While they\u2019re the basis for most curry pastes, I tend to think of dried chillies as principally aromatic. Try toasting dried chilli lightly before using it \u2013 you\u2019ll notice how richly perfumed it can be. The beef salad recipe below relies on dried chilli and is a northern Thai-style laap, made with warming dry spices such as cumin and mahkwean (a relative of Szechuan pepper). The beef should be chopped by hand with a little offal and then very gently fried in oil with the lemongrass and a whole dried chilli. I suggest you serve it loosened with a little stock; this soupy style brings forward the heady, tonic-like quality of toasted spices and offally meat. Quite opposite in style, these two laaps demonstrate the differing uses of chilli between Thai regions. Laos-style fish laap Be careful not to overwork the fish or the herbs or it will all be a little sodden. The sweetness comes from the deep-fried lemongrass and shallot rather than sugar, and the result is a restrained but balanced dish where the heat of fresh chilli amplifies the fresh fish and any herbs you are using.

Add the lemongrass outer stalks and any trimmings from the makrut lime leaves to the water and gently boil the fish until cooked (2-3 minutes). 3 Set aside the fish and retain 1 tbsp of the boiling liquid. 4 Add the fish and salad ingredients to a large mixing bowl. Combine the fish sauce, reserved cooking liquor and lime juice to make a dressing and add this to the mixing bowl. Toss to coat all the ingredients without breaking up the fish too much. 5 Plate and add the garnishes.

This year it runs to a single amazing item: a new celebrity, from me to you. He is the incoming Thai king, and he was pictured in May arriving with his poodle-toting wife at an airport. His now-majesty was drenched in fake tattoos and wearing a vanishingly small white crop top. I was in heaven at the expression of the two officials standing to attention to him on the Tarmac, which came with a thought bubble reading \u201cI\u2019m saluting what now?\u201d For those instantly moved to establish a shrine to King Maha Vajiralongkorn somewhere in their home, there is a wealth of other gems out there. You may care to add the 2007 footage of his third wife topless and in a thong at the party to celebrate the birthday of his pet poodle Fufu. Fufu is sadly no longer with us, but during his life rose to the rank of air chief marshal in the Royal Thai Air Force. According to the then US ambassador to Thailand, Fufu appeared at one official function dressed in black tie, with paw mitts. He\u00a0hopped on to the table at the state banquet and drank from various water glasses, including that of the ambassador. Of course, it is a sadness that Fufu isn\u2019t now in charge of the secret police or something, but the new king has nonetheless made an eye-catching start. A\u00a0promptly launched investigation into the BBC\u2019s local language service for a profile it ran of Vajiralongkorn has already seen online access to the article blocked by the Thai authorities. Shortly afterwards, 10 police officers visited the corporation\u2019s Bangkok bureau, only to find it closed. According to reports, they drank some of the Yakult delivery they found on the doorstep, but will doubtless be back to discuss the matter more fully \u2013 and in better intestinal heath than ever.

I have a big thing about chips. Whenever I go out, I ask if the chips I see on the menu are hand-cut. I\u2019m nearly always told they are; they invariably aren\u2019t. That\u2019s no good \u2013 I\u2019m not interested if they\u2019re triple-fried in goose fat if they\u2019re not hand-cut. It\u2019s all about the rough edges, you see. Now, I have to say I didn\u2019t oversee how they cut the chips at a restaurant called Gazi in Melbourne when I was there in January, but they taste like the real thing \u2013 but different. They\u2019re fat chips that are halfway to potato wedges, fried in intensely garlicky oil and, once crisp and golden, tossed in a bowl with proper Greek dried oregano and crumbles of sharp feta. It\u2019s impossible not to eat well in Melbourne (well, in Australia generally), but these chips were absolutely worth flying the 10,496.05 miles for. Scallops with truffle puree at the Clove Club, LondonGregory Marchand, chef-patron, Frenchie, London This was really fresh, really beautiful and really, really tasty. The scallops came with a dashi jelly, mandarin juice, chopped hazelnuts and a brown-butter dressing, with some raw chestnut mushrooms shaved on top. Everything in the meal was stunning \u2013 the duck with fermented red cabbage puree was another standout \u2013 but this was the dish with the biggest wow factor. I still remember the experience of eating it. Cured past\u0131rma fish at Ismet Baba, IstanbulMarianna Leivaditaki, head chef, Morito Hackney Road, London Earlier this year, a few of us from Morito went to Istanbul. We had some amazing food but the most interesting thing was a dish we ate at a fish restaurant in Uskudar, right next to the Bosphorus, called Ismet Baba. The dish is bal\u0131k past\u0131rmas\u0131: swordfish cured with past\u0131rma spices, so lots of fenugreek, chilli flakes, cumin and caraway. Even though I cure fish myself, I had never eaten it in this way before. Then, a few months later, I went to Crete and had a very similar dish. I couldn\u2019t believe the coincidence. So I got to work and tried to replicate it \u2013 and I did it quite successfully. Now it\u2019s on our seafood menu. I\u2019ve turned it into a salad with capers, cherry tomatoes and some boiled baby potatoes, but in Turkey and Crete they just served it on its own with a little olive oil. Squid bolognese at Koffmann\u2019s, LondonTom Kitchin, chef-patron, The Kitchin, Edinburgh I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a nostalgic thing, because his restaurant is about to close, but the best thing this year was Pierre Koffmann\u2019s squid bolognese. It\u2019s a mindblowing dish. He\u2019s taken the idea of spaghetti bolognese, but there\u2019s no pasta involved. What you do is freeze the squid in a vacuum pack bag in one big block, then slice it very thinly on a meat slicer, which creates a kind of tagliatelle effect. The bolognese is the tentacles cooked in a rich tomato sauce. Some of the most ingenious things in life are the simplest. You can\u2019t take it out of the man, he just keeps creating. Jackfruit curry at Samakanda, Sri LankaMeera Sodha, food writer, author of Fresh India In January, I went to Sri Lanka and stayed at a tropical plantation in the south called Samakanda. One evening some local chefs climbed the trees in the garden, harvested some coconuts and tender baby jackfruit and made a curry. I\u2019d never eaten jackfruit before and I\u2019d been staring at these spiky green fruit in the sky wondering what they\u2019d taste like. They cooked the jackfruit in a clay pot over an open fire with onions, ginger, spices, coconut milk and a very sour ingredient called goraka. As you never just get one dish in Sri Lanka, we also had an aubergine and mustard pickle called brinjal moju, a cashew-nut curry, sambal and spiced rice, all washed down with an arak sour. But the jackfruit curry stood out: the sticky sweetness of the fruit was balanced by the sourness of the goraka, and together they cut through the creaminess of the coconut. It was a sensational dish.     Jackfruit curry chosen by Meera Sodha. Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Cured and smoked jowl at Pitt Cue, LondonSarit Packer, chef-patron, Honey &amp; Co and Honey &amp; Smoke, London Itamar and I used to get takeaways from Pitt Cue\u2019s little place off Carnaby Street but we wondered how it would translate to a big restaurant in the City. We thought they might go for something over-sleek but they haven\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not frou-frou and the food was really simple. They did this smoked jowl which was literally the piece of meat on a plate, with a lick of puree. It was proper proud cooking, as if to say, we know we can do this amazingly well so you don\u2019t need anything else. And it was fun to see people being really creative with smoke. Petit-beurre cakeTomer Amedi, head chef at the Palomar, London My wife made me a cake for my birthday in April. It\u2019s called a petit-beurre cake, after the French biscuits (which are very popular in Israel), and it\u2019s the most delicious thing in the universe. I used to have it when I was little. My wife knows it\u2019s one of my kryptonites: she made me a whole tray and I ate half of it by myself. It\u2019s basically a layer cake with vanilla cream and these biscuits, then you add shaved chocolate on top and then the biscuit becomes all mushy and nice. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s trashy, but it\u2019s so good. Cochinita pibil in Yucat\u00e1n, MexicoRen\u00e9 Redzepi, chef-patron, Noma, Copenhagen This summer, I went to a tiny little Mayan village called Yaxuna in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and had cochinita pibil. It\u2019s a very traditional dish made with a little pig, usually wild, that they hunt and then marinate in the seed of the achiote tree mixed with sour orange juice. It\u2019s then folded in banana leaves and cooked in a pit. We ate it in 35-degree heat with fresh tortillas, which Mayan women made on hot stones, accompanied by pickled onions, fresh coriander and habanero chillies (as a pale gringo, I could only have a few drops of the chilli marinade). The meat was moist and juicy and the acidity was just incredible. It was such a perfect mouthful \u2013 the best Mexican food I\u2019ve ever had. Bone-marrow arancini by Jacob Kenedy at the Oxford Symposium on Food and CookeryBee Wilson, food writer and historian At the Oxford Food Symposium, which I\u2019m the chair of, we always have themed meals, and this year the theme was offal. A lot of people thought it was going to be dreadful, but Jacob Kenedy, chef-patron at Bocca di Lupo, put together a total feast \u2013 one of those meals I\u2019ll remember all my life. The level of thought he put into it was just extraordinary. There was a lot of wordplay on the menu: it included ox-heart tomatoes, marrow-fat peas and kidney beans. He served red mullet livers, which he\u2019d been stockpiling for months at the restaurant, with bruschetta and peas. He made coda alla vaccinara, or Roman oxtail stew, and an extremely spicy stew of innards called u morzeddhu. But the thing that really stood out for me was an arancino (stuffed rice ball). I\u2019m not often a fan \u2013 I think they can be quite dry and disappointing compared to risotto \u2013 but this was a beautiful golden sphere, so saffrony, and when you opened it up it had bone marrow in the middle. It was so unctuous \u2013 sort of like having risotto Milanese with osso bucco all in one tiny, perfect element. Black rice with squid ink at El Pirata of Mayfair, LondonFred Sirieix, general manager, Galvin at Windows, London El Pirata of Mayfair is a lovely Spanish restaurant next to where I work. It\u2019s a traditional, no-frills tapas place that\u2019s been open for 22 years \u2013 if it were French it would be a bistro. The dish I love there is black rice with squid. They cook the rice in squid ink and a little bit of fish stock and it has a very delicate round flavour. I love the langoustine with tomato sauce, too, and breaded monkfish \u2013 oh, it\u2019s delicious. And such good value. I said to the manager, \u201cAre you mad?\u201d He said, \u201cFred, people like these prices and we\u2019re happy, too, we don\u2019t need to put the prices up.\u201d OK, fine by me. Oh, and the ham, I think it\u2019s the best that you can find in London. Don\u2019t take my word for it, go and try it out.     Squid chosen by Fred Sirieix. Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Pan-fried cep with celeriac puree and shaved truffle at Timberyard, Edinburgh  Gill Meller, Head chef at River Cottage and author of Gather Timberyard is a family-owned restaurant \u2013 the father, mother, daughter and two sons are all involved and they were incredibly welcoming. One particular dish in the six-course lunch bowled me over. The chef had received a delivery of fresh ceps that morning. He\u2019d taken a thick slice from the middle of the mushroom and pan-fried it on both sides with salt and pepper, then served it warm with a tiny bit of celeriac puree and shaved truffle. Every mouthful was exceptional, partly because the mushroom was so fresh and pristine. It was the simplest dish you could imagine, but the way it was executed was just perfect. Watermelon in BeijingMichael Zee, author of Symmetry Breakfast In September, I went to stay with my sister who lives in Beijing. She was obsessed with watermelons, which are absolutely gargantuan in China \u2013 bigger than a beach ball. They\u2019re so big, you need help in the supermarket to put it into the trolley, and we had to carry our one home in a pram. The heart of the watermelon is the best bit. It was such a different texture to anything I\u2019ve ever experienced in the UK or America: the flesh was like sugar crystals. I just chopped it up and ate it by itself. It was so sugary and sweet, I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Duck breast with blackcurrant at Birch, BristolStephen Terry, chef-patron of the Hardwick, Abergavenny The couple who run Birch, Sam Leach and Beccy Massey, are young and very passionate. They grow a lot of the produce themselves, make their own bread, do their own butchery. The food is very simple and the place is unpretentious, which appeals to me \u2013 they\u2019re clearly putting their money into quality ingredients rather than fine china. We went in the springtime and every dish was a celebration of the season: we had some early rhubarb, we had snails. But the best thing was duck with blackcurrants and roasted carrots. It was the most amazingly cooked duck breast I\u2019ve had in my life. I asked if he\u2019d cooked it in a water bath and he said, no, just in the pan. It was beautiful. Sp\u00e4tzle at Rotstockh\u00fctte, Gimmelwald, SwitzerlandTrine Hahnemann, food writer and cook This summer I went hiking in the Swiss Alps. One day we walked for 12km, a lot of it uphill, and then came down into a valley where we found a little cafe that looked a bit like a shed. They made just a few dishes and one of them was homemade sp\u00e4tzle with cream, bacon and local cheese. I had it with a big glass of beer. Maybe it was the circumstances \u2013 I was really hungry from the long walk \u2013 but this dish was so good. It wasn\u2019t a foodie thing at all: it felt like the world hadn\u2019t touched this place for a long, long time. But it made me really happy. Veal brain at Le Baratin, ParisDominique Ansel, owner, Dominique Ansel Bakery, London It was in Paris this spring, at a small bistro called Le Baratin, that I had the best dish ever: veal brain, poached and seared, with lemon sauce and some small boiled potatoes. I love simple, home-cooked food and this was just spot on \u2013 unbelievably delicious and cooked to perfection. Le Baratin is a tiny place in Belleville, not fancy at all. There\u2019s an open kitchen and you can see the chef [Raquel Carena] working away, with just one other cook, while her husband manages the bar and front of house. She makes the kind of food I want to eat every day. I\u2019d like to go back very soon. Pumpkin tortelli at Dal Pescatore, Canneto Sull\u2019oglio, ItalyMassimo Bottura, chef-patron, Osteria Francescana, Modena, Italy None of the best things I ate this year involved luxury ingredients but they all had an emotional quality, which is very important to me. A few months ago I had a pumpkin tortelli at Dal Pescatore, not far from Modena, which reminded me of my youth and the flavours of my grandmother\u2019s cooking. It is savoury, spicy and sweet, so you have this feeling that you\u2019re almost eating a dessert at the pasta course. Maybe the pasta was more refined and the plate more elegant, but otherwise it was exactly like my grandmother made it. As soon as I tasted it, I was so emotionally touched, because it took me back to the memory of my youth. It was unbelievable: I almost cried.     Pumpkin tortelli chosen by Massimo Bottura. Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Grilled starfruit in Sylhet, BangladeshNadiya Hussain, food writer and broadcaster My dad has a starfruit tree in his backyard in Bangladesh and when we were over there last month it was in season, which I was very excited about. My relatives were all laughing at me because they think starfruit is a nuisance \u2013 they don\u2019t really eat them because they\u2019re so tart, and when they become sweet they disintegrate very quickly. But it was such a treat to see them growing in abundance, and for the kids to pick them. They couldn\u2019t see where the star was, but then we sliced one up and they saw it and were like, \u201cAh, that\u2019s really cool.\u201d I\u2019d never cooked with starfruit before, but me and the kids dug a hole in my dad\u2019s front garden (which he doesn\u2019t know about because we filled it up afterwards) and took an old piece of metal mesh from my uncle\u2019s building site and built a fire. Then we grilled the starfruit with cinnamon and sugar, and ate it with all the kids in the village. We were just making it up as we went along, using whatever we had in the cupboard, but it was so good. Grilled starfruit, I can tell you, is really delicious. Roast Dexter ribeyeApril Bloomfield, chef-patron, the Spotted Pig and the Breslin Bar &amp; Dining Room, both New York Few things blew my mind this year, but one that did was this lovely beef I had at my friend Charlie Hart\u2019s farmhouse in Cornwall. He cooked us a Dexter ribeye roast with all the trimmings \u2013 lots of roast potatoes and vegetables \u2013 and it was all delicious, but the joint was the standout. Boy, was that thing beefy: the fat was the colour of good butter and the meat so tender and tasty. It was one of those moments where you have a connection with what you\u2019re eating \u2013 it kind of grabs you, stops you in your tracks, and makes you go, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s perfection!\u201d Fried reindeer moss sprayed with chocolate at Noma, CopenhagenSat Bains, chef-patron, Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham Take a snapshot of \u201cNordic\u201d cuisine right now, and people are still doing the kind of stuff Ren\u00e9 Redzepi was making five or six years ago. But what the guy himself is cooking these days, you can\u2019t call it Nordic. It\u2019s unique. This dessert blew my mind. I had it in August, when I was in town for the Mad festival, and, like all Ren\u00e9\u2019s food, it looks stunning. It comes on a bed of moss with slices of chocolate-covered dehydrated cep, which were amazing in their own right, but this lichen was something else: it\u2019s deep-fried, sprayed with chocolate and flavoured with, at a guess, pine oil. The first thing that hits you is the texture \u2013 it\u2019s like the most delicate Shredded Wheat imaginable \u2013 then all these flavours hit you all at once. It\u2019s incredible. I went back six weeks later, just to have it again. Scallops at F\u00e4viken, SwedenClare Smyth, chef I went to F\u00e4viken at the end of the summer and the whole dining experience was incredible. First, we sat at a log fire for aperitifs and snacks. Then we went upstairs and had a procession of courses \u2013 we probably ate 30 different things, though it didn\u2019t feel like a heavy meal. Everything was good but there were a few standouts. One was the most amazing plump scallop that was cooked on a big wood fire in the middle of the kitchen. They remove the skirt, then pour the juice back into the shell and serve it on some juniper wood. It\u2019s just a scallop \u2013 so simple \u2013 but it was the most succulent sweet thing. Towards the end, we went back down to the fire and they handed out a wonderful selection of sweets, petit fours, coffees and homemade drinks. Afterwards, we went out to a tipi to smoke cigars and drink cognac. Whole peking duck at Park Chinois, LondonJay Rayner, Observer restaurant critic The best all-round eating experience remains Riley\u2019s Fish Shack in Tynemouth and, having come so late in the year, it\u2019s unlikely to be beaten. But the best single food item has to be the whole peking duck at Alan Yau\u2019s homage to the famed dinner-dance clubs of Shanghai, Park Chinois, just off London\u2019s Berkeley Square. Is it cheap? God no. It\u2019s \u00a385, though that\u2019s for two at least. But blimey, it\u2019s good: crisp lacquered skin, the perfect thin layer of fat, sweet yielding meat. It\u2019s been said that the Chinese are the best at roasting duck. And this is quite simply the very best of the best. It could be more expensive. For \u00a3280 they\u2019ll bung on 50g of beluga caviar, but I really wouldn\u2019t bother.     Peking duck chosen by Jay Rayner. Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Gaeng ki lek (beef and cassia leaf curry) at Bo.lan, BangkokAndy Oliver, chef/co-owner, Som Saa, London Before we opened the new Som Saa, the team went on a research trip to Thailand. For me, the meal at Bo.lan was the highlight of the entire visit, and this curry stood out even among all the other sublime dishes. It had sweetness from fresh coconut cream and this amazing artisan palm sugar that tastes a bit like a combination of butterscotch and honey, and that\u2019s balanced by the slight bitterness of fresh cassia and the fragrance of fresh makrut lime leaf. The beef was pretty special stuff, too \u2013 aged rump grilled until it was all smoky. When you\u2019re just off a flight from the UK and eat here, it smacks you square in the face \u2013 all those familiar Thai tastes and ingredients are turned up to 11, because they\u2019re fresh from the market that morning. Cuttlefish with summer truffle at Bak\u00e8, Torre dell\u2019Orso, ItalyJane Baxter, chef/co-owner, Wild Artichokes, Kingsbridge, Devon Bak\u00e8 is the kind of place that proves you shouldn\u2019t judge on appearances. It\u2019s behind a semi-deserted shopping centre on the outskirts of a quiet seaside town in Puglia \u2013 the only thing missing is tumbleweed \u2013 but you walk in and the place is packed: they had to bring in an extra table and move everyone around to make room for us. The owner\u2019s a bit of a local celeb \u2013 he invented the pentolo pan, for cooking large amounts pasta \u2013 but he\u2019s best known round these parts as a truffle hunter. It\u2019s a short menu: three or four pastas, a few mostly fishy mains, and a selection of antipasti, of which this dish was one. It\u2019s so simple: incredibly fresh cuttlefish sliced very thinly, then flash-fried and dressed with brilliant olive oil and summer truffles. The combination was staggering. Reuben sandwich at Black Axe Mangal, LondonTim Siadatan, chef/co-owner, Padella and Trullo, both London I\u2019ve eaten at Black Axe Mangal a lot in the past year \u2013 well, it is just 20 metres down the road from Trullo. Everything Lee Tiernan and the BAM team cook is excellent, but their take on the Reuben is the best I\u2019ve ever had. Everything in it \u2013 and I mean absolutely everything \u2013 is made in-house: the smoked pastrami, the brisket, the welsh rarebit mix for the cheese, the sauerkraut, the pickles and even the mustard. And it\u2019s all served in a homemade flatbread with a side of homemade crisps. It\u2019s totally awesome. Nathan Outlaw\u2019s lobster roasting juicesTom Adams, chef-patron, Pitt Cue, London, and Coombeshead Farm, Lewannick, Cornwall What with opening the new Pitt Cue and Coombeshead in 2016, I haven\u2019t had many meals out this year. Even so, there have been many memorable morsels along the way, and perhaps the most satisfying came during a dinner we held at the farm with Nathan Outlaw. I hadn\u2019t eaten much all day, and was running mostly on fumes and the occasional Malteser. After we sent out the main courses, there was a short respite before dessert, so I nipped out to the prep area, where we\u2019d moved the spent roasting trays. Some of Nathan\u2019s sweet, buttery, smoky lobster roasting juices were still in the trays, so I liberated a few slices of bread and took care of things. Roasting and resting juices are my holy grail, and these were some of the finest. Curried calves\u2019 brains, Farokh Talati pop-up, LondonGary Usher, chef-owner, Sticky Walnut, Chester; Burnt Truffle, Heswall, Wirral, Hispi, Manchester Farokh\u2019s day job is at St John Bread &amp; Wine in London, but on the side he runs these brilliant Persian and curry pop-ups \u2013 he\u2019s done a couple for us up at Sticky, but I\u2019m on-duty there, so only get a small taste. I had these brains in October, when he did a guest night at Black Axe Mangal in Highbury. He serves everything family-style, and you just dive into this amazing feast. These massala-spiced brains came with a wonderful tarragon mayo, and I must have eaten at least five of them all by myself \u2013 and I mean whole ones. We sometimes have brains on the menu at our places, but Farokh\u2019s spicing takes them to another level. Coffee ice-cream at Grom, MilanRuby Tandoh, food writer In May, I went to Italy with my girlfriend for five weeks and we must have had two ice-creams a day while we were there. We went to a couple of off-the-beaten-track places that were highly recommended, with an old man crushing pistachios with his bare hands or whatever, and to be honest they were underwhelming. The best was at a chain called Grom. I know being into a chain is very anti-foodie, but it was really amazing ice-cream. The one I remember most clearly was the first one I had: coffee and pistachio in a branch in Milan. I couldn\u2019t believe that a coffee ice-cream could taste like that \u2013 so dark and bitter but sweet as well. It was wonderful. In every town we went to after that, we\u2019d go to Grom.

The guy smeared a glorious paste of herbs, spices and about 10 types of chilli all over half a lamb, then laid it on a rack over a big pot filled with chickpeas, carrots, tomatoes, onions, herbs, spices, chillies and water, so the fat would drip through. He covered the meat with agave leaves, put the pot in a hole filled with smouldering charcoal, covered everything with hay and left it. The next day, about 16 hours later, we had the soup from the pot, then the lamb with tacos and \u2026 Oh my god! Even though I was full, I just couldn\u2019t stop eating. It was my idea of heaven. And the guy still refused to tell me what was in his paste. Anchovy cicchetti at All\u2019Arco, VeniceAngela Hartnett, chef-patron, Murano, Cafe Murano and Merchants Tavern, London A few months ago, Russell Norman (Polpo) took a bunch of us over to Venice for a few days. We went to All\u2019Arco the morning after a lovely, but very long, night on the town. It\u2019s a bacaro near the Rialto, and while the others were chatting away over yet more drinks, I sat quietly at the bar and got stuck into the cicchetti. My memory\u2019s a little hazy, for obvious reasons, but three stood out: one topped with sea bass ceviche with oil and chilli, another with fontina, prosciutto and swiss chard, and these little squares of bread spread with glorious butter and topped with a single salted anchovy. That\u2019s all there was to it, but it was just the best. Soba noodles dipped in duck broth at Kanei, KyotoErchen Chang, chef/co-owner, Bao, London Kanei is in an unassuming house in a quiet residential neighbourhood. We were lucky, because we got to the front of the long queue just before they shut the doors \u2013 there are only 16 or so seats on the tatami, so it\u2019s pretty cosy. The four schoolboys next to us all seemed to know what they wanted and ordered straightaway, while this old guy sat behind us told me he\u2019d been eating here for 10 years. We had cold soba noodles with a rich, hot duck broth with three slices of pink duck breast floating in it. You dip the super-bouncy soba in the broth, and slurp. This dish was so simple, yet every part of it hit the spot and was so elegant. OFM Steamed flower crab, Tasting Court, Hong KongcorrectFuchsia Dunlop, cook and writer of Land Of Fish And Rice My dish of the year was steamed flower crab with golden chicken oil and Shaoxing wine, served on a rippled bed of smooth rice pasta. It was part of an exquisite Cantonese feast arranged by friends. Every dish was prepared with consummate artistry, among them lion\u2019s head meatballs and a perfect rendition of an old classic, braised pomelo skin with dried shrimp eggs. I think it\u2019s the best Cantonese meal I\u2019ve ever had, and the steamed crab was the highlight. Unforgettable. Chicken rice, Wee Nam Kee, SingaporeClaus Meyer, Food writer and co-founder, Noma Last winter, during a trip to Singapore, I had the best chicken in my life. The chicken itself was a 2kg free-range chicken of the very best quality. It was poached for 30 minutes in a gigantic pot full of chicken stock that I suspect had been cooking for decades and had been passed on from chef to chef, just like a sourdough is passed on from one generation to another. After 30 minutes, the chicken was taken out of the stock and put straight into water with ice to seal the melted fats and juices under the skin. The chicken was then kept at room temperature. The rice itself was cooked in chicken fat and then in chicken stock, and served with a black thick soy-like sauce and a chilli sauce made from freshly pounded chillis, ginger juice, garlic, lime juice, sesame oil and sugar. When the chicken melted in my mouth, tears came to my eyes.", "publicationDate": "2016-12-11T09:00:22Z", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Restaurants"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/11/best-thing-i-ate-2016-nigella-lawson-nadiya-hussain-rene-redzepi", "title": "The best thing I ate in 2016", "sentences": ["Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Gaeng ki lek (beef and cassia leaf curry) at Bo.lan, BangkokAndy Oliver, chef/co-owner, Som Saa, London Before we opened the new Som Saa, the team went on a research trip to Thailand."]}, {"article": "Police in Thailand are investigating the death of a diver off the coast of the resort city of Pattaya, whose body was found tied to a concrete post with his throat slit.

You couldn\u2019t get on a plane or lie on a beach without seeing copies of the book in your neighbours\u2019 hands. It was reprinted 25 times in less than a year and the film rights were hot property. The book about seclusion and secret places was everywhere. The Beach is a modern take on Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness. The backpacker, Richard, meets an unhinged Scotsman going by the alias of Daffy Duck who gives him a hand-drawn map, with directions to a beautiful island with a hidden lagoon and beach, located in the Gulf of Thailand and inaccessible to tourists. Richard finds paradise, but he and his fellow travellers are locked in a constant battle to keep it to themselves.   Related: Alex Garland\u2019s cult novel The Beach, 20 years on    There are many places that claim to be the inspiration for The Beach including the undeveloped Ang Thong national marine park near Koh Samui. But there is one place I kept hearing about that was the original inspiration for The Beach: The Sanctuary on Koh Phangan. Even its name has a Beach-like vibe. One friend who was getting over a breakup went there for a week and ended up staying several months. The visit changed her life, she told me. \u201cGet on a plane, do what it takes, just get over there,\u201d she urged.  The Sanctuary is a hippie resort that specialises in yoga, spa treatments, detoxes and alternative therapies yet also offers a hedonistic, party-vibe if that\u2019s what you want. Accommodation ranges from dorm rooms to self-contained air-conditioned bungalows , high up in the jungle hills. Because it was paradise it was not easy to find. When the weather is wet you can pay a guy to take the sometimes-treacherous route inland though dense jungle to get to resort but, if it\u2019s calm, you can arrive by sea. I flew from Penang to Koh Samui and caught a boat to Haad Rin wharf, then scrambled down rocks with a suitcase, which got tossed on to a fishing boat, before we took off, away from the hectic beaches that are home to the full moon parties, and headed towards a string of beaches that sit at the start of steep hills, covered in jungle. We pulled in at Haad Tien, which is made up of three bays and is the home of The Sanctuary.      The main bar and restaurant is the hub of the community. Photograph: The Sanctuary     As soon I got off the boat, carrying my suitcase aloft as I waded though the water, I was greeted by managers Michael Doyle and Nolan Dalby.  Doyle has been on the island for almost 20 years. An Irishman, he lived and worked for a time in Australia as a psychiatric nurse before he went travelling around Asia and discovered \u201cthe beach\u201d. \u201cThe Sanctuary in the early days was a few hippies on the beach,\u201d he says. \u201cIt started as a communal thing 20 years ago. Ten to 15 years ago they built the wellness centre. Conscious, colourful party people come here.\u201d Each year more dorms and bungalows are added to accommodate the growing word-of-mouth crowds but costs are kept down, which results in an eclectic mix of budgeting backpackers and older, monied travellers having a week or two off from their banking jobs. The Sanctuary easily fits the description of paradise. And not just because it\u2019s devastatingly pretty with an azure bay circled by palm trees. It\u2019s paradise because it operates like a community but without the boring chores like cleaning, cooking and governance.    People work hard and then come back for six months and chill.  Nolan Dalby, The Sanctuary     The community aspect is strengthened by the fact that many people aren\u2019t just passing through on their way somewhere else \u2013 it\u2019s one of those places where people come for a week and stay for months or, in some cases, years.  \u201cThere\u2019s a current between here and Bali,\u201d says Dalby, who co-manages the property. \u201cA number of yoga teachers and healers go between the two. We find people changing their flights all the time. There have been people who get to the airport on the boat and they turn around and come back.\u201d One Irish guest, Anne-Marie, loved it so much she moved into the bay area permanently. \u201cOne of the most beautiful things I find is that people really bond,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see guests at the start and they are quiet and nervous and then they might do something like a course or a fast \u2013 and get great support from the others doing it \u2013 and they are friends for life.\u201d  Dalby adds: \u201cPeople become friends then come back with each other. That\u2019s prevalent on the island \u2013 people work hard and then come back for six months and chill.\u201d The Sanctuary is a good balance between hedonistic and healthy. There is a fasting centre that sits down near the beach and is run by a man who goes by the name Mr Moon. The fasters sit in lounges away from the main bar and drink their special detox drinks at regular intervals. Not far away is the main bar and restaurant, which is the hub of the community. I am feasting not fasting and each day enjoyed pad Thai or seafood curry served in a coconut. Doyle tells me about the parties every Friday night on another part of the island. \u201cYou go and just connect.\u201d He takes his two peace fingers and point them at me \u2013 \u201cconnect\u201d. \u201cOn drugs?\u201d No, not drugs here, he assures me \u2013 through the eyes you have a connection with people. At first, I spend time alone in my room, high up in the hills with a balcony overlooking the bay, or reading the Bangkok Post in the restaurant, eavesdropping and scribbling in my journal.      One guide said: \u2018Everything in the jungle speaks to us. I\u2019m interested in rewilding the human being.\u2019 Photograph: The Sanctuary     But I soon find my way to the healing centre where you can put your name down to sample various new age therapies. I signed up for an \u201cecstatic dance\u201d and at dusk I make my way along the trail to the hall. There were about eight of us and we sit in a circle, with Patrick as our guide. He is Australian \u2013 from a small town outside Sydney \u2013 and has hair so blond it is almost white. He wears those Thai fisherman\u2019s pants with the complicated knotting at the front and more billows than a bagpipe yet he carries it off. He has a sort of regal bearing. \u201cI take people into the jungle and we do ancestral movement and games,\u201d he explains. \u201cEverything in the jungle speaks to us. I\u2019m interested in rewilding the human being.\u201d Patrick has mixed up a drink containing cacao, a chocolate plant that is one of the most revered of the ancient Mayan deities. Music plays. He passes around the drink and we are asked to state what we are grateful for. There were several fasters in the group whose gratitude seems deeper and more profound than the gratitude of the eaters, who say things such as, \u201cI am grateful to be here.\u201d The fasters are grateful not just for being here, but also for being. In the darkened hall, the whites of their eyes are illuminated as though they are wearing Halloween contact lenses. Their number includes a monk, an MBA student, a hypnotist, a lawyer and a traveller who had previously worked in the arts and culture sector in Darwin. In the next 90 minutes I dance \u201cecstatically\u201d, starting with Polynesian-style movements and clapping, followed by call and response and then just free-form dancing, until I am dripping with sweat. Massive Attack brings everyone down, then Patrick plays African drums and guitar and then a flute and we all lie on yoga mats. The candles around the room burn and the jungle makes noises and it is incredibly great and peaceful and then there is a tape of an Indian voice saying, \u201cBe grateful for everything,\u201d and for a few long minutes I am.   Related: Thank you for not visiting: tourist hotspots that have done a Koh Tachai     The wellness centre stocks plentiful detox books locked in a cabinet that smells musty. The first book I pull out looked old and is filled with diagrams of intestines. I flick it open to a part about impacted faeces \u2013 the stuff that hangs around in your gut \u2013 for, like, ever. Fasting and detox \u2013 together with colonics \u2013 is the only way to clean it out, apparently, and The Sanctuary offers it all.  Throughout the week I feast on delicious hand-made rice paper rolls with prawns, huge chunks of grilled salmon with soba noodles, coconut-battered fried fish with jasmine rice and green curry sauce, fish cakes, fried spring rolls filled with vegetables and prawns, ice-cold Singa served in stubby holders, smoothies and juices, fresh coconuts, cocktails, and fresh ginger, lemon and honey tea. Dalby tells me that their regular visitors tend to alternate \u2013 they\u2019ll come and enjoy the yummy food and the next visit they\u2019ll do a detox. We\u2019ll see.

The incident is the latest example of the social media platform\u2019s algorithms failing to distinguish between reliable and faulty news sources.   Related: Fake news: an insidious trend that's fast becoming a global problem    Facebook\u2019s safety check tool, which allows users to mark themselves safe in the event of a disaster or crisis, was activated in Bangkok on 26 December, citing \u201cmedia sources\u201d as confirmation of an explosion.

No one was injured, according to the Bangkok Post.

A screenshot of the feature shared by Saksith Saiyasombut, a local journalist, shows that Facebook promoted a 26 December article by BangkokInformer.com in conjunction with the safety check.

BangkokInformer.com is part of a network of local \u201cnews\u201d websites that appear to simply repost articles from other sources. The company did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.  Facebook defended its activation of the safety check feature.  \u201cAs with all safety check activations, Facebook relies on a trusted third party to first confirm the incident and then on the community to use the tool and share with friends and family,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.  When the safety check tool was launched in October 2014, it was only used for natural disasters. It was first used for a terrorist attack during the November 2015 Paris attacks. The company faced criticism, however, for its decision to activate the feature in some cases and not in others. In November, the company announced that it would no longer directly control the feature, instead relying on alerts of incidents from a \u201cthird-party source\u201d. The company\u2019s explanation of the changes suggest that the feature is now controlled by algorithms detecting whether \u201cpeople in the area are talking about the incident\u201d.   Related: 2016: the year Facebook became the bad guy    The company declined to name its third-party source for incident reports. Facebook has faced considerable criticism over its role in the dissemination of false information, especially following the US presidential election, in which news hoaxes and partisan propaganda ran rampant on the site.  On 15 December, the company announced that it would begin working with third-party fact checkers to flag viral fake news stories. Five fact-checking organizations are participating in a pilot program to combat fake news on the platform, but the pilot is limited by the staff capability of the independent organizations.  The pilot also requires the fact-checkers to address each false story individually \u2013 a challenge given that fake news stories can rapidly multiply across numerous websites. The BangkokInformer.com article, for example, was subsequently copied on to msn.com, creating another misleading headline featured on the safety check tool.

But research has found that while you should book ahead for short journeys on such airlines as Ryanair or easyJet, it\u2019s better to wait until much later for the best deals on long-haul flights. The best time to book a short-haul flight is at least 70 days (2.5 months) in advance of flying, according to online booking agent Tripsta. But if it\u2019s a long-haul destination that you\u2019re after \u2013 such as New York, Bangkok or Sydney \u2013 then it is better to hold your nerve and wait until closer to your departure date.

Booking far in advance, for an equally quiet period of travel in late November 2017, the cheapest price for a direct flight was \u00a3482. But if you follow the same strategy with Ryanair or easyJet, you are likely to get your fingers burned. Their business model is to offer the cheapest tickets on a first-come, first-served basis; as the clock ticks down towards the departure date\u00a0the prices begin to rise. However, note that Ryanair holds sales on some routes around two to three months ahead of departure date, so keep an eye\u00a0out for those. There are many other tips for bagging a bargain on flights. Here are our top 10: 1. Always book on a Sunday According to Expedia, more business travellers make bookings on Fridays, and the airlines and hotels price accordingly. By choosing to book on a Sunday (although not necessarily travelling on a\u00a0Sunday) you can save up to 30%. 2. Buy long-haul on Tuesdays According to website Skyscanner: \u201cQuite\u00a0a few airlines release their last-minute weekend deals on a Tuesday, as they tend to start their sales on a Monday evening \u2013 as competitors scrabble to compete, by Tuesday afternoon you could be bagging a sweet bargain on your air fare.\u201d 3. Stay away over a Saturday By including a Saturday night stay in your flight you can save up to 34% on average when travelling within Europe, says Expedia, but this rises to 74% for flights within central Europe. \u201cAirlines often try to segment business versus leisure travellers by filing cheaper fares\u00a0that require a Saturday night stay,\u201d says Expedia.     Including a Saturday night stay can save you up to 34% on average on your flights when travelling within Europe. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    4. Try this easyJet trick  Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert says there\u2019s a loophole in easyJet\u2019s \u201cFlexi\u201d fare, which allows you to get round peak time prices in the summer school holidays. \u201cBook a Flexi fare\u00a0on the same route at a less busy time, when flights are cheaper; after 24 hours, provided there\u2019s capacity, you can switch it to the dates you originally wanted at no extra charge. It\u2019s not the easiest trick in the book, but if it works it could save you hundreds of pounds,\u201d he says. 5. Remove cookies It may be an urban myth, but regular flyers swear that flight prices increase when a particular route is repeatedly searched. You can delete cookies by heading to the internet options button\u00a0in \u201ctools\u201d on Microsoft Internet Explorer, or by heading to \u201csettings\u201d in\u00a0Google Chrome. 6. Avoid some specific dates  These are always the first five Fridays of the school summer holidays. Tripsta says flights to Alghero in Italy, departing this summer on Friday 4 August, were selling for \u00a3304, but if the traveller switched dates to Wednesday 17 August the price fell to \u00a3143. 7. Return on a Friday A summer trip to Alicante was \u00a3325 booked last minute and returning the following Sunday. If the traveller could face returning on the Friday, and had booked earlier, the price dropped to \u00a3110.     There are ways to avoid paying more for flights during school holidays.  Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters    8. Use different search engines Skyscanner is great for a quick overview of prices. But be wary of excessive card charges made by some operators which enable them to offer \u201ccheap\u201d flights but which come with a sting in the tail. Kayak allows you to filter options based on card fees. Momondo is good for inspiration. Expedia is good for flight/hotel combinations. In the US, try AirfareWatchDog for alerts on cheap deals. JacksFlightClub claims to hunt down pricing errors and email you when\u00a0they occur. 9. Consider split ticketing Take the concept of \u201csplit ticketing\u201d on the railways and apply it to airlines. That\u2019s what Skiplagged.com does after discovering that sometimes a flight that connects in the city you want to go to is cheaper than flying directly to it. They call it \u201chidden city flights\u201d, although it only really works in the US. Its promoters are currently engaged in a legal battle with United Airlines, and it can only work if you have no luggage apart from carry-on. 10. Mix and match It\u2019s always cheaper midweek, on both short and long haul. And always check single as well as return ticket prices, and\u00a0mix and match airlines. There is no\u00a0rule that says because you choose to\u00a0fly Ryanair to Madrid you can\u2019t fly back with easyJet. Expedia\u2019s new loyalty scheme Expedia is the first major holiday booking website to launch a loyalty programme, similar to air miles. It will give holidaymakers two \u201cExpedia+\u201d points for every \u00a31 spent on a flight-plus-hotel package, or one point for every \u00a35 spent on flights.Points can then be used to obtain as much as 3% off the price of further bookings, with no \u2018blackout\u2019 periods common on other travel reward schemes. A couple heading to Ibiza this summer on a \u00a32,450 package including flights, hotels and car hire would qualify for \u00a367 off the price of their next trip, or equal to 2.75% cash back. Expedia also promises free room upgrades and other perks for travellers who book at least 15 nights and enter its \u201cgold tier\u201d membership, although members of Expedia\u2019s similar scheme in the US have complained that upgrades have sometimes failed to materialise. As with all loyalty schemes, travellers should check the price of flights or hotel combinations on a variety of websites before booking, but if Expedia is the cheapest there is no harm in joining the rewards programme, which is free. Using Expedia+ does not stop you collecting on other schemes such as Nectar or using their credit cards to pay for flights and pick up air miles.     Londoners could find that flying to Dublin is a lot cheaper from Birmingham airport. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images    Flying from a different airport can save a lot of money Flying home for Christmas and the New Year can be an expensive affair, Shane Hickey writes, even if you book well in advance. A few years ago, faced with return fares of \u00a3400 for two for a trip from London to Dublin, I\u00a0found an unlikely, cheaper alternative: Birmingham airport. Living in north-east London, flying from Stansted makes the most sense. At Christmas, however, prices skyrocket, particularly for the most convenient times of day. Travelling to Birmingham airport, meanwhile, takes just an hour and 10 minutes from Euston, and the station is located in the terminal building. Flights cost just over \u00a3190 for two return when they were booked at the start of October \u2013 some 50% cheaper than if we had flown from Stansted or\u00a0Heathrow. The return train fares to the airport came in at \u00a338.40, after savings from a Two Together railcard were applied. Planning ahead is key for Christmas and New Year travel on budget airlines \u2013 return flights for two people to Dublin from London, booking just before Christmas, were \u00a3696.", "publicationDate": "2016-12-31T07:00:21Z", "tags": ["Ticket prices", "Consumer affairs", "Online shopping", "Money", "easyJet", "Airline industry", "Business", "Ryanair", "Flights", "Travel", "Air transport", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/31/ten-ways-save-money-holiday-flights", "title": "Ten ways to save money on your holiday flights", "sentences": ["But if it\u2019s a long-haul destination that you\u2019re after \u2013 such as New York, Bangkok or Sydney \u2013 then it is better to hold your nerve and wait until closer to your departure date."]}]}
