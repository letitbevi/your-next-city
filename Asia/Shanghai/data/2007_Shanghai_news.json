Kate Bostock, director of women&apos;s wear and girls&apos; wear at Marks &amp; Spencer, has a big job but has not made it on to the board. The 50-year-old is credited with playing a key role in turning around the range of clothes for women. Previously at Asda as a product director at clothing range George and also at Next, she has broken M&amp;S&apos;s problem of leaving clothes on the rails too long and instigated a model to keep up with the fast pace of change in the fashion world. Women undercover soldiers are few and far between. When Corporal Leah Mates, 30, of the 14 Intelligence Company in Northern Ireland won her case for sexual discrimination last year it became a little clearer why. In Kosovo in 1999, her superior masturbated and called out her name in a tent he shared with her and other male soldiers. &quot;The army is a male preserve and a woman who tries to establish herself does so at the peril of her health and happiness,&quot; she said.

It felt a real privilege to be able to do it. I knew how much my friend wanted to breastfeed, and if I hadn&apos;t stepped in, he would have had formula.&quot; While in the developing world suckling someone else&apos;s baby is commonplace, here we see it as weird - but why? Formula milk has only been available since the early 1900s. Before then wet-nursing would have happened as a matter of course if the mother was ill or absent. In three generations it has become socially unacceptable. None the less, I know women in the UK who have fed each other&apos;s babies, although they acknowledge that they would not necessarily admit to it openly. I have also heard of several circles of parents where it is accepted that if you babysit for someone else&apos;s newborn, it is OK to breastfeed them (with the parents&apos; consent). This informal wet-nursing is called &quot;shared feeding&quot; or &quot;cross-nursing&quot;. And while this has always gone on on quietly in Britain, hiring someone else to breastfeed your child is becoming increasingly popular in Hollywood. Cross-nursing also happens in extreme circumstances. Sarah (not her real name) was contacted by a local breastfeeding support group when a woman with a three-month-old baby was injured in a car crash. She was unconscious and unable to feed. The baby&apos;s father knew that the mother would ideally want to avoid feeding the baby formula so he contacted the organisation to ask for donations of breastmilk. &quot;The first woman who turned up at the hospital to express milk said, &apos;This is a bit ridiculous. I might as well just feed the baby.&apos; The father agreed.&quot; In the end a group of five women wet-nursed the baby for a week until the mother recovered. This example is telling in that it shows that wet-nursing can be a pragmatic solution: it would have been very difficult for the family to feed this baby any other way (the father was also injured and hospitalised and in any case the baby had never taken a bottle or had any formula). It felt very intimate to feed another woman&apos;s child, says Sarah: &quot;It was weird at first. But it was just a baby who needed milk and needed cuddling.&quot; Wet-nursing is now making a comeback in China, after being banned for political reasons for decades. Rich Shanghai families are recruiting rural women as live-in nannies to feed their babies. Given that most well-heeled Chinese women do not work, these nannies-with-extras are more of a status symbol than a necessary accessory to a busy life. Banned under Mao as &quot;decadent&quot; in the post-war period, wet-nursing is a long-standing Chinese tradition: Pu Yi, the Last Emperor, was suckled into his teens. Now, China&apos;s nouveau riche are bringing it back, recruiting pregnant women, who leave their own child-ren at home with their grandparents (these babies then have to be wet-nursed themselves by another local woman). Their sacrifice is rewarded with a salary of up to five times the national average. Perhaps even more intriguing than the actual trend itself is the way it has been reported in the west - with fascination disguised as disgust. One (male) reporter on a British broadsheet claimed with some excitement that these Chinese wet nurses are selected for their &quot;superlative breasts&quot;. This, as any breastfeeding mother knows, is total nonsense - breasts of virtually any condition or size can produce milk. Babies do not give extra marks for beauty. The only breasts that have trouble producing milk (although it is not impossible) are fake ones. And, surprise, surprise, earlier this year a Los Angeles-based agency supplying wet nurses popped up. Certified Household Staffing claims it has on its books several Hollywood celebrities with breast implants who have requested lactating nannies. On its website, &quot;wet nurse&quot; is right next to valet, chauffeur and chef. Company director Robert Feinstock assured me over the phone that, yes, there was a demand, but declined to give any more details. If feeding another woman&apos;s baby seems like the last taboo, it is one that exerts a fascination. (You can imagine what happens if you type the words &quot;wet nurse&quot; into Google: X-rated mammary heaven). In the film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle the moment we &quot;know&quot; that nanny Peyton (Rebecca de Mornay) is genuinely psychopathic is when she pulls her employer&apos;s crying baby out of the cot and puts it to her breast. Perhaps the intimacy of shared feeding enhances the taboo. Rhonda Shaw, a sociologist at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, is author of a study entitled The Virtues of Cross-Nursing - and the Yuk Factor and is researching contemporary cross-nursing practices. We perceive feeding another woman&apos;s child to be somehow indecent, she says: &quot;Adult meanings of eroticism get confused with breastfeeding as a sensual activity.&quot; She recently interviewed two single working mothers who have agreed to share childcare and cross-nurse each other&apos;s babies to fit around their work schedules. &quot;It&apos;s always been practised. It just isn&apos;t reported,&quot; she says. Extraordinarily, there have even been cases where there is an underlying suggestion that wet-nursing is borderline child abuse, says Shaw: &quot;One state in the USA requires people to get a license before they provide someone else, other than their child, with breast milk. There was a case in Oklahoma in 2003 where a woman breastfed someone else&apos;s infant without consent, and faced a $500 [\u00a3257] fine and up to a year in jail on a &apos;morals&apos; charge.&quot; Gabrielle Palmer, lecturer in human nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and author of The Politics of Breastfeeding, finds current attitudes perplexing. Once wet-nursing was so commonplace that Jane Austen mentions it in Emma: &quot;For years it was a really good job for a woman. In 17th- and 18th-century Britain a woman would earn more money as a wet nurse than her husband could as a labourer. And if you were a royal wet nurse you would be honoured for life.&quot; She has personal experience of the practice (her children were born in the 1970s): &quot;I wouldn&apos;t mind another mother feeding my baby - if it was my sister or my best friend that would be fine. In the 1970s, you would get breastfeeding circles within the babysitting circle - you&apos;d ask for somebody lactating. There is an idea that &apos;this is a special relationship&apos; - it is that special bond - but I&apos;d rather a baby had another woman&apos;s milk than formula.&quot; Given the current climate, Palmer advises against anyone telling the authorities they are cross-nursing: &quot;I know adoptive women who have breastfed their [adopted] children and the health authorities have been appalled. Far too many health professionals are hung up about breastfeeding.&quot; The practice is officially frowned on in the UK because HIV can be transferred through breast milk, although, as Shaw puts it, &quot;If a woman knew she was HIV positive I think she would be unlikely to cross nurse someone else&apos;s infant.&quot; (This is a major problem in countries where wet-nursing is culturally acceptable but talking about and testing for HIV is not; in many parts of Africa, for example.) There is no medical reason why women should not lactate indefinitely or feed more than one child simultaneously (known as &quot;tandem feeding&quot; when a mother feeds two siblings of different ages: Palmer estimates that some women would thoeretically be able to feed up to five babies). And there are many historical examples of wet-nursing, says Shaw: Naomi, from the Old Testament, relactated to feed her grandchild so Ruth, the infant&apos;s mother, could go to war after her husband was killed. Both Moses and Mohammed were wet-nursed after they were rescued from the bulrushes. Dr Naomi Baumslag, author of Milk, Money and Madness, wrote a celebration of the legendary wet nurse Judith Waterford: &quot;In 1831, on her 81st birthday, she could still produce breast milk. In her prime she unfailingly produced two quarts [four pints] of breast milk a day.&quot; All our objections to wet-nursing, says Shaw, are cultural: &quot;The exchange of body fluids between different women and children, and the exposure of intimate bodily parts make some people uncomfortable. The hidden subtext of these debates has to do with perceptions of moral decency. Cultures with breast fetishes tend to conflate the sexual and erotic breast with the functional and lactating breast.&quot; I wonder if our attitudes towards the &quot;freakishness&quot; of wet-nursing betray what we really think about breastfeeding itself. We still don&apos;t completely accept it as what it is - natural, normal, instinctive. And no superlative breasts required.", "tags": ["Health", "Life and style", "Society", "Health & wellbeing"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-05T09:37:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jan/06/2", "sentences": ["I believe I once shared a bottle of fizz with your MD over Sri Lankan airspace.&quot; Then the sob story: &quot;Frightfully tricky this DVT business, I managed to pick up a bout of the stuff on an overnight from Shanghai recently."], "title": "How to blag a free upgrade", "article": "After extensive research, we can exclusively reveal that getting flight upgrades is a simple matter of mathematics, as shown in the equation above. The aim is to spruce up your Passenger Name Record (PNR) with a bit of creative Other Significant Information (OSI), ideally alongside a note confirming susceptibility to Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), written by a Friendly General Practitioner (FGP). With all this in the bag, getting a Suitable For Upgrade (SFU) stamp on your boarding pass should be a piece of cake. The key is the point of first contact. When booking your flight at a travel agent, act all Billy Business: &quot;I&apos;m quite the jetsetter you know. I believe I once shared a bottle of fizz with your MD over Sri Lankan airspace.&quot; Then the sob story: &quot;Frightfully tricky this DVT business, I managed to pick up a bout of the stuff on an overnight from Shanghai recently. Here&apos;s my doctor&apos;s note.&quot; Once lulled, the agent will make a note of your status and maladies in the OSI section of the booking. This will pop up on your PNR behind the check-in desk at the airport, and - kazam! - upgrade. We also managed to track down a former air hostess who spent several years working for a major British carrier that may or may not be British Airways. With her insider info we have included a fallback option within the equation. Like me and you, flight staff are real people with real needs such as Mint Imperials and glossy mags. Upon entering the airport, our source would often visit certain retailers to stock up on provisions before the big flight. Said ex-air hostess exclusively revealed to the Guardian that, having chatted to a stranger during a WH Smith Rendezvous (WHSR), she had recommended him for an in-flight upgrade when he happened to be on her plane. If our equation somehow fails, here are some other methods you may wish to use: The suck-up Pick an airline and stick to it. Enrol in their Frequent Flyer Programme on day one. Use their recommended credit card and hotels frequently. Send Christmas cards and round robins. Once the air miles and frequent flyer points have stacked up, cash them in for an upgrade. The career path The most dedicated of blaggers will start planning for free upgrades right after GCSE results. A decent epithet may lead to better legroom. Titles such as Reverend, Doctor, Professor, General, Archduke (etc) are particularly hard to refuse at 20,000 feet. Abstinence is another good one - kids are a guaranteed upgrade-blocker. The numbers game Book yourself on to a predictably busy flight, hoping that it will be overbooked, and then turn up fashionably late, preferably in your best gear. The overbooking will force the airline&apos;s hand: either they put you in first class there and then, or put you on a later flight with an upgrade for the inconvenience. The gate shmooze The airline agents at the boarding gate have more upgrading authority than any other employee. Having arrived at your gate early, approach carefully with open palms, and have a quiet word with the agent well out of earshot of any other passengers. Ask if there are any &quot;aisle seats by the window&quot; available. The recent accident Purchase newspaper, wallpaper adhesive and matted textile from shop. Fashion papier-mache cast and apply to limb. Supplement with crutches if necessary. Make a continuous fuss upon entering airport until boarding plane, accentuating pained moans when in vicinity of airline staff. The high brow Pay the full price on a ticket. Chances of an upgrade are slim to none if you&apos;ve bought your tickets on the cheap 10 minutes ago from cheekychappie.com. If, however, you clearly indicate at check-in that you are a discerning full-pricer, the staff might take pity, and upgrade you from the riff-raff. The visual tool If you ever make it into the hallowed aisles of business or first, guard your stickers with your life. Any attached indication on any luggage that you have previously flown first class may tip the golden scales in your favour. Thrust under check-in staff&apos;s nose. The old favourite Unfortunately check-in staff have become increasingly savvy to the honeymoon shuffle, so beat the competition by bringing documentation. A stamped wedding certificate will do.

And although, admittedly, it is only really a hugely popular tourist destination with visitors from Hong Kong (and in more recent years the newly freed holidaying classes of Shanghai and Beijing), it occurs to me - strolling through Macau&apos;s ancient jumble of narrow streets this bright, sunny morning - that you can&apos;t blame them for keeping quiet about it. Certainly there&apos;s a welcome and surprising orderliness about this tiny former Portuguese enclave, whose central &apos;peninsula&apos; area is one of the most densely populated places on earth. So where is everyone? One or two diminutive street sweepers with brooms are pootling about in their conical hats, and the metal shutters are sleepily going up on the antique shops down here. But it&apos;s now well after 10.  It occurs to me that most of the tourists are probably still in bed, given that the millions of them who arrive on the ferries (which depart every 15 minutes from Hong Kong) are here for a round-the-clock orgy of gambling. If you live nearby and have a bit of money, this is traditionally the place to burn it. In the Sixties, Macau used to be a sort of lurid, oriental Blackpool swarming with Triads, but since the Portuguese handed it back to the Chinese in 1997, everything has been scrubbed and polished, investment has poured in, and vast American-style casino hotels now blast the inky skyline with neon. Other gilded, high-spec palaces mushroom beneath vast structures of bamboo scaffolding. Give it five years, and a bit more colouring-in, and we&apos;ll be looking at Las Vegas with crispy duck and - who knows? - maybe Celine Dion.  But although a third of Macau&apos;s governmental budget comes from betting tax, there are palpable efforts to promote its other attractions, not least the historic old city, which has been miraculously preserved, with a good many of its temples, churches and colonial buildings this year awarded World Heritage status. Signs of life in what headline writers will be pleased to call &apos;the real Macau&apos; are at least evident this morning at the serene and leafy Luis de Camoes garden, where locals come to practise their tai-chi and other mind-soul-and-body workouts. You do have to labour up a hill to get here, but it&apos;s nice to see the gnarled old banyan trees and linger at the bandstand for a necessarily brief moment while somebody wails a heartfelt lament accompanied by a drony instrument with one string. Further along the path a woman stands massaging the air in spiritual fashion while another rubs her nose (no - her own nose) with similar close attention to some inner focus. Seized by the mood, I take off my shoes to walk the Path of Discomfort (as I imagine it&apos;s called) - a steeply inclined trail of cobbles which is supposed to be beneficial for the feet, though perhaps only when you&apos;ve stopped doing it. Afterwards our little group wanders the shady precincts of the Protestant cemetery, established in 1821 by the British East India Company, who bought the plot after some years of not quite knowing how to dispose of their dead employees and other passing (as it were) non-Catholics. With its flowering trees and potted poinsettias this is a nice place to rest, even for those of us still alive. We wend a slow way back down into town beneath raggedy but picturesque tenement blocks whose high-barred balconies sit above the street like birds&apos; cages, festooned with plants and pyjamas hanging out to dry. The shops are open now, selling fruit and wedding dresses and door handles. Gormless schoolboys pass, plugged into iPods. A pair of oldies sit eating in a tiny breakfast bar. A butterfly the size of a bat flits among the municipal pots of flowers that seem to be everywhere. There are seven hills in Macau, so unsurprisingly we are quite soon at the top of another one, gazing upon a classic East-meets-West juxtaposition - a simple Buddhist temple dwarfed at the rear by the ruins of the Jesuit Sao Paulo church, built in 1602 but burnt to the ground after a kitchen fire in 1835, which left nothing but its stone facade and the steps leading up to it. It&apos;s rather magnificent, with its tiers of colonnades and carvings of dragons and angels and skeletons and arcane inscriptions (&apos;Careful with that chip pan, Ignacio ...&apos;).  A few minutes&apos; walk from here we find the Macau museum, where one might while away half an hour looking at miniature tableaux of early settlements featuring 16th-century Portuguese traders exchanging cordial greetings with the indigenous population (&apos;You are welcome to our country!&apos; &apos;Thanks, don&apos;t mind if we do ...&apos;). There&apos;s an interactive thing, too, where by pressing buttons you can learn that the word for &apos;tea&apos; is almost identical in 17 languages, an excellent map of the world drawn in the days when everyone thought Japan was the shape of a loofah and some of those scary-looking masks and puppets that Chinese parents use to make their children respect them in old age. I plug myself into a film about junk-dwellers from the 1950s, all of them wearing lottery winners&apos; smiles. How they must have loved subsistence fishing! Out we come, and head down the hill at the other side, which brings us to the busy main thoroughfare and square, with its church and stately old galleried buildings the colour of mangos and ice cream. It&apos;s the sort of spot you can buy a beer from a kiosk and sit under an umbrella watching the town Christmas tree go up. Huge baubles. After a leisurely spot of dim sum we head for the waterfront. The city doesn&apos;t have too many head-turning monuments, but it does have the world&apos;s 10th tallest tower (233m), which you&apos;re allowed to jump off if you&apos;re completely insane. A small queue duly forms. You have to pay HK$488 (\u00a335), though the price does include being attached to a special cable, which stops you hitting the ground at whatever speed gravity is. It&apos;s quite a drop. There&apos;s a great view of the long ribbony bridges that carry tiny Scalextric roadsters zipping along to Macau&apos;s two southern islands.  The shop up here has photographs of people in mid-fall with a surprised look on their faces, and sells T-shirts with the message: &apos;Why live on the edge when you can jump off?&apos; I&apos;m looking for one that says: &apos;Why live on the edge when you can stay in the lift?&apos; I suppose when it comes to acts of high adventure I&apos;m more of a tea person really, so the very next afternoon, after a hard morning&apos;s traipsing around churches full of suffering life-size Jesuses and prostrating myself with burning incense at the shrines of benevolent local gods, Richard the photographer and I find a perfect former gambling den turned souvenir shop with a woman on the top floor whose job it is to put the kettle on. I&apos;m intrigued by the buckwheat tea, which &apos;cleanses the spleen and removes harmful material in the lungs after too much smoking&apos; (has anyone informed the World Health Organisation?), though in the end I go for a refreshing cup of chrysanthemum. Lovely. Just what I need for my Qi (body air) and Shen (spirit and mind). The nice woman fusses around our table with her little glass cups and wooden tweezers, explaining, I imagine, in her excellent rapid-fire Cantonese why making tea is more important than performing brain surgery.  After that we pop next door, which used to be a pawnshop and still has all the paraphernalia (an abacus, accounts ledgers, scales) from when people used to hock their good winter shoes for the price of a bowl of tripe soup till payday, or perhaps just money to put on a horse. Off we go again, across the street and into the warren of back alleys lined with shops flogging sets of sharks&apos; teeth and pharmacies displaying jars of ginseng and birds&apos; nests and antlers and deer&apos;s penises (ideal for a last-minute stocking-filler). There is a market stall where you can get those malodorous durian fruits, and more than one fast food outlet selling the local almond cookies and processed slices of sugared pork that look like wet floor tiles. Yum. We find a whole street devoted to dried fish, set out in circles on the pavement or hanging from awnings like bunches of staring twigs. &apos;That&apos;s China over there,&apos; Richard says, pointing across the water. Richard is Welsh but lives in Hong Kong. He loves Macau, he says, because of the way they have managed not to ruin it. The new stuff is here but so is the old stuff. Now we trek down to Fisherman&apos;s Wharf - a sort of leisure park sprawling along the waterfront that incorporates an all-new Roman amphitheatre and shops, and has street performers and a place to park your yacht if you have one. Here we stop for a milkshake and have a go on one of the rides. Then, at twilight, a huge artificial volcano erupts, belching fire into the darkening sky. Not far away, the casinos are lighting up too - the old, gaudy Lisboa and the newer, swisher Sands and the Wynn (Steve Wynn is the American mogul who recently stuck an elbow through his own $139m Picasso). We take a walk up there. Outside the Wynn, the fountains are shooting up and down to an aria from Rigoletto while sleek black motors come and go at the entrance. Anyone can wander in and out of these places, so we do. The interiors are gigantic in scale and ridiculously glitzy. And even this early the tables are crammed, floor upon floor of them, although the mood is disappointingly unfrenzied, resembling that resigned air you get from sitting around for hours in a National Express coach station. We know now where everyone has been all day, but what do they see in it?  Having said that, we&apos;re all back here much later, having first taken the precaution of drowning our higher senses in Macau brandy and a hundred bottles of Tsingtao beer, courtesy of the Moonwalker bar, which is still out there somewhere in the dark, pounding the sea with disco beats. But this is now, and though I&apos;m not feeling entirely functional it doesn&apos;t stop me from sitting down and losing HK$400 at blackjack in my first baffling minute. (So what&apos;s HK$400? Fourpence? A pound?) I carry on, tapping the table for another card (I notice even the Chinese can&apos;t be fagged to ask for one properly), and then - bugger me if I don&apos;t start winning it all back again! The dealer is as unimpressed with my howls of delight as with my suddenly sensible decision to cash my chips while I&apos;m ahead, or at least not behind.  This calls for a drink, even though we already seem to be having one. But no, I hear myself say - what about a nightclub? There&apos;s one just a short hop from here, says Danni behind the bar, who is scribbling Chinese instructions on the back of a paper napkin for us. And although, looking around, it turns out there are only two of our number left, I figure that, given the procession of willing taxis and the wild, balmy endlessness of the night and my new-found sense of being on a roll, what could possibly go wrong? Off we go, laughing and, I&apos;m afraid, singing. I think I&apos;m turning Macanese, I really think so. Oh yes. Though obviously I might not be quite up in time for my morning tai-chi. 60-second guide to Macau \u00b7 Macau covers 26 square kilometres of a peninsula and Taipa and Coloane islands, 60km west of Hong Kong. It is Chinese territory but is a &apos;Special Administrative Region&apos;, like Hong Kong. This means it has its own legislature, immigration policies, currency and judiciary. \u00b7 The main attractions include the ruined church of Sao Paulo and the museum of the Fortaleza do Monte fort, which has reconstructions of streets and displays about cricket fighting and religious festivals. Visit some of the temples, including Hong Kung to the west of Sao Paulo. Explore Rua da Felicidade and the Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro, both charming but decaying, plus the old city between Largo do Senado (a bustling shopping area) and the Guia hilltop for a sense of old colonial Macau. The casinos surrounding the Avenida da Amizade are mostly anonymous, in contrast to the gaudy xSands (www.sands.com.mo), the first foreign-owned, Vegas-style casino. Local games include boule (like roulette) and dai-siu (betting on dice). \u00b7 You can reach the other islands by bus as they are connected by bridges. Coloane has good beaches and Taipa village is good for Portuguese and Macanese food, which blends Chinese, Portuguese, Brazilian and Goan influences. \u00b7 See macautourism.gov.mo for more details, and pick up the What&apos;s On newsletter for event listings.

All China basked in the reflected glow; foreigners were barbarians beyond the gilded pale who should not be allowed even to learn the art of speaking and writing Chinese. When I first visited China in the autumn of 2003, such articles of Confucian faith seemed very far away, submerged by the lost wars and the 26 humiliating treaties of the 19th century, subsequent communist revolution and now the economic growth to which Beijing&apos;s motorway rings and Shanghai&apos;s skyline are tribute. This was a new China that had plainly left behind obeisance to the canons of Confucianism and the later cruelties of Mao. More than three years and a book later, I am less convinced. All societies are linked to their past by umbilical cords - some apparent, some hidden. China is no different. Imperial Confucian China and communist China alike depended - and depend - upon the notion of a vastly powerful, infallible centre: either because it was interpreting the will of heaven or, now, of the proletariat. In neither system have human rights, constitutional checks and balances or even forms of democracy figured very much. As a result, China has poor foundations on which to build the subtle network of institutions of accountability necessary to manage the complexities of a modern economy and society. Sooner or later, it is a failing that will have to be addressed. China is both very confident about its recent success and very insecure about its past, a potent mix that breeds a deep-seated xenophobia and shallow arrogance. China&apos;s economy in 2007 will be nearly nine times larger than it was in 1978 when Deng Xiaoping won the power struggle with the Maoists and began his extraordinarily sinuous, gradualist but successful programme of market-based economic reforms, groping for stones to cross the river, as he called it. China is now the fourth largest economy in the world - after the United States, Japan, and Germany - and is set to become the second largest within a decade. More than 150 million workers have moved to China&apos;s booming cities and 400 million people have been removed from poverty. It is a head-spinning achievement. China is the new factor in global politics and economics, and its rulers and people know it. It now has more than $1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, the world&apos;s largest. It is the single most important financier of the United States&apos; enormous trade deficit. It is the world&apos;s second largest importer of oil. Before 2010, it will be the world&apos;s largest exporter of goods. It is, comfortably, the world&apos;s second largest military power. Last year, the Pentagon&apos;s four-yearly defence review stated that China is the power most likely to &apos;field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages&apos;. A new great power is in the making, but one whose pursuit of its self-interest takes the amorality of power to a new plane. It is not just the Chinese who should be concerned about its institutional and moral failings; all of us should be. In China, you can almost smell the new self-confidence: it is in the skyscrapers built in months; it is in the brash and unashamed willingness to rip off and copy Western brands; it is in the well-groomed and inscrutable demeanour of the rich entrepreneurs, self-confident officials and assured academics. I sat in a Beijing bar just over a year ago with a typical member of China&apos;s new class of rich businessmen who double up as members of the party, a combination of commercial and political power that China knew well as the old Confucian mandarinate, now strangely reproducing itself in a new guise after Mao tried to eliminate it forever in the Cultural Revolution. In surprisingly fluent English and with his Mercedes waiting outside, he praised China&apos;s communist regime and its curious mix of capitalism and communism with all the enthusiasm of a Tory businessmen praising Thatcher. Chinese corruption? Think of Enron and party-funding scandals in London, he declaimed. Double standards between communist rhetoric and practice? What about the US and Britain&apos;s invasion of Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay? What I failed to realise, he insisted, betraying both assurance and insecurity, is that China will not surrender again the natural rank that it should never have lost. Western values, institutions and attitudes were being revealed for being straw men, blown away by resurgent China and the pragmatism of its communist leaders. Yet Western values and institutions are not being blown away. The country has made progress to the extent that communism has given up ground and moved towards Western practices, but there are limits to how far the reformers can go without giving up the basis for the party&apos;s political control. Conservatives insist that much further and the capacity to control the country will become irretrievably damaged; that the limit, for example, is being reached in giving both trade unions more autonomy and shareholders more rights. It is the most urgent political debate in China. The tension between reform and conservatism is all around. For example, the party&apos;s commitment now is no longer to building a planned communist economy but a &apos;socialist market&apos; economy. The 26,000 communes in rural China, which were once the vanguard of communism, were swept away by the peasants themselves in just three years between 1979 and 1982, the largest bottom-up act of decollectivisation the world has ever witnessed. Hundreds of millions of peasants are, via long leases, again farming plots held by their ancestors for millenniums. China&apos;s state-owned enterprises no longer provide life-long employment and welfare for their workers as centrepieces of a new communist order; they are autonomous companies largely free to set prices as they choose in an open economy and progressively shedding their social obligations. Equally amazing, China&apos;s communists have declared that the class war is over. The party now claims to represent not just the worker and peasant masses but entrepreneurs and business leaders, whom it welcomes into its ranks. The party refers to this metamorphosis as the &apos;three represents&apos;: meaning that the party today represents &apos;advanced productive forces&apos; (capitalists); &apos;the overwhelming majority&apos; of the Chinese (not just workers and peasants); and &apos;the orientation ... of China&apos;s advanced culture&apos; (religious, political and philosophical traditions other than communism). Party representatives say that the country is no longer pledged to fight capitalism to the death internationally, but, instead, wants to rise peacefully. China has joined the World Trade Organisation and is a judicious member of the United Nations Security Council, using its veto largely in matters that immediately concern it, such as Taiwan. But for all that, it remains communist. The maxims of Marxist-Leninst-Maoist thought have to stand, however much the party tries to stretch the boundaries, because they are the basis for one-party rule. Yet the system so spawned is reaching its limits. For example, China&apos;s state-owned and directed banks cannot carry on channelling hundreds of billions of pounds of peasant savings into the financing of a frenzy of infrastructure and heavy industrial investment. The borrowers habitually pay interest only fitfully, and rarely repay the debt, even as the debt mountain explodes. The financial system is vulnerable to any economic setback. Equally, China is reaching the limits of the capacity to increase its exports, which, in 2007, will surpass $1 trillion, by 25 per cent a year. At this rate of growth, they will reach $5 trillion by 2020 or sooner, representing more than half of today&apos;s world trade. Is that likely? Are there ships and ports on sufficient scale to move such volumes - and will Western markets stay uncomplainingly open? Every year, it is also acquiring $200bn of foreign exchange reserves as it rigs its currency to keep its exports competitive. Can even China insulate its domestic financial system from such fantastic growth in its reserves and stop inflation rising? Already, there are ominous signs that inflationary pressures are increasing. These ills have communist roots. It is the lack of independent scrutiny and accountability that lie behind the massive waste of investment and China&apos;s destruction of its environment alike. The pace of desertification has doubled over 20 years, in a country where 25 per cent of the land area is already desert. Air pollution kills 400,000 people a year prematurely. A hacking cough in the Beijing smog or the stench when the wind comes from the north in Shanghai are reminders of just how far China still has to go. Energy is wasted on an epic scale. But the worst problem is water. One-fifth of China&apos;s 660 cities face extreme water shortages and as many as 90 per cent have problems of water pollution; 500 million rural Chinese still do not have access to safe drinking water. Illegal and rampant polluting, a severe shortage of sewage treatment facilities, and chemical pollutants together continue to degrade China&apos;s waterways. In autumn 2005, two major cities - Harbin and Guangzhou - had their water supplies cut off for days because their river sources had suffered acute chemical spills from state-owned factories. Enterprises are accountable to no one but the Communist party for their actions; there is no network of civil society, plural public institutions and independent media to create pressure for enterprises to become more environmentally efficient. Watchdogs, whistleblowers, independent judges and accountable government are not just good in themselves as custodians of justice; they also keep capitalism honest and efficient and would curb environmental costs that reach an amazing 12 per cent of GDP. As importantly, they are part of the institutional network that constitutes an independent public realm that includes free intellectual inquiry, free trade unions and independent audit. It is this &apos;enlightenment infrastructure&apos; that I regard in both the West and East as the essential underpinning of a healthy society. The individual detained for years without a fair trial is part of the same malign system that prevents a company from expecting to be able to correct a commercial wrong in a court, or have a judgment in its favour implemented, if it were against the party interest. The impact is pernicious. The reason why so few Britons can name a great Chinese brand or company, despite China&apos;s export success, is that there aren&apos;t any. China needs to build them, but doing that in a one-party authoritarian state, where the party second-guesses business strategy for ideological and political ends, is impossible. In any case, nearly three-fifths of its exports and nearly all its hi-tech exports are made by non-Chinese, foreign firms, another expression of China&apos;s weakness. The state still owns the lion&apos;s share of China&apos;s business and what it does not own, it reserves the right to direct politically. Mark Kitto, a former Welsh Guardsman, has found at first-hand how difficult it is to sustain private ownership in China. He built up three Time Out equivalents in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou but, after seven years of successful magazine publishing, learnt last year that he was about to become a partner of the state. The only terms on which his licence to publish could be retained was if he were to accept a de facto takeover from China Intercontinental Press, controlled by China&apos;s State Information Council, the propaganda mouthpiece of the Communist party. It did not matter that he owned the shares, wanted to retain his independence and had been careful to stay within the party&apos;s publishing guidelines. The party now wanted control of his magazines and simply took it. It is an example repeated many times over. China must become a more normal economy, but the party stands in the way. Chinese consumers need to save less and spend more, but consumers with no property rights or welfare system are highly cautious. To give them more confidence means taxing to fund a welfare system and conceding property rights. That will mean creating an empowered middle class who will ask how their tax renminbi are spent. Companies need to be subject to independent accountability if they are to become more efficient, but that means creating independent centres of power. The political implications are obvious. China&apos;s future is shrouded in uncertainty. My belief is that what is unsustainable is not sustained. Change came in the Soviet Union with the fifth generation of leaders after the revolution; the fifth generation of China&apos;s leaders succeed today&apos;s President Hu Jintao in 2012. No political change will happen until after then, but my guess is that sometime in the mid to late 2010s, the growing Chinese middle class will want to hold Chinese officials and politicians to account for how they spend their taxes and for their political choices. What nobody can predict is whether that will produce another Tiananmen, repression and maybe war if China&apos;s communists pick a fight to sustain legitimacy at home or an Eastern European velvet revolution and political freedoms. Either way, China&apos;s route to becoming a world economic power is not going to proceed as a simple extrapolation of current trends. This book has been something of a personal intellectual odyssey. My hypothesis when I began was that China was so different that it could carry on adapting its model, living without democracy or European enlightenment values. I have changed my mind and now see more clearly than ever the kinds of connection I identified in The State We&apos;re In between economic performance and so-called &apos;soft&apos; institutions - how people are educated, how trust relations are established and how accountability is exercised (just to name a few) - are central. They are equally important to a good society and the chance for individual empowerment and self-betterment. Early in my research, I tried out the still-emergent thesis at a small dinner in Lan Na Thai, one of the restaurants in Shanghai&apos;s Ruijin guest house, a complex of refurbished old mansions and traditional pavilions in the French quarter where communist leaders reputedly once ate and slept. Over stir-fried curried chicken and crispy fried flying sea bass, the Chinese guests repeated politely and persuasively that China was making up new economic and political rules. Afterwards, I chanced to have a few words alone with one of the local rising government stars as we walked out of the complex. He kept his eyes on the ground. &apos;Don&apos;t allow yourself to be dissuaded, despite what you have heard. You are right that China is not different. I want my children to see a China with human rights and democratic institutions. And I am not alone.&apos; He jumped into a taxi and was gone. I have often thought about that chance exchange. Britain and the West take our enlightenment inheritance too easily for granted, and do not see how central it is to everything we are, whether technological advance, trust or well-being. We neither cherish it sufficiently nor live by its exacting standards. We share too quickly the criticism of non-Western societies that we are hypocrites. What China has taught me, paradoxically, is the value of the West, and how crucial it is that we practise what we preach. If we don&apos;t, the writing is on the wall - for us and China. China&apos;s quest for oil China&apos;s foreign policy is increasingly driven by the need to feed its growing appetite for oil. General Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the Chinese general staff, has said that China&apos;s energy problem needs to be taken &apos;seriously and dealt with strategically&apos;. That means less reliance on the Middle East; less transportation of oil via sea-lanes policed by the US navy; more capacity for the Chinese navy to protect Chinese tankers; and more oil brought overland by pipeline from central Asia. Over the past two years, China has pulled off a string of strategic oil deals. In April 2005, Petro China and Canadian company Enbridge signed a memorandum to build a $2bn &apos;gateway&apos; pipeline to move oil from Alberta to the Pacific Coast. In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez is to build a Chinese-financed pipeline to the Pacific coast through Colombia, having given China oil and gas exploration rights in 2005. Saudi Arabia surrendered to Chinese courtship in 2004 and accorded exploration rights. In Sudan, a major source of oil, China&apos;s blind eye to human rights and mass murder if it hinders its interests is demonstrated by Zhou Wenzhong&apos;s comment when Deputy Foreign Minister about the situation in Darfur where more than 250,000 have died.&apos;Business is business,&apos; he said. &apos;We try to separate politics from business and, in any case, the internal position of Sudan is an internal affair, and we are not in a position to influence them.&apos; Wrong: China has substantial influence on Sudan if it chose to exercise it. It does not, a commentary on China&apos;s approach to foreign policy and an awesome warning of the future if an unreconstructed China became yet more powerful. Tiananmen: the legacy The image of a single student halting a tank in Tiananmen Square is one of the most arresting in modern history. But the protests spread well beyond Beijing for six weeks in spring 1989 to encompass demonstrations in 181 cities. The party and army were divided over how to respond; 150 officers openly declared that they would not fire on demonstrators after martial law was declared, and at least a third of the central committee wanted to reach a compromise with the protesters. The party&apos;s then general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, proposed a partial meeting of demands for reform. Nobody should be killed. That was not the view of Deng and the party elders - the eight &apos;immortals&apos;, veterans of the Revolution. A &apos;counter-revolutionary&apos; riot had to be suppressed. But before Deng could act, he had to leave Beijing to ensure that army groups 28 and 29, personally loyal to him, would provide the core of the force rather than the uncertain army groups based around the capital. Once in place, Zhao was then brutally deposed, remaining under house arrest until his death in 2005. Martial law was imposed on 19 May and a fortnight later the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square. Official estimates were that 5,000 soldiers and police officers were wounded and 223 killed. Civilian losses - 2,000 wounded and 220 killed - were lower. Many still languish in prison. Tiananmen is the event that cannot be discussed in China; websites mentioning it are blocked. It was no &apos;counter-revolutionary riot&apos; but a demand for freedoms that infected all China and very nearly succeeded. Current leader Hu Jintao and his successors know they are not Deng and cannot command the loyalty of key elements of the army in the same way. Their best strategy is to deliver growth and jobs while trying to keep the lid on China&apos;s growing but still disconnected social protests. Whether the policy will carry on working is the open question asked daily in Beijing&apos;s inner circles. \u00b7 An edited extract from The Writing on the Wall: China and the West in the 21st Century to be published by Little, Brown on 15 January, \u00a320. \u00a9Will Hutton 2007", "tags": ["Business", "China", "Books", "World news", "Culture", "Original writing", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-07T10:56:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jan/07/escape2", "sentences": ["An 11-night tour including a three-night cruise, plus Beijing, Xian and Shanghai, costs \u00a33,099pp, including flights.\u00b7 0845 0700610; www.abercrombiekent.co.uk  SibiuExplore the cafe culture, Gothic arcades and Art Nouveau architecture of Sibiu."], "title": "The fabulous 50 for 2007", "article": "City breaks New YorkTravel to New York in style on new business-class-only airline Silverjet, which starts its Luton to Newark service on 25 January.

It is Little, Brown.    The emergence of China as a $2 trillion economy from such inauspicious beginnings only 25 years ago is such a giddy accomplishment that the temptation to see its success as proof positive of your own prejudices is overwhelming. And the west&apos;s broad prejudice is that China is growing so rapidly because it has abandoned communism and embraced capitalism. China&apos;s own claim - that it is building a very particular economic model around what it describes as a socialist market economy - is dismissed as hogwash, the necessary rhetoric the Communist party must use to disguise what is actually happening. China proves conclusively that liberalisation, privatisation, market freedoms and the embrace of globalisation are the only route to prosperity. China is on its way to capitalism but will not admit it. But the closer you get to what is happening on the ground in China, its so-called capitalism looks nothing like any form of capitalism the west has known and the transition from communism remains fundamentally problematic. The alpha and omega of China&apos;s political economy is that the Communist party remains firmly in the driving seat not just of government, but of the economy - a control that goes into the very marrow of how ownership rights are conceived and business strategies devised. The western conception of the free exercise of property rights and business autonomy that goes with it, essential to any notion of capitalism, does not exist in China. The truth is that China is not the socialist market economy the party describes, nor moving towards capitalism as the western consensus believes. Rather it is frozen in a structure that I describe as Leninist corporatism - and which is unstable, monumentally inefficient, dependent upon the expropriation of peasant savings on a grand scale, colossally unequal and ultimately unsustainable. It is Leninist in that the party still follows Lenin&apos;s dictum of being the vanguard, monopoly political driver and controller of the economy and society. And it is corporatist because the framework for all economic activity in China is one of central management and coordination from which no economic actor, however humble, can opt out. In this environment genuine wholesale privatisation is impossible and liberalisation has well-defined limits, as President Hu Jintao himself brutally reminds us. The party, he says, &quot;takes a dominant role and coordinates all sectors. Party members and party organisations in government departments should be brought into full play so as to realise the party&apos;s leadership over state affairs&quot;. It may be true that party organisations in the provinces (some with populations bigger than Britain&apos;s) and in the chief cities are jealous of their autonomous local political control, but all retain the discretionary power to do what they choose and override any challenge or complaint from any non-state actor - or, indeed, from state actors if they cross the will of the party. Absolute power corrupts, and the Chinese Communist party has become one of the most corrupt organisations the world has ever witnessed. The combination of absolute power and an ideology that palpably no longer describes reality is a virus that is morally and psychologically undermining the regime. And if the regime wobbles, then its capacity to sustain the unsustainable economic structures will wobble and Leninist corporatism will unravel. Beijing&apos;s authority could fragment and China&apos;s provinces reassert their destructive independence as they did in the 1910s and 20s, or a new and fiercely repressive regime could try to hold the country together abandoning economic openness and market reforms - and even pick some international fights (such as invading Taiwan?) to rally the country to its side. It is because this prospect is so real that the task of peacefully moving to a sustainable capitalism, and building the necessary institutions to do it, is so vital for both China and the world. Ever since the late 1990s the party leadership, then under Hu&apos;s predecessor Jiang Zemin, has rightly become more and more preoccupied with how corruption is corroding the party. &quot;If we do not crack down on corruption, the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people will suffer a lot and the party will be in danger of losing its ruling position, or possibly heading for self-destruction,&quot; Jiang declared in 2002, in his last political report to the National Congress. High-level officials had been arrested and imprisoned for embezzlement and racketeering; they included the party secretary and mayor of Beijing, Chen Xitong, a member of the Politburo. Cheng Kejie, vice-chairman of the National People&apos;s Congress, was executed for taking pounds 2.5m in kickbacks for arranging land deals and contracts for private business. In the financial system the highest-profile casualties were three of prime minister Zhu Rongji&apos;s hand-picked &quot;can-do commanders&quot;, selected to sort out the financial crisis of the late 1990s, and one of whom, Li Fuxiang, leaped to his death from the seventh floor of Beijing&apos;s Hospital 304 while under investigation. To put this in a British context, it is as if the Mayor of London, the speaker of the House of Commons, the chief executive of HSBC, along with a deputy governor of the Bank of England and the deputy chief executive of the Financial Services Authority had all been imprisoned for fraud with one committing suicide. For all the strengthening of the anti-corruption and Orwellian sounding &quot;Central Discipline Inspection Committee&quot;, corruption remains deeply embedded. The number of arrests of senior cadres members above the county level quadrupled between 1992 and 2001, and since then have included a ring of officials in Gansu, one of China&apos;s poorest provinces, caught embezzling pounds 500m. Four provincial governors and one provincial party secretary have been charged recently - the top posts in China outside Beijing. And in September 2006 came the arrest of Shanghai party secretary and member of the politburo Chen Liangyu for his involvement in the misappropriation of pounds 206m of social security funds. The Chinese economist Hu Angang, in his trailblazing book Great Transformations in China: Challenges and Opportunities, calculates that over the late 90s the cumulative annual cost of corruption was between 13.3% and 16.9% of GDP and is still around that level today. Every incident of corruption - smuggling, embezzlement, theft, swindling, bribery - arises in the first place from the unchallengeable power of communist officials and the lack of any reliable, independent system of accountability and scrutiny. Corruption has become part of the system&apos;s DNA, now threatening the integrity of the state. To see how, look no further than the combination of one-party control and corruption and how it deforms the legal system. The judicial apparatus is politicised from top to bottom. Every president and vice-president of a court is appointed by the party; and the courts are funded by provincial governments. The court bureaucracy works on the same basis as the rest of the government, with a party committee system superintending each rung of the court hierarchy. Judges often make decisions at the instruction of the committee or government independently of the legal merits of the case. Many judges still have no formal legal training - the majority are retired army officers, only too ready to do the party&apos;s bidding. The scale of the corruption is stunning. In 2003, 794 judges were tried for corruption (out of a national total of 200,000). In 2003 and 2004, the presidents of the provincial high courts of Guangdong and Hunan were both found guilty of corruption. When the party does not or cannot influence the judgment in a case, it can use its influence over the police to decide whether to slow down or not enforce the judgment. Enforcement rates in China are lamentable; for example, only 40% of provincial high court decisions are enforced. The lack of a clear system of property rights, with the party-state claiming particular privileges, can make debt enforcement against state organisations close to impossible. As a potential watchdog to correct any of this, the media is crippled. China now has more than 2,000 newspapers, 2,000 television channels, 9,000 magazines and 450 radio stations, but they are all under the watchful eye of the party in Beijing or provincial propaganda departments. These authorities issue daily instructions on what may and may not be reported; journalists who digress will be suspended from working or even imprisoned. China is estimated to have 42 journalists in prison, the highest number in the world. Editors know roughly how much slack they have; but recently, under Hu Jintao, there has been a tightening of the leash. The right to travel independently and report from a non-local city had allowed more aggressive reporting of corruption; but it has been rescinded. Some prominent editors have been fired. For instance, Yang Bin, editor of China&apos;s most forceful tabloid, the Beijing News, was dismissed in 2005 for reporting village protests against unfair confiscation of land. Other journalists have been prohibited from publishing. The Committee to Protect Journalists, in its 2005 report on repression of the media, quotes the government-run People&apos;s Daily: &quot;[During 2004] censorship agencies permanently shut down 338 publications for printing &apos;internal&apos; information, closed 202 branch offices of newspapers, and punished 73 organisations for illegally &apos;engaging in news activities&apos;.&quot; In February 2006, three of China&apos;s most distinguished elders - Li Rui, a former aide to Mao Zedong, Hu Jiwei, former editor of the People&apos;s Daily, and Zhu Houze, a former party propaganda chief - published a letter condemning the approach: &quot;History demonstrates that only a totalitarian system needs news censorship, out of the delusion that it can keep the public locked in ignorance,&quot; they wrote. Far from ensuring stability, they continued, such media repression would &quot;sow the seeds of disaster&quot;. All this is obvious to western eyes; what is less obvious is the way the same system of control undermines the economy. Successful businesses have to be successful in business terms - with managers freely exploiting opportunities, developing products and brands and promoting on ability. No such autonomy is possible within Leninist corporatism; party needs come before those of business, enforced by a national system of party committees in every enterprise, finance from state-owned banks and a complex system of accounting and ownership rights that leaves majority ownership of most enterprises with the state. Private shareholders have very limited ownership rights; companies&apos; fixed assets are separated out in company accounts and can still only be legally owned by state and public bodies. And as MIT economist Yasheng Huang argues, government shareholders interfere, especially if a firm is successful. Countless Chinese firms, he says, have been driven to bankruptcy or thwarted in their growth ambitions because the government has exercised its ownership privileges to meet party objectives. In short, the party state is at the centre of a spiderweb of control of the economy, radiating out from the tight ownership and direction of the 57 sectors the party considers the economy&apos;s strategic heart like steel and energy to a more relaxed stance the less important the party considers an enterprise&apos;s activity - such as packaging or hairdressing. Even they can be controlled if need be. The general rule is that the more politicised and controlled a Chinese enterprise, the lower its productivity and performance. Thus the performance of China&apos;s State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), which control two-thirds of industrial assets, has hardly improved during 20 years of reform. One in three of their employees is estimated to be structurally idle. SOEs are on a financial edge and barely profitable. According to one influential estimate, even the tiniest upward movement in interest rates or the slightest decline in sales would mean that 40%-60% of their enormous bank debts would not be serviced, rendering the entire Chinese banking system bankrupt. They are commercial and business disaster areas. Even large private companies, although better performing, are still affected. Davin Mackenzie, managing director of iVentures, which is based in Beijing, says that almost no private company, however well run, wants to leave the opaque, informal world of guanxi personal relationships in which the main aim is to hide revenue, cash, and profits from potential political direction. The vast majority, he says, run themselves out of the &quot;cash box in the back of the Mercedes&quot;. Most private Chinese companies have three sets of accounts - one for the banks, one for the tax authorities, and one for management. Most do not last long; the average duration is three years. The law of the jungle prevails: you do what you can get away with. China is the counterfeiters&apos; paradise, where intellectual property rights are neither respected nor enforced. Between 15% and 20% of all well-known brands in China are fake; two-thirds of the imports confiscated by US Customs as fakes were made in China. Counterfeiting is estimated to represent 8% of GDP - eloquent testimony to Chinese business strategies and the ineffectiveness of the legal system. The cumulative result of all this is economic weakness, despite the eye-catching growth figures. Innovation is poor; half of China&apos;s patents come from foreign companies. Its growth depends on huge investment, representing an unsustainable 40% or more of GDP financed by peasant savings. But China now needs $5.4 of extra investment to produce an extra $1 of output, a proportion vastly higher than that in economies such as Britain or the US. But 20 years ago, China needed just $4 to deliver the same result. In other words, an already gravely inefficient economy has become even more inefficient. China&apos;s national accounts tell the same story. Hu Angang calculates that China is now back to the Mao years in term of the inefficiency with which it uses capital to generate growth. Behind all these problems lie Leninist corporatism. Capitalism, I contend, is much more than the profit motive and the freedom to set prices which China&apos;s reforms have permitted. It is a system in which many different actors freely take different decisions according to their best judgment; some are right and some are wrong, but the system never has to bet on any one being right for everyone - as in an authoritarian system of centralised economic control. But this economic pluralism is closely intertwined and dependent upon the wider political capacity of different citizens to be able to be part of a public space in which they can debate options and choices. It is because democracies possess such public spaces that, over decades, even the weakest tend to manage themselves better than authoritarian states. There is less likelihood of group-think, conformism and top-down plans that militate against good decisions - or of the quick reversal of poor decisions. This public sphere is a whole network of &quot;soft&quot; independent processes of scrutiny, justification, transparency and accountability that range from a free media to independent justice. Representative government in which the people regularly vote for their governors is but the coping stone of this structure. And the processes of scrutiny and deliberation do not stop just with the state - the same processes are extended to capitalism and the market economy, and through having to justify themselves, makes them more honest and better performing. But none of this can happen if individuals are not free and capable of being involved - and having the capacity, through the independence that property ownership, education, trade union membership and citizenship confers, freely to challenge and change individual policies, whether they are those of the government or the company they work for. These social processes work best the less social distance there is between people. The more inequality and the more social distance, the less well these processes of pluralism, capabilities and accountability can function. And the less well capitalism then functions. So China leads to an unexpected insight. Capitalism works best the more inequality is capped - and the more and better developed its democratic institutions. The west is unforgivably ignorant about China&apos;s shortcomings and weaknesses, which leads it vastly to exaggerate the extent of the Chinese &quot;threat&quot;. China is certainly emerging as a leading exporter, but essentially it is a sub-contractor to the west. It has not bucked the way globalisation is heavily skewed in favour of the rich developed nations. Its productivity is poor; it lacks international champions; its innovation record is lamentable; it relies far too much on exports and investment to propel its economy. To characterise China as an unstoppable force whose economic model is unbeatable and set to swamp us - the stuff of almost every ministerial and business lobby speech - is to make a first-order mistake. Rather, the west needs to understand the depth of China&apos;s problems and the possibility, if not probability, of an economic and political convulsion as China seeks their resolution. What the west must avoid is a position where it forces the Chinese leaders&apos; hand and China retreats towards economic isolation and freezing the reform process. The challenge to the global trading and financial system would be profound; not only would an important source of global demand be scaled back, a key source of financing the US trade deficit would be removed. China&apos;s progress would be shaken to its core. The interest of the west is to help China avoid this fate and encourage a peaceful transition to a pluralist China within a legitimate system of accountability; a country that is comfortable with liberal globalisation and the international rule of law. To describe the goal of policy in this way is demanding enough; more demanding still is to execute it. The simple extrapolations of China&apos;s growth, predicting that it will eventually become a one-party, economic colossus, lead to an alarmist climate in which it is easier to justify trade protection or, in the United States, potential military activism. Such responses are naive. We have to play it long, encourage and help to co-manage the change that must come. Only thus will the world be a safer and still prosperous place.\u00b7 Will Hutton&apos;s The Writing on the Wall is published on January 18 at pounds 20.

The launch of a Mandarin language website in conjunction with China&apos;s biggest portal, Sina, is part of an intensifying global contest for hearts and wallets that pits the London side against Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. It will soon be followed by the release of a Bollywood film aimed at making Stamford Bridge lovers out of India&apos;s middle-class, as well as a pre-season tour to the United States by Jose Mourinho&apos;s team and an intensified Asia marketing strategy with Adidas and Samsung. With the world&apos;s biggest population and the fastest growing economy, China is seen as having huge potential by football giants such as Manchester United and Real Madrid, both of which have sent teams to tour here in recent years. Apart from lucrative friendlies every two or three years, however, few foreign clubs have made much money here because average incomes are still below \u00a31,000 per year. Two Manchester United-themed restaurants in Chengdu were recently forced to close because customers were not willing to pay extra for the brand. Instead of opening their own outlets, Chelsea - which is neck and neck with Manchester United in terms of popularity, according to market research surveys - will focus their efforts on the internet, grass-roots support and cooperation with the national football association. Their new website partner, Sina, is the most powerful force in the Chinese internet, which has more than 120m users. Sina will translate material from Chelsea&apos;s English website and add comment from a local perspective in return for a share of revenues from advertising, sponsorship, online sales and membership subscriptions. Within a year, it is expected to turn a profit. At its launch, the website featured a video clip of Ashley Cole speaking Mandarin with a cockney accent, still pictures of Frank Lampard kissing his ring finger to celebrate a goal, and a haggard Mourinho reading from an autocue about how much he is looking forward to answering questions from millions of Chinese fans. In the days and months ahead, Chelsea will also announce plans for a first-team tour of China - possibly as early as 2008 - and the hosting of the Chinese Olympic football team at the London club&apos;s training ground later this year. In association with the Asian Football Confederation, Chelsea will also expand a grass-roots coaching programme from the current two cities - Qingdao and Wuhan - to 15, including Beijing and Shanghai. Dong Lu, a leading Chinese football journalist, said Chelsea appealed to younger fans more than Manchester United or Real Madrid. &quot;Their popularity has grown in the past two or three years because of the impressive power of their football. Until now, their fans have been scattered around a number of different bulletin boards. Sina, as the biggest force in the Chinese internet, can bring them together. There is great potential for the two to develop their business.&quot; But despite the emphasis on youth at the website launch ceremony, one older Chelsea supporter also crept out of the woodwork - the British ambassador, William Ehrman, who said he became a Blues fan in 1958.

Classrooms, gyms, studios and church halls are groaning with yoga devotees from Los Angeles to New York, from London to Sydney and more recently from Tokyo to Shanghai and Seoul. Movie stars, models, designers and television personalities have &quot;found&quot; yoga. We read about it endlessly (and inaccurately) in the media, snap up celebrity DVDs and books, go on yoga courses and retreats, not to mention taking it up as a career option (it used to be a vocation) along with the essential props of branded belts, blocks, mats and clothing, an organic diet and an ecologically conscious lifestyle which can be picked up and put down as easily as getting in and out of your 4x4. So ubiquitous is yoga, and in so many forms, that we now have the British Yoga Championships, devotees of which are attempting to get yoga &quot;recognised&quot; as an Olympic sport. And one of the reigning British yoga champions has been doing yoga for only two years. Pushing the Olympic dream forward is the Bikram school of yoga, founded by Bikram Choudry, who was always more of an athlete than an aesthete. His system of the same 26 poses performed in a room heated to 41C was devised originally to restore his own health after a gymnastics accident at 20. Now, thanks to a nine-week teacher-training course and 840 studios world-wide, Bikram is claimed to be the fastest-growing yoga system in the world. So I feel like a grumpy old woman as I clock up not two but 30 years of yoga practice, as well as a teaching qualification that took two years&apos; study of anatomy, philosophy, history and teaching practice. I despair at the idea that we now want to turn a 5,000-year-old spiritual system, seen in the words of the founder of Viniyoga, TKV Desikachar (an Indian guru who is still teaching today) as &quot;the discipline of controlling the mind, rooted in ancient Vedic texts&quot;, into a competition on a par with figure skating and gymnastics. I feel even more depressed to hear that the egregious spread of any number of types of yoga has extended back to India itself, the home of yoga, where fashionable girls in Mumbai are taking it up for the first time because &quot;Madonna does it&quot;. Power yoga classes, the Californian way, seem to have become a platform for both teachers and pupils to show off toned torsos as well as to perform and impress with their fabulous ability to bend and contort the body into ever more demanding positions. What happened to inquiry and the acquisition of wisdom? What happened to the teaching of BKS Iyengar, who suggested that all you need for yoga practice is a mat and some space in the shade? No longer does the aspiring yogi have to choose from acknowledged schools such as Hatha, Iyengar, Sivenanda, Ashtanga or Kundalini - the Bhagavad Gita (regarded as a sacred text by the majority of Hindu traditions) actually names 18 different kinds, each with its own emphasis. Today, due to the proliferation of yoga across the western world, teachers with only a few weeks or years of knowledge are offering a plethora of new permutations, some of which have strayed a very long way from the original systems. Today you can choose from any number of &quot;yoga fusions&quot;, among them power chi yoga (a combination of tai chi and Ashtanga yoga), Sport yoga (aerobics and yoga), Fitcamp Fusion (yoga and pilates), weight loss yoga, disco yoga and laughter yoga (the latest hot trend from Los Angeles) - and that&apos;s not a joke. I could go on. &quot;In the 60s, we didn&apos;t know anything about yoga and we accepted all things oriental with blind faith,&quot; says Peter Blackaby, a distinguished teacher with a practice in Brighton. &quot;But after 40 years yoga has flowered and, yes, diversified and some of it is mad. Absolutely mad.&quot; Indeed, some teachers think that if they throw in some pseudo-science, a bit of Sanskrit, some chanting but little instruction, then that is all right. In one class in LA they even played bagpipe music and I wondered if they thought that it was Indian. And remember the woman who came back from India some years ago practising a yoga that involved not eating, just breathing? &quot;There is such a thing as intelligent yoga,&quot; says Blackaby. &quot;It&apos;s about letting go, unravelling muscles only where you need to. There is nothing mindless or sleepy about it. &quot; For this article, I went recently to a so-called Ashtanga class in central London with a friend who is happily caught up in a passion for yoga. I have been to classes all over the world, in chilly church halls, mouldy basements, Zen gymnasiums, hotel spas as well as on distant beaches and in shaded gardens. I have woken at dawn and driven from London to Oxford for regular classes and workshops. I have tried classes in Thailand, New York, Los Angeles, Paris and Shanghai. I have done days of yoga, three- and five-hour sessions and 40-minute bursts; classes where &quot;gurus to the famous&quot; presided and joss sticks were burned; where there was Sanskrit chanting, mystic breathing, and yogic jumping. I have done classes on my own and classes with up to 100 people. In the Ashtanga class I tried, the pupils were packed in so tightly that the teacher couldn&apos;t possibly see whether we were unravelling or not and she had no assistant. (It appeared to be more about making money than sharing knowledge.) She had what I call an Ashtanga body - taut and defined - and she started the class with an extremely advanced set of breathing exercises that are potentially dangerous. We then progressed to the familiar, tiresome routine of endless down-dogs, up-dogs and chatarangas that seem typical of many of today&apos;s classes; repetitious poses that merely add up to callisthenics with absolutely no attention paid to the very stiff who were trying to go much further than their capabilities allowed. Rarely do I go to a class (except those with my own teacher, Chloe Fremantle) in which upside-down poses (headstand, shoulder stand and variations), let alone a series of thoughtful floor poses (twists and balances), are taught or the individual is considered. It is all about pumping people up, rather than bringing them down into a calm, mindful place - despite ending the session with a bit of chanting (Sanskrit? Hindu? Tibetan?), to add a touch of random spirituality. &quot;In 1976, studying with Iyengar in India, we were told that we were very lucky to be learning yoga because it was something that was only for high-class, spiritual Indians,&quot; says teacher and yoga book author Mary Stewart. &quot;Nowadays yoga has been dumbed down. Publishers demand a &apos;celebrity&apos; on the book or magazine cover even if they don&apos;t know how to do the poses,&quot; she says. &quot;And I was asked to include a 10-minute programme presumably because no one these days is thought to have the attention span to do it for longer. In 1983, I was told that the word yoga could not be used, if the book I was co-writing was to sell in middle America.&quot; Stretch and Relax (the title that was chosen, and her first of six books on yoga) has sold for more than 20 years. Today anyone can write a yoga book and, worse still, sacred chants, costumes and rituals have been ambushed and taken up without conscience. And this is the same yoga that Carl Jung described as &quot;the spiritual achievement of the East, one of the greatest things the human mind has ever created&quot;. What would he say about Geri Halliwell&apos;s video? Would he be disenchanted to know that the desire for money and fame has corrupted Indians as well as westerners, many of whom have played along with what they think westerners want, both in India and, particularly, in guru-friendly California, branding their schools and systems for the rewards of money, status, cars and jewellery. &quot;Beneath the bogus spirituality and superficiality of some of the yoga around,&quot; says Stewart, &quot;there is a yearning among generations all over the world for something deeper and more meaningful.&quot; I agree. Yoga that is about strength and competition misses the point and inevitably ends up with injury and disillusion. Poses should be beneficial, not detrimental, as we strive for balance and the ability to sit and meditate with ease. The practice is about grounding and releasing; it involves effort but not push and struggle. With or without Olympic yoga, there are people who will take yoga onwards and who realise the deep significance and power of its roots. &quot;How can I say what is good and bad?&quot; said the great Iyengar, recently interviewed about the way yoga is going. &quot;People will find what they are looking for.&quot; That seems to say it all. \u00b7 The Spirit of Yoga by Kathy Phillips is published by Cassell Illustrated, priced \u00a314.99", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Health", "Society", "Yoga"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-09T00:04:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/09/football.china", "sentences": ["In association with the Asian Football Confederation, Chelsea will also expand a grassroots coaching programme from the current two cities - Qingdao and Wuhan - to 15, including Beijing and Shanghai."], "title": "Never mind Wembley - Chelsea target 100m Chinese fans in global campaign", "article": "Chelsea Football Club&apos;s plans for world domination came a mouseclick closer to realisation yesterday with a Chinese internet tie-up adding more than 100 million people to the club&apos;s potential fanbase. The launch of a Mandarin language website in conjunction with China&apos;s biggest portal, Sina, is part of an intensifying global contest for hearts and wallets that pits Chelsea against Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus. It will soon be followed by the release of a Bollywood film aimed at making Stamford Bridge lovers out of India&apos;s middle-class, as well as a pre-season tour to the United States by Jose Mourinho&apos;s team and an intensified Asia marketing strategy with Adidas and Samsung. With the world&apos;s biggest population and the fastest growing economy, China is seen as having huge potential by football giants such as Manchester United and Real Madrid, both of which have sent teams to tour here in recent years. Apart from lucrative friendlies every two or three years, however, few foreign clubs have made much money here because average incomes are still below \u00a31,000 per year. Two Manchester United-themed restaurants in Chengdu were recently forced to close because customers were not willing to pay extra for the brand. Instead of opening their own outlets, Chelsea - which are neck and neck with Manchester United in terms of popularity, according to market research surveys - will focus their efforts on the internet, grassroots support and cooperation with the national football association. Their new website partner, Sina, is the most powerful force in the Chinese internet, which has more than 120 million users. Sina will translate material from Chelsea&apos;s English website and add comment from a local perspective in return for a share of revenues from advertising, sponsorship, online sales and membership subscriptions. Within a year, it is expected to turn in a profit. At its launch, the website featured a video clip of Ashley Cole speaking Mandarin with a cockney accent, still pictures of Frank Lampard kissing his ring finger to celebrate a goal, and a haggard Mourinho reading from an autocue about how much he is looking forward to answering questions from millions of Chinese fans. In the days and months ahead, Chelsea will also announce plans for a first-team tour of China - possibly as early as 2008 - and the hosting of the Chinese Olympic football team at the London club&apos;s training ground later this year. In association with the Asian Football Confederation, Chelsea will also expand a grassroots coaching programme from the current two cities - Qingdao and Wuhan - to 15, including Beijing and Shanghai. Dong Lu, a leading Chinese football journalist, said Chelsea appealed to younger fans more than Manchester United or Real Madrid. &quot;Their popularity has grown in the past two or three years because of the impressive power of their football. Until now, their fans have been scattered around a number of different bulletin boards. Sina, as the biggest force in the Chinese internet, can bring them together. There is great potential for the two to develop their business.&quot; But despite the emphasis on youth at the website launch ceremony, one older Chelsea supporter also crept out of the woodwork - the British ambassador, William Ehrman, who said he became a Blues fan in 1958.

State of the nation&apos;s game \u00b7 China qualified for their first World Cup in 2002, leading to predictions that theyb would dominate the sport, but they were knocked out in the first round and failed to qualify for last year&apos;s tournament. Fifa, world football&apos;s governing body, ranks them 84th. \u00b7 A professional football league was launched in 2004, and is known as the Chinese Super League. The number of clubs has fluctuated but 15 competed in the 2006 season, which ended in October with Shandong Luneng celebrating their first title. \u00b7 China&apos;s player of the year, Zheng Zhi, signed for Charlton Athletic on loan this month, becoming the latest export to the British leagues. The most successful is the defender Sun Jihai, who signed for Manchester City in 2002, costing \u00a32m. He has since played 121 times for the club. \u00b7 China will host the Women&apos;s World Cup in September. The women&apos;s team, one of the best in the world, were the losing finalists in the 1999 World Cup and the 1996 Olympics. \u00b7 West Bromwich Albion were the first English team to play in China. They won all their four friendlies before an aggregate audience of nearly 250,000. \u00b7 China is the birthplace of the modern game.

But if you were in Blackpool in the summer of 1934, that&apos;s where you would have found her. It was there that she lost an antique pearl earring which has only now, 77 years later, been discovered lying at the bottom of the Log Flume lake, which lies beneath the Big Dipper. It had been drained in preparation for the building of a new white-knuckle-and-screaming-abdabs ride called Infusion (due to open this summer, for those of you who consider it a holiday season wasted if you don&apos;t revisit your lunch at least once every fun-packed day) and there, in amongst a lot of mud, a glass eye, three sets of false teeth, a bra, a toupee and \u00a385 in loose change was the Blonde Venus&apos;s missing jewellery. Both Dietrich and Blackpool were at the height of their success in 1934 when Leonard Thompson, Pleasure Beach manager at the time, persuaded the star to pay a visit. Alas, for the delightful pictures of the event summoned up by the mind&apos;s eye - and which one would so like to have confirmed as truth - Dietrich feeding deutschmarks and dollars into the slot machine, chomping on toffee apples down the Golden Mile, or disappearing into Gypsy Petulengro&apos;s tent to have her fortune told (&quot;I see you confusing everybody with your strangely androgynous yet unmistakably feminine allure, but you&apos;re no Gracie Field ... ). But it was not so. She took a tour of the resort, gamely gave the Big Dipper a go, saw the illuminations and then went home. Dietrich had made most of what would turn out to be her best films by then, the one on which her legend would come most to depend (The Blue Angel, Morocco, Shanghai Express, Blonde Venus, The Scarlet Empress) and Blackpool was still THE annual holiday destination for thousands upon thousands of workers from the nearby mill towns; years away from the decline that the end of the cotton industry and advent of cheap air travel would bring. There is something quite poignant in the thought of the two famous emblems of escapism being brought together, neither presumably ever envisaging the possibility that they might fall from grace as easily as an earring from a centrifugally strained lobe. Still, let us not dwell on such affecting thoughts. Let us just hope that of the remaining jetsam, the glass eye turns out to be Peter Falk&apos;s, the toupee belonged to John Wayne and the bra was one of Jane Mansfield&apos;s.

Its chairman, Stephen Green, a thoughtful and collegiate executive who is a lay preacher in his spare time, has been accused of being &quot;asleep at the wheel&quot; while analysts and investors are concerned about mistakes in its US operations and an increase in costs of $2.5bn (\u00a31.3bn) over the past two years in its investment banking arm. Even supportive investors admit to being &quot;disappointed&quot; and the performance of the shares highlights the problem. Over three years HSBC&apos;s shares have risen 6% compared with an increase of 27% in the FTSE banking index. Of the major UK banks, only Lloyds TSB has had a more torrid time. Investors hoping for a rising dividend have been let down too. The bank reports in dollars and the weakness in the US currency means UK investors are having to accept a second-quarterly dividend fall even though the dollar amount is unchanged. They are receiving 7.759p for the third quarter compared with the 7.792p the same time last year. Mr Green took over the top job only in May. But he is the one shareholders are looking to for answers. Some of them are talking about the need for changes to the wider HSBC board, which has some 19 members, in part reflecting the bank&apos;s geographic spread. It has operations in around 80 countries and makes only 18% of its profits in the UK. Most of its money - 34% - is made in North America, where the current trading problems are dogging performance. Hong Kong makes up 21%, the rest of Asia 13% and South America - a relatively new market for the bank - 3%. The calls for boardroom reorganisation stem from the changes to the executive team made in May when Mr Green was elevated from chief executive and replaced by Michael Geoghegan, breaching the City&apos;s codes on corporate governance, which rule that the chief executive should not inherit the chair. HSBC, which prides itself on breeding its own management - &quot;we grow our own timber&quot; is a favourite phrase - had always been seen as a prime candidate to make such a move. But one investor said: &quot;Unquestionably it was made clear at the time of the elevation that the shareholders didn&apos;t consider the non-executives to be strong enough.&quot; Though HSBC plays this down, it is making some boardroom changes. Simon Robertson, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has been named as senior independent director, the main sounding board for investors, and three other non-executives are leaving in May. Other long-standing members such as Sir Brian Moffatt and Baroness Dunn are also thought to be nearing the end of their tenure. Mr Green is also letting it be known that he is approaching the chairmanship in a different way to his predecessor, Sir John Bond, the statesman-like banker who now chairs Vodafone. Sir John was the bank&apos;s first chief executive - appointed in 1992 when the group was buying the Midland bank, so the legacy of chief executives at a bank traditionally run by dominant chairmen is short. Mr Green leaves day-to-day management to Mr Geoghegan, putting more of his efforts into big-picture strategy and the ambassadorial hand-shaking that the job of chairing such an international bank entails. The City will be hoping this starts to bolster performance. The current sticking point stems from the acquisition of Household in the US in 2003, when Sir John was chairman. The bank paid \u00a39bn for Household, a specialist in lending to those without the best credit records. It is now known as HSBC Finance and has generated a return on capital invested of 17% a year. But still the City is not convinced. In its recent trading statement, the bank admitted that some mortgages granted only six months ago had turned sour. Mark Thomas, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said: &quot;We want our clients to be well aware of our concerns about the US correspondent mortgage exposure of HSBC ... With 20 years&apos; experience in the business we cannot recall any UK banking group having material credit issues on mortgages originated just six months before. It takes some doing to get it that wrong, especially when the overall market conditions are favourable.&quot; The bank has made management changes in the US. Even so, analysts at ABN Amro and JP Morgan have downgraded their forecasts for the shares on the basis of the problems in the US. The long-running and troublesome efforts to build up the investment bank, first under veteran banker John Studzinski, who has since left, are also perplexing investors. Costs have risen by $2.5bn in this business in the past two years - although revenues have risen by the same amount. Part of the bank&apos;s problem is that its ambition for this operation is not always clear. But it seems HSBC is not trying to replicate the prowess of big Wall Street players such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley but to focus on being a major force in specialist areas such as derivatives and emerging markets currencies. While the new US operations are proving problematic, HSBC&apos;s traditional emerging-markets businesses appear to be performing well and more emphasis may be made of these in coming months. The bank missed out on expansion in eastern Europe in the 1990s, when many others were jumping in, and is now focusing on opportunities in places such as Poland and Russia. One long-standing investor points out that part of HSBC&apos;s problems stem from the fact that the markets have been, on the whole, so benign in the past five years or so. The bank is often regarded as a defensive stock and a good one to hold in a crisis. Mr Green is not taking any criticism personally. &quot;I think we need to make sure our strategy is well formed such that we can succeed over the next 10, 15 years. If you look from 2005 there were only two years back to 1992 when compound annual growth in earnings per share was less than double digits. My job is not to run the bank with one eye focused on the next quarter or half year but to run it for the long term.&quot; He must now hope that shareholders are prepared to be as patient.

Newspapers trumpet soaring share prices, speak of the soft superpower of Bollywood and report gloatingly about companies gobbling up western rivals. The Times of India, the country&apos;s biggest-selling English-language newspaper, has adopted a new slogan: India Poised, Our Time is Now. Despite the hyperbole, what strikes most people when they arrive is the seemingly organised chaos. Cattle roam the capital&apos;s poshest avenues and ragged children beg alongside foreign-made cars and glitzy malls. India&apos;s traditional image is overshadowed by strikingly new ones. Today the country is known for call centres and software companies, blotting out older notions of interminable penury or romantic visions of maharajahs. While jobs are sucked out of Britain and the US to India, the country has gone from begging bowl economy to global giant. But the success of India&apos;s hi-tech sector is still to make an impact on the lives of the 360 million people who live on less than 50p a day. There is little doubt the Indian economy is booming. Growth has averaged 8% since 2003, second only to China. According to investment bank Goldman Sachs, the country&apos;s young population means India has the potential to grow faster than China in the long term. There are few better places to illustrate the changing face of India than Gurgaon, a suburb of Delhi. Ten years ago Gurgaon was a collection of muddy villages with a population of 30,000. Today it is home to more than 600,000 people, many of whom work in multinationals such as Ericsson, Pepsi, GE, Honda, and Nestl\u00e9, who have headquarters in the suburb. A thicket of high-rises and cranes towers over 300 acres of sculpted gardens and Mediterranean-style villas in Gurgaon&apos;s new neighbourhood of Nirvana Country. Prospective owners are offered an Indian dream: houses with air conditioners and Italian marble floors, with 24-hour electricity and water. Fenced-off and privately guarded, the neighbourhood embodies the sanitised charm of western suburban life. It all comes at a cost. House prices in this part of Gurgaon start at 10bn rupees (\u00a3115,000), about 270 times the average Indian&apos;s annual income. This has done little to dampen demand. &quot;When we last offered apartments we sold out all 250 in two hours,&quot; said Vikram Singh, sales manager with Unitech, the real estate company behind Nirvana. &quot;On sales days it is chaos here. We cannot keep up with the buyers.&quot; A notable feature of the new Indian economy is the &quot;reverse brain drain&quot;. More than 40% of Nirvana Country&apos;s housing stock is owned by returnees. Drawn by the money to buy the lifestyle they had overseas, Indians are returning in large numbers. Shiv Dayal, a former banker who worked on Wall Street and in the City, returned last year to start up Langham Capital, a corporate finance house with offices in London, San Francisco and Delhi. The 42-year-old says he moved back home for two reasons: the boom and his children. &quot;We came back because we saw what was happening here and I thought Indian companies would need people to find their way in the world. I also felt personally that I wanted my kids to be Indian, speak the language, have Indian friends. It&apos;s important.&quot; Holy poverty The influence of the returning talent is amplified beyond their numbers. Highly educated and with western cultural perspectives, returning Indians have helped to bury India&apos;s notion of holy poverty. &quot;I think that mindset has completely gone,&quot; said Mr Dayal. Little surprise then that the nation is set to become the world&apos;s fastest wealth creator in the next few years, according to the Boston Consulting Group. In two years there will be 1.1m households with \u00a350,000 in disposal income. The paradox is that poverty abounds in a time of plenty. While a recent study found that one in five teenagers in Delhi are obese, a government report showed that one in three children under three are clinically underweight. India appears not just an underdeveloped society but an unjust one. Ten days ago bulldozers, flanked by riot police, flattened a slum in west Delhi at the request of wealthy residents. Two hundred huts made of bricks and galvanised steel were reduced to rubble in hours. A 12-day-old baby died during the demolition, according to its parents. &quot;The big people do not care for us,&quot; said Puja, the mother of the dead child, whose husband is a construction worker. &quot;We have been here for years and they just wanted to get rid of us to make Delhi look beautiful.&quot; Experts say that the west should not be blinded by India&apos;s poverty figures. Pointing out that the country&apos;s companies have penetrated hi-tech fields such as software and pharmaceuticals, British thinktank Demos warns that London&apos;s &quot;presumed superiority&quot; could breed complacency about India&apos;s potential. The thinkthank says India has 14 million graduates - twice as many as the US - topped up by 2.5 million graduates in science, engineering and IT every year. Yet British companies and universities are doing little to tap the talent pool. Sleepwalking &quot;Britain is sleepwalking out of its special relationship with India because not enough people have woken up to how fast the country is changing,&quot; said Charles Leadbeater, a research associate at Demos and a former Downing Street adviser. Indian executives say that until a few years ago nobody thought India could shake off its slumber. &quot;[Firms] are certainly more respectful now,&quot; said Nandan Nilekani, managing director of Infosys, a software company he helped to found in 1981 with six others and \u00a3200. Infosys this week announced that sales in 2006 would top $3bn and it would spend $300m to create the world&apos;s biggest residential university, with rooms for 13,000 students. &quot;People did not buy the India story back then. Now they do. Indian motor companies will build the $2,000 car, healthcare firms have the $100 hospital operation and Indian banks offer global services at one 10th the cost of western rivals. We are faster, bigger, cheaper.&quot; On the move: Gordon&apos;s world From Mozambique to Mumbai Gordon Brown has clocked up thousands of air miles in recent years as he flies around the world in preparation for his expected premiership. All the trips - apart from the usual International Monetary Fund and EU meetings attended by a chancellor - are designed to underline two key themes: the challenge of new economies in the east and the desperate plight of Africa. The chancellor&apos;s visits in recent years include: \u00b7 January 2005 Visit to Kenya and Tanzania, at the start of Britain&apos;s year-long chairmanship of the G8, where he pledged to help lift Africa out of its &quot;grinding, abject and relentless poverty&quot;. \u00b7 February 2005 First visit to China, which he praised as a &quot;major economic player stabilising the world economy&quot; as he visited the powerhouses of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzen. \u00b7 April 2006 Visit to Mozambique where he pledged to spend \u00a38.5bn over 10 years on primary education in the developing world. \u00b7 May 2006 Africa again, to address a conference in Abuja at the invitation of the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo. He praised Nigeria for its reforms. \u00b7 September 2006 Singapore for annual meeting of IMF and the World Bank in his role as chairman of the IMF&apos;s key policy-making body, the international finance and monetary committee.", "tags": ["World news", "Politics", "India", "Foreign policy", "UK news", "Travel", "India holidays"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-13T00:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/13/centralasiasotherturkmenbas", "sentences": ["Both powers have sought to use the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation - a regional grouping that includes Russia, China, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan - as a vehicle to pressure the US to withdraw its military forces from the region."], "title": "The dictator's legacy", "article": "A dictator&apos;s sudden death almost always triggers political instability. But it is doubly dangerous when it poses a risk of region-wide destabilization and a scramble for influence among the world&apos;s greatest military powers - the United States, Russia, and China. The sudden death in late December of Saparmurat Niyazov, Turkmenistan&apos;s authoritarian president-for-life who declared himself &quot;Turkmenbashi&quot; (Leader of all Turkmens), jeopardizes stability in a country that is an increasingly important supplier of energy to Europe. Worse, given the absence of a clearly designated successor and the weakness of civil society and other political institutions, his death could have repercussions across Central Asia. Indeed, Niyazov&apos;s demise highlights the broader problems of Central Asia&apos;s post-Soviet regimes, which, with the exception of Kyrgyzstan, are run by Soviet-era bosses who, while not nearly as eccentric or egomaniacal as Niyazov, tolerate little dissent or opposition. Most of them are old, some of them are unwell. So, in the next few years, Central Asia will face leadership change on many fronts, with security apparatuses - which, as in Turkmenistan, have been crucial to buttressing these countries&apos; regimes - likely to be important players. How these transitions turn out will matter for several reasons. First, Central Asia is an important source of energy. The Caspian region accounts for 2% to 3% of the world&apos;s known oil resources - about equal to that of North Sea oil. While far smaller than the deposits in Saudi Arabia or Iran, Caspian oil could prove important if oil production falls or is reduced for political reasons elsewhere. Much of this Caspian oil is in Kazakhstan, giving that country a critical role in the regional energy market. Moreover, Kazakhstan&apos;s strategic importance has increased as a result of recent revelations that the country&apos;s Kashagan&gt; oil field will produce 25% more than initially expected at peak production. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are also major exporters of natural gas. Russia depends heavily on Turkmen gas for domestic consumption and export abroad, which could prove vital as demand rises over the next decade. Second, Central Asia&apos;s leadership transitions could tempt outside powers to exploit the resulting instability and spark a struggle for influence. Because the region was part of both the Soviet Union and the Russian empire, President Vladimir Putin&apos;s Kremlin regards it as part of Russia&apos;s natural sphere of influence. Putin&apos;s efforts to transform Russia into a major energy power and use energy as a tool of Russian foreign policy make the region all the more strategically significant. Moreover, China has sought to improve trade and transit ties with Central Asia over the last decade, reflecting its growing interests there. Not only is the region important for meeting China&apos;s growing energy needs, but the Chinese authorities also are concerned about separatist pressures among the Uighur population in Xinjiang province and the impact of ties with Uighurs in neighboring Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Like Russia, China wants a reduction of the US military presence in Central Asia. Both powers have sought to use the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation - a regional grouping that includes Russia, China, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan - as a vehicle to pressure the US to withdraw its military forces from the region. However, this cooperation represents a short-term, tactical marriage of convenience rather than a budding new strategic alliance. In the long run, Russia and China are likely to be rivals for power and influence in Central Asia. Iran could also view the transitions in Central Asia as an opportunity to expand its regional influence, particularly given its close ethnic and cultural ties with Tajikistan and its long border with Turkmenistan. And, like China and Russia, Iran has no desire to see the US fill any security vacuum that could emerge as a result of leadership changes in Central Asia. Pakistan and India - especially the latter - will also watch carefully how the transitions play out. Both countries have growing strategic interests in the region. Like China, India views Central Asia as an important future energy supplier. As a result, India has quietly begun to strengthen its military ties to countries in the region, particularly Tajikistan, where it has a small base. Finally, the transitions in Central Asia could have a strong impact on US interests. As long as the US remains involved militarily in Afghanistan, access to facilities in Central Asia will remain important. With the loss of the use of the base at Karshi-Khanabad in Uzbekistan, access to Manas airfield in Kyrgyzstan has become the main means of re-supplying US troops in Afghanistan from Central Asia. However, the political situation in Kyrgyzstan is far from stable. Discontent with President Kurmanbek Bakiyev&apos;s rule is rising. A leadership change or increased Russian and Chinese pressure on Kyrgyz leaders could precipitate calls for a renegotiation of the agreement regarding access to Manas - or even demands for its termination altogether. In the nineteenth century, the struggle for mastery in Central Asia between the Russian and British empires was called &quot;The Great Game&quot;. Today, there are many more players involved, and the stakes - energy security, above all - are far higher now. America, India, Europe, and Japan will face increasing tension between their short-term military needs in the region and their long-term goal of promoting political reform in order to create more stable and reliable partners. Indeed, the key challenge in the years ahead will be to find the proper balance between these two objectives. Given the prospect of further leadership changes and increasing instability, meeting that challenge has never been more important. \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2006", "tags": ["Turkmenistan", "World news", "Oil", "Energy", "Russia", "US news", "China", "Europe", "South and Central Asia"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-13T10:05:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/13/tennis.australianopen20071", "sentences": ["So much has changed in a year, with Gilbert saying this year&apos;s aim is to finish in the top eight and thereby qualify for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai."], "title": "Australian Open: Buff Murray can play as he likes", "article": "While the AAMI Classic at Kooyong is a notch or two up from the meaningless exhibitions that litter tennis and line the top players&apos; pockets at the back end of every year, this invitational pre-Australian Open showcase is really nothing more than a series of glorified public practice sessions, so it did not cut Andy Murray to the quick that he lost 6-4, 6-4 against Andy Roddick in what was notionally the semi-final yesterday morning. &quot;You go out and play properly but you try things that you might not necessarily do in a match. You&apos;re not playing for ranking points; you&apos;re playing to get ready for next week. So I thought today was OK. I didn&apos;t return as well as I can.&quot; In some respects, he freely admitted, the defeat did Murray a favour because, had he won, the teenager would have played Roger Federer today and that might have adversely affected his confidence before the year&apos;s first major. Murray performed well enough to have Roddick, whom he beat twice last year, in trouble early on but then played far too many wayward points of the sort he will need to eradicate next week if he is not to get dragged into long matches that sap strength and wither mental fortitude in the Australian heat. This first grand slam event of the year often favours those who have worked the most diligently in December; Andre Agassi, who won the title four times, invariably arrived here as fit as a butcher&apos;s dog while players of considerably less calibre have also profited from hard pounding in the winter. In 2003 Germany&apos;s Rainer Sch\u00fcttler, a player of limited talent but great lung capacity, reached the final. If Murray supporters are to believe the stories of his physical efforts in California and Florida under Brad Gilbert&apos;s stern eye, then the 19-year-old Scot may be in a position to inflict real damage. Neither Tim Henman nor Greg Rusedski was ever able to get into the second week and Murray&apos;s inaugural Australian Open last year ended in a first-round defeat against Argentina&apos;s Juan Ignacio Chela. What few knew at the time was that Murray&apos;s relationship with his then coach, Mark Petchey, was already under terminal strain while he himself had not totally shed his junior carapace. So much has changed in a year, with Gilbert saying this year&apos;s aim is to finish in the top eight and thereby qualify for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. Others, a little less close to Murray, have been more circumspect. Frew McMillan, always a wise and calming voice, believes Murray may finish the year around 10th to 12th, although the former doubles maestro is a huge admirer of the Scot&apos;s skills. &quot;It&apos;s just that he has had a mercurial rise and it may take a little longer for the next major breakthrough.&quot; Murray remains confident. &quot;I obviously worked pretty hard in the off-season. I feel quick on the court and I&apos;m not getting tired during points. I feel fast. So yeah, everything feels pretty good. But I&apos;m probably not as match tight as I was going into the US Open.&quot; It will be fascinating to see how he develops. So much of his initial success has stemmed from his remarkable ability to extend rallies and force his opponents into mistakes. Federer, who lost to only Rafael Nadal and Murray last year, may have been short of his best, physically and mentally, in the second round of the Cincinnati Masters when he lost to the Scot but Murray teased him into errors. He mixes up pace and angles beautifully and seemingly has time in abundance. Yet there have been those keen to see him finish rallies off more quickly, principally because of the question marks over his fitness. Now that his stamina appears to be improving there is no reason why Murray should radically change his style. His serve will improve and so will the velocity of his shots but it his variety and subtlety that mark him out as somebody special. He has reminded many of the sublimely skilful Czech player, Miloslav Mecir, who delighted fans in the 1980s with an intricate touch that brought him 13 titles, though never a major. His career was cut short by a back injury, a salutary reminder to all those who believe that Murray may become Britain&apos;s most successful player since Fred Perry, that supreme talent needs good health, something of which Federer, in search of his 10th major title here, is only too aware. Baseline battle awaits a happy 15th seed Andy Murray is hoping his seeding at No15 will allow him to make good progress at the Australian Open. Murray is in the opposite half of the draw to Roger Federer and Andy Roddick but could face Rafael Nadal, the world No2, in the fourth round. He begins against another Spaniard, Alberto Mart\u00edn. &quot;He&apos;s obviously a very fit guy but one of the advantages of getting seeded now is that you don&apos;t have to play one of the highest-ranked guys in the first couple of rounds. I don&apos;t want to say it&apos;s going to be easy. But I feel like I&apos;m stronger physically and better prepared this year and I&apos;ve given myself five or six days to get used to the weather. Every match is tough. I practised with Mart\u00edn once last year in Auckland. I don&apos;t really know him too much off the court. I know his game well; I&apos;ve watched him play quite a lot of times. All the Spaniards are in great shape, so the heat probably won&apos;t be a problem for him and it&apos;s up to me to try to use my all-court game against his baseline game to my advantage.&quot;", "tags": ["Sport", "Tennis", "Australian Open 2007", "Australian Open", "Andy Murray", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-13T23:34:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/13/comment.ethicalliving", "sentences": ["OK, China, I said to myself, as pair after pair disappeared, deep into the compost, build your power stations, and your cars, and see how you like it when Shanghai disappears under oceans of coal-black sewerage."], "title": "Will Duguid: Will our knicker boycott be noticed?", "article": "I know.

And she&apos;s not the only one. Why bother with sustainable potato peelings, people keep asking me, when Blair&apos;s just told everyone to carry on flying? What the hell&apos;s the point? Well, first off, this is quite normal. I felt the same sort of despair a few months back, with news of the Chinese plan for 544 new coal-fired power stations. Is it just me, or is that the single most challenging thing about going green? Just carrying on. You think you&apos;re doing something useful, then something like Blair happens, or you think about Jeremy Clarkson, and suddenly you&apos;re plunged into weeks of self-doubt. Maybe Blair&apos;s got a point, you think, what&apos;s our little 2% share of global emissions? But when going gets tough, the true environmentalist gets going. If the Chinese wanted to do nothing, I thought, then I&apos;d have nothing to do with China. Though I waited until Rowan had left the house before I audited her knicker drawer. OK, China, I said to myself, as pair after pair disappeared, deep into the compost, build your power stations, and your cars, and see how you like it when Shanghai disappears under oceans of coal-black sewerage. But one thing&apos;s for certain: Will Duguid will never eat crispy duck again. Since that day, no label reading &quot;Made in China&quot; has entered our household. And it feels great. So the positive response to Blair&apos;s irresponsibility was to give our own ethics a spring clean. It was Rowan&apos;s idea to challenge his line on flying, by giving it up. &quot;Completely?&quot; I said. &quot;Sometimes you have a duty to spread the message.&quot; So we settled on boycotting China. Not without a few qualms - I&apos;ve always wanted another look at the Terracotta Army - I made sure China was aware of our decision. &quot;Dear Mr Zha Peixin,&quot; I wrote to the ambassador, &quot;This is just to let you know that I have renounced your country. Unless I hear by return, that China will match all forthcoming EU targets for cuts in carbon emissions, neither I, nor my wife and children, will ever fly there again (for work).&quot; And the proof that every little does, in fact, help? They&apos;ve not even tried to dissuade us. Small-scale, maybe, but at times I&apos;ve even been scared by what we&apos;ve done. Can we watch the Olympics? What if an important climate change conference is scheduled in Beijing? Am I crazy? Something tells me I&apos;m not. It may not particularly selfless, or heroic, but gut feeling tells me our China boycott is the right thing to do. Each time I visit Marks &amp; Spencer, and go to an assistant, &quot;I&apos;d buy these underpants if they weren&apos;t made in China,&quot; I feel the start of a ripple effect. What a difference we could make, if all Guardian readers followed suit. But if you&apos;re nervous, why not start, with a boycott on somewhere less ambitious - Belarus, maybe, or the Edgware Road, or more polluted parts of the Adriatic coast? Simply add to your sanctions portfolio as you go along. Just this week, Rowan and I took immediate action against Hamburg, Greater Manchester, and - with some regret - the Galapagos Islands. So that&apos;s two more people who won&apos;t be harassing the iguanas. Impractical, Mr Blair?

Simplee Solar claims your mother did know she was committed to the sale as its contracts include a box where customers sign to confirm that they understand it cannot be cancelled. A director said children often complained to him about parents buying solar panels because they did not want to see their inheritance spent. I do not know how he came to that conclusion. A bug in the system and a well-known scam My cousin in Australia, who was selling her vintage Volkswagen Beetle, got an email from a buyer in London. We agreed he would send me a cheque for \u00a35,000 and I would pass on the money. The cheque was to cover the cost of the car plus shipping, and we were to pay the shipper ourselves via Western Union.  We suspected a scam. The cheque arrived and I banked it on 14 November. Four days later I phoned my bank, HSBC, to ask if it had cleared. The clerk confirmed it had and said the funds were safe to use. On 20 November I transferred the money to my cousin; she gave it to the &apos;shipper&apos;. On 27 November the cheque bounced and I went \u00a33,230 overdrawn. I had no money for rent, fares or groceries. HSBC said I had to wait for the complaint to be investigated, but now says it will take the matter no further.O&apos;SLondon That is unforgivable. HSBC knew it had a tape recording of your conversation with a staff member who wrongly assured you that the money was safe and also failed to follow standard procedure by warning you that the cheque could still be returned unpaid. The scam that takes advantage of cheque-clearing delays is well known in the banking industry and staff should have been more alert. HSBC has now capitulated. It has cancelled the overdraft charges and returned your \u00a35,000 with an extra \u00a3150 to compensate for the stress. Water leak causes customer services to shrink In August I bought a washing machine from Comet for my brother, who finds it difficult to go out himself. The second time he used it, water leaked from it into the flats below his. Comet said someone would be in touch, but no one has been. One neighbour said my brother should claim on his house insurance with Lloyds TSB, but the bankwill not pay out.AJCreditonDevon Your brother&apos;s policy would not pay to repair his flat because he did not have accidental insurance cover. It would have paid for downstairs if he had been at fault, which he was not. Once Comet focused on this, the loss assessor visited him and his neighbours. Comet accepts liability for the machine being wrongly installed and is to pay for repairs to all three flats. It has sent \u00a3100 in gift vouchers to apologise.

Animals enjoy their perpetually iterating present moments if these are pleasant, and endure them more easily if they are unpleasant because they have no expectation that they will continue being so, or might worsen. One can grant that it is a - the? - human tragedy to have memory and foresight in a life of difficulty, but it is relevant to point out that difficult lives tend to be those that remember the wrong things and are not very good at foresight. Present moments are the richer for being freighted with good memories and enticing plans; that is why one imagines that the present moment of a cow chewing its cud in the shade lacks the depth, height and texture of a human equivalent pondering, let us say, a move to Los Angeles on the back of a $250m deal. As with individuals, so with nations. The bovine option is to live in the present moment too much, forgetting to mount a high point periodically in order to survey the way ahead. The major Anglophone nations of the western world, and perhaps their European friends, are currently very distracted by Iraq and the Middle East generally, and by problems over oil and gas supplies both from there and an increasingly Mafia-like Russia intent on using its throttle-like grasp on pipe-lines to hold its neighbours to ransom. In consequence they appear not to notice that the future, which they could visit if they wished, lies on the banks of the Huangpu River, which flows muddily between the Bund and Pudong in China&apos;s business capital, Shanghai. Proof: there was no US presence at last weekend&apos;s meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), which as &quot;Asean plus three&quot; - joined by China, Japan and South Korea, the three biggest players on East Street - met at Cebu as guests of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines. In what is one of the most telling and resonant remarks of this first decade of the century so far, she said, &quot;We are very happy to have China as our Big Brother in this region.&quot; How apt a phrase that is. Everyone knows about China&apos;s spectacular economic success in the last 10 to 15 years, unleashed by Deng Xiaoping&apos;s remark that it does not matter whether a cat is black or white so long as it catches mice, meaning that ideology must no longer stand in the way of China&apos;s economic growth. And it is a good thing that many in China&apos;s development zones have been lifted out of the functional poverty they lived in just 20 or so years ago when this true Great Leap Forward started in earnest. In those days it took many saved-up ration coupons and half a year&apos;s salary to buy one of those sit-up-and-beg Flying Pigeon bicycles on which the underfed Chinese used to ride, in surreal slow motion, in their tens of thousands, down the wide roads of their cities, along which a bus or truck might occasionally pass (with the engine off, coasting, to save fuel). There is nothing wrong with China becoming the world&apos;s economic superpower in the next 50 years; this will assuredly happen. But it does matter if this happens without a significant change in its political arrangements. Economic liberalisation has happened without liberalisation in much else, and this joint fact - surprising to China-watchers who once predicted that the one would lead to the other as surely dawn leads to day - is ominous, because it is consistent with the thesis that a Chinese colleague and I advanced in our jointly written (and pseudonymous - to protect his identity) book written 12 years ago, The Long March to the Fourth of June, which is that the leadership of the Communist party of China desires not just economic but military hegemony, and it does so because it wishes to revive the glory days of China&apos;s brilliant past - the Han or Tang or early Qing dynasty glories, when China was in every sense truly Zhong Guo, the central kingdom of the earth. Fanciful? Well: look at the rapid and dazzling development of China&apos;s military. Its once vast but useless - because poorly equipped and practically untrained - army has been slimmed but potentiated into one of the world&apos;s leading forces. China is a nuclear weapons power, and a major manufacturer and exporter of arms. It is determined not to allow a repetition of its humiliation at the hands of the North Vietnamese in the 1970s, and it is equally determined to have the military muscle to force reintegration of Taiwan, to gain control of the East and South China Seas - the latter as far as and including the Spratly Islands - to control the gas reserves that lie under each. For China is the world&apos;s second fuel-hungriest nation, and speeding towards becoming the hungriest; it is in no mood to allow its supplies to be compromised. It has built deep-water harbours in Pakistan and Bangladesh - with its own labour, note, for security reasons - to maintain oil supplies from the Middle East, and it will defend them if necessary; and so for its African oil-producing client states. As it jets rapidly towards its objectives China likes to keep the rest of the world looking in another direction. It likes the Iraq situation for this reason. It funds delinquent regimes - Zimbabwe is one egregious example - partly to extend its foothold in neglected but future-useful parts of the world (it is a big player in Africa already) and partly to keep the west off-balance with lots of little local fires in problematic regions. Meanwhile, at home the huge interior where poverty still reigns, where farmers still plough with oxen as they did two thousand years ago, there are disturbances, riots, minor rebellions, attacks on police stations, almost every week. The restive, secretive country hides and controls its difficulties, its immense army of deracinated migrant labour, its problems and insecurities, behind a veil of propaganda, censorship, and harsh policing. The speed of industrial development has created environmental damage to China that will take hundreds of billions of dollars and many, many decades to clean up. China is in a pollution crisis, but that is another secret rarely discussed. People die in mining and industrial accidents every day; the pace of development is too quick for health and safety regulations. Another secret that is not so secret is the fact that many western companies in joint ventures with Chinese companies find life hard-going, because of cheating and corruption, because the dice are loaded against them and the goalposts shifted whenever it suits the Chinese. And the &quot;vast potential market&quot; of China is a reality still to materialise, since almost all of its 1.3 billion people are in no position to buy the kinds of goods or services that western countries provide. The western companies operating in China are there to profit (literally) from the cheap labour and services for export back to the west. This is why China owns most of the US debt - in the trillions - and could if it wished switch off the world economy&apos;s lights by calling it in. And by the way, as the Tiananmen Square massacre shows, they are not above cutting off their own noses in certain circumstances, should they think they will save the rest of their face by doing so: as presently constituted they are not a good country to be holding anyone&apos;s debt. Worst is the human rights record in China, and the fact that the west does nothing about it, those dollar bills dangling in front of its glazed eyes. There are 62 capital offences in China, including embezzlement and interpretations of extra-marital sex deemed by the authorities to count as rape. China executes more people in a year than the rest of the world put together. Corneas and kidneys from the executed are said to be used in transplants, and the families of the executed pay for the bullets used. There are millions of prisoners in &quot;administrative detention&quot; (that is, without trial) in the vast gulag of forced labour camps in China&apos;s Qinghai province and elsewhere. Almost everyone reading these words will touch something made in a prison camp in China every week: plastic chopsticks, paper bags, simple things usually. As all the great economies of the world started out by doing, China&apos;s economy depends on slave labour to give it part of its boost; that is why some of its exports - the widgety, plastic things - are so cheap. Yet still China was given WTO membership and is treated as a respectable member of the world community. China maintains a savagely brutal occupation of Tibet, and an oppressive occupation of Xinjiang and Mongolia. Arguably its south-western provinces, home of its &quot;minority peoples&quot;, are occupied lands too. Its irredentism means that it will not rest until it has Taiwan back under Beijing&apos;s control; its sabre-rattling, threats and bullying towards Taiwan are a constant. Recently I was asked to give a short course at a university in Shanghai. Then the invitation was withdrawn by the administrators of the course, because they feared that critical things I had written about China would reflect badly on themselves in the eyes of the authorities. Thus does self-censorship and self-monitoring do the work of repressive regimes for them. Interestingly, the course was in business ethics; had it been in philosophy or the history of ideas it would probably not have been a problem. But business exists under the floodlights there. (And it sure needs some ethics.) China has a brilliant cultural past (more than half obliterated by the current regime&apos;s mad rush to make everywhere look like Manhattan as a signature of modernity), and wonderful people. Look at the Chinese outside the People&apos;s Republic for an indication of what they are like when left alone to be themselves. But while in China itself they are politically squashed under the incubus of a party that dreams of being the US of the future - and without US-style democratic checks and elections and changes of presidency as an at least partial restraint - the future for the rest of us is not so rosy. At very least the world community ought to demand that China observe standards and norms on human rights, political participation, labour practices and environmental protection, as the price of membership among responsible nations. Then we need not be so fearful that even more of a bully is going to take over from the US before the end of this century as the dominating player in world affairs.", "tags": ["China", "Trade unions", "Climate change", "Human rights", "Economics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-16T11:30:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/18/comment.china", "sentences": ["Life in the China of the first half of the 20th century was cheap, as writer Lu Xun wrote after witnessing the nationalists clinically murder students in Shanghai in 1926."], "title": "Will Hutton: Mao was cruel but laid the ground for today's China", "article": "Nobody wants to be an apologist for Mao. Even the Communist party, five years after his death, delivered the verdict that his crimes during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution meant that he had been 30% wrong. Mao was undoubtedly responsible for monstrous crimes, but if today&apos;s China ever completes the transition to a more plural economy and society it will be more obvious than ever that he was the man who partially laid the platform for today&apos;s China. And from this may one day emerge a country with the liberties of the rest of Asia and the west. In the first place, there is context. Life in the China of the first half of the 20th century was cheap, as writer Lu Xun wrote after witnessing the nationalists clinically murder students in Shanghai in 1926. After the imperial throne fell on New Year&apos;s Day 1912, China imploded into territories dominated by warlords over whom the nationalist government never established proper dominion. China was in economic stasis. The Confucian gentry - mandarin officials, landlords and merchants - had so effectively delivered the stability that hundreds of millions of peasants craved, that together they became an obstacle to vitally needed change. The peasants were wedded to obsolete farming techniques on tiny plots; the Confucian gentry were wedded to a system that allowed them to become absentee landlords for around half of China. They continued to run the country at the behest of the warlords, still genuflecting before Confucian maxims that were now hopelessly outdated. Japan&apos;s invasion in 1931 could not be effectively opposed. There was a craving for a decisive rupture with all that had produced this. Radical egalitarianism, a kind of transformed Confucianism, seemed the only way to respond. The Confucian mandarinate had to be broken. The land had to be taken off absentee landlords. Savings had to be mobilised in a collective effort to create a modern industrial base. There seemed no other viable prospectus. Mao gave vent to this ambition. The negative side of the Maoist balance sheet is well-known: mass murder, famine, injustice, and economic waste. But there are less well-known positives. Industrial output climbed 13-fold, albeit from a tiny base. The rail network doubled. Half of Chinese land became irrigated. There was a dramatic lowering of illiteracy. Near universal healthcare was established. Life expectancy rose; and despite Mao&apos;s appetite for imperial-style concubines, women were given the same right to petition for divorce and education as men. Their position was transformed. And if Mao created an economy that while desperate for reform at least existed to be reformed - a statement that could not be made in the hyperinflation of 1949 when the Communists took over - he also bequeathed an ideological legacy that would permit reform. The Maoist communist concept of the so-called mass line meant that ideology and policy would emerge from respecting local differences and conditions. As a result, state planning and collectivisation of agriculture could be reversed more quickly in China than in the Soviet Union, under the guise of respecting local autonomy and creating local responsibility. Deng Xiaoping, the mastermind of the reform programme, was punctilious in describing the first phase of market-led reforms and decollectivisation in these Maoist terms. Few western critics today appreciate the scale of the task confronting any moderniser of China in 1949. Western economies created the surpluses to finance industrialisation through incredible exploitation - of their own working class, and in the US via slavery. It was never likely that China could achieve self-sustaining economic growth without great collective pain to achieve its own surpluses, or that this could be done without the involvement of the state. Spontaneous market-led industrialisation is a myth. This is certainly how Mao saw the task, with egalitarianism and collectivism the means. The German sociologist Max Weber, in a famous essay, argued that statesmen facing these kinds of challenges - of winning a war or of master-minding economic development - have to be judged by different moral criteria. Their decisions are means to achieve this ultimate end, and their choices have to be judged by this criteria rather than their inherent moral worth. Truman, for example, justified dropping the atom bomb on the Japanese because of the value of the ultimate end. Mao would justify his radical egalitarianism in the same way. We know that he was wrong. He, authentically and passionately, did not. Yet that is insufficient excuse. The superiority of liberal democracy over communism is that when politicians take ultimate-end decisions they know they will have to justify them before a wide and critical audience - which means they must have very good arguments to justify them. Truman&apos;s nuking of Japan is still questioned, tribute to the vigour of democracy. Mao only had to justify his decision to himself, or arrest or kill his critics. Even today&apos;s Chinese communists recognise it is an inadequate framework. The condemnation of Mao that convinces the majority of Chinese they need to change has to be more subtle than simply joining, say, Jung Chang and Jon Halliday in their book on Mao and seeing him as unrelievedly evil. Most Chinese are never likely to accept the verdict, not least because it is only a partial version of the truth. The better course is to build on Deng&apos;s description of Mao&apos;s Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution as China&apos;s &quot; treasure&quot;, because they proved that radical egalitarianism was wrong. But the lesson Deng drew - that the party can remain in Leninist control of a market economy that needs no democratic institutions -was as wrong as Mao&apos;s. Today&apos;s China is in many ways going back. The healthcare that covered nearly all of rural China under Mao now covers just 5%. China spends less on education than other developing countries. Inequality is high. The country is sliding down international indices for good governance, corruption and business competitiveness. To return to Mao&apos;s solution to these issues would be wrong and immoral; but neither can China continue as it is. The best option is to embrace democratic institutions - and the path to doing that is not to repudiate Mao but to see him for what he was. Wrong and cruel, but part of China&apos;s groping to find a way to cross the river. \u00b7 Will Hutton&apos;s The Writing on the Wall is published this week at \u00a320; to order a copy for \u00a318 with free UK p&amp;p go to theguardian.com/bookshop or call 0870 836 0875 will.hutton@observer.co.uk", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-18T00:14:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/21/china.features", "sentences": ["But outside the Shanghai Oriental Arts Centre, more than anything else they just look a bit confused.", "wants a piece of the action, though, for the cream of Shanghai society is here, as well as crowds of eager but incredibly well-behaved fans, and celebrities galore: singers from Taiwan in head-to-toe Versace; actresses from Hong Kong in slashed-to-the-thigh Liz Hurley-style numbers; a 14-member boy band consisting of the finalists of the Chinese version of Pop Idol, and great flocks of 6ft models who skitter up the red carpet like nervous gazelles expecting an attack by water buffalo.", "&apos;He is the chairman of Shanghai Media,&apos; whispers Claire.", "A model-turned-PR asks me to guess the worst social crime you can commit in Shanghai.", "But when I start talking to Lu Kun, a couture designer, and ask what he thinks of fashion in Shanghai, he makes a face.", "Then there&apos;s his apartment in Shanghai and his house in Eastbourne.", "You get blase about meeting the super-rich in Shanghai.", "In the taxi back to central Shanghai I start thinking that although the house was expensive, it really wasn&apos;t that different from millions of suburban homes all across America.", "But then, that&apos;s Shanghai: from one angle it all looks quite &apos;normal&apos; - the bars, the shops, the fashionably dressed young folk - and yet from another, it&apos;s anything but.", "With everything that implies: it&apos;s why China has the highest number of mobile-phone users in the world, why western brands are salivating at the riches to come, and why, in every glamorous bar in town, I seem to meet a young girl who refers to herself as a &apos;Shanghai princess&apos;.", "Yuan Yuan, the events organiser with the mobile-phone billionaire friend, is not a Shanghai princess - she&apos;s in her thirties, defiantly independent and single - but she knows Shanghai princesses and rounds up a bunch of them for us, along with a couple of princes.", "Shanghai is building 400 new high-rises a year.", "And they are going to win big.&apos; I give you the Shanghai princes and princesses.", "Instead, I&apos;m trying to build up the first professional photographer&apos;s agency in Shanghai."], "title": "Carole Cadwalladr on the millionaires turning Shanghai into the biggest boom town in history", "article": "The last time the Chinese police really captured the world&apos;s attention was back in 1989, when they appeared on the TV hitting Chinese students over the head with big sticks. They still have the sticks, it turns out, and the ability to look impassive in the face of a large and determined crowd. But outside the Shanghai Oriental Arts Centre, more than anything else they just look a bit confused. There are people waving thick white invitations at them and bunches of flowers. Read any human-rights report on China and sooner or later you&apos;ll see the word &apos;policeman&apos; coupled with words such as &apos;torture&apos; or &apos;brutality&apos;. And yet here they are, a 200-strong battalion, stationed out the front of the China Fashion Awards, ensuring that no celebrity should suffer the indignity of walking more than two yards from their chauffeur-driven limo to the red carpet, and that the footballers&apos; hairdos don&apos;t get drizzled on. Worse, it turns out that the event&apos;s sponsors include OK!. The official role of the cops therefore appears to be to protect the global business interests of Richard Desmond, the founder of OK! and former publisher of Asian Babes, Big Ones and Horny Housewives, titles unlikely to get past the Chinese censors any time soon. Protecting ex-porn barons is one thing in the People&apos;s Republic of China, but possessing pornography is a crime that can result in the Re-education Through Labour Committee sending you to a labour camp for three years. It&apos;s not hard to see why OK! wants a piece of the action, though, for the cream of Shanghai society is here, as well as crowds of eager but incredibly well-behaved fans, and celebrities galore: singers from Taiwan in head-to-toe Versace; actresses from Hong Kong in slashed-to-the-thigh Liz Hurley-style numbers; a 14-member boy band consisting of the finalists of the Chinese version of Pop Idol, and great flocks of 6ft models who skitter up the red carpet like nervous gazelles expecting an attack by water buffalo. Inside, a Jeremy Beadle lookalike from Taiwan with impressively bouffy hair is compering. A 24-year-old from a local English-language magazine, Claire (like all the English-speaking Chinese, she&apos;s taken an English name) translates for me with an increasingly surreal commentary. &apos;She was Chinese Vogue&apos;s first cover star,&apos; she whispers when one of the gazelles walks on stage. &apos;We think she is very ugly. He is very famous because he changes his hairstyle often. That singer in the band - he is deaf. And dumb.&apos; &apos;Is he... popular?&apos; I ask. &apos;Oh yes,&apos; she says. &apos;People love him!&apos; In fact, the show doesn&apos;t require all that much translation. The evening largely consists of a succession of glossy, shiny people coming up on stage, each glossier and shinier than the last, right up until the moment a middle-aged man in a drab suit with bottle-lens glasses and a balding head sweeps into the spotlight. &apos;He is the chairman of Shanghai Media,&apos; whispers Claire. &apos;The government.&apos; He&apos;s so alien, so totally out of place, that I half-expect him to speak in the synthesised electronic tones of R2D2. He&apos;s here to present the Male Fashion Icon of the Year award, and as a man with spiky red hair steps up to accept the prize, they form a tableau vivant: old China meets new China. Can this really be what ex-president Deng Xiaoping meant when he talked about &apos;socialism with Chinese characteristics&apos; almost 30 years ago? When I ask Claire how they decide the winners, she shrugs her shoulders, but it all seems a bit of a stitch-up. Procter &amp; Gamble is another of the sponsors, and although there&apos;s a whole football team from Prada and another from Hermes taking up the front two rows, Brand of the Year goes to Lux, a cheapo soap bar that P&amp;G just happens to make. But the evening is as good an introduction as any to the forces at work in modern China. For a start, there&apos;s the unedifying spectacle of western companies desperately ingratiating themselves with a Chinese audience (China&apos;s economy grew by 10.4 per cent last year, with foreign investment reaching \u00a32.27bn). The Dutch chairman of Unilever goes on stage and thanks the producers for a show that he declares is &apos;so edgy, so groovy and so swinging&apos;. There are whispers among the audience that the awards aren&apos;t totally above board. But I learn later that that&apos;s how business is conducted here, namely by the traditional virtue of guanxi. Or in other words, through elaborate social relationships rather than on merit. There&apos;s also the stark division between rural China, where 900m people live largely in poverty, and urban China - the 400m people who have already made the country the third-largest consumer of luxury goods in the world and by 2015 are predicted to have shopped it into first place. Indeed, the crowd grows restless when a film is shown of some barefoot Chinese children, and only snaps to attention again when some models in short skirts are brought on. And then, finally, there are the brands, the labels, the designer dresses - lots of them. Or as Julien, a Frenchman who works for Prada, sums it up: &apos;It&apos;s all money, money, money. Even two years ago it was normal; now it has gone totally crazy. We have eight stores already, but we are opening more. Dozens more. You have to see these people when they come in to the shop. Oh my God! They carry bags of cash with them! Plastic bags full of cash!&apos; Although it&apos;s not just Julien who tells me this, it&apos;s everybody I meet. A model-turned-PR asks me to guess the worst social crime you can commit in Shanghai. It&apos;s not a very good game, to be honest. &apos;Child abuse?&apos; I hazard. She shakes her head. &apos;No! It is to give someone a fake!&apos; she says, just a little too solemnly. &apos;This is the worst thing! Unforgivable!&apos; And then she wags her finger at me. The real action takes place at the after-party, a glamorous affair held on the 66th floor of the Le Royal Meridien hotel, where the champagne flows and from every window there is another staggering view: skyscrapers upon skyscrapers; neon pinks and greens and yellows whichever way you look - up, down, sideways; and on the river below, vast floating video screens that cruise silently by projecting images of speeding Chevrolets and Jaguars. It&apos;s like Blade Runner: The Cocktail Party, and I&apos;m beginning to see what the chairman of Unilever means. It is so groovy and so edgy and so swinging: we&apos;re 66 floors up a skyscraper in the most successful city of the country with the fastest economic growth in the world. It feels like being at the epicentre of the future. PT Black, the American partner of a company that conducts market research for western firms desperate to crack the secrets of the world&apos;s biggest market, tells me about a recent survey which asked people in 80 countries whether they thought tomorrow would be better than today. &apos;Only three countries in the world answered positively. And by far and away the most positive was China: 83 per cent said yes. People really believe in progress here.&apos; But then how could they not, when the view from the windows is of Pudong? Fifteen years ago it was swamp land; now it&apos;s home to 4m people and headquarters to dozens of international companies. But when I start talking to Lu Kun, a couture designer, and ask what he thinks of fashion in Shanghai, he makes a face. &apos;Not much,&apos; he says. &apos;Everybody is just copying [counterfeiting western designs]. Do you know what the greatest social insult is here?&apos; &apos;Yes! It&apos;s to give someone a fake!&apos; &apos;Exactly! They are buying stuff that is made in China, shipped to Italy, marked up 500 times and then shipped back to China. Where they put the price up again!&apos; I later find out that between 15-20 per cent of all well-known brands in China are fake. But tonight, with a lot of people getting drunk on free champagne, there&apos;s the golden whiff of opportunity in one of the greatest boom towns in history. Only Charlie, it seems, is sober. He&apos;s an advertising exec from Beijing, in his mid-thirties, and the only doomy person in the room. Maybe the entire city. &apos;It&apos;s insane!&apos; he says. &apos;Everything - the money. The poverty. The urbanisation. The exhaustion of our natural resources. These opportunities that are beyond anything that anybody in Europe or America has seen before or will ever see again. It&apos;s mad, if you think about it. But no one is thinking about it, because it&apos;s impossible to hold it all in your head.&apos; It&apos;s 4am, and we&apos;re at the after-party of the after-party in a newly opened private members&apos; club called Volar designed by Philippe Starck. But Charlie has things to get off his chest. &apos;My sister is nine years older than me and she is completely different because she grew up during the Cultural Revolution [1966-1976], and I grew up after it. It&apos;s like we are totally different breeds. She had to go and work in a factory. I cannot even imagine how hard her life has been. And she&apos;s my sister.&apos; Charlie pauses, then says, &apos;There is this overwhelming optimism. But at the heart of us all is this enormous insecurity. Look what happened to our parents. Me? I&apos;m always looking for escape routes.&apos; &apos;Yes,&apos; I say, looking around, thinking that maybe Philippe Starck&apos;s brothel look is not my favourite and wondering how on earth I&apos;m going to get back to my hotel, when Charlie interrupts: &apos;This is what the whole of China is like! It&apos;s like being in a dodgy club! And never knowing if you will be able to get a taxi out!&apos; The next night I&apos;m back on the 66th floor of the Le Royal Meridien for a &apos;private shopping evening&apos; organised by Qeelin, China&apos;s first luxury jewellery brand. The signature piece is a panda pendant, studded with 300 diamonds, on sale for \u00a36,000. One of the shoppers is a man called Joe, who&apos;s in his late twenties and runs the Ferrari club. &apos;It&apos;s for me and my friends. We turn up and drive around places in our Ferraris.&apos; It&apos;s quite equal opportunities, though: they&apos;ll also let you in if you drive a Porsche. He already owns nine cars (a Porsche 911, a Mercedes, a BMW X5, a Mitsubishi Evolution, a Toyota Yaris, a... oh, my pen simply gives out at this point) and is about to buy a Lamborghini. Then there&apos;s his apartment in Shanghai and his house in Eastbourne. Eastbourne? &apos;It&apos;s near where I went to school.&apos; Boarding school, it turns out, for Joe is a member of that other elite club: the first generation of Chinese to have inherited wealth. His father owns several hotels and &apos;around 2,000 apartments&apos;. You get blase about meeting the super-rich in Shanghai. It&apos;s a city of newly made bao fa hu - the &apos;explosively rich&apos;. Yuan Yuan, 32, an events organiser with a PR company, tells us about her friend Steven. &apos;He makes just this one tiny component for Sharp mobile phones. This one,&apos; and she points to the little socket into which the charger plugs. &apos;And he has six factories, and 6,000 employees, and each factory makes RMB2m [renminbi - \u00a3130,000] a month. Each factory! And he doesn&apos;t know what to spend it on.&apos; The next day we go off to the golf academy, where we meet Michael Dickie, a Scottish golf coach, who tells us about a golf club that costs $180,000 to join. &apos;My one is much cheaper - only $100,000.&apos; We take a taxi to go and meet one of his students, 35-year-old Wu Xin, or James, and drive through a scrappy little neighbourhood until suddenly we arrive at Rancho Sante Fe. It&apos;s a private compound with huge villas made of fake adobe and a whole mini-army of private guards. James&apos;s villa has manicured lawns, a deck overlooking the lake, a barbecue pit, an ornamental well and a perfectly groomed labrador retriever called Wang Wang. Ten years ago James had nothing; now not only does he have this house, which he bought for \u00a33m, he&apos;s also bought apartments for his parents, his wife Vina&apos;s parents, his sister and his wife&apos;s sister. And he&apos;s only in his mid-thirties. He built his own chain of clothing stores from the ground up, and now owns an empire that spans China, although these days he&apos;s mostly concentrating on his investments. His son attends the British school and goes horse-riding, and as a family they holiday in Europe, South Africa, Australia and southeast Asia. They&apos;re so friendly and they give us a tour of the house, but there&apos;s a rather unsettling moment when they show us a girl&apos;s bedroom with a doll&apos;s tea set and flowery bedspread. &apos;For a daughter,&apos; says James. &apos;But you don&apos;t have a daughter,&apos; I say. And there&apos;s an uncomfortable pause, as James looks at his wife as if they&apos;ve been found out. &apos;The designer did it,&apos; he says. But then, for all the Wisteria Lane-style decorative features, it&apos;s not America. And Californian style only works up to a point in a country with authoritarian social policies of the one-child-only variety. After the house, we tour the &apos;clubhouse&apos; across the road, with its bar, restaurant, gym and two swimming pools. &apos;Did you have a private swimming pool when you were young?&apos; I ask him jokingly. &apos;We were just so happy if we had something good to eat,&apos; he answers, but less jokingly. In the taxi back to central Shanghai I start thinking that although the house was expensive, it really wasn&apos;t that different from millions of suburban homes all across America. But then, that&apos;s Shanghai: from one angle it all looks quite &apos;normal&apos; - the bars, the shops, the fashionably dressed young folk - and yet from another, it&apos;s anything but. In the business centre of the Shangri La Hotel, not far from the construction site where the tallest skyscraper in the world is being built, I attempt to do a bit of research on the internet, but the server seems to be down. There&apos;s no Wikipedia, no BBC, no New York Times. And only then does the penny drop: I&apos;m behind the great firewall of China. I spend half an hour trying to establish what it is exactly the Chinese government doesn&apos;t want me to know and then, somehow, quite by accident, I slip through an electronic loophole and find an article by someone who&apos;d written something on a chatsite and was taken off to be &apos;re-educated&apos; in a labour camp. The hairs on the back of my neck prickle. I can&apos;t help wondering if there&apos;s somebody watching. But then, of course, there probably is. It&apos;s one thing knowing about the one-child policy in theory, quite another seeing it in action. The present crop of twentysomethings is a demographic freak, a generation consisting predominantly of only children. With everything that implies: it&apos;s why China has the highest number of mobile-phone users in the world, why western brands are salivating at the riches to come, and why, in every glamorous bar in town, I seem to meet a young girl who refers to herself as a &apos;Shanghai princess&apos;. Yuan Yuan, the events organiser with the mobile-phone billionaire friend, is not a Shanghai princess - she&apos;s in her thirties, defiantly independent and single - but she knows Shanghai princesses and rounds up a bunch of them for us, along with a couple of princes. They&apos;re all such polite young things, articulate, interesting, with good jobs at western firms. And encouragingly, only one of them, Tim, is dressed head to toe in designer labels. &apos;Talk me through your outfit, Tim,&apos; I say, and Yuan Yuan translates: &apos;The sunglasses are YSL. The jacket&apos;s Vivienne Westwood. This necklace is Dolce and Gabbana. The bracelet is Cartier. The gold chains are Dior Homme. This is a Gucci bag, Gucci key ring, Gucci belt...&apos; &apos;And how much did it cost?&apos; &apos;The outfit... at least 300,000 RMB. But he doesn&apos;t like the logos, he just likes the style.&apos; (It&apos;s not until later that I check the exchange rate: \u00a320,000! That&apos;s not an outfit, it&apos;s a car.) Finally, I attempt to ask them about politics. &apos;Ask anything you like!&apos; they say. &apos;We are the new generation, we&apos;re allowed to talk about it. Western people think that we are all heavily controlled by the government. But we don&apos;t really feel like that.&apos; &apos;Does anyone ever criticise the government?&apos; I ask, pointing out that they can talk to me with the assurance of strict anonymity. &apos;Of course,&apos; says someone I&apos;ll call Lily. &apos;They say the government is hiding stuff. That they don&apos;t tell the truth.&apos; &apos;And do you agree with this?&apos; &apos;Sometimes,&apos; she says. &apos;Actually, the media is not really controlled by the government,&apos; says &apos;Pete&apos;. &apos;We can get a lot of information over the internet.&apos; &apos;And what about democracy?&apos; I say. &apos;Hmm? Any thoughts on that?&apos; &apos;We can vote for representatives. But our problem in China is that we have too many people. It&apos;s impossible for us to have true democracy. The country is too big,&apos; says George. They could be reading off a script entitled something like Young People in China Don&apos;t Give a Stuff About Politics. But they really don&apos;t. &apos;What about human rights?&apos; I say, a plaintive note rising in my voice. &apos;Like detaining prisoners without trial. Like torture.&apos; &apos;Like Guantanamo?&apos; says George. &apos;America has the same problem as us.&apos; It&apos;s a fair point, but largely a rhetorical one. They really aren&apos;t interested. They were toddlers at the time of Tiananmen - in their experience, Chinese policemen provide security at red-carpet events. And everybody&apos;s getting better off: industrial profits grew by 30 per cent in the first 10 months of last year, investment by 27 per cent in the same period. Total retail sales by 14.3 per cent - in just one month, October. Shanghai is building 400 new high-rises a year. Ten new cities are emerging on the city&apos;s outskirts, each of which will house more than 1m people. It&apos;s hardly surprising that China now consumes 40 per cent of the world&apos;s concrete and 90 per cent of its steel. These are astonishing times, and even among this group of young Burberry wearers you get a glimpse of how far the country has come, how quickly. I chat to one of the girls, idly, while we&apos;re doing the photos. She&apos;s wearing a raspberry cashmere sweater and designer leather boots. Her bag is by Chanel. She loves Chanel, she tells me. She loves shopping. Oh, blah blah, I think, and put down my notepad because, really, there&apos;s only so many conversations about designer handbags you can take. And then she mentions that she was brought up in Xinjiang, in the far, far northwest. Her parents were forcibly relocated there in the Seventies. &apos;They didn&apos;t want to go,&apos; she says. &apos;They were taken there and then left in the middle of the countryside. They had to build their own house. We were miles from anywhere - they wanted to keep us apart from the local people. The nearest village was a two-hour cycle ride away and it had nothing, only a little market.&apos; She lets out a little shiver of horror at the memory: &apos;There was no McDonald&apos;s, no KFC, no shops. There was no Chanel - I didn&apos;t even know about Chanel at the time.&apos; From rural to urban, from poverty to designer cashmere, her transformation has taken just over a decade. She&apos;s gone from grinding rural poverty to a good job with a western computer firm. With her immaculately groomed hair, her manicured nails and her fluent English, she is China in miniature. The economic miracle made flesh. By the end of my trip, I&apos;ve learnt so much about Chinese millionaires and billionaires. But it&apos;s an American woman I meet by chance in a bar who really drives it home. She&apos;s the vice president of the International Finance Corporation, the private investor arm of the World Bank. And when I&apos;m left slightly befuddled by her descriptions of capital markets and corporate governance and investment assets, she puts it very simply for me: &apos;These people are going to win. And they are going to win big.&apos; I give you the Shanghai princes and princesses. The masters of the universe of the future. Or China, as it&apos;s otherwise known. Jin Yuan Yuan, 32, events organiser My mother&apos;s staying with me at the moment, but she didn&apos;t want to come today. She said, &apos;Don&apos;t let them take your picture in public.&apos; This is a result of the Cultural Revolution - she thinks you shouldn&apos;t draw attention to yourself. The Chinese way is to always be in the middle, never say yes or no, always say &apos;maybe&apos;. My parents were teenagers at the start of the Cultural Revolution and as all the universities were closed down, they couldn&apos;t get an education. So when I was old enough, they paid for me to study fashion PR at the London College of Fashion. My father hoped I could come back and help them, but I&apos;m not really interested in the fashion industry. Instead, I&apos;m trying to build up the first professional photographer&apos;s agency in Shanghai. My parents don&apos;t really approve of my lifestyle and there&apos;s this huge generation gap: my mother doesn&apos;t like me wearing make-up and she doesn&apos;t know I drink alcohol. They also worry that things could change again very quickly, just as they did with the Cultural Revolution. They also want to know when I&apos;m going to get married. I have a boyfriend, but it&apos;s not really long term. All my girlfriends are the same - except they have three or four boyfriends at the same time. They never commit to anyone until they marry. They say you have to tell men they have competition otherwise they think you are easy to get. Chen Hang Feng, 32, graphic designer I paint what look like traditional Chinese designs, but up close you can see that the patterns are actually made up from logos - I use the C from Chanel, the Converse star, Lacoste alligator. People aren&apos;t really interested in politics now. You should never believe anything in the papers or on TV, but the taxi drivers know everything. My father and my uncle used to talk about politics all the time, but even they&apos;ve stopped. Money has taken over everything. Qian Cui Fang (Hang&apos;s mother), 58, member of the neighbourhood committee The Cultural Revolution was the greatest disaster of my life. Before the civil war my grandparents had been landlords, so we were considered to be capitalists. I was very good at my studies, but I couldn&apos;t go to university. I was sent out to work in the fields; it was a very hard life. I became a tailor after that. Part of my job now is to enforce the one-child policy. Sometimes pregnant women come from the countryside to my compound, and we have to ring the authorities in the area they are from to see if they have a licence. If they don&apos;t, they are supposed to have an abortion, but it doesn&apos;t always happen. They sometimes run away. Michelle Ma, 35, marketing manager I&apos;ve been to this restaurant - Jade on 36 at the Shangri La Hotel - eight times now. Two years ago I&apos;d never even tasted a glass of wine or eaten western food, but now I&apos;m addicted to fine dining. My boyfriend and I go to restaurants at least once a week, and while many Chinese people probably think I&apos;m mad to spend \u00a3100 on a meal, for me it&apos;s as rewarding as going to the opera or the cinema. My lifestyle is very different to a lot of Chinese girls my age. My cousin, for example, loves to play mah jong and drink tea, just like our parents before us. If I&apos;m going to a restaurant for lunch and a glass of champagne, I would never call her, because I know she wouldn&apos;t enjoy it. We&apos;re very close - in China, cousins are often like sisters - but we are two different types of Chinese women. I hate mah jong. I just think it&apos;s a waste of time. My cousin&apos;s married, but none of my friends are. I&apos;m in the most stable relationship out of any of them. We all have foreign boyfriends. It&apos;s funny, because some of the western men go out with girls we consider really ugly. We have a joke that if you&apos;re so ugly that you can&apos;t get married, go get a western guy.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-21T00:05:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jan/21/flights.escape1", "sentences": ["Until then they cost \u00a3385 return, and there are also discounted flights to Delhi and Mumbai from \u00a3339 return, to Beijing and Shanghai from \u00a3397 return."], "title": "Escape's picks of the week: The flight", "article": "Emirates (0870 243 2222) is to launch flights from Newcastle to Dubai on 1 September, which have \u00a3100 off if you book before 31 March.

It is a blank suburb appended to a series of industrial parks and huge porno warehouses, and divided by the straight, wide roads and soullessly empty streets characteristic of a planned, once brand-new city. The place exactly fits 24 co-creator Joel Surnow&apos;s description of the classic 24 location - desolate, shabby, depressing: &quot;places that aren&apos;t Beverly Hills or the beach, places you&apos;ve never been to ...&quot; 24 is back for its sixth season - it started in the UK on Sky One last night - and everybody&apos;s talking. I meet Surnow on the Wednesday after Fox TV poured a heaping double-double scoop of four episodes, two apiece on Sunday and Monday nights, just to hook us all back into another traumatic day for Kiefer Sutherland&apos;s CTU agent Jack Bauer. Full of the usual white-knuckle mayhem, this season brings the War on Terror home to American shores. &quot;We thought this year to make the terrorist threat smaller and more real,&quot; Surnow tells me when we settle into his unpretentious office, whose primary adornment is a huge flag sent to him by a tank crew serving in Iraq (one of the new 24s is dedicated to a helicopter crew shot down there). Surnow is lean, in his mid-40s, very smart, and good company. &quot;This time we thought, let&apos;s play the projected nightmare - and to its full extent. And that is that the War on Terror is here, in America, it has landed. Now what are we gonna do? And all the questions that you see talked about by the pundits on TV - let&apos;s just bring that into the White House, put those conversations in people&apos;s mouths.&quot; Last time we saw Jack Bauer, he had been kidnapped by the Chinese government and was being shipped off to Shanghai. Season six opens with a radical Islamist-backed bombing campaign unfolding in cities across the nation; with the late President Palmer&apos;s brother now in the White House (the first president with a shaved head and a goatee, incidentally) and negotiating for Bauer&apos;s release; with brutally random racial profiling of Arab-Americans, and Homeland security detention centres springing up everywhere. It is a dauntingly different, but far from implausible future America. What has not changed are the things one loves about 24. The ridiculous techno lingo. Multiple reiterations of the phrases &quot;We don&apos;t have a lot of time&quot; and &quot;patch me through to ...&quot; Chloe O&apos;Brian&apos;s grumpy, &quot;who farted?&quot; grimace (courtesy of Mary Lynn Rajskub, siren of the nerds). The outrageous 180-degree plot twists that are the meat and drink of the serious 24 addict (for example, by episode two this season, Jack is fighting alongside a character who, as Surnow cheerfully acknowledges, is a barely disguised Osama bin Laden looking to make peace with the west). And the hero&apos;s dubious moral choices - murder, torture, anything really - in the pursuit of his nation-saving ends. As for the less familiar (along with new guest stars like Peter McNichol, Powers Boothe and James Cromwell - plus Surnow&apos;s pal Stephen Merchant, who can be spotted as, appropriately, an extra, in episode one), episode four ends with a true shocker which I&apos;ll hint at only with the code words &quot;smoking gun&quot;. These last topics have got the media talking about 24 in far more hostile terms than in the past. On Tuesday several cable news shows (none of them on Fox News, of course) asked whether 24 intentionally exploits a climate of fear in present-day America, and if the show, in some diabolical collaboration with evil old Rupert Murdoch, is peddling torture as a necessary weapon in the war on terror, perhaps to hasten the general public&apos;s acceptance of the practice. Slate, using the headline &quot;One Nation, Under 24&quot;, asked &quot;Can Jack Bauer exist only in a decadent superpower?&quot; It was a very slow news day, but the debate has some purchase on reality, since torture often functions as a kind of money-shot in episodes of 24, and terror is never in short supply. Surnow, who once jokingly described himself as &quot;a right-wing nutjob&quot; (you&apos;d never guess) and made, in October 2006, a $2,000 donation to the doomed and almost comically reactionary Pennsylvanian senator Rick Santorum, finds the accusations ridiculous. &quot;I think a lot of these people haven&apos;t seen the show or bothered to get into it properly, because 24 is so filled with these complexities, that for people to say that it&apos;s liberal or conservative is really missing the point. I mean, we have this character Assad this year who is a terrorist who has renounced terrorism and wants to start the peace process with the west. That&apos;s not left, right or centre, that&apos;s just another interesting approach to terrorism. You could argue every side of it. If wanting to stop terrorism makes you patriotic, then I guess we&apos;re patriotic. But you&apos;re right, it&apos;s a slow news day. It&apos;ll dissipate in a day or two.&quot; As for trafficking in fear? &quot;Certainly we&apos;re trafficking in fear. That&apos;s the point. If the show&apos;s not scary we haven&apos;t succeeded.&quot; Surnow has an idea where the media backlash originated, though. &quot;You know what hurt us, or helped us, or at least brought this up? We did an event at the Heritage Foundation [one of the largest, most powerful rightwing think-tanks] last year. There was a 24 symposium, there was a liberal pundit and a conservative pundit, all given equal time. We were on a panel, &apos;24 and Terrorism&apos;. [Rightwing radio host] Rush Limbaugh was the moderator, and Clarence Thomas&apos;s wife Ginny put the event together. So it had some conservative people behind it, but I think afterwards some people identified the show as somehow shilling for George Bush, which I think is absurd. We have the whole political spectrum both within our show and on the writing staff. This season and last we have stuff that pisses off people on the right. We had a corrupt president last year, racial profiling is an issue this year, and our take could have been written by a liberal. We mainly want to keep the audience off balance. It&apos;s just a story, it has nothing to do with anything.&quot; And the best alibi is the star: son of the star of M*A*S*H, not exactly a fascist tract, and grandson of the first socialist premier of Canada, Tommy Douglas. &quot;Exactly, and get this, Barbra Streisand is a huge fan of the show - and she&apos;s as liberal as they come!&quot;. Other fans include Tina Turner, a slavish addict who has 24 episodes airlifted to her home in Germany by Surnow, and sends lavish Christmas gifts in return. Surnow&apos;s take on torture in the show, and in the war on terror, is a little more controversial. &quot;I think torture does work. It would work on me! I believe torture has been around since the beginning of time because it works. I just think that for any person in the circumstances that Jack Bauer is in, you&apos;d be a fool not to. If someone&apos;s family was going to be killed in 10 minutes unless you tortured something out of somebody, they would do it. A lot of these experts, people in the human rights field, will tell you it doesn&apos;t work, it may not work, that there may be more humane ways to get information out of people, and I believe that, but in our show, if you have 10 minutes to stop a nuclear bomb, tell me what you&apos;re going to do. I mean, it&apos;s unrealistic, and it&apos;s not how the world works, but we&apos;re not purporting to be the world, and we&apos;re creating our own little world. And we&apos;re not saying it&apos;s good, bad or whatever. We&apos;re saying, tell me what you would do. I would bet there are a lot of soldiers fighting wars, on all sides, in all sorts of conflicts, under pressure when the bullets are flying and wanting information, who do all sorts of things. And I don&apos;t want to know about it. I just want to be safe. We&apos;re just exposing a little of what maybe does happen. The military hates it. People call us a conservative show, but the military will tell you they never use it. We use it as a last resort.&quot; Right now, Surnow, his co-creator Robert Cochran and the writing team are writing episode 19 - with no idea as yet how the show will wrap up this season. They work a merciless schedule, necessitated by 24&apos;s pioneering non-stop format (other shows have two-month-long hiatuses per season, 24 runs for 24 consecutive weeks). After writing the four-episode block already aired, they had no idea what would be happening by episode six. If the writers aren&apos;t perpetually surprising themselves, says Surnow, how can they expect to keep surprising the fans? &quot;I don&apos;t know how we&apos;ll get Jack back in a good place so we can pull the rug out from under him all over again - but we&apos;ll try! It&apos;s brutal, it&apos;s rough. 18 scripts from July to January, six from January to June. So it starts to feel about now that we have the ending in sight - even though, of course, we don&apos;t know the ending.&quot;", "tags": ["Television industry", "Media", "Torture"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-22T07:21:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jan/22/thegreaterspottedballard", "sentences": ["When songwriters borrow Ballard, it&apos;s never Empire of the Sun, his Spielberg-filmed memoir of a childhood in Japanese-occupied Shanghai."], "title": "The greater-spotted Ballard", "article": "Nu rave wunderkinder, the Klaxons Here&apos;s a game you can play with Klaxons&apos; much-ballyhooed (and genuinely rather ace) debut album when it comes out in a week&apos;s time: spot the literary namedrop. So far, I&apos;ve found Crowley (Magick), Burroughs (Atlantis to Interzone), Pynchon (Gravity&apos;s Rainbow) and Proust (the line &quot;In search of lost time&quot;), but the most important reference is the one in the title. Myths of the Near Future takes its name from a short story collection by JG Ballard. When it comes to authors in pop, you can&apos;t beat Ballard. Sure, Steinbeck inspired a Springsteen album or two, Camus prompted the Cure&apos;s Killing An Arab and Bulgakov led Mick Jagger to write Sympathy for the Devil, but those are isolated cases. Only Bukowski gets around as much, influencing songs by Tom Waits, U2, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and silly old Razorlight. (OK, maybe Burroughs too, but he made records himself, which is cheating.) In a sense, Bukowski is Ballard&apos;s polar opposite. While his two-fisted barfly philosophising is stained with booze and phlegm, Ballard&apos;s spotless prose is steel and glass. When songwriters borrow Ballard, it&apos;s never Empire of the Sun, his Spielberg-filmed memoir of a childhood in Japanese-occupied Shanghai. Usually, it&apos;s the early experimental fiction or the trio of mid-70s works, Crash, Concrete Island and High Rise. These are the works that inspired the adjective Ballardian, full of malfunctioning cities, maddening information overload and deadening social isolation. Like two other pop set texts - A Clockwork Orange and Nineteen Eighty-Four - his books imagine dystopias that aren&apos;t as far-fetched as the reader might like. Bowie was the first to channel the auto-accident erotica of Crash on his Low album. (Bowie also lifted from Burroughs and Crowley so maybe Klaxons are simply attending the Thin White Duke&apos;s book group.) His enthusiasm anticipated Ballard&apos;s installment as the unofficial prophet of post-punk. Need to evoke the soulless modernity of the urban sprawl? JG&apos;s your man. The Normal&apos;s Warm Leatherette was an explicit homage to Crash&apos;s morbid mating rituals: &quot;The handbrake penetrates your thigh/Quick, let&apos;s make love before you die.&quot; Joy Division named a song after 1969&apos;s The Atrocity Exhibition, although Ian Curtis always claimed he wrote the lyrics before he read the book, and only pinched the title. The short story The Sound-Sweep was indirectly responsible for the Buggles&apos; hit Video Killed The Radio Star, the first video ever played on MTV. Members of Cabaret Voltaire, the Human League, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Ultravox were also fans, this being the era of conspicuous reading, when a battered Penguin Classic in your pocket was an essential accessory. In pop terms, Ballard fell out of favour as the 80s progressed and made only a brief reappearance in the 90s, causing Suede&apos;s Brett Anderson to flap endlessly about tower blocks and nuclear skies, and peeping out from the dark corners of such electronic dystopias as Future Sound of London&apos;s Dead Cities (not a record that has dated well, but never mind). Perhaps Klaxons are trying to revive post-punk&apos;s ostentatious I-read-books-you-know intellectualism, but it&apos;s hard to discern Ballard&apos;s DNA in their glowsticks-aloft optimism. His true disciples can be found on the dubstep scene. Burial&apos;s &quot;underwater-London&quot; conceit might have been based on 1962&apos;s The Drowned World, a once-outlandish prophecy made disturbingly credible by climate change, and Kode9&apos;s Memories of the Future album is up to its eyeballs in JG. You can trace every filament of his influence on the excellent website Ballardian: the World of JG Ballard. What the 76-year-old author himself makes of all this is unclear. By all accounts, his own taste in music is disappointingly bland. But his ideas will continue to echo through pop, one way or another. His books articulate a fascinated fear of modernity - the haunting suspicion that all our wonderful inventions will eventually destroy us - and that will never go away.", "tags": ["Books"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-22T11:14:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/24/comment.politics", "sentences": ["This is six times the prevalence of Shanghai or Nigeria, a huge discrepancy."], "title": "Oliver James: Infected by affluenza", "article": "Let&apos;s stop the pretending: Blatcherism has been an inexcusable missed opportunity to take Britain in a completely different direction (towards Denmark rather than America) and it has significantly contributed to our spiralling rate of mental illness. I have discovered that citizens of English-speaking nations are twice as likely to suffer mental illness as ones from mainland western Europe. Specifically, my analysis reveals that over a 12-month period nearly one-quarter (23%) of English speakers suffered, compared with 11.5% of mainland western Europeans. What explains such a massive difference? It is extremely unlikely to be genes - English-speakers largely come from the same gene pool as Europeans. Indeed, the World Health Organisation study of mental illness in 15 nations, on which my analysis is based, strongly implies that genes play little or no part in explaining national differences in mental illness, and that among developed nations economic inequality is highly significant. The US is by some margin the most mentally ill nation, with 26.4% having suffered in those 12 months. This is six times the prevalence of Shanghai or Nigeria, a huge discrepancy. Again, genes do not explain it - studies show that when Nigerians move to America, within a few generations they develop American prevalences. It is looking increasingly likely that major flaws in studies of identical twins - on which the genetic case has wholly rested until recently - have led to a large exaggeration of the role of genes. Molecular genetics (direct studies of DNA) has disproved the idea that there are single genes for almost any mental illnesses and may eventually prove that genes play little role at all. It is selfish capitalism which largely explains the greater prevalence among English-speaking nations. By this I mean a form of political economy that has four core characteristics: judging a business&apos;s success almost exclusively by share price; privatisation of public utilities; minimal regulation of business, suppression of unions and very low taxation for the rich, resulting in massive economic inequality; the ideology that consumption and market forces can meet human needs of almost every kind. America is the apotheosis of selfish capitalism, Denmark of the unselfish variety. Selfish capitalism causes mental illness by spawning materialism, or, as I put it, the affluenza virus - placing a high value on money, possessions, appearances (social and physical) and fame. English-speaking nations are more infected with the virus than mainland western European ones. Studies in many nations prove that people who strongly subscribe to virus values are at significantly greater risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorder. Follow the logic? Selfish capitalism infects populations with affluenza; it fosters mental illness; English-speaking nations are more selfish capitalist - ergo, more prone to illness. In 1997 we trusted that Blair was only pretending to be Blatcher. Most of us signed up to his selfish capitalist manifesto thinking that it would really be unselfish - that the third way bullshit was really code for this. Alas, it was not. Yes, there has been much more spent on education and health than the Tories would have done. But private companies now own many of the buildings, and criminal rates of interest and privatisation are the real goal. The only thing about which I am totally convinced is the reduction in child poverty. Otherwise, Blatcher and Thatcher have been indistinguishable. The net consequence for true Labour voters has been to force us to become more or less severely virus-infected. Above all, the clamping on of nosepegs to vote for these closet selfish capitalists has been incredibly harmful to our mental health, making self-contradictory frauds of too many. Doctors, teachers and public service workers have had to pretend that money is more important than patients or pupils - as it all too manifestly is to Blatcher and his acolytes, personally and politically. For Brown to get me out on polling day, a major apologia will be required: &quot;I am terribly sorry. I promise not to perpetuate the Nouveau (riche) Labour catastrophe for another day.

The two have met 13 times, with the Swiss having won 12, including two Wimbledon finals and the final of last year&apos;s US Open. Yet Roddick, under the tutelage of Jimmy Connors, is currently playing some exceptional tennis. The hang-dog slope from baseline to chair has gone and the old Roddick strut has returned. In the first of the quarter-finals here he demolished his fellow American Mardy Fish 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 and might as well have been shooting fish in a barrel. Connors, who won the Australian Open 33 years ago, one of his eight grand slam titles, has managed a makeover on Roddick and, if the ugly duckling is not yet a sleek and gliding swan, it is a vast improvement. The power is undiminished but the rallies have become more cerebral and the backhand no longer simply gets the ball back. Roddick is volleying with something resembling competence and occasionally brilliance. All this means that Federer will have more of a challenge on his hands as he strives for his third title here and his 10th major title in total. Roddick had a match point against him during last year&apos;s end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai and beat him just before the Australian Open, albeit in an exhibition match at Kooyong. Federer, in windy conditions, was not entirely at his best in his quarter-final against the world No6, Tommy Robredo of Spain, though the time he spent at the net, much more than usual, suggests that this may be his tactic against the American. Who but Federer of the current top players could use a grand slam quarter-final for practice? &quot;I&apos;ve said for the past probably five or six months the gap has either been closing a little bit or Roger hasn&apos;t been extending it,&quot; said Roddick. &quot;I don&apos;t feel like you can sit back and let him create. I think that&apos;s when you get in trouble. I&apos;m going to have to go with what I do well and try to attack him, at least make him come up with shots from uncomfortable positions.&quot; It might be said of this year&apos;s Australian Open that the women&apos;s tournament will not be over until the fat lady loses and Serena Williams duly defied all tenets of sporting logic when she reached the semi-finals with a three-set victory over Israel&apos;s Shahar Peer. Williams, playing in only her sixth tournament in 13 months, should not be able to play tennis of such a high standard given her overall size and fitness. Several times during the first set, which Williams lost 6-3, her mother and coach, Oracene, shook her head in despair at her daughter&apos;s lumbering efforts to reach the ball. Yet Williams, the winner of seven grand slam titles, is such a formidable competitor that she is still able to defy the rules that apply to lesser mortals and took the next two sets 6-2, 8-6. Next up in her formidable hitting zone is the 17-year-old Czech, Nicole Vaidisova, already a top-10 player, and capable of halting Serena&apos;s run should she not be constricted by her reputation.

Todd Thomson, long viewed as a possible future chief executive of Citigroup, was sacked on Monday as head of the bank&apos;s wealth management arm. It has since emerged that his superiors were irritated with aspects of his expenses, including the installation of a wood-burning fireplace in his 50th floor office, to sit alongside a fishtank and provide a place for &quot;fireside chats&quot; with clients. The bank is also reported to have had concerns about his generosity towards Maria Bartiromo, 39, the CNBC reporter dubbed the &quot;money honey&quot; when she became the first TV reporter allowed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In November, Mr Thomson, 45, invited Ms Bartiromo to address Citigroup clients in Hong Kong and Shanghai. He flew her back to New York on Citigroup&apos;s corporate jet and allegedly flew alone with her, bumping several fellow executives off the passenger list. The trip, estimated to have cost $50,000, was signed off by CNBC, which reimbursed Citigroup to the tune of a typical first-class air fare, around $3,000 to $4,000. Citigroup has been under pressure from major shareholders to cut its expenses, prompting the appointment of chief operating officer Robert Druskin as an &quot;expenses tsar&quot;. Mr Druskin was allegedly dismayed to spot Mr Thomson dining with Ms Bartiromo one evening at Daniel, a New York restaurant which serves Iranian caviar costing up to $660 a portion. Citigroup&apos;s chief executive, Robert Prince, reportedly ordered Mr Thomson to spend no more money on Ms Bartiromo, but last week the bank&apos;s board discovered he had dedicated $5m to sponsoring an environmental show on the TV channel Sundance which was to feature Ms Bartiromo as a presenter. A Citigroup spokeswoman would say only that Mr Thomson departed &quot;to pursue other opportunities&quot;.", "tags": ["Business"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-25T23:46:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jan/26/jamesbond", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;ve got to go to Beijing and Shanghai to promote Bond soon."], "title": "'He's the Bond girl, not me'", "article": "Eva Green is stuck in traffic at Euston and will be late. This can&apos;t be right. Glamorous French actresses don&apos;t get stuck at Euston. They get teleported from Armani photoshoots at the Palais Royal to the interview with their cheekbones&apos; molecular structure perfectly reconstituted, their blushes like roses under April snow, their flunkies flustered in their mistresses&apos; imperious wakes. Or they arrive in private jets from Juan-les-Pins, with irritating little dogs. While I wait, I survey a shelf of film scripts in her agent&apos;s Covent Garden office. Perhaps they will give me a bead on where the fifth French Bond girl&apos;s career is going next. They include such projects as Memoirs of a Midget (at 5ft 6in, she&apos;s too tall), Five Psychopaths (she has wonderfully wild eyes, but it&apos;s probably not really her thing), Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin (already filmed, but she would have been great as Zola&apos;s tortured murderer). All the while, Barbra Streisand&apos;s song is in my head: &quot;Love, ageless and evergreen/ Seldom seen by two.&quot; Evergreen, Eva Green: can she be real or just a drooling marketing man&apos;s invention to revive the Bond franchise like cinematic Viagra in its sixth decade? Here comes the answer: Green arrives blissfully dogless (she apparently owns a terrier, though). She has blushes like roses under April snow (check), cheekbones like porcelain (check), eyes you could gaze into for a happy afternoon (check), fey handshake (check) and eyebrows in need of attention (mine too). She resembles a boiled-down Isabelle Adjani, and yet also has the gamine charms of Audrey Tautou and the improbable politesse of Emmanuelle B\u00e9art. Bertolucci said Green was &quot;so beautiful it&apos;s indecent&quot;. This is wrong: her beauty, though extreme, has nothing indecent about it. Yet. She&apos;s delectably apologetic and speaks English in an accent that makes me want to listen to her talk any old rubbish all day long. &quot;I love English. It&apos;s so musical,&quot; she says as she removes her coat. &quot;Not like that French quack, quack, quack from the front of the mouth, you know?&quot; Green is like Charlotte Rampling in reverse: she&apos;s the Anglophile Frenchwoman who studied English in Ramsgate, London and Ireland, while Francophile Englishwoman Rampling finessed her Gallic chops in Versailles. &quot;I feel more centred when I&apos;m here,&quot; she says dreamily. We meet to discuss Green&apos;s nomination for the Bafta rising star award, a gong last year presented to James McAvoy. &quot;In France we have the C\u00e9sars, but I think the Baftas are much more serious. So when the nomination was for me in a Bond film, it&apos;s a bit like a joke.&quot; Oh, Eva - surely not! &quot;No! I don&apos;t believe in awards. It&apos;s very good for the ego, I suppose.&quot; This must be good news for Cillian Murphy, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris and Emily Blunt, who all will be up for the award on February 11, which will be decided by popular vote. We only have half an hour before Green must leave to weekend with her parents in Paris&apos;s 17th arrondissement, so questions come as fast as an Aston Martin tearing through the Montenegran corniches. Was being in a Bond film beneath you? &quot;Not at all. In France, it&apos;s just not a big deal, whereas here every man wants to be Bond.&quot; I counter: I&apos;d rather be Marcel Proust. &quot;Really? I thought I was weird.&quot; But surely the threat of appearing in a seemingly ailing British franchise must have been a worry? &quot;No, I just read the script and thought, &apos;This is good.&apos;&quot; Weren&apos;t you worried about the flak that Craig got for being &quot;James Bland&quot;: too short, too wimpy etc? &quot;That completely passed me by. He got all the mad tabloids - I got nothing. Actually that&apos;s not quite true. I got very angry when people kept asking me, &apos;What&apos;s it feel like to be a Bond girl?&apos; As if I was soup.&quot; The only time Green got stuck on the fuzzy end of the tabloids&apos; lollipop was when low-brow French mag Voici published photos of Green fooling around in between shots on the Casino Royale set in the Bahamas. &quot;I&apos;m a little bit crazy, you know? And so, between shots, I was pulling silly faces, which appeared in the magazine. They said I was going to get fired and I can&apos;t act.&quot; My mother and friends called me and said &apos;Is this true?&apos; It was very funny, ridiculous but funny.&quot; Did you feel that it was ungallant of Craig to have bigger boobs than you? She is heroically unperturbed by my rude question. &quot;Well, he is the Bond girl, not me. He&apos;s the one who comes out of the sea with his top off.&quot; Didn&apos;t you feel envious? &quot;No, not at all. I&apos;ve been nude in a film before [Bertolucci&apos;s The Dreamers, of which more later] and found it very troubling, so I was quite glad not to be in this film.&quot; Indeed, Green fought to keep her clothes on in Casino Royale. &quot;In the shower scene - you remember? - they wanted me to strip down to my panties. We had a good fight about that. I used to go to Daniel and ask for his support.&quot; It was a worthwhile fight: for Vesper Lynd to strip at a moment in the film when she is supposed to be horribly upset about the violent world behind 007&apos;s sartorially pristine facade would have been even more fatuous than many of the fatuous things for which Bond films have become renowned. Green&apos;s mother, Marl\u00e8ne Jobert, didn&apos;t want her daughter to go on the stage, still less pap-saturated film sets in the Bahamas. &quot;She was a very, very successful actress who, at about 40, gave it up for writing children&apos;s books and raising her children.&quot; Jobert was, for a while in the late 1960s and early 70s, hot: sexy and red-haired, she starred in Godard&apos;s Masculin Feminin, Malle&apos;s Le Voleur, was particularly excellent in Maurice Pialat&apos;s Nous Ne Viellirons Pas Ensemble (We Won&apos;t Grow Old Together) and also appeared opposite Charles Bronson in Rider in the Rain. What happened? &quot;She lost the desire. She knew that it&apos;s a very tough profession and was worried that someone as gentle as me wouldn&apos;t be able to deal with it.&quot; Can you? &quot;I seem to have done so far.&quot; Green had the acting bug ever since she saw Isabelle Adjani in Truffaut&apos;s L&apos;Histoire d&apos;Ad\u00e8le H, based on the true story of Victor Hugo&apos;s second daughter, who fell obsessively but unrequitedly in love with a British officer, followed him to Nova Scotia and Barbados before going mad and dying in a Paris asylum. &quot;I was 14 at the time and it made an indelible impression.&quot; She trained in acting in London and New York, before returning to Paris where she played in several stage productions, including the play Jealousy in Three Faxes. There she caught the eye of Bertolucci who, captivated by her supposedly indecent beauty, cast her in The Dreamers, a free adaptation of Gilbert Adair&apos;s novel about a threesome during les \u00e9v\u00e8nements in Paris 1968. &quot;My parents didn&apos;t want me to be in it.&quot; Why? &quot;Because of what happened to Maria Schneider in Last Tango in Paris.&quot; Schneider disappeared after the film became a success, subsequently checking into an Italian psychiatric hospital. Several years later, she resumed her career. &quot;My mother was a bit worried, but she hasn&apos;t got very good English, so the script didn&apos;t mean much to her.&quot; Green took the role. &quot;You can&apos;t say no to Bertolucci.&quot; What was Bertolucci like? &quot;He was not a pervert. The film is just about three young people having sex. He&apos;s so much in love with Paris. I remember Bertolucci saying, &apos;I want to kill the mother&apos;. He&apos;s like that. He was like a father.&quot; Her real father, incidentally, is a Swedish dentist (hence her surname, which should be pronounced to rhyme with Wren) who only appeared in one film - but what a film, Robert Bresson&apos;s great Au Hasard Balthazar, about a mistreated donkey. The Dreamers earned her good reviews and a goggle-eyed reception from her family. &quot;For my mother and sister and father to see me naked on screen was shocking.&quot; For them? &quot;No! For me.&quot; But one might be forgiven for thinking she got over the shock: indeed, she expressed her outrage when cuts were made for the film&apos;s US release. She said: &quot;It is quite paradoxical, because in America there is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet I think they are frightened by sex.&quot; After that, she starred in a delightful piece of Gallic froth, Ars\u00e8ne Lupin. But her looks and her command of English soon sucked her into the vortices of two Anglophone blockbusters, Ridley Scott&apos;s crusades flick Kingdom of Heaven, opposite Orlando Bloom, and then Casino Royale. She turned down the role of the femme fatale in Brian De Palma&apos;s The Black Dahlia and was unfortunate to be beaten by Rachel Weisz to the role of the British diplomat&apos;s wife in The Constant Gardener. &quot;I have been in two big machines now and something a bit smaller scale would be nice. I want to work in England.&quot; Why don&apos;t you appear in more French films - there are so many interesting Gallic directors right now (Laurent Cantet, Jacques Audiard, Cedric Kahn)? &quot;It&apos;s true. But I haven&apos;t found the right script.&quot; Green divides her life between London and Paris, where she was born. She&apos;s currently dating a Kiwi actor, Marton Csokas, whom she met on the set of Kingdom of Heaven. Last Tuesday, she finished filming Northern Lights, the first part of Philip Pullman&apos;s His Dark Materials, along with Daniel Craig (again) and Nicole Kidman. She plays Serafina Pekkala, a witch queen. Will you, like your mother, lose your desire for acting? &quot;I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m so scared of all the bollocks, you know?&quot; It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve ever heard a Frenchwoman say &quot;bollocks&quot;, and so can&apos;t help giggling. What bollocks? &quot;All the interviews. Not you, of course!&quot; Of course. &quot;I&apos;ve got to go to Beijing and Shanghai to promote Bond soon. It&apos;s not about acting, that&apos;s why they contract you to do these things.&quot; That must make the prospect of acting all your life difficult? &quot;I see Judi Dench and Maggie Smith and I think they are wonderful, but I&apos;m not sure.&quot; Indeed, she&apos;s so young (26) that the question is hardly worth worrying about. And with that, Eva Green pulls on her coat and is gone on a journey to a parallel universe. Or at least Paris. She says she&apos;s going by Eurostar, but I&apos;m not so sure. Eva Green is, after all, a glamorous French actress and occasional witch, so surely she doesn&apos;t travel like ordinary mortals. \u00b7 To see the nominees and vote for the Orange Bafta Rising Star award, go to: www1.orange.co.uk/entertainment/film/OrangeRisingStarAward.php", "tags": ["Film", "James Bond", "Culture", "Casino Royale"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-26T00:07:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/26/davos07dailymailismisath", "sentences": ["The life of a young person in London, or New York, or Shanghai, or Paris is increasingly similar in many of its concerns."], "title": "Davos 07: a rejection of 'Daily Mailism'", "article": "My first day at Davos confirmed the impression of last year&apos;s trip to China, and preparations for this year&apos;s to India: &quot;Daily Mailism&quot; is a threat to Britain&apos;s prosperity - something I will explain later. Yesterday was dominated by climate change. First, there was an automotive industry discussion, &quot;Inhibiters and facilitators of green vehicle technologies&quot;. There were two reports - mine on London&apos;s transport policies, and another on technical advances in electric propelled vehicles. It was an interesting, practical discussion on how rapidly cities can move to Euro five and six standards on vehicle emissions (which are way ahead of present UK ones) and on the possibility of replacing London&apos;s bus fleet with hybrid vehicles. Several large bus manufacturers were present who, naturally, were highly interested in the discussion. Then came a break from the day&apos;s main theme, as we moved on to &quot;sport and development&quot;. I guess London having won the Olympics had something to do with the invite. A big discussion on sport and health followed, and a theme we are going to use up to 2012 - &quot;getting London fit for the Olympics&quot; - seemed to get potential buy-in. Once that was over, it was back to climate change. There were two sessions. The first was with Fabian Nunez, of the California State Assembly, Zhang Xiaoqiang of the Chinese Development Commission, and Montek Ahluwalia of the Planning Commission of India, and it centred on economic development and climate change. The second concentrated on the US and Europe with a stormy (for polite company) discussion on the US refusal to ratify Kyoto; governments and markets; nuclear power, and carbon pricing. My impression was as I had anticipated. I disagree with many of the solutions propounded, but this World Economic Forum is discussing many of the world&apos;s most important issues. Naturally, it is a subset. Needless to say, poverty is not central to the discussions, and developing world leaders at Davos, such as President Lula, are not given the focus they deserve. London, with the support of my office, was completely right to have hosted the European Social Forum in 2004. But the rise of India and China, together with the impact of climate change, are among the most important issues facing the world. A left which remains locked in local concerns, and which is not capable of seriously and practically engaging in the major issues of the planet, will become irrelevant. To return to where I started, the world represented by Davos, the most powerful forces in the global economy, are destroying the world of &quot;little Englandism&quot; articulated most perfectly by the Daily Mail. If Britain is to thrive and prosper in this new world economy, we need to think internationally and not retreat into national narrowness; it requires international movement of labour rather than hysteria against immigrants; it requires increasing interaction of culture, not attempts to shut out &quot;the foreign&quot;; it means coming to terms with two huge new economies - China and India - who we can no longer kick around but must deal with on terms of equality; and it needs action against climate change - which can only be tackled internationally. It is a world of a global economy in which people use common technology, are linked instantly by modern communications, and have an increasingly common life experience. The life of a young person in London, or New York, or Shanghai, or Paris is increasingly similar in many of its concerns. If Britain adopted the values of Daily Mailism - national narrowness, prejudice, the idea that foreign countries can still be kicked around, the failure to grasp the urgency of action that must be global on climate change - it would condemn itself to failure in this new world economy, with the consequences for our standard of living, narrowing of the range of choices available to its citizens, and environmental degradation. The left can ultimately contest the issues raised at Davos because it is international in its foundations. But the world of Davos will destroy the world of Daily Mailism. The only question is whether the latter will drag Britain down with it. To put it another way, and bluntly: the issue is whether, in their different ways, the left and Davos will destroy Daily Mailism before Daily Mailism destroys the prosperity of Britain. Today, Davos is concentrating on cities. But I think the same real themes will dominate.", "tags": ["Daily Mail", "UK news", "Global economy", "Olympic Games 2012", "Climate change", "Davos", "Business", "World news", "Davos 2007", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-26T10:31:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jan/27/weekend.jonathanwatts", "sentences": ["British diplomats and businessmen in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou enjoy a modern consumer lifestyle with access to international schools, well-equipped hospitals and Starbucks lattes.", "Most provocative is Sex And Shanghai, the lurid, possibly fictional diary of a self-professed British bounder that last year caused an online storm when a Chinese professor used it to denounce the worst behaviour of foreigners."], "title": "China", "article": "Population: 1,315,844,000 British population: around 3.5 million Few countries offer such a variety of expat experiences. British diplomats and businessmen in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou enjoy a modern consumer lifestyle with access to international schools, well-equipped hospitals and Starbucks lattes. Farther inland, language teachers and aid workers are more likely to see a toilet and clean drinking water as luxuries. The number of Brits in China has grown enormously from a generation ago, when you could probably have accommodated the entire British expat population in the Beijing Hotel (one of the few places foreigners were allowed to stay at the time). Lifestyles and climates span the gamut. A lucky few hotel workers bask in the sunny subtropical resort of Hainan island; those in Beijing and its environs have to endure spring dust-storms, freezing winters and sulphurous smog. But rapid development is transforming the average expat&apos;s life. Modern communications have spread rapidly, and travel restrictions have been extensively relaxed, so foreigners can now live in or visit all but a handful of areas. All of this has made for some great books, among them River Town, Peter Hessler&apos;s lyrical account of teaching English, and Mr China, Tim Clissold&apos;s salutary tale about investment and business management. Numerous blogs also offer insights and anecdotes. Most provocative is Sex And Shanghai, the lurid, possibly fictional diary of a self-professed British bounder that last year caused an online storm when a Chinese professor used it to denounce the worst behaviour of foreigners. For those who prefer to mix with compatriots in the flesh rather than online, there are expat hangouts in most big cities. Among the most popular in Beijing is Club Football, which offers live Premiership matches, all-day British breakfasts, cheap beer and table football. A constant refrain among expats is that the gap between east and west is closing. Although China is still considered a &quot;hardship posting&quot;, life for foreign residents is getting easier as aliens and natives grow accustomed to one another. In cities on the increasingly cosmopolitan eastern seaboard, foreigners no longer turn heads as they did a generation ago, though children attract cooing strangers. Everywhere there is a degree of interaction - and intermarriage - that would have been unthinkable during the Cultural Revolution. Along with the booming economy, it is perhaps for this reason - more than the spread of Starbucks and Premiership football - that more and more Brits are joining the world&apos;s biggest population. How is it for you? Daniel Stratford is a 32-year-old primary school teacher at the British School of Beijing. He has been in China for 14 months. I came with many prejudices about the government, and about how this would affect life, but my experience is that it is very liberal, more so than England. There is no sign of communism - it seems more capitalist than back home. I have friends who love going to restaurants down horrific alleys - places they would write to their councillor to have demolished were they back home - but I can live without it. The main difficulty is in mastering Mandarin. I haven&apos;t been terribly adventurous in trying lots of things, and that seems to be the case for a lot of people I know. It&apos;s very easy to island-hop expat venues, from home to work to bars, and you can end up surprising yourself when you ride your bike home and see an Asian face. The difficulty of the language is key here, because the Chinese seem a very friendly people - if a little conservative for someone who calls South Woodford home. How to do it A one-way flight from London to Beijing costs from around \u00a3350, though it will be considerably more in peak seasons. For those moving to mainland China, long-term visas - for residency, business, internship or study - can be obtained through overseas consulates. The most important visa classes for foreign workers are the Business/ Official Visit Visa, the Employment/ Work Visa, and the Resident Visa. (There are other classes of visas for airline pilots, mariners, diplomats, tourists, family visits, students and journalists.) Visa requirements for Hong Kong are different from those for the People&apos;s Republic of China. It&apos;s also worth bearing in mind that the Chinese government does not recognise dual nationality. Foreigners staying to work for longer than one year must undergo a health check, which will include an HIV/ Aids test. The ease with which a foreign national can buy a property depends on the location - in Beijing, for example, a one-bedroom apartment can be had for around \u00a370,000 and a three-bedder for around \u00a3240,000. Outside the major cities, however, foreign nationals are not permitted to buy property. Useful links include the Chinese embassy, chinese-embassy.org and the British embassy in China, uk.cn/bj.

In this book, he explores the idea further, and it&apos;s terrific. A lot of readers, wanting to put their finger on why the affluent world they live in makes them so uneasy, will want to cheer. Here he is saying, loud and clear, that capitalism is bad for your mental health. And then he tells us why this is the case, and what we can do about it. &quot;My focus,&quot; explains James, &quot;is on why we are so fucked up, not with dangling a false promise of the possibility of happiness.&quot; He&apos;s right - he doesn&apos;t offer false promises. By the time you&apos;ve finished this book, you, too, might be feeling pretty pessimistic. As if we weren&apos;t already - as James points out, almost a quarter of Britons suffer &quot;emotional distress&quot;. &quot;Cards on the table,&quot; he says, &quot;I contend that most emotional distress is best understood as a rational response to sick societies.&quot; So why are we, in James&apos;s words, so fucked up? It&apos;s because of what James calls Selfish Capitalism, or, more catchily, &quot;Affluenza&quot;, a virus-like condition that spreads through affluent countries. In these countries, notably English-speaking ones, people define themselves by how much money they make. They are also ruled by superficial values - how attractive they look, how famous they are, how much they are able to show off. As the sociologist Erich Fromm would have put it, we have moved from a state of &quot;being&quot; to a state of &quot;having&quot;. Now we are obsessed with what other people think of us, and we&apos;ve lost touch with our own feelings. How has this happened? James is very coherent on this matter. He explains the thesis behind Vance Packard&apos;s famous book on advertising, The Hidden Persuaders: in a society in which people all have what they need, the job of advertisers is to create false needs. Packard wrote his book in the 1950s, and what James is exploring is the fallout from 60 years of false needs. The fallout, of course, gets worse; each successive generation is more anxious and depressed. In the past, people wanted things because they were useful; later, they wanted them to enhance their status; and now they want them because they feel ugly and alone. It&apos;s a wonderfully clear and cogent thesis. Affluenza, as defined by James, is clearly recognisable as our way of life. It spreads because it feeds on itself; when you try to make yourself feel better by buying a car, or bulking up in the gym, or spraying on a fake tan, or having a facelift, you actually make yourself feel worse, which makes you want to buy more things. As James points out, the virus has spread to television - &quot;most programmes,&quot; he says, &quot;are now barely concealed advertisements for classes of product&quot; - and education. James sees modern education as &quot;little better than a systematic method for spreading the virus&quot;. He travels the world, interviewing rich, unhappy people. There is Sam, a New York billionaire who lives alone in a vast apartment. Sam was addicted to heroin, and now seems to be addicted to casual sex with young girls. He has, we are shown, pursued the goals of affluenza to their ultimate point. He can have anything he wants, but nothing satisfies him. James also meets the trophy wife of another fabulously rich man - she is addicted to shopping and cocaine, and he is often away from home. Their relationship is based on mutual contempt: she spends his money with vengeful spite; he pays her back with coldness and abuse. James visits places in the grip of Affluenza, such as Australia and Singapore, and also places less affected. People are more depressed, he tells us, where inequality is greatest. So Denmark, with its high taxes, is hanging in there; Danes are less impressed by wealth and glamour than just about anyone else in the developed world. Heartbreakingly, he visits societies where the virus is taking hold, and shows us things that are about to die out. Russian women, he says, dress with individuality and a type of flair missing from the west, where they tend to follow the intricacies of fashion, and feel terrible about themselves. And people in Shanghai apparently feel less social anxiety, because, even though western values are sweeping the place, they still have their roots in an earlier era. Well, he&apos;s convinced me. The antidote is simple: look inward, not outward. Don&apos;t be a sheep. Try to be &quot;beautiful&quot; rather than &quot;attractive&quot;. Embrace the family. Don&apos;t see life as a competition. Don&apos;t watch too much TV. Simple, perhaps. But will it be enough? One of the scariest parts of the book is James&apos;s analysis of New Labour politicians. Have they been infected with the virus? Well, just think of Tony Blair and his property dealings, his flash holidays, his spray-on tan. Think of Peter Mandelson, who said: &quot;We are seriously relaxed about people becoming very, very rich.&quot; Think of Prescott. Think of Cherie Blair ... &quot;Just as Aids is stalking the globe, so is the Affluenza virus,&quot; says James. I think he&apos;s right.

Boris Gudz, who has died aged 104, relished his status as Russia&apos;s oldest secret agent and, even after he turned 100, enjoyed giving interviews about his work and involvement in notorious episodes in Soviet espionage. Among the best known were the plot to lure Sidney Reilly, the &quot;ace of spies&quot; in the nascent MI6, to interrogation and execution in Moscow in 1925, and Gudz&apos;s pivotal role in coordinating the activities of Richard Sorge, the Soviet agent who infiltrated the Nazi party and provided the Kremlin with detailed information on Barbarossa, Hitler&apos;s plan to invade the Soviet Union in 1941, intelligence that Stalin, fatefully, did not heed. Gudz was born into a family of political exiles in Ufa in the Urals. A family connection with Artur Artuzov, the founding head of counter-intelligence in the OGPU, which followed the Cheka, and was the precursor to the NKVD, the KGB and today&apos;s FSB, led to Gudz joining the service in 1923. Within a year he had begun working on Operation Trust, a highly sensitive operation aimed at delivering back into the hands of Moscow enemies of Bolshevik rule who had escaped abroad. Trust, which ran until 1926, saw OGPU agents set themselves up as members of an anti-Bolshevik organisation that aimed to topple the Soviet government. One of Gudz&apos;s jobs was to assess the suitability of foreign ports in which to dock unofficial Soviet vessels or in which to drop off agents. He was also involved in couriering money abroad to OGPU agents posing as anti-Bolshevik activists. Trust&apos;s first big success was in luring Boris Savinkov, a one-time member of the provisional government and a key Socialist Revolutionary party figure in the civil war, back to Russia in 1924. Savinkov, whose death sentence was commuted to 10 years imprisonment, committed suicide by plunging from a fifth-floor window of the Lubyanka headquarters of the secret police in 1925. Conspiracy theories suggested that Savinkov was pushed, but Gudz, with first-hand details of the events, maintained towards the end of his life that a colleague had attempted to grab Savinkov, a valuable asset who had offered to work for Moscow, but his grip failed. Trust&apos;s second big success was in persuading Sidney Reilly to follow in Savinkov&apos;s footsteps some months later. Like Savinkov, Reilly was persuaded that the OGPU agents he met were plotting the overthrow of Bolshevism. Moscow, meanwhile, saw Reilly as foreign enemy agent number one for his involvement in an abortive 1918 plot to assassinate Lenin. He had been captured and sentenced to death , but escaped in the tumult of the civil war. Interviewed by one of Reilly&apos;s biographers, Andrew Cook, Gudz recalled Reilly being kept in solitary confinement in conditions more akin to a hotel than a prison and the care that OGPU agents took that his whereabouts were not discovered. Reilly, apparently, revealed little about MI6 during interrogation and the decision was taken that he should be killed. He was shot in the back of the head while out exercising on the outskirts of Moscow in November 1925. After Trust was wound up, Gudz was sent to the Caucasus. There he rooted out anti-Bolshevik militants in Chechnya and Dagestan, and studied philosophy. By the early 1930s he was in Siberia, masterminding a series of operations against Japan. His success led to a posting as resident at the Soviet embassy in Tokyo from 1934 to 1936. It was there that he first came across the activities of Sorge, mythologised in the Leonid Brezhnev era from 1964 to 1982 as a Soviet James Bond. Sorge, a German communist and the grandson of Karl Marx&apos;s one-time private secretary, was in Shanghai in 1933 collecting information on Chiang Kai-Shek&apos;s nationalist army, but was sent back to Germany, where he joined the Nazi party and was sent to Tokyo as a foreign correspondent for various German papers. Gudz&apos;s Tokyo connections made him the ideal candidate to run Sorge from Moscow. However by 1937, with the purges at their height, Gudz fell from grace, His sister was arrested and he was expelled from the party. But this proved fortuitous, since Gudz&apos;s mentor, Artuzov, and many senior colleagues were to perish in subsequent campaigns against the security services and Red Army. Gudz became a Moscow bus driver but, after his party membership was restored, he rose to head a transport organisation. By the late 1960s, with the Soviet Union in the grip of a mania for spy thrillers that equalled that of its western adversaries, Gudz turned consultant on books about espionage and for the first TV serial about Operation Trust. After the Soviet Union&apos;s collapse he also enthusiastically recounted details of operations to foreign researchers, remaining fiercely loyal to the service. &quot;Many workers of the security services remember meetings with Gudz, his stories about Felix Dzerzhinsky (founder of the service), and other Chekists of the 1920s,&quot; an FSB statement said. Interviewed in his 103rd year, the still sprightly Gudz, who continued to ride his motorbike until he was 90, and had married for the third time aged 101, attributed his longevity to giving up smoking and drinking a glass of red wine only twice a year - at new year and on the annual secret services day. \u00b7 Boris Ignatievich Gudz, intelligence officer, born 1902; died December 29 2006", "tags": ["Russia", "World news", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-30T00:05:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/31/motoring.lifeandhealth", "sentences": ["Nanjing, for example, faced competition to buy MG Rover assets from its rival, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation.", "Shanghai then went on to work with a UK-based automotive consultancy on product development.", "The Phoenix Four sought an overseas partner to help fund the development of new models but when long-running negotiations with the Chinese company, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, failed MG Rover was forced to call in the administrators."], "title": "Gear change puts MG back on road", "article": "On a clear day, from the Lickey Hills you can see the towers of Birmingham&apos;s city centre and the jets taking off from its international airport. At their foot the giant Longbridge plant sprawls across the landscape; 490 acres, spanning the county boundary and dwarfing the surrounding housing. Even on a sunny day, it has a brooding air. Once it was the flagship of Britain&apos;s automotive industry, known to generations simply as the Austin, after its founder. In the 1970s it became the battleground for management and unions. By the 1990s, the decline was all too apparent: Longbridge&apos;s owner, MG Rover, had become the English patient, a German joke against its parent, BMW. The Munich-based car maker&apos;s exit in 2000 and Longbridge&apos;s final demise in 2005 under the businessmen known as the Phoenix Four - both just before elections with a fistful of Labour marginals at stake - added political drama to a saga of industrial decline. Now, however, regeneration is in the air. Yesterday Nanjing Automobile Corporation, the Chinese car maker which bought many of the assets of MG Rover, confirmed that it was planning to restart production of the MG TF sports car in the spring and the first two of a series of test vehicles have been made. Much of the manufacturing will be at Nanjing&apos;s home plant in China, using plant taken out of Longbridge, but final assembly of the right-hand drive version will be at the West Midlands plant. The first cars should be in UK showrooms in the second half of the year. &quot;The re-opening of the Birmingham-based plant will bring a welcome boost to the local economy, employing many former MG Rover workers who will provide valuable product knowledge and skills. NAC MG is planning to resume production in spring 2007,&quot; the company said in a statement. The only indication of a Chinese presence at Longbridge is a red flag and a small sign on one of the buildings next to the plant&apos;s gate Q. Indeed Nanjing has maintained a low profile since it moved into Longbridge. However, the Chinese car maker clearly has ambitious plans to use MG Rover&apos;s technology to develop its product line-up. A number of Chinese car makers have joint ventures with European or US partners but increasingly Chinese companies are developing independently. Nanjing, for example, faced competition to buy MG Rover assets from its rival, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. Shanghai then went on to work with a UK-based automotive consultancy on product development. Although Nanjing has not said how many workers it will employ at Longbridge, where it occupies roughly a third of the old factory space, local newspaper reports suggest the workforce will increase from around 110 to 250 - a fraction of the 6,500 who lost their jobs when MG Rover collapsed. The destiny of the remainder of the site rests with the developer, St Modwen, which owns the bulk of Longbridge, as well as the development agency, Advantage West Midlands, which also owns a slice, and the planners in Birmingham and Bromsgrove. Work on clearing the ground is already well under way. Much of the old plant has already been given over to the bulldozers and diggers. Last week the demolition men were ripping the heart out of the east works, once the place where Rover&apos;s K-series engines were made in their thousands. Some 26,000 tonnes of steel and 75,000 tonnes of old bricks and concrete have been recycled. Much of what is left will soon be gone. But what will fill the space cleared by the demolition gangs? After widespread consultation, owners and planners are considering four options; ranging from an employment-led alternative to others including increasing provision for housing, shops, education and community facilities. All aim to provide at least 10,000 jobs and the planners are expected to announce their preferred scheme next month. Finding the right option will not be easy. Longbridge does not sit in isolation but cheek-by-jowl with large-scale housing. Birmingham council is pouring millions of pounds into the local housing stock, working with government, housing associations and the private sector. Estates like Nimmings Farm and Egg Hill, for example, are to be transformed. The Lickey Hills, with its country park, has some very desirable postcodes. Longbridge&apos;s industrial past is still evident, despite the demolition, but so is its near-rural location. Alongside the site are 75 acres of parkland. The Longbridge estate even includes a farm. Construction work has already started. St Modwen is well on its way with a \u00a315m development of a twin block for technology-based start-up businesses. It is designed to form part of a central technology belt stretching from Birmingham to Malvern. Anthony Glossop, St Modwen chairman, made it clear at the launch of the technology park that the aim at Longbridge was to create &quot;10,000 new jobs and a new heart for the area. Nanjing is not the only company to have moved into Longbridge. PRG Europe, a supplier of lighting and other equipment for big events such as concerts, has taken a warehouse which used to be MG Rover&apos;s parts distribution centre. The area has survived the demise of MG Rover surprisingly well. The government pushed through an aid package to support those who lost their jobs and to help them retrain and find other work. The housing market, usually a telling indicator, has been relatively robust. Ian Williams, a partner in estate agents Robert Oulsnam &amp; Co, said the impact on the housing market &quot;has not been as devastating as people feared it might be.&quot; One reason is that MG Rover drew its workforce from a wide area; its close proximity to the motorway network meant many workers were commuters. But what do the locals think should happen? Rose Green, who has lived in the area for 18 years, reckons redevelopment will help unemployment and the idea of a college on the doorstep will be a boon for the local youngsters who left school without enough qualifications. She is looking forward, too, to the new shopping facilities. &quot;It&apos;s like a ghost town down here, it&apos;s gone dead ... It has picked up a bit, but not a vast amount.&quot; Jagir Singh, who runs the Longbridge Superstore, estimates his turnover fell 20% when Longbridge closed, though that was partly offset when he took over as the local sub postmaster from another business which shut down around the same time. For him redevelopment could be a mixed blessing - a bigger market but more competition from the shops which will move into the new retail developments. So what would he like to see? &quot;I think if they built some houses, that would be nice ... and some recreational activities - facilities for during the day and in the evening; that would be lovely.&quot; Backstory When the production line at Longbridge ground to a halt in early April 2005, it marked the end of a century of output at the West Midlands plant. Longbridge was created by Herbert Austin, turning out vast fleets of the cars which bore his name. During the two world wars Longbridge was pressed into service to make munitions. In 1956 Austin was merged with Morris and just over a decade later the business became part of British Leyland.  That company was nationalised in 1975 and at the end of the decade forged an alliance with the Japanese car maker, Honda. In 1986, a much reduced group was renamed Rover and in 1988 was sold to British Aerospace. In 1994, the manufacturer was again sold, this time to the Munich-based BMW, which saw Rover as a way to achieve critical mass in the European market. In 2000, however, BMW gave up on the &quot;English patient&quot; and MG Rover was sold to a consortium of British businessmen, the Phoenix Four, for a nominal \u00a310 though BMW kept the Mini brand and the plant at Cowley.  The Phoenix Four sought an overseas partner to help fund the development of new models but when long-running negotiations with the Chinese company, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, failed MG Rover was forced to call in the administrators. A subsequent sale saw most of the assets sold to another Chinese company, Nanjing Automobile Corporation, which has taken a 33-year lease on part of Longbridge and is promising production again this spring.", "tags": ["Business", "Life and style", "Automotive industry"], "publicationDate": "2007-01-31T00:23:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/01/india.frontpagenews", "sentences": ["Top 10 steelmakers Mittal/Arcelor 110m tonnes a year Nippon Steel 32m tonnes POSCO 30.5m tonnes JFE 29.9m tonnes Corus/Tata 28m tonnes (combined) Shanghai Baosteel 23.8m tonnes United States Steel 19.3m tonnes Nucor Corporation 18.4m tonnes Riva Group 17.5m tonnes ThyssenKrupp 16.5m tonnes Source: IISI/company estimates"], "title": "Tata celebrates costly victory in Corus chase", "article": "The chief executive of Tata Steel yesterday hailed his company&apos;s victory in the \u00a36.7bn auction for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus as a milestone for Indian business and the country&apos;s economy. &quot;The Indian corporate sector is doing well and increasingly looking globally,&quot; B Muthuraman said in the aftermath of the overnight auction that ended in the early hours of yesterday morning. &quot;I believe it&apos;s an important step, a milestone.&quot; His upbeat mood was echoed by India&apos;s finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, who said the successful bid reflected the new-found confidence of Indian industry. If Corus shareholders back the deal, Tata Steel is set to become the world&apos;s fifth-biggest steelmaker. The company is offering 608p a share, topping a 603p bid from its rival suitor, the Brazilian company CSN. The deal values Corus equity at \u00a36.2bn, which, coupled with some \u00a3500m of debt, puts the enterprise value at \u00a36.7bn. CSN will not go away entirely empty handed; it is in line for a break fee of more than \u00a360m. The acquisition restores the Tata group to its traditional place as India&apos;s biggest company, with a market capitalisation of 2,700bn rupees (\u00a333bn), and it puts the company on the brink of clinching India&apos;s biggest foreign takeover. However, enthusiasm for Tata&apos;s strategy was not universal. Tata Steel&apos;s shares slumped almost 11% on the deal with traders warning that the company was paying too much. Its opening offer had been pitched at 455p a share but was raised to \u00a35 after CSN indicated its interest. Ratan Tata, the chairman of the Tata group, defended the 608p price tag, saying Corus represented a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; for the Indian company. &quot;Quite frankly I do feel [the stock market] is taking a short-term and harsh view. In the future somebody will look back and say we did the right thing. Corus is a unique opportunity for us in terms of scale, location and culture. This is a key part of our global strategy.&quot; Analysts said that Tata&apos;s bid was nine times Corus&apos;s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), a figure that dwarfed the 6.2 times Mittal Steel paid for Arcelor to create the world&apos;s biggest steel producer. However, banking sources close to the Tata camp argued that Tata was paying $700 (\u00a3357) for each tonne of steel production compared with $670 in the Mittal-Arcelor deal and $1,000 a tonne in a recent US deal. Mr Muthuraman accepted the deal &quot;may look expensive&quot; but said it would triple the company&apos;s capacity from 8.7m tonnes to almost 28m tonnes a year at half the cost of building new plants. He added that within three years it would add $300m to $350m a year to net profit. Steel prices would rise driven by demand from the sustained, explosive growth in the biggest markets in the developing world: India and China. &quot;Both of these two will need to be built up.&quot; In response to questions about possible job cuts at Corus, Mr Muthuraman said that the steelmaker was not as competitive as it should be. &quot;This is not about cutting jobs. The company has to be made more competitive so jobs can be secured.&quot; British unions are keen to open talks with Tata about its plans for the British plants. &quot;Tata will be inheriting a profitable, well-run company with, in the case of its UK operations, some of the most efficient steelworkers in the world,&quot; said Michael Leahy, Community&apos;s general secretary. &quot;We are willing to work in partnership to drive forward an investment strategy which allows the UK operations to contribute further to the profitability of Tata. However, what we are not prepared to accept is to see the accelerated or slow demise of the UK steel industry. Tata should be under no illusions that we will resist any attempt to achieve this using all the resources at our disposal.&quot; Corus&apos;s chairman Jim Leng will become the group&apos;s deputy chairman. Mr Tata added that he intended to leave the running of Corus, led by chief Philippe Varin, to its existing executives. CSN and Tata Steel are both smaller than Corus, leading to questions about why the Anglo-Dutch group was the target, not the buyer. &quot;We would love to have bought either,&quot; said Mr Leng, &quot;but, as you know, neither of them was for sale.&quot; The Corus acquisition underlines the ambition of the cash-rich Tata group, which aims to become a global conglomerate along the lines of General Electric.

On the catwalk faded jeans were worn with rock&apos;n&apos;roll T-shirts and pinstriped blazers, a look already much favoured by boy band members and successful off-duty young .

Perhaps even in the depths of Mongolia, you would have heard the dire warnings emitted by journalists. You would have distilled from these agonised noises that the report concluded that global warming is worse than we had imagined, and that we need to take swift and strong action right now. You would have been misinformed. The IPCC has produced a good report - an attempt to summarise what the world&apos;s scientists know about global warming. Unlike the Bush administration, caught downplaying the science, the IPCC squarely tells us that mankind is largely responsible for the planet&apos;s recent warming. And, unlike Al Gore, who has travelled the world warning that our cities might soon be under the oceans, it refrains from scaremongering. But lost among the hype is the unexciting fact that this report is actually no more dire than the IPCC&apos;s last report, issued in 2001. In two important ways, this year&apos;s effort was actually less dire. The report reflected the fact that since 2001, scientists have become more certain that humans are responsible for a large part of global warming. Otherwise, though, this report had a definite sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu . Estimates of temperature increases, heat waves, and cold waves are all nearly identical to those produced six years ago. The report did, however, contain two surprising facts. Both went unmentioned in most reports. First, the world&apos;s scientists have re-jigged their estimates about how much sea levels will rise. In the 1980s, America&apos;s Environmental Protection Agency expected oceans to rise by several metres by 2100. By the 1990s, the IPCC was expecting a 67-centimetre rise. Six years ago, it anticipated ocean levels would be 48.5 centimeters higher than they are currently. In this year&apos;s report, the estimated rise is 38.5 centimeters on average. This is especially interesting since it fundamentally rejects one of the most harrowing scenes from Al Gore&apos;s movie An Inconvenient Truth. In graphic detail, Mr Gore demonstrated how a 20-foot rise in the sea level would inundate much of Florida, Shanghai, and the Netherlands. The IPCC report makes it clear that exaggerations of this magnitude have no basis in science - though clearly they frightened people and perhaps will win Mr Gore an Oscar. The report also revealed the improbability of another Gore scenario: that global warming could make the Gulf Stream shut down, turning Europe into a new Siberia. The IPCC simply and tersely tells us that this scenario - also vividly depicted in the Hollywood movie The Day After Tomorrow - is considered &quot;very unlikely&quot;. Moreover, even if the Gulf Stream were to weaken over the century, this would be good, as there would be less net warming over land areas. So why have we been left with a very different impression of the climate panel&apos;s report? The IPCC is by statute &quot;politically neutral&quot; - it is supposed to tell us just the facts and leave the rest to politicians and the people who elect them. This is why the report is a careful and sensible document. But scientists and journalists - acting as intermediaries between the report and the public - have engaged in greenhouse activism. Elsewhere calling for immediate and substantial cuts in carbon emissions, the IPCC&apos;s director even declared that he hoped the IPCC report would &quot;shock people, governments into taking more serious action&quot;. It is inappropriate for somebody in such an important and apolitical role to engage in blatant activism. Imagine if the director of the CIA published a new assessment of Iran, saying: &quot;I hope this report will shock people, governments into taking more serious action.&quot; Climate change is a real and serious problem. But the problem with the recent media frenzy is that some seem to believe no new report or development is enough if it doesn&apos;t reveal more serious consequences and more terrifying calamities than humanity has ever considered before. Indeed, this media frenzy has little or no scientific backing. One of England&apos;s foremost climatologists, Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, points out that green militancy and megaphone journalism use &quot;catastrophe and chaos as unguided weapons with which forlornly to threaten society into behavioural change&quot;. In his words, &quot;we need to take a deep breath and pause.&quot; A 38.5cm rise in the ocean&apos;s levels is a problem, but by no means will it bring down civilisation. Last century sea levels rose by half that amount without most of us even noticing. The UN tells us that there is virtually nothing we can do that would affect climate change before 2030. So we have to ask the hard question of whether we could do better by focusing on other issues first - helping real people improve their lives and resilience so they can better deal with the world&apos;s challenges. When Nobel Laureate economists weighed up how to achieve the most good for the world in a project called the Copenhagen Consensus, they found that focusing on HIV/AIDS, malaria, malnutrition, and trade barriers should all be tackled long before we commit to any dramatic action on climate change. With the world in a fury about cutting greenhouse gases, it is easy to forget that there are other and better ways to do some good for the planet. Good decisions come from careful consideration. The IPCC report provides that. But the cacophony of screaming that has accompanied it does not help. \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2007.", "tags": ["Climate change"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-07T08:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/08/newsstory.qpr", "sentences": ["It was absolute mayhem.&quot; Shanghai Shenhua striker Gao, who could be sent home, said he had been provoked."], "title": "Football: Chinese friendly with QPR ends in blows", "article": "It was supposed to be a footballing event that built bridges, but today the Chinese Olympic team&apos;s tour of England looked like the least successful excursion since Captain Scott set off for the South Pole, following a brawl that left a member of the side unconscious.

Like Roman emperors of old, Washington&apos;s centurions already arbitrarily divide much of the world into Middle Eastern, European and Pacific domains. Now it is Africa&apos;s turn, although whether Africans will welcome (or were consulted) about this latest geo-strategic power play seems doubtful. Practical more than imperial considerations dictated the White House move. With Gulf of Guinea countries including Nigeria and Angola projected to provide one quarter of US oil imports within a decade, with growing Islamist terrorism worries in the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions, and with China prowling for resources and markets, the US plainly feels a second wind of change is blowing, necessitating increased presence and leverage. Africom&apos;s advent also follows a pattern of perhaps unparalleled military expansion under President George Bush, not all of which is explained by the 9/11 trauma. The American military-industrial complex that so troubled Dwight Eisenhower in 1961 has morphed into a boom business with truly global reach. It makes China&apos;s business-oriented People&apos;s Liberation Army look like a corner store. The Pentagon&apos;s total budget requests for fiscal year ending September 2008 have swollen to $716.5bn (\u00a3365bn). That is more than double Clinton-era spending. In contrast, Russia will spend $31bn on defence this year and China, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an estimated $87bn. With Mr Bush as head of the police academy, the US is becoming, de facto, the self-appointed global policeman it said it never wanted to be. In Africa as elsewhere, this could have the unintended effect of creating US-secured regions that are safe for rival countries to do business in - and exploit. Beijing, for example, has cause to be thankful. Sino-African trade, boosted again by the grand continental progress of President Hu Jintao this week, has risen from about $3bn in 1995 to $55.5bn last year, according to the independent Power and Interest News Report (PINR). And Chinese political cooperation is also growing, not only with &quot;rogue regimes&quot; such as Sudan and Zimbabwe but with more mainstream governments, potentially undercutting US-promoted governance standards. &quot;One of the main reasons that the African Development Bank agreed to hold its next meeting in Shanghai was that the member states would like to learn more about how China has achieved its rapid economic growth while maintaining a corrupt and non-representative political system,&quot; said PINR analyst Adam Wolfe. Yet many of these same countries are potential beneficiaries of Washington&apos;s proposed security umbrella. At the same time, the limits on what the new command will actually do there are arguably too strict. Africom will advance &quot;our common goals of peace, security, development, health, education, democracy and economic growth,&quot; Mr Bush said this week. But officials say that will not involve the stationing of extra combat troops. Nor will it mean US soldiers reinforcing badly stretched UN and African Union peacekeeping forces in Congo, Somalia or Darfur. In practice much of Africom&apos;s work is likely to involve oversight of already extensive, US-funded African capacity-building programmes, including good governance-related assistance schemes and training of security forces. In many ways it may be modelled on the Horn of Africa Taskforce set up in Djibouti after 9/11. Like smaller US military units working temporarily in countries such as Rwanda, Botswana and Liberia, the taskforce undertakes a laudable range of humanitarian and infrastructure projects including, recently, the collation of Somali folk tales. But like Africom, the Djibouti base&apos;s raison d&apos;etre remains American security and counter-terrorism, as seen in its training of Ethiopian troops and its air and sea support for the recent Ethiopian intervention in Somalia against Islamist militants. By coordinating and expanding similar operations, such as US special forces in Algeria and the 10-country &quot;Trans-Saharan Counter-Terrorism Partnership&quot;, Africom marks the official arrival of America&apos;s &quot;global war on terror&quot; on the African continent. It is a wonder they took so long.", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "US national security"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-08T15:33:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/feb/08/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1", "sentences": ["XJTLU, based in the world heritage city of Suzhou near Shanghai, opened in 2006."], "title": "Guardian Weekly Academic Jobs and Courses", "article": "IN THE FEBRUARY ISSUE OF GUARDIAN MONTHLY  Guardian Monthly is the new magazine from the Guardian and Observer for readers all over the world.

And when Jacki Penny won, she had visions of champagne class flights to Melbourne and luxury hotels with celebrities at the poolside - all feasible, she reckoned, within the overall budget promised in big print in the Tesco supermarket magazine which advertised the competition. The prize also included a trip to the Neighbours Ramsay Street set to see scenes being shot. Entrants had to write a &quot;foreign holiday postcard&quot;. Penny composed a poem about being jilted at the altar, going on the &quot;paradise honeymoon&quot; alone, meeting a millionaire and living happily ever after. But the reality of the prize was more prosaic. Far from the expected luxury, it consisted of an indirect flight to Australia via Shanghai and a stay at a business hotel near Melbourne railway station. Penny, from Somerset, calculated its value at around \u00a35,000, not \u00a310,000. She now feels jilted by the BBC. &quot;What has happened to the holiday promised in the advert?&quot; she asks, having priced direct BA flights at around \u00a33,440 (by checking Expedia) and the hotel (from the hotel&apos;s own website) at \u00a31,040. &quot;That&apos;s about \u00a34,500. Even adding in insurance, transfers and the trip to Neighbours, it can&apos;t come to more than about \u00a35,000.&quot; The prize covered flights insurance, bed and breakfast accomodation and the trip to see Neighbours, but the family must still find \u00a31,000 for food and spending money. Penny wanted to go with her son Guy, 11, her grown-up daughter Kelly and her niece Megan, 10. &quot;It had seemed like a dream come true. We could never afford a \u00a310,000 holiday. We had never been to Australia and my son is a Neighbours nut,&quot; says Penny, a professional photographer. She believes her doggerel verse caught the judges&apos; eye in the free-to-enter contest. &quot;I do a number of competitions and always check for dodgy conditions and who is offering the prize. You could hardly get a better class of prize-giver than the BBC. After all, it is backed by billions in licence payers&apos; money.&quot; The prize came from BBCRaW (reading and writing), billed as &quot;the biggest adult literacy campaign the BBC has ever undertaken&quot;. The Penny family asked BBCRaW to justify the \u00a310,000 valuation. &quot;Its PR company said to us on the phone that the \u00a35,000 balance was the cost of the Neighbours trip. That&apos;s nonsense. The actors have a free &apos;meet the cast evening&apos; once a week.&quot; In a letter, BBCRaW told her: &quot;The prize was costed at almost \u00a37,000 for the air fares alone and almost \u00a33,000 for the accommodation at the time of the promotion. The Neighbours element is a genuine money-can&apos;t-buy prize as it has been individually negotiated for this promotion. It is not to be compared with the standard tourist Neighbours tour.&quot; Penny says: &quot;If they are really spending twice as much as anyone else would need to, then you can see where my licence fee goes.&quot; BBCRaW added: &quot;The competition organisers have already bent over backwards to make arrangements better to your satisfaction and also managed to book you in over the Easter holidays, which is of course peak time.&quot; &quot;When do they expect children to travel other than in the Easter holidays?&quot; Penny asks. &quot;You can&apos;t just take kids out of school these days. Anyway, Easter is low season in Australia.&quot; The Penny family now intend to take their dispute to the Advertising Standards Authority under sections of its code dealing with &quot;misleading promotions&quot; and &quot;not causing unnecessary disappointment&quot;. Normally, complaints must be made within three months of the promotion, but the ASA can make exceptions when alleged facts take time to emerge. The broadcaster said in a statement: &quot;The BBC has been assured by the company responsible for the arrangements that the details were accurately described in the magazine.&quot; &quot;We still intend to enjoy the holiday, but it is not as promised,&quot; Penny says. &quot;Adverts should be truthful.&quot;  t.levene@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Consumer affairs", "Money", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-10T23:49:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/10/features16.theguide3", "sentences": ["Shanghai Dreams \u00a318.99, Artificial Eye Understated drama following a relocated family in 1980s China."], "title": "DVD releases: Feb 10 - 16", "article": "Film Noir Classics\u00a310.99 each, Universal An inappropriate but welcome release for Valentine&apos;s Day.

The film plays cleverly with the audience&apos;s expectations. Eccentric inventor Leslie Banks, working on a secret weapon, must be a good guy. But a year later, the quintessentially English Banks played the upper-class traitor in Ealing&apos;s Went the Day Well?, the greatest wartime thriller. Are RAF hero John Mills and MI5 operative Alastair Sim all that they seem? The film is lit by Hitchcock&apos;s regular British cameraman, Jack Cox, and the musical director is Hitch&apos;s long-time collaborator, Louis Levy. While making the film, Sim took 16-year-old Cole under his wing and helped shape his career. This DVD is augmented by a 75-minute TV play starring Sim.

Although the field is stronger than in 2006 and players will be gunning for him, he has greater resources to draw on, both physical and mental. The past year has been a steep learning curve for the Scot, who saw even his five-set defeat by Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open as a vital part of his education. &quot;I learned a lot from that match, not just from not taking my chances, but a lot about myself and the way I can play,&quot; he said. &quot;I have a lot more confidence. I served well there, I used the drop shot, my slice, I changed the pace and I was hitting the ball bigger. It was a great match to watch. I think I&apos;m better for it.&quot; Having led Nadal by two sets to one Murray, who enters this tournament with a career-high ranking of 13, was disappointed to lose 6-7, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 but he is physically stronger than a year ago and against the muscular Spaniard he showed off a more powerful serve, heavier groundstrokes and a sound volley. &quot;It shouldn&apos;t have been my match because I didn&apos;t win it, but the thing I&apos;m most happy about is that I lost the match on my terms,&quot; said the 19-year-old. &quot;I went for my shots and missed them by a few inches. I had a lot of chances in the fifth set and I just didn&apos;t take them. I wish I could have won but now I&apos;m looking forward to playing here and defending my title.&quot; He knows it will be difficult to win in San Jose again with competition from the likes of the top seed Andy Roddick, whom he upset in the semi-finals here last yar, James Blake and Marat Safin. &quot;There are lot of dangerous servers in the draw,&quot; said the Scot who, seeded No3, is on the same side of the draw as Roddick and faces the American Kevin Kim in the first round tomorrow. &quot;It&apos;s a tough draw but if I play well I can go deep. I have the confidence that I can beat guys like Roddick and Blake. It&apos;s just a matter of not playing badly in the first few rounds.&quot; Murray will be a calmer and more calculating competitor. He may have had his temper tantrums in the past two years but under his American coach Brad Gilbert he said he had learned to stay cool and focus better on the task at hand.

There are a few things to work on as to when to stay calm. A lot of it comes with experience. Everyone talks about how Federer was at 19 and he had a pretty fiery temper. It takes a little while, because I don&apos;t like losing and I like to play well all the time. It doesn&apos;t help when I do get angry but it&apos;s just because I don&apos;t like playing badly.&quot; In last year&apos;s SAP Open he shocked Roddick and the two-times grand slam champion Lleyton Hewitt en route to the title.

Many cadres, entrepreneurs and military officials are cutting corners in a rush to join the ranks of a new-money elite. Rags-to-riches-to-jail stories are increasingly common in the domestic media. But even by the standards of the world&apos;s fastest-growing major economy, Ms Wu&apos;s rise has been giddy. She is eldest of four daughters, born to a poor farmer mother and labourer father in Dongyang city, in coastal Zhejiang province, a heartland for entrepreneurs and financial speculators. Unable to afford university, she quit an accountancy course in the 1990s to manage a foot massage parlour and beauty salon, later starting a car rental company. But outside her home province, almost nothing was known of her until last August, when she registered the Bense Group, which included 12 companies, and acquired more than 100 retail outlets. In a spectacular shopping spree, she snapped up hotels, department stores, entertainment venues and internet cafes. Her businesses ranged from cosmetics to construction to car repairs. Known for dressing ostentatiously in designer clothes and driving Ferraris and BMWs, she was nicknamed &quot;wealthy Miss Dongyang&quot; by the local media. In recent weeks, she has tried to fight off rumours that her wealth came from an inheritance from a south Asian warlord, arm sales, smuggling or futures trading. &quot;All my money is clean,&quot; she said in an interview with the Nanfang Weekend newspaper, suggesting the speculation was &quot;maybe because I&apos;m a woman and young&quot;. But the case has shed light on the huge sums of money that are flowing independent of regulated financial institutions. This is particularly rife in Zhejiang, where huge loans are made among family, friends and social connections for speculative investments. Ms Wu told the paper no bank in Zhejiang would lend her the cash because they suspected her of money-laundering. Denying the allegation, she said she had been forced to borrow from friends. Guo Jun, a close associate, told reporters: &quot;Wu does borrow money on a person-to-person basis.

Salary payments for Bense staff have been delayed on at least one occasion. Rupert Hoogewerf, who publishes the Hurun Report, a list of China&apos;s wealthiest people, said his researchers had been unable to substantiate Ms Wu&apos;s assets. &quot;Nobody really knows how she broke into business or where the money came from,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot of people in China who claim to own fortunes that are very hard to prove.

Cutbacks are expected to be announced later this month at the Chinese arm of the global news and information network, which employs 37 people at London&apos;s Bush House. The World Service&apos;s Russian operation may also be cut back. The Chinese unit operates a radio station, broadcasting output in Mandarin and Cantonese on short wave, and a website - although both are regularly blocked by the country&apos;s government. If the cuts are confirmed, the restructure would come as the Chinese government comes under increasing scrutiny for censoring outside news sources such as the BBC and Google. There was bemusement among World Service staff at the prospect of cuts. &quot;There is clearly a problem with China blocking outside news organisations, but sooner or later it is going to open up again and you want to still be there when it happens,&quot; said one source. Other staff members said the cuts would be fiercely resisted, with a plan already in place to set up a &quot;Save the Chinese Service&quot; petition if they are severe. Awareness of the BBC in China has dwindled in recent years. According to the most recent World Service annual report, just 8% of respondents in Beijing, Shenyang, Chengdu and Shanghai were aware of the corporation in 2005-06, compared with 21.6% in 2004-05. The World Service&apos;s reach in those areas fell from 2.2% to 0.3% over the same period, according to the report. Bush House axed 10 foreign-language services last year, part of a shift in emphasis that saw \u00a319m pumped into its new Arabic TV news channel. The Thai-language arm was closed just months before a military coup in the country last September. The BBC said it had been closed because it was making &quot;minimal impact&quot; in the region. Separately, World Service bosses are planning an internal reorganisation that will see all its Arabic radio, TV and online services move under one roof in Egton House, next to Broadcasting House in London&apos;s West End. BBC management will meet staff representatives over the future of the China service on February 22. The World Service has a record weekly global audience of 163 million, up 10 million on the previous high in 2001. It has a budget of \u00a3245m for 2006-07, up from \u00a3239m in 2005-06. A World Service spokesman said: &quot;BBC World Service is looking at ways to strengthen its service to listeners in China against a background of persistent frequency interference to our shortwave broadcasts and effective blocking of our online services in the country. &quot;The principles that underpin and shape the review are that news and current affairs are important and any changes will be designed to enhance the impact of our multimedia services for China. &quot;Therefore we will be looking to re-allocate resources so we can improve our coverage of domestic Chinese issues, both for the Chinese audience and across the whole of BBC World Service, while maintaining our international news current affairs output; and ensuring that programmes are broadcast at times when they have the most impact. &quot;Any implications from the review will, of course, be discussed with the staff and the unions.&quot; The BBC broadcasts around four hours of programmes a day in Mandarin, around half of which is news output and the rest features. BBC Chinese also airs news bulletins in Cantonese. The radio station has a Chinese audience of 850,000 - 0.1% of the population. Its website, BBCChinese.com, gets 8m page impressions a month despite being heavily blocked. Listening online is as popular as listening on shortwave.

Official data showed retail sales tumbled at their fastest rate for four years in spite of the heaviest discounting for the past six months.   Retail analyst Richard Ratner at Seymour Pierce said it was dangerous to look at one month in isolation but the report &quot;could also be confirmation that the consumer has had its last spurt over Christmas, and is now spent-up, especially in &apos;big ticket&apos;&quot;.   &quot;Anecdotal evidence is suggesting that this could be happening, especially with the slowing housing market,&quot; he added.

Elsewhere among the fallers, profit-taking hurt shares in building materials supplier Wolseley. After topping the FTSE 100 gainers on talk of private equity interest yesterday, today it led the fallers, down 32p at \u00a313.75.   The leaders board top spot went to business and science publishing giant Reed Elsevier. It rose 40p, or 6.6%, to 644.5p after announcing it wants to sell off its education division. Analysts say the sale, announced alongside Reed&apos;s latest results, could raise some \u00a32bn.   Shares in rival publisher Pearson were up 15p to 831.5p. Further down the market, publishing and conferences group Informa was up 26p, or 4.6%, at 595p.   Back on the FTSE 100, Diageo was one of the biggest risers as the drinks group raised its full-year growth guidance. The Guinness and Gordon&apos;s gin maker said it now expected organic operating profit growth of 8% compared with a previous forecast of 7%. The shares closed up 24p, or 2.4%, at \u00a310.45.   Elsewhere in the drinks sector there was support from reports of a possible merger between brewer InBev and Anheuser-Busch. The consolidation talk helped lift SABMiller 22p, or 1.9%, to \u00a311.98 and Scottish &amp; Newcastle 13p to 579p.   Positive broker notes lifted BAE Systems to make the shares second in the list of top performers, up 11.25p, or 2.5%, at 454p.   Among the midcaps, EMI rebounded somewhat after yesterday&apos;s profit warning sparked a 12% slide in the share price. The shares were up 8.25p, or 3.9%, at 219p as speculation of a takeover bid for the world&apos;s third-largest music company provided support. EMI&apos;s weaker share price and news of a continuing struggle in North America was also seen as making a Warner Music takeover more likely once the regulatory situation becomes clearer. The rivals have both bid for the other in the past but most analysts now believe Warner will be the one driving any tie-up.   Analysts at UBS cut their price target on EMI to 225p from 280p and maintained a &quot;neutral&quot; rating on the stock. Credit Suisse cut its target to 280p from 300p and Panmure Gordon cut its target to 181p from 225p. Lehman Brothers kept its &quot;equal-weight&quot; recommendation but cut the price target to 230p from 255p.   &quot;Given that weaker releases appear to be responsible for only a small part of the weakness so far this year, and the physical declines for retailers in other markets are likely to follow those in the US, without a significant reduction in internet piracy, this would imply the market could remain tough for the next couple of years,&quot; said Lehman&apos;s Richard Jones.   Elsewhere among the midcaps, UK Coal added to yesterday&apos;s strong gains to hit a record high on talk it could soon get approval for a new development site in West Yorkshire. They hit 475.75p early on before easing back to close at 473.5p, still up 31p on the day.   Smallcap retailer Blacks Leisure ended down 14p, or 4.5% lower, as 295p after Mike Ashley&apos;s Sports Direct International said last night it had no intention of bidding for the owner of Millets, Blacks and O&apos;Neill. Following the news, analysts at Numis cut their price target on Blacks to 310p from 370p.   Back on Aim, RC Group, which provides biometric identification products, climbed after it announced new contracts in the Middle East.   The shares rose 2.75p, or 2.5%, to 113.75p after the group flagged up sales orders from Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and a new contract to provide a United Arab Emirates bank with fingerprint recognition-based security systems for more than 50 branches in Dubai.   Elsewhere on the junior stock market, executive recruitment specialists Hexagon Human Capital made a strong debut, floating at 165p and climbing to 190.5p by the close.

The 1989 Beijing massacre by Wu Wenjian While the year of the pig under the Chinese lunar calendar begins this Sunday, the art world is chanting a loud mantra: &quot;China is hot&quot;. But is white-hot press coverage and blazing auction house sales blinding critics and collectors to much of Chinese contemporary art&apos;s questionable quality, hype and inevitable burnout? For the works currently being publicized and promoted in the west - predominantly &quot;cynical realist&quot; paintings satirically juxtaposing capitalism and communism - the answer is yes. Because this theme is inherently interesting and important, these painters&apos; unskilled self-consciousness, lack of subtlety and reliance on adolescent irony, particularly when confronting the ideological, historical, spiritual and aesthetic conflicts that roil contemporary Chinese culture, is especially disappointing. Visiting Shanghai and the Yunnan in late 2005, I was overwhelmed by China&apos;s sharp and pervasive social contrasts. But a Wang Guangyi canvas that interposes workers wearing the gleaming strained grins that the cultural revolution required for propaganda painting imagery with the names of luxury western brands does not satirize these cultural contradictions - it transforms art into another cheaply made and too easily consumed, high-priced commodity. Equally upsetting is the willingness of western audiences to patronize instead of challenge such artists, whose facile work panders to western expectations. The impact of that work&apos;s popularity in the west is not benign. Instead, it exacerbates some of capitalism&apos;s destructive by-products by debasing genuine creative impulses. Although interest in Chinese contemporary art has only recently emerged, the market is already beginning to be flooded with fakes. The sad reality is that, like China&apos;s infamous designer knockoffs, Chinese artefacts and now paintings satirizing capitalist product fetishism are beginning to be cynically produced en mass to cater to the tastes of western buyers. Though not all western collectors of contemporary Chinese work are motivated by mercenary impulses, even the most sincere collectors&apos; interests do not assure long-term value for the current crop of cynical realist stars. As with the sale of art from other developing regions, such as the Middle East, the majority of western collectors purchasing this work appear to be businessmen or people with professional and personal ties to the country. Having witnessed and aided China&apos;s transition to capitalism, they are buying a piece of their personal history as well as preserving a part of China&apos;s culture for posterity. But these sincere collectors&apos; motives need to be recognised as too limited and subjective to translate into long-term international aesthetic interest and ratification. It is unfair to disparage the work of this generation of artists as merely derivative of western art, since contemporary Chinese artists and audiences were only introduced to recent western art when Deng Xiaoping opened China to it in the late 197O&apos;s. But it would also be unfair not to wait and evaluate the art that China makes when the shock of its culture clashes with the west subsides and true indigenous contemporary art emerges?", "tags": ["The art market", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-16T12:38:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/16/marketforces", "sentences": ["It happened too late to prompt a move, but news that a Shanghai-based mobile content group is interested in buying the ringtone specialist MonsterMob should make for an early rise in the Aim-listed group&apos;s shares today."], "title": "Market forces: Drinks sector raises a glass to upbeat Diageo", "article": "It happened too late to prompt a move, but news that a Shanghai-based mobile content group is interested in buying the ringtone specialist MonsterMob should make for an early rise in the Aim-listed group&apos;s shares today.

It was drinks that dominated the FTSE 100&apos;s leader board yesterday as a sunny outlook from the drinks firm Diageo and the prospect of sector consolidation lifted major brewers. Those gains combined with a jump in publisher Reed Elsevier&apos;s shares to erase early losses and put the index at a fresh six-year high by the close. The FTSE 100 closed up 12.1 points, or 0.2%, at 6422.9, having had a subdued start to the day with pressure from a surprise tumble in January shop sales. Official data showed retail sales falling at their fastest rate for four years in spite of the heaviest discounting for the past six months.

After topping the FTSE 100 gainers on talk of private equity interest on Wednesday, yesterday it led the fallers, down 32p at \u00a313.75. Top spot on the leaders board went to the business and science publisher Reed Elsevier. It rose 40p, or 6.6%, to 644.5p after announcing it wants to sell off its education division.

The mood wasn&apos;t helped by a downbeat report on US consumer sentiment, with the University of Michigan survey showing an unexpected fall in February following a two-year high for January.   The FTSE 100&apos;s top losers board featured some of yesterday&apos;s top gainers as profit-taking took its toll. Reed Elsevier was one of the biggest fallers. The shares had shot up almost 7% yesterday after the Anglo-Dutch publishing giant said it wanted to sell its education business. Today they closed down 8.5p, or 1.3%, at 636p.   Scottish &amp; Newcastle was on the way up yesterday on consolidation talk in the drinks sector but today it was on the way down and lost 11.5p to 567.5p.

Antofagasta lost 3.5p to 485p, BHP Billiton slipped 5.5p, or 0.5%, to 1089.5p, while Vedanta Resources was hardest hit, down 18p, or 1.4%, at \u00a312.86, having recently been one of the strongest performing miners on hopes it could get a bid as consolidation spreads through the sector. Anglo American, which reports next week, fell 32p to \u00a325.38 after analysts at Numis cut their recommendation to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot;.   Banks and other financial sector stocks hogged much of the limelight among the risers making up for a subdued day on Thursday. Royal Bank of Scotland was up 16p at \u00a321.17, investment managers Amvescap added 9.5p to 632p, Legal &amp; General edged up 1p to 165.5p and Aviva added 4p to 851.5p.   In a market short on corporate news, B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher topped the gainers after a price target lift to 290p from 286p by analysts at HSBC. The shares ended up 8.75p, or 3.5%, at 259.75p.   Catering group Compass was also in the top 10 climbers list, up 2.75p to 312p after revealing there had been &quot;significant interest&quot; in Selecta, the European snacks vending machine business it put up for sale last November.   Analysts believe the Selecta sale could bring in as much as \u00a3800m for Compass, which is the world&apos;s biggest catering company.   It gave no detail on potential buyers today but among the frontrunners is thought to be private equity group Charterhouse Capital Partners, which already owns rival vending business Autobar.   Among the midcaps, transport group Go-Ahead was down slightly despite posting a 17% increase in first-half profits and saying it is confident on prospects for the full year.   The shares were little moved by the news, down 10p at \u00a323.40, but analysts noted good prospects going forward.   &quot;The interim results highlight another strong trading performance,&quot; said Investec&apos;s Matthew Gerard, who has a &quot;hold&quot; recommendation on Go Ahead.   &quot;After a benign share price performance over the three months (relative to the sector), with fuel costs reducing and a projected turnaround in aviation, we believe the shares are starting to look good value.&quot;   Further down the market, troubled iSoft was up 4.75p, or 10.6%, at 49.75p after the Australian health information company IBA Health emerged as a possible rescue bidder for the NHS software supplier.   Media group GCap, home to Classic FM and Capital radio, was one of the day&apos;s biggest fallers after a major placing. The group&apos;s smallcap shares fell 23.75p, or 9.9%, to 217p after UBS placed 13.6m shares.   That amounted to 8.3% of the company and market talk was that Morgan Stanley was selling its shares following a 20% rise over the last two months. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.   There were some similarly big moves in the food world. Aim-listed cake maker Inter Link Foods slumped 96p, or 28.4%, to 241.5p after it said it will miss market forecasts for the current year. Ready meal and biscuit group Northern Foods also fell, ending down 3.75p, or 2.8% lower, at 131.25p. But back on Aim, cereal bar group Glisten rose as the bad news from the cake-making world whetted traders&apos; appetites for health foods. The shares ended up 8.5p, or 2.1%, to 413.5p.   Shares in 2ergo shot to their highest ever level - up 18p at 326.5p- as the text messaging to mobile video services group published plans to demerge its secure mobile communications and payments platform, slapping a value of just under \u00a320m on the business.   The Lancashire-based company has been developing the unit under the 2safeguard name but upon demerger on March 6 the Aim-listed firm will be renamed Broca after 19-century French scientist Paul Broca, who carried out pioneering work on the localisation of brain functions and is considered one of the founders of modern neurosurgery.   Property group Speymill was on the way up after an upbeat trading statement predicting full-year results &quot;in line with expectations&quot;. The group, which has invested in property in Macau and Germany, has recently won a contract for a 150-bed safari hotel at Chessington World of Adventure. The shares rose 2p, or 2.5%, to 83p.

If you want to play with the big boys during new year celebrations, you&apos;ll have to travel a lot further afield than Scotland; and you can forget the end of December, too. Six thousand miles and February will get you the real deal. There are few things quite as full-on as the Chinese new year. Rather than a frenzied, be-kilted piss-up crammed into one night, the festivities last for two glorious weeks, from new moon (tomorrow) to full moon. Tradition dictates a rigorous schedule of family-oriented events: a big feast on New Year&apos;s Eve, dealing with the ancestors and in-laws for a couple of days, schmoozing the God of Wealth on day five, and hanging out with your mates on day 10. It&apos;s topped off with a lantern ceremony on the last night. But, like the rest of China, the traditions are changing fast and these days are only strictly observed in remote, rural areas. I joined the tasselled (rather than tinselled) revelry to see in the Year of the Pig in Pingyao, a beautiful and ancient walled city in Shanxi province built during the Ming and Qing dynasties. It&apos;s a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon kind of place; picturesque tiled rooftops sweep down into lanes and courtyards, ruined mansions and willow-patterned pagodas appear mysteriously out of the icy mist, and extraordinary, cantilevered gate-houses loom on the horizon. Western tourists are something of a novelty in Pingyao; it&apos;s geared to the domestic market, which makes it all the more interesting. After dodging a local television crew who were pursuing me for a spot of exotic colour, I was invited to the festival preparations in a local hotel. A fierce fire raged in the courtyard to entice good fortune and prosperity, bright red and gold couplets (good luck messages) were pasted around the doors, and complicated paper cut-outs (like fanciful doilies) adorned windows. Dumplings were being made and I was expected to join in and demonstrate my culinary skills. About 30 clapping and snapping people surrounded me, cheering and photographing each misshaped dumpling I produced, and I began to feel like a celebrity at a garden fete or a contestant on The Generation Game. My new year&apos;s feast was held in a small private dining room at the top of a local restaurant with a group of sophisticates from Beijing. Private dining is de rigueur in China and feels decadent. Huge amounts of food (read noodles and pork, lots of pork; the only porcine dish I didn&apos;t scoff during my stay in Shanxi was the one made with his squeak) was washed down with the local hooch. Chinese white wine is a misnomer; also known as green bamboo, it&apos;s 45% alcohol by volume and lethal. We toasted prosperity at least 10 times, and got more than a little shaky. Chinese new year is synonymous with fireworks. The street outside was like a war zone. Red fire-cracker ammo belts three metres long were thrown into the roadside, and enormous roman candles, bangers and tiny rockets went off constantly. The noise was incredible. I stood on the pavement and loved every second as the city was thrown in and out of silhouette by distant incendiaries. A gaudily lit pagoda outlined in strings of green lights illuminated boys nonchalantly launching small rockets from their gloved hands. It was a pyromaniac&apos;s dream. Defying tradition, the lantern ceremony began on the first day rather than the last. A garish tunnel of fairy lights fed revellers into a large courtyard where they warmed themselves by a huge fire. Enormous, surreal articulated models filled an adjacent compound. Gargantuan babies clutching fish, rats getting chummy with pandas, helicopters, spaceships, galleons, a trio of gods and other assorted creatures were constructed in lurid materials over cane frames. They were automated and moved jerkily like fabric fairground attractions. Lion and dragon dancing was promised, but the lights failed; the crowd, now chilled to the bone, stampeded for the exit. I decided to move on to a tiered auditorium hung with red lanterns and full of people sitting at tables smoking, drinking and chatting, which was the setting for a series of revue acts put on for Chinese tourists; it was a wonderful amateur hash, a raucous oriental pantomime complete with bubble machine.  Back to the relit lantern ceremony, where the dragon eventually arrived - a wonderful beast with satanic red eyes and a swirling, sinuous body. The crowds were pushed back as the dragon whooshed past spitting fire. (OK, it was a roman candle, but we won&apos;t quibble.) The whole shambolic gig came away at the seams, but it was heartfelt entertainment. On the way back to my hotel, I checked out the neighbourhood&apos;s only funky bar. It felt like a beach bar, except the weather was arctic; the entrance had a secondary door of thick plastic, such as you&apos;d find outside an industrial freezer. Pingyao International Financier Club is a peculiar name for a hotel. The yuppie tag derives from its location; the city was the birthplace of modern banking and known as the Wall Street of the East until the early 20th century. The hotel is like a miniature Shrager, in that the reception area is the centrepiece. Instead of the plastic found elsewhere, the outside doors are cloaked with padded purple satin curtains like eiderdowns; the interiors are chic, but you need to keep your coat to hand, as temperatures outside the bedrooms never quite get above freezing.  On day two, cheap plaster Buddhas and Prosperity Gods were arranged on the ground outside the city walls. A crowd threw cane hoops at them in a bid to bag a deity. Nearby was a bizarre freak show. Trestle tables piled up with desiccated road-kill and pickling jars filled with unrecognisable creatures looked like a macabre WI market. Some cages housed a live menagerie that included chickens, a peacock without a tail and hairy beaver-like animals. Two girls behind me took one look and ran out shrieking. I followed their lead. Pingyao is like a low-tech, ancient theme park. It&apos;s strangely Victorian, the pantomime revue and freak show belonging to another time. Yet there are modern overtones: street vendors don&apos;t bother shouting their wares, they use megaphones with a recorded cry on a loop that sounds oddly synthetic. A few hundred miles to the east is Shanghai and another world. The contrast couldn&apos;t be greater; from the bumbling simplicity of the ancient to the sleekness of the new ultra-city. I wasn&apos;t prepared for the scale: 22 million people cram the megalopolis and vast swathes of the cityscape have been rebuilt sky-high over the past 15 years. The ugly-beautiful modern parts look as though they were designed by a 1950s comic book illustrator; this is a 21st-century city that Buck Rogers would recognise instantly. The only thing missing is personal jet-packs, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s only a matter of time before they arrive. In Yuyuan district - an old part of the city where buildings are punctured with bamboo washing poles that look like acupuncture for the architectural - the lantern festival was 10 times the size of its country cousin&apos;s and a hundred times gaudier. All the shops and stalls were selling seasonal boxes of oranges and biscuits, the packaging as polished as anything you&apos;d find on Bond Street. Thousands flocked to the markets and made their last festive visits to a Buddhist temple marooned in the hubbub of the city. But after only a week of celebrations the urbanites were already thinking of getting back to the desk or building site.  Shanghai is a city that likes to shop and eat; apart from the customary New Year&apos;s Eve family banquet, the entire population seemed intent on getting out on to the street to do what they do best; and to hell with tradition. The opulence was dazzling. Brown South Sea pearls the size of marbles jostled in shop windows with gobbets of green jade and diamond rings. Mink was the fur of choice for well-clad ladies. It&apos;s also a city of extremes; you can pick up 10 imitation Mont Blanc pens for a fiver in the fake market, and a meal can cost less than a coffee from Starbucks. I visited a grotty, steaming cafe and had some of the best food of my trip, washing it down with a bottle of Beijing Two Pot - a liquor of startling 55% ABV potency. This feast for two, including the firewater, cost less than \u00a33. Shanghai works best at night. Futuristic electronic billboards 50 storeys high, wishing the populace season&apos;s greetings, have come straight out of Blade Runner. Neon-lit beauty salons and massage parlours are everywhere. For 60 yuan a blind man mauled my feet in what was simultaneously the most agonising and refreshing pedicure of my life. Dodgy bars are full of cardsharps, and whole streets of tailors are ready to run up suits for pennies at any time of day - or night. But perhaps the single most striking thing about both Shanxi and Shanghai is the accessibility. I speak no Mandarin, except a few pidgin phrases I picked up along the way, yet found them easy to navigate. Xin nian hao, as folks will be saying soon. Happy new year. Way to go Getting there The next Chinese new year is on February 4 2008, the Year of the Rat.

The London blue-chip index closed down 13.8 points, or 0.2%, at 6419.5. It spent the morning in the red and came under further pressure later on as traders digested comments from Microsoft that analysts&apos; revenue forecasts for the Vista system were &quot;overly aggressive&quot;. The mood wasn&apos;t helped by a downbeat report on US consumer sentiment, with the University of Michigan survey showing an unexpected fall this month following a two-year high for January. The FTSE 100&apos;s top losers featured some of Thursday&apos;s top gainers as profit-taking took its toll. Reed Elsevier was a big faller. The shares had shot up almost 7% on Thursday after the publisher said it wanted to sell its education business. Last night they closed down 8.5p, or 1.3%, at 636p. Scottish &amp; Newcastle followed a similar pattern. Gains on Thursday&apos;s merger talk gave way to a fall of 11.5p to 567.5p yesterday. A pause in the latest copper price rally put some of the big miners under pressure. Antofagasta lost 3.5p to 485p; BHP Billiton slipped 5.5p to 1089.5p, while Vedanta Resources was hardest hit, down 18p at \u00a312.86, having recently been one of the strongest performing miners on bid hopes. Anglo American, which reports next week, fell 32p to \u00a325.38 after analysts at Numis cut their recommendation to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot;. Financial-sector stocks hogged much of the limelight among risers, making up for a subdued day on Thursday. Royal Bank of Scotland was up 16p at \u00a321.17; the investment managers Amvescap added 9.5p to 632p; Legal &amp; General edged up 1p to 165.5p, and Aviva added 4p to 851.5p. In a market short on corporate news, B&amp;Q&apos;s owner Kingfisher topped the gainers after a small price target lift to 290p from 286p by HSBC analysts. The shares rose 8.75p, or 3.5%, at 259.75p. The catering group Compass was also among the top 10 risers, up 2.75p to 312p, after saying there had been &quot;significant interest&quot; in Selecta, the European snacks vending machine business it put up for sale late last year. Analysts believe the Selecta sale could bring in as much as \u00a3800m for Compass. One frontrunner is thought to be the private equity group Charterhouse Capital Partners, which already owns the rival vending business Autobar. Among the midcaps, the transport group Go-Ahead was down slightly despite posting a 17% rise in first-half profits and saying it was confident about prospects for the full year. The shares were little moved by the news, down 10p at \u00a323.40, but analysts noted good prospects. Investec&apos;s Matthew Gerard, who has a &quot;hold&quot; recommendation, said: &quot;The interim results highlight another strong trading performance ... the shares are starting to look good value.&quot; Further down, iSoft was up 4.75p, or 10.6%, at 49.75p after the Australian health information company IBA Health emerged as a possible rescue-bidder for the NHS software supplier. The media group GCap, home to Classic FM and Capital radio, was a big faller after a major placing. It fell 23.75p, or 9.9%, to 217p after UBS placed 13.6m shares. That amounted to 8.3% of the company and market talk was that Morgan Stanley was selling its shares after a 20% rise in the last two months. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. There were some similarly big moves in the food world. The Aim-listed cake-maker Inter Link Foods slumped 96p, or 28.4%, to 241.5p after admitting it would miss market forecasts for the year. The ready meal and biscuit group Northern Foods also fell, ending down 3.75p, or 2.8% lower, at 131.25p. But back on Aim, the cereal bar group Glisten rose as the bad news from the cake-making world whetted traders&apos; appetites for health foods. The shares ended up 8.5p, or 2.1%, to 413.5p. Shares in 2ergo shot to their highest ever level - up 18p at 326.5p - as the text-messaging to mobile video services group published plans to demerge its secure mobile communications and payments platform, slapping a value of just under \u00a320m on the business. The Lancashire-based company has been developing the unit under the 2safeguard name but upon demerger on March 6 the Aim-listed firm will be renamed Broca after the 19th-century French scientist Paul Broca, who carried out pioneering work on the localisation of brain functions and is seen as one of the founders of modern neurosurgery. The property group Speymill was also on the way up after an upbeat trading statement predicting full-year results &quot;in line with expectations&quot;. The group, which has invested in property in Macau and Germany, has recently won a contract for a 150-bed safari hotel at Chessington World of Adventure. The shares rose 2p, or 2.5%, to 83p. Elsewhere on Aim, the ringtone firm MonsterMob jumped 10.25p, or 25%, to 51.25p after Thursday&apos;s news of a possible bid from the Shanghai-based mobile content group Linktone. Management are looking into Linktone&apos;s interest and there should be some clarity at Monstermob&apos;s EGM next week. Bonjour Tristel Superbug fighters Tristel are worth taking a look at on Monday. The disinfectant specialists are due to report half-year results and analysts suspect profits could be up by as much as 20%. The group has previously focused on products using chlorine dioxide to decontaminate hospital instruments but is branching out into an odourless treatment that can clean floors and walls. Tristel is in 375 UK hospitals - 60% - and hopes the new cleaner will be a big seller this year as the NHS continues to focus on fighting MRSA. Investors will also be awaiting an update on the Aim-listed group&apos;s recent acquisition, Vernagene. Bought for \u00a31m last summer, the business is helping Tristel expand into water treatment and food processing.

In fact, she has no design training at all (and, by all accounts, can&apos;t draw for toffee). She has, however, spent nearly two decades at the epicentre of the fashion industry, notching up 23 Vogue covers and a few million in the bank along the way. She is, of course, Kate Moss. Back in September last year, when Moss&apos;s new role as designer of her own Topshop range was still just an unconfirmed rumour, it had already attracted the kind of column inches most British designers spend their careers dreaming of. When the 90 -piece range finally hits stores on May 1, scenes of mass hysteria are pretty much guaranteed. Few have thought to quibble with Moss&apos; transition from wearing clothes to designing them - she is, after all, simply the latest and most high profile example of a growing trend. Elle Macpherson long ago graduated from life as a supermodel to being head of a thriving empire. Jovovich-Hawk, designed by Milla Jovovich and Carmen Hawk - both successful models - has in the past 18 months become one of the most critically acclaimed small labels at New York fashion week. A stint on the catwalk is starting to look like an even better leg-up in the designer ranks than an eye-catching degree show or an internship at Armani. Kate Moss is as famous for her wardrobe, these days, as she was for her waif-like figure 15 years ago. She has a very finely tuned instinct for spotting a trend early; combined with the ability to impart sex appeal to the most unlikely garments, she creates a virtuous circle: she spots something that could be come a trend, she wears it, and by wearing it she guarantees it catches on. Why, even Hunter wellies, favoured footwear of pig farmers and fishermen, were imbued with glamour the moment Moss sported them backstage at a music festival. Even at the height of her cover-girl fame, Elle Macpherson &quot;never felt comfortable about making my career out of modelling. I was a surfer chick studying law in Sydney; I started modelling to pay for school books. Fashion never really resonated with me , but five years into my career I had done a lot of lingerie shoots, and I realised I could use my experience , along with the recognition I had, to launch a company. It was a business decision.&quot; Macpherson was by no means the first model to cross over to designing - Twiggy put her name to a range of dresses back in the 1960s - but her success as a businesswoman has altered perceptions of life beyond the catwalk. Today, she is creative director of lingerie brand Elle Macpherson Intimates, a role which involves &quot;working on design, packaging and behind-thescenes stuff, as well as getting out front and selling it to the public &quot;. Although Macpherson modelled early collections herself, she no longer does so; our chat today is scheduled between business meetings rather than shoots. Other ex-models have turned to design as a creative outlet rather than a business one. When Milla Jovovich and Carmen Hawk launched their label four years ago, they stitched the first collection by hand in their apartments. These days, after several seasons notching up good reviews and prestigious stockists, they can hire staff - but the mood of the collection remains cerebral rather than commercial. References include Gertie Stein and Katharine Hepburn rather than, say, Mischa Barton and Kate Bosworth. Nonetheless, many of those in the fashion industry who have a real knowledge of and passion for design are concerned that the &quot;model &quot; ranges are symptomatic of a &quot;dumbing down &quot; of fashion. Willie Walters, fashion course director at Central St Martins, admits to being &quot;thoroughly fed up&quot; with &quot;the whole celebrity thing. In fact, if I thought about it too much I would probably give up and go home. But I don&apos;t pay it much attention. I see it as ephemera. It has nothing to do with serious fashion design.&quot; Does it devalue the training St Martins stands for ? &quot;There probably are people out there stupid enough to think that all you need to be a designer is to be famous and thin. But luckily, I don&apos;t have to deal with those people very often.&quot; Savannah Miller, St Martins alumni (with a First, no less) and sister of Sienna, is in a unique position on the training-versus-celebrity debate. While a student, she did a stint at Alexander McQueen; since graduating she has designed knitwear for Anya Hindmarch and Shanghai Tang. She has just fi nished work on the first collection for her own label Twenty8Twelve - a collaboration with Sienna, whose designing qualification is that she is already a high-street fashion icon. The Millers are savvy enough to realise that Sienna&apos;s profile and proven ability as a clothes horse is a crucial element of their appeal. &quot;Sienna&apos;s clothes were being ripped off left right and centre, and usually really badly. And then the opportunity for backing came up&quot; - from Pepe Jeans boss Carlos Ortega - &quot;and we thought , there&apos;s something happening here that we may as well take advantage of. It&apos;s an opportunity for me as a designer - and I think it could do great things for Sienna&apos;s public image, because it&apos;s a very sophisticated collection, not like some of the rubbish in the shops supposedly inspired by her.&quot; Twenty8Twelve will blend the sisters&apos; personal styles. &quot;I&apos;m very romantic, and Sienna&apos;s more rock&apos;n &apos;roll, and the amalgamation makes something quite unique. So the first collection has elements that are very ethereal and pretty, and others that are more Dickensian - quite dark and eerie. Ultimately, we are designing clothes we want to wear - we&apos;re not trying to be Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, much as I would adore to be able to do what he does. We are just trying to make beautiful clothes which are fl attering, and which women will want to wear. That&apos;s quite enough of a challenge in itself.&quot; Savannah insists that Sienna was involved at every stage of the process. &quot;The collection began with ideas from both of us, and our co-designer . As it turned out, we were all thinking along the same lines. From there we did visual research, and made mood boards, and then started drawing. Most of that was done by me and the team, because of Sienna&apos;s filming schedule, but she was constantly emailing and web-chatting. She can draw, too.&quot; In this, Sienna may be the exception. As Willie Walters puts it, &quot;Milla and Kate may be savvy young women, with a good eye - and of course, think how much incredible fashion Kate&apos;s seen over the years - but I don&apos;t imagine they are sitting down with a sketchbook.&quot; The &quot;Kate Moss Topshop &quot; collection is heavily under wraps until an exclusive in the April edition of Vogue , but a Topshop spokesman will reveal that it had a slightly different modus operandi. &quot;Kate doesn&apos;t draw, but she was heavily involved in the design process. She has worked alongside the team, bringing in things she found in vintage stores. And she&apos;s the fit model, so she tries everything on to make sure it&apos;s right. When you see the collection, it&apos;s very her.&quot; What&apos;s more, says Topshop, the way the collection will be stocked refl ects how Moss would wear the clothes. So rather than being strictly divided into seasons, there will be hotpants alongside sweaters - because that&apos;s how Moss dresses. This is important, because it refl ects the fact that the emphasis of fashion has shifted from the cut and construction of a garment to how a look has put together. As Savannah Miller says, &quot;it&apos;s all about how you wear clothes. I might come up with a pretty silk dress, but Sienna will put it on with thick tights and killer shoes and yesterday&apos;s make-up, and suddenly it looks rock hard.&quot; Fashion purists would argue that this way of viewing fashion - that how you &quot;style &quot; or put together your clothes has as much impact as the intrinsic nature of the clothes themselves - is further evidence of the dumbing down of fashion. Those designers who are seen in the fashion industry as lacking in substance are often dismissed as being &quot;just stylists&quot;, meaning that they are merely tweaking and rearranging fashion material that is already out there. Interior designers, as opposed to architects, as one comparison has it. Be this as it may, however, the ubiquity of Rachel Zoe has left no one in any doubt that stylists - particularly those who occupy that space on the Venn diagram where styling and celebrity intersect - are increasingly infl uential. Indeed, Zoe already puts her name to a line of handbags for Judith Leiber, and there are rumours of an own-label clothing brand. It is possible to see the model-designer phenomenon in an altogether more positive light. It is, after all, part and parcel of the democratisation of fashion over the past decade, which has seen trends go on sale to Primark shoppers just as quickly as they are available to those with Harvey Nichols&apos; personal shoppers on speed dial. Fashion is no longer just about what women are wearing on the Givenchy catwalk, but what they are wearing at Glastonbury; the must-have designer buy of the season might be by Viktor &amp; Rolf for H&amp;M, or Giles Deacon for New Look. And ultimately, while the celebrity angle might get a label a fast fix of column inches, if the public don&apos;t buy it, it will vanish as quickly as it appeared. &quot;I do realise some people are going to be out to get us,&quot; says Savannah Miller of her label&apos;s celebrity connections. &quot;But I&apos;ve got a fantastic team, and ultimately the clothes speak for themselves. The fashion press will be hard-pressed not to like the clothes. Even though I know they don&apos;t want to.&quot;", "tags": ["Topshop", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Models"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-17T23:58:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/feb/20/chinawillshaketheartworld", "sentences": ["Ken Livingstone has had an office in Shanghai since April 2006 (it may be the Beijing Olympics but he knows which city he can have more fun in) and last year pushed out a large press incentive for arts organisers to put on an event for China in London.", "In Liverpool, sister city to Shanghai, the International Biennial 2008 will focus on China and a UK-wide arts programme, China Now, will sweep the country."], "title": "China will shake the art world yet", "article": "Photograph by Xing Danwen from the exhibition China Contemporary: Fantasy Landscapes at Asia House in 2006. Photograph: Joseph Alford Last week Ana Finel Honigman wrote about the art world&apos;s current appetite for Chinese contemporary art and suggested that western audiences are buying up the country&apos;s art regardless of quality and originality. There is no doubt that many gallerists and collectors have been exploiting the Chinese art market for some years now, whipping up the hype - and the prices. In turn artists have submitted to the demand by producing canvases (easily transported and sold) of communist iconography ironically commenting on Mao&apos;s China. When I visited China to research the contemporary art scene I met a very successful artist whose studio was divided in two; the work he sold to western clients displayed on one side, and tucked away his own, personal practice. One can blame the artist for pandering to this trend - but he has watched his friends get rich, buy cars, get the girls (for these artists are invariably male) and assume almost superstar status. One can blame the collector for treating art as pure investment without considering quality or one can blame the predominantly western dealer who has set out to pair these two. Money is certainly the ultimate vice for creativity. However things are set to change. In the UK we will see a huge surge of interest in China over the next year as the government endeavors to make as many links with the country during the run-up to the Beijing Olympics. Ken Livingstone has had an office in Shanghai since April 2006 (it may be the Beijing Olympics but he knows which city he can have more fun in) and last year pushed out a large press incentive for arts organisers to put on an event for China in London. In Liverpool, sister city to Shanghai, the International Biennial 2008 will focus on China and a UK-wide arts programme, China Now, will sweep the country. All this backed by the government and companies keen to offer corporate sponsorship related to that vast market they hope to crack. Perhaps then we will see the genuinely innovative work being made by the young generation in China today. It is unfair however to focus only on this work, for it is by no means the only art being shown to western audiences and perhaps just a sad symptom of sudden hype seen in any counterfeit item. I would disagree with Ana Finel Honigman&apos;s view that the &quot;shock of [China&apos;s] culture clashes with the west&quot; needs to subside for the country&apos;s true artistic talent to emerge. In fact, this very cultural collision has been a perfect catalyst for the new generation of excellent artists emerging from China, some already &quot;accepted&quot; by the Western art world (artists such as Cao Fei, Liu Zheng, Xing Danwen and Yang Fudong to name a few). France and Germany have been years ahead in showcasing strong and thoughtful contemporary art from China. Exhibitions such as Living in Time (2001) in Berlin, Paris Pekin (2002) and Alors, le Chine? (2003) in Paris, have been slowly followed by UK institutions such as the 2005/06 exhibition Between Past and Future: New Photography and Video from China which itself had toured from America. I would strongly debate the idea of an indigenous Chinese art or that Chinese contemporary artists are just copying the western style. It is naive - and a cripplingly western point of view - to think that western art will not influence artists. As for the market, there must be a responsibility for collectors to look beyond what is delivered to the auction house. Until recently there has been little concept of commercial galleries in China, particularly for the more experimental or political work. Many of the older generation of successful artists such as Xu Bing and Cai Guo-Qiang have refused to be represented by galleries. But genuinely excellent commercial galleries such as Continua are opening spaces in China, and slowly the infrastructure is strengthening.

Freedom is under threat even in old-established democracies such as Britain. Western supremacy is on the skids. But everyone does capitalism. Americans and Europeans do it. Indians do it. Russian oligarchs and Saudi princes do it. Even Chinese communists do it. And now the members of Israel&apos;s oldest kibbutz, that last best hope of egalitarian socialism, have voted to introduce variable salaries based on individual performance. Karl Marx would be turning in his grave. Or perhaps not, since some of his writings eerily foreshadowed our era of globalised capitalism. His prescription failed but his description was prescient. Here is the great fact about the early 21st century, so big and taken for granted that we rarely stop to think how extraordinary it is. It was not ever thus. &quot;Can capitalism survive?&quot; asked the British socialist thinker GDH Cole, in a book published in 1938 under the title Socialism in Evolution. His answer was no. Socialism would succeed it. Most readers of this newspaper in 1938 would probably have agreed. What are the big ideological alternatives being proposed today? Hugo Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s &quot;21st century socialism&quot; still looks like a local or at most a regional phenomenon, best practised in oil-rich states. Islamism, sometimes billed as democratic capitalism&apos;s great competitor in a new ideological struggle, does not offer an alternative economic system (aside from the peculiarities of Islamic finance) and anyway does not appeal beyond the Muslim umma. Most anti-globalists, altermondialistes and, indeed, green activists, are much better at pointing out the failings of global capitalism than they are at suggesting systemic alternatives. &quot;Capitalism should be replaced by something nicer,&quot; read a placard at a May Day demonstration in London a few years back. Of course there&apos;s a problem of definition here. Is what Russian or Chinese state-owned companies do really capitalism? Isn&apos;t private ownership the essence of capitalism? One of America&apos;s leading academic experts on capitalism, Edmund Phelps of Columbia University, has an even more restrictive definition. For him, what we have in much of continental Europe, with multiple stakeholders, is not capitalism but corporatism. Capitalism, he says, is &quot;an economic system in which private capital is relatively free to innovate and invest without permission from the state, green lights from communities and regions, from workers, and other so-called social partners&quot;. In which case most of the world is not capitalist. I find this much too restrictive. Surely what we have across Europe are multiple varieties of capitalism, from more liberal market economies like Britain and Ireland to more coordinated stakeholder economies like Germany and Austria. In Russia and China, there&apos;s a spectrum from state to private ownership. Other considerations than maximising profit play a large part in the decision-making of state-controlled companies, but they too operate as players in national and international markets and increasingly they also speak the language of global capitalism. At this year&apos;s World Economic Forum in Davos, I heard Gazprom&apos;s Alexander Medvedev defend the company&apos;s record by saying that it is one of the world&apos;s top five in market capitalisation and constantly looking for value for its shareholders - who happen to include the Russian state. At the very least, this suggests a hegemony of the discourse of global capitalism. China&apos;s &quot;Leninist capitalism&quot; is a very big borderline case, but the crab-like movement of its companies towards what we would recognise as more rather than less capitalist behaviour is far clearer than any movement of its state towards democracy. Does this lack of any clear ideological alternative mean that capitalism is secure for years to come? Far from it. With the unprecedented triumph of globalised capitalism over the last two decades come new threats to its own future. They are not precisely the famous &quot;contradictions&quot; that Marx identified, but they may be even bigger. For a start, the history of capitalism over the last hundred years hardly supports the view that it is an automatically self-correcting system. As George Soros (who should know) points out, global markets are now more than ever constantly out of equilibrium - and teetering on the edge of a larger disequilibrium. Again and again, it has needed the visible hands of political, fiscal and legal correction to complement the invisible hand of the market. The bigger it gets, the harder it can fall. An oil tanker is more stable than a sailing dinghy, but if the tanker&apos;s internal bulkheads are breached and the oil starts swilling from side to side in a storm, you have the makings of a major disaster. Increasingly, the world&apos;s capital is like oil in the hold of one giant tanker, with ever fewer internal bulkheads to stop it swilling around. Then there is inequality. One feature of globalised capitalism seems to be that it rewards its high performers disproportionately, not just in the City of London but also in Shanghai, Moscow and Mumbai. What will be the political effects of having a small group of super-rich people in countries where the majority are still super-poor? In more developed economies, such as Britain and America, a reasonably well-off middle-class with a slowly improving personal standard of living may be less bothered by a small group of the super-rich - whose antics also provide them with a regular diet of tabloid-style entertainment. But if a lot of middle-class people begin to feel they are personally losing out to the same process of globalisation that is making those few fund managers stinking rich, while at the same time outsourcing their own middle-class jobs to India, then you may have a backlash. Watch Lou Dobbs on CNN for a taste of the populist and protectionist rhetoric to come. Above all, though, there is the inescapable dilemma that this planet cannot sustain six-and-a-half billion people living like today&apos;s middle-class consumers in its rich north. In just a few decades, we would use up the fossil fuels that took some 400 million years to accrete - and change the earth&apos;s climate as a result. Sustainability may be a grey and boring word, but it is the biggest single challenge to global capitalism today. However ingenious modern capitalists are at finding alternative technologies - and they will be very ingenious - somewhere down the line this is going to mean richer consumers settling for less rather than more. Marx thought capitalism would have a problem finding consumers for the goods that improving techniques of production enabled it to churn out. Instead, it has become expert in a new branch of manufacturing: the manufacture of desires. The genius of contemporary capitalism is not simply that it gives consumers what they want but that it makes them want what it has to give. It&apos;s that core logic of ever-expanding desires that is unsustainable on a global scale. But are we prepared to abandon it? We may be happy to insulate our lofts, recycle our newspapers and cycle to work, but are we ready to settle for less so others can have more? Am I? Are you? www.timothygartonash.com", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2007-02-22T00:07:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/23/utilities.viewpointcolumn", "sentences": ["Won&apos;t we be talking about how HSBC&apos;s roots in Hong Kong and Shanghai put it in a prime slot in the booming market of China?"], "title": "Viewpoint: The great Centrica gas escape", "article": "Our service was lousy. Our billing system didn&apos;t work properly. Our prices were uncompetitive. One million customers deserted us. Let&apos;s call it another successful year and put shareholders&apos; dividends up 6%. Sam Laidlaw, the newish chief executive of Centrica, parent of British Gas, didn&apos;t quite summarise 2006 this way, but you get the gist. The company is pleased to have escaped with limited damage from a period in which critical ratios moved in the wrong direction. The price of gas was high and Centrica&apos;s upstream operations didn&apos;t produce enough of the stuff. The generating division couldn&apos;t escape the fact that other people&apos;s coal-fired stations could produce electricity more cheaply. The &quot;strategy&quot; was to pass as much pain as possible on to residential energy customers and hope for the best. It worked up to a point. It was embarrassing that British Gas&apos;s share of the market fell below 50% for the first time since privatisation, but a subsequent plunge in wholesale gas prices means the company can now promise to be vaguely competitive on price. That accounts for the optimism in the City, where Centrica&apos;s shares were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 yesterday. We shall see. There is a feeling around that two years of viciously high energy bills may finally prompt a portion of the apathetic majority to look for a cheaper supplier. In other words, the promised price war among energy providers may be worthy of the name this time. If so, it is alarming to hear Laidlaw confess that the efficacy and robustness of British Gas&apos;s new billing system is &quot;still in the proving stage&quot;. That does not sound like an enthusiastic vote of confidence. By contrast, the City appears to be pricing the shares as if a perfect year is already in the can. Centrica&apos;s recent history suggests life rarely runs so smoothly. Household clear-out Can it really be less than four years since Sir John Bond was reassuring us that Household International, a company that had just shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to settle allegations of predatory lending, was a suitable purchase for an upstanding, conservative bank such as HSBC? Yes, it is, and the funniest thing is that Bond argued that one of the great benefits of the \u00a39bn deal was the quality of the management that Household would bring. Now those same managers are departing HSBC by the back door, shuffled out only a fortnight after the bank&apos;s first profits warning. Bobby Mehta, head of the bank&apos;s North American operations, is the most senior HSBC executive in living memory to suffer such a fate. Sandy Derickson was one of the most senior women on HSBC&apos;s payroll. It is encouraging that HSBC appears to appreciate the scale of its cock-up at Household, even if it has yet to provide a coherent explanation of how it walked into an elephant trap that seemed obvious to everybody else. The mistake was to pour billions into low-quality mortgages and loans that went sour as soon as the US property market stalled. It was an error HSBC would have been expected to move heaven and earth to avoid given the scepticism over the original purchase. Logic says HSBC is sufficiently broad and robust to weather the squall and that the only reasonable perspective to adopt for a bank this size is a long-term one. In half a decade or so, won&apos;t an upset on the trailer parks of America be ancient history? Won&apos;t we be talking about how HSBC&apos;s roots in Hong Kong and Shanghai put it in a prime slot in the booming market of China? Almost certainly, and a dividend yield approaching 5% is a decent incentive for long-term investors to keep the faith. Yet the feeling remains that confidence in HSBC&apos;s management would be shredded in an instant if any other bad news emerges. This is a critical moment.

MW Tops&apos;s novelty is a system of picking stocks via a computer formula that ranks a panel of selected City analysts and salesmen by the success of their past recommendations. The precise formula is closely guarded and little understood, even within the hedge fund community. But clearly Bolton feels he knows enough to trust it.

I&apos;d like to think so, but even if it&apos;s only a figment of Rose Tremain&apos;s always vivid imagination - remember the asylum in Restoration - it makes for a memorable moment in the title story of a collection packed with memorable vignettes. The former Mrs Simpson, for whom a king gave up his throne and effectively his life, is dying in her Paris apartment. Bedridden, incontinent, gaga, the once immaculate Duchess of Windsor, who can no longer speak without dribbling, awakes to find that she has a visitor. &quot;He puts a tender kiss on Wallis&apos;s head. &apos;Duchess&apos;, he says, &apos;it&apos;s Cecil, how are you darling?&apos; &apos;Cecil, Cecil who?&apos; She wants to ask him, what&apos;s all this Duchess business? When did that begin? But she can&apos;t get anything out.&quot; It&apos;s Cecil Beaton, of course, who obliges her by putting on his lorgnette to read the inscription on the bracelet she is proffering. &quot;Hold Tight&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s what they used to say on the buses.&quot; The man explodes with laughter. &quot;On the buses - sweetheart, he never went on a bus in his life. What a card you are.&quot; Alas, not any more. Now Wallis&apos;s memory is so impaired she has no idea who the man in the silver photograph frame by her bed is, except that he was with her when she met Mr Hitler. Poignant, quirky and original, the stories are all imprinted with Tremain&apos;s talent for pinpointing character with a single light touch. Eleanor Bron has at last found the perfect vehicle for acting skills that have long been wasted in radio comedy. Far Eastern Talesby W Somerset Maugham, read by Robert Powell(10hrs unabridged, BBC, \u00a321.99) Ideally you should listen to these stories lying in a long cane chair on the veranda of a dark bungalow sipping a gin and bitters - not that Maugham&apos;s writing needs any further atmospheric embellishment. Like Kipling and Conrad, he transports us to a long-since-vanished and distinctly non-PC world of hard-drinking colonial planters and traders and their frosty memsahibs, Mabel and Dorothy and Winifred, from Yokohama to Colombo, Rangoon to Shanghai. If he weren&apos;t such a consummate storyteller, you might balk at the constant references to the &quot;natives&quot; and the &quot;chinks&quot;, but don&apos;t worry, those pukka sahibs in the white ducks and sola topis don&apos;t always come out on top. The characters catching butterflies and hunting tigers may be dated, but their fears, passions, weaknesses and ambitions are timeless. I suspect that listening to these is better than reading them, especially with a voice like Robert Powell&apos;s setting the scene. Heavenly Date and Other Flirtationsby Alexander McCall Smith, read by Anton Lesser (3hrs abridged, Hachette, \u00a313.99) If you like Alexander McCall Smith (and millions do, especially in America, where his No 1 lady detective Precious Ramotswe&apos;s fan club is threatening to outnumber Miss Austen&apos;s), I see no reason why you shouldn&apos;t enjoy these breezily inconsequential stories about relationships. Personally I enjoyed them more for their exotic settings - Italy, Africa, Australia, Switzerland - than for the people milling about in them. They&apos;re a mixed bunch: a Swiss septuagenarian chocolate millionaire contemplating marriage to an equally rich septuagenarian chocoholic femme du monde; a feisty young woman from Sydney accused of feeding her boyfriend to the crocodiles; a mixed-up young man in Bulawayo, who prefers sport to his wife - hang on, isn&apos;t that normal? McCall Smith is such a prolific writer I sometimes get the feeling that he switches his laptop to autopilot, and off it chugs over the same old ground.

It went unnoticed at the time. But for Mr Livingstone&apos;s opponents, fuming still at the international &quot;oil for brooms&quot; deal he signed this week with Hugo Chavez, of Venezuela, and smarting over his claim that the mayoralty is as much about international diplomacy as municipal stewardship, it should now be taken as a sign that things are only going to get worse. The Guardian has learned that officials at City Hall, central London, have begun &quot;scoping&quot; work on the prospects for international cooperation between the capital and Brazil. Mr Livingstone&apos;s team are concentrating in the short term on relations with China, India and Russia as well as on the nuts and bolts of the deal with Venezuela. But Brazil has also been identified as another rising force with which London must make common cause. &quot;Lula thinks London is a very important place and we are looking closely at the situation there,&quot; a source said. &quot;It may be four or five years down the road but Brazil has many things going for it. It is a major manufacturer of cars and steel. It is also the biggest producer of ethanol, which will be a key commodity in the fight against climate change.&quot; London considers itself well placed to provide municipal consultancy. &quot;If you went to one of the big consultancy firms and said &apos;let&apos;s rebuild a city&apos; the cost would be colossal. We have over 100 years experience of running a successful city,&quot; the source said. Unveiling his Venezuela deal this week, the mayor trumpeted the benefits for 250,000 poor Londoners, who will get half-priced bus and tram travel using the \u00a316m saving via the receipt of cheap oil from Hugo Chavez. But Mr Livingstone also said the deal was part of a strategy and wider philosophy. &quot;We will work with cities right the way across the world. People see themselves as partners on one planet and we either save the world together or die together.&quot; He said the notion particularly applied to the response to climate change. Mr Livingstone believes that for a city like London international diplomacy by the mayor is a matter of necessity. Next week, he plays host to the mayors of Paris, Moscow, Berlin and Beijing. The leaders of other devolved administrations also venture further afield. Last year Rhodri Morgan, the Welsh first minister, went to China, Dubai, Brittany, Brussels and Latvia. Jack McConnell, Scotland&apos;s first minister, took six foreign trips between April 2005 and 2006, including Canada, Australia, Malawi, China and Belgium. London&apos;s mayor has been abroad 20 times since 2004, on visits including tips to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, Singapore, and Moscow. Last year he famously tried to visit President Chavez in Caracas but returned home because the Venezuelan leader could not see him. London has &quot;embassies&quot; in Brussels, Beijing and Shanghai with offices in Mumbai and New Delhi due to open in November, all of which the mayor claims are cost effective. &quot;We don&apos;t have a foreign policy,&quot; a source said. &quot;We have a domestic policy that requires us to have these international links.&quot; But Mr Livingstone&apos;s macro approach to the job of municipal leadership is controversial and the Venezuela deal has particularly infuriated his critics. Hours after the accord was signed, the London Assembly announced an investigation. Members have also been forcing his administration to justify the travel bill. The policy also carries the risk of guilt by association, particularly for a mayor who so guards his political reputation. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, is a political ally but the mayor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, who signed a partnership agreement with Mr Livingstone, is seen by some as a rightwing nationalist. President Chavez is also both loved and loathed. Referring to his relations with Venezuela&apos;s media, this week&apos;s Economist magazine accused the president of &quot;silencing dissenting views little by little&quot;. Angie Bray, Tory leader at City Hall, said the international links required scrutiny. &quot;I can see the logic of deals with major cities but what has happened with Venezuela is basically the politics of the pirate. What next? Cheap rice from Cambodia? Cheap cigars from Havana? In any event, I am not sure people in London would think the mayor and his team run our services so efficiently that they have time to run them anywhere else.&quot; She added: &quot;He wasn&apos;t elected to have a foreign policy. He has very specific areas of responsibility.&quot;", "tags": ["Local government", "Brazil", "London politics", "Politics", "Travel", "Brazil holidays", "Rio de Janeiro holidays", "UK news", "Hugo Ch\u00e1vez", "Venezuela", "World news", "Americas"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-24T23:57:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/25/business.london", "sentences": ["David Sharpe, managing director of the London Eye, which is now owned by Dubai International Capital, is leaving today to visit Shanghai, Kuala Lumpar and Singapore to discuss the possibility."], "title": "Revealed: secret plan for West End convention centre", "article": "Secret plans by London Mayor Ken Livingstone to create central London&apos;s first purpose-built international convention centre (ICC) have been uncovered by The Observer. The spectacular proposal would see a world class 5,000-seat facility built on land around Centre Point along New Oxford Street in the West End . The plan would involve persuading the landlord of Centre Point, tycoon Ardeshir Naghshineh, to convert the listed tower into a luxury hotel. A convention centre would boost the West End&apos;s retail and leisure sector and help regenerate Oxford Street. Though one of the world&apos;s most famous shopping streets, its east side in particular has grown markedly tatty. Although Livingstone&apos;s staff have been working on the plans in secret for years, it is understood that the four landowners affected have been sounded out. There are still plenty of obstacles to be overcome if the convention centre is to be built. Ultimately, the mayor could purchase the land compulsorily to push the plan through, but that is an option of last resort. Apart from former civil engineer Naghshineh, a key landowner is Lawrence Kirschel, a former business partner of Paul Raymond who has a fortune estimated at more than \u00a3200m. James Bidwell, chief executive of Visit London, the city&apos;s official tourist body, said: &apos;A central location for a convention centre is attractive because it would have direct benefit to the retail, restaurant and theatres. This would be a tremendous asset for our tourism economy.&apos; The plan would take years to bring to life. Insiders say it is unlikely to be built until after the 2012 Olympics. Plans for a new international convention centre come as London&apos;s tourism sector has enjoyed a record year.

The broader FTSE 250 suffered its biggest-ever one-day points fall, dropping by 431.5 to 11,180.9.  The Nikkei dropped 0.52 percent to 18,119.92, after the yen&apos;s strength gave investors a reason to sell some exporters&apos; shares.

At lunchtime in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 170 points, with the White House seeking to ease concerns about an imminent strike against Tehran by saying it hoped Iran and Syria would play a &quot;constructive part&quot; in regional Middle East talks organised by Iraq. Foreign exchange markets were also thrown into turmoil by a hefty jump in the value of the yen, particularly against the US dollar.  Investors have made big profits in recent years by borrowing money cheaply in yen and buying higher-yielding but riskier assets elsewhere in the world.  An unwinding of these so-called &quot;carry trades&quot; led to a 1.3% decline in the value of the greenback against the yen. Following comments on Monday from Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, that the US risked sliding into recession, there was a further dent to investor confidence in the world&apos;s biggest economy when official data released in Washington showed an unexpectedly large 7.8% fall in durable goods orders. The dollar steadied when later figures revealed a rise in consumer confidence to a five-year high and a modest pick-up in sales of existing homes as a result of unusually mild winter weather, but analysts said they expected the US currency to remain under pressure. With the price of existing homes more than 3% lower in January than a year earlier, concern has been growing in recent weeks about the risk of default among high-risk borrowers in US sub-prime mortgages, the riskier home loan deals.  Despite the concerns about a US slowdown, oil prices continued to recover from a low point of just $50 a barrel last month and rose to just over $62 a barrel on Wall Street, the highest level this year. Financial markets will now be highly sensitive to US economic data emerging over the next few days to gauge the chances that the Fed, America&apos;s central bank, will cut interest rates later this year.  Wall Street was predicting that borrowing costs have peaked and the dollar was down across the board tonight, with sterling trading at just under $1.97.  &quot;The dollar will continue to sell off, especially with the unwinding of the carry trades,&quot; said Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange trading at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. The ripple effect across all markets reminded some analysts of the dramatic retreat in global markets seen in May 2006. &quot;There&apos;s near-term vulnerability a la May 2006 because of the sheer amount of risk that is on board across the world,&quot; said Jim O&apos;Neill, chief global economist at Goldman Sachs. He added that widening credit spreads and worries about stress in the mortgage lending industry in the US were also concerns.  Buoyant credit markets, which have provided much of the cheap borrowing and funding that has fuelled everything from household consumption to a buyout spree by private equity funds in recent years, are also starting to feel the heat. Emerging market sovereign debt spreads, also a gauge of global risk-taking, rose to as high as 177 basis points over benchmark US government yields, more 10 basis points wider than on Friday. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-27T18:33:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/28/china.frontpagenews", "sentences": ["But I feel we had gotten the point of feeling that risk was nonexistent and maybe people have finally gotten a wake-up call.&quot; Earlier, a day of turmoil on the world&apos;s bourses from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires began with a fall of almost 9% in Shanghai, with the biggest drop in China&apos;s stock market in almost a decade blamed on hints from Beijing that action was being planned to combat the speculation that this week drove share prices to record highs."], "title": "Wall St suffers biggest fall since 9/11", "article": "Wall Street suffered its biggest one-day fall yesterday since the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as a day of hefty stock market falls around the world culminated in a late panic sell-off in New York.

But I feel we had gotten the point of feeling that risk was nonexistent and maybe people have finally gotten a wake-up call.&quot; Earlier, a day of turmoil on the world&apos;s bourses from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires began with a fall of almost 9% in Shanghai, with the biggest drop in China&apos;s stock market in almost a decade blamed on hints from Beijing that action was being planned to combat the speculation that this week drove share prices to record highs. Chris Low, economist at FTN Financial in New York said: &quot;What is striking to us is not the big move in Chinese stocks, but the contagion driving stocks down around the world. For the past couple of years, contagion was a thing of the past. The FTSE 100 closed almost 150 points down on the day at 6,286.1, with the fall of 2.31% the sharpest since last June. The FTSE 250 suffered its biggest one-day points fall, dropping by 431.5 to 11,180.9. The Nikkei dropped 0.52% to 18,119.92 after the yen&apos;s strength gave investors a reason to sell some exporters&apos; shares. The FTSEurofirst 300, the pan-European index, dropped 2.8% to close unofficially at 1,507.06, its biggest one-day percentage loss since May 2003. Foreign exchange markets were also thrown into turmoil by a jump in the yen. Investors have made big profits in recent years by borrowing money cheaply in yen and buying higher-yielding but riskier assets elsewhere. An unwinding yesterday of these so-called &quot;carry trades&quot; led to a 2% decline in the value of the dollar against the yen - its biggest drop in a year. The dollar also lost ground against the sterling, with the pound ending the day in London little more than three cents away from the $2 level. The ripple effect reminded some of the retreat in global markets of May 2006. &quot;There&apos;s near-term vulnerability a la May 2006 because of the sheer amount of risk that is on board across the world,&quot; said Jim O&apos;Neill, chief global economist at Goldman Sachs. Explainer: Carry trades \u00b7 Currency carry trades involve an investor borrowing money in a currency where interest rates are low and buying assets in a currency where they are high. The amount investors make on the deal depends on the riskiness of the asset they buy and the amount they are prepared to borrow to boost their initial investment. Evidence suggests that many investors have plumped for high-risk plays and dangerously magnified their exposure through borrowing. In recent years, the prime target for the carry trade has been the Japanese yen, because a decade of deflation has forced the authorities to keep interest rates at zero. Even now, the official cost of borrowing is under 1%, compared to more than 5% in Britain and America. The carry trade is not a one-way bet, however. The main risk comes from movements in exchange rates: if the yen goes up against the dollar, paying back the original borrowing becomes more expensive and can wipe out the profits of an investor who has borrowed heavily to fund the trade.", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-28T01:25:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/28/wrap.jamessturcke", "sentences": ["*Brown camp fear Miliband after challenge on policy BIG TROUBLE FROM BIG CHINA Shanghai has sneezed.", "The markets have historically always looked to America, the paper points out, so the dramatic reaction to Shanghai&apos;s trouble is a clear indication - if any were still needed - of China&apos;s growing global influence.", "The Herald Tribune also devotes much of its front page to the story, saying that Shanghai&apos;s slide comes at a time when analysts fear shares may be overvalued."], "title": "Pass the Duchy's", "article": "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited&apos;s digest of the best of the day&apos;s papers. Please accept our apologies for the late arrival of the Wrap this morning: we will be back to business as usual tomorrow. BURGER PRINCE There&apos;s little consensus on the top story of the day, but the subject of food offers much food for thought, with the tabloids splashing on meat-related matters. BURGER ORF! screams the Mirror, reporting on what it says was Prince Charles&apos;s call in Abu Dhabi for McDonalds fast-food to be banned. Leaping to the defence of the worthy burger, the paper points out that Prince Harry is a &quot;big fan of burgers&quot; and quotes &quot;health experts&quot; as claiming that Prince Charles&apos;s own Duchy Originals pork sausages contain more fat than a Big Mac. The Guardian, however, says food campaigners have welcomed the prince&apos;s comments, which it ties in with the campaign against the domination of Britain&apos;s food retail sector by the so-called big four supermarkets. The paper looks ahead to a public rally at which the TV chef Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall and others, it says, will call on the government to take action to stop the environmental and social damage caused by the chains. &quot;It&apos;s a major scandal that the supermarkets have been allowed to have such a corrosive effect on the local and ultimately national food culture,&quot; it quotes him as saying ahead of the meeting. &quot;Local producers are bullied and even busted by the aggressive tactics of the supermarket whilst many shopping centres, once the heart of the community, have been standardised or gutted by retail totalitarianism.&quot; *Mirror: Storm as Charles calls for Big Mac ban *Charles voices distaste for Mc Donald&apos;s food BUSH SHIFTS POSITION ON IRAN TALKS The more serious papers focus on what the Telegraph calls a dramatic shift in the Bush administration&apos;s Middle East policy, in the form of a clearing of the way for talks with Syria and Iran on the future of Iraq. The US will attend a conference in Baghdad next month, the paper says, to discuss the &quot;stabilisation&quot; of Iraq with its six neighbours, including Iran, which Mr Bush once described as part of an &quot;axis of evil&quot;. The Guardian describes the plan, announced by the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, to the Senate last night, as a policy reversal, while the Herald Tribune points out that the move cracks open the door to a diplomatic channel that has long been sought by Bush&apos;s critics, who argue that America should be doing more to engage its enemies. The bipartisan Iraq Study Group, it points out, called for just such a strategy in December. *Telegraph: Bush to talk with Iran on future of Iraq*Guardian: US invites Iran and Syria to talks on Iraq in reversal of Bush policy*International Herald Tribune: US set to join Iran and Syria in talks on Iraq BROWNITES FEAR MILIBAND CHALLENGE Returning to domestic issues, the Guardian leads with an update on Labour&apos;s succession wrangles: &quot;Brown camp fear Miliband after challenge on policy.&quot; &quot;Two of Gordon Brown&apos;s oldest political enemies have told the chancellor that there should be a public debate over the future direction of a Labour government before Tony Blair&apos;s exit this year,&quot; reports political editor Patrick Wintour. &quot;Alan Milburn and Charles Clarke say they are only starting a policy debate within the party, but some of Mr Brown&apos;s allies are treating the move with suspicion. They fear that the real aim is to flush out a credible challenger to him for the leadership.&quot; The Guardian speculates that in one scenario, Mr Clarke could challenge the chancellor for the party leadership after Tony Blair finally stands down, in order to clear the way for a challenge from the environment secretary, David Miliband. *Brown camp fear Miliband after challenge on policy BIG TROUBLE FROM BIG CHINA Shanghai has sneezed. But does that mean the rest of the world is about to catch a very nasty cold? The Telegraph seems to think we might indeed be right to be concerned about our financial health after a 9% slide on China&apos;s stock market caused shares to tumble everywhere else. The markets have historically always looked to America, the paper points out, so the dramatic reaction to Shanghai&apos;s trouble is a clear indication - if any were still needed - of China&apos;s growing global influence. The Guardian notes that Wall Street saw the biggest single one-day fall since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. This came, it says, amid fears not only that China and the US, the twin locomotives of the global economy, are about to plunge into recession, but also that the Bush administration is thinking about carrying out air strikes against Iran. The fall wiped out gains on the Dow Jones for the year so far. The Herald Tribune also devotes much of its front page to the story, saying that Shanghai&apos;s slide comes at a time when analysts fear shares may be overvalued. *Stock market slump enters second day GLORIOUS FAILURE FOR READING There&apos;s widespread admiration for Reading&apos;s fightback in last night&apos;s FA Cup replay and dismay at Manchester United going off the boil during the second half, although Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s team did just enough to secure a 3-2 win. &quot;Having appeared to give themselves the rest of the night off with three goals in the first five minutes, this turned into a fixture that must have felt like unending torment before Manchester United at last staggered on to an FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough,&quot; writes Kevin McCarra in the Guardian. Only the crossbar stopped Reading scoring an equaliser in stoppage time. The Times says that Steve Coppell&apos;s side have again proved that their rise to sixth place in the Premiership is no fluke. &quot;Under the auspices of their shrewd manager, a former [Manchester] United player, Reading&apos;s days in obscurity in the Coca-Cola Championship have long gone.&quot; *Guardian: United survive stirring Reading fightback*Times: Replay victory keeps United on course for second treble LOVELY JUBBLY It was a deal that Del Boy himself would have been rubbing his hands over. The grubby, three-wheeled Reliant Regal that starred in the long-running hit TV series, Only Fools and Horses, was sold for over GBP44,000 in a London auction yesterday, the Times reports. The 35-year-old yellow van, emblazoned with &quot;Trotters Independent Trading Co - New York, Paris, Peckham&quot; was bought by a Wiltshire businessman who collects cars. Phillip Walker tells the Times that he plans to keep the vehicle in full working order and had to fight off bids from a national newspaper - doesn&apos;t say which - for the three-wheeler. &quot;It&apos;s an iconic van. The whole family said we just had to get it. I&apos;m looking forward to driving down to collect the papers,&quot; he tells the Times. The van fetched more than double its expected price. A tale of contrasting fortunes ends with the news that a Ferrari owned by the musician Chris Rea sold for just GBP28,000, far below its expected GBP38,000-45,000 guide price. *Del Boy&apos;s three-wheeler fetches GBP44,000 COMING UP ON GUARDIAN UNLIMITED TODAY &gt;&gt;&gt;Equalities review: women with children are the group most discriminated against at work &gt;&gt;&gt;Fidel Castro makes first live radio broadcast since falling ill &gt;&gt;&gt;The battle for school places: the council running a lottery for the right to attend popular schools", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2007-02-28T10:37:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/28/citiesaretakingthelead", "sentences": ["In China, carbon emissions are increasing fast (although, per person, they&apos;re still a fraction of the UK&apos;s), but the regional administration in Shanghai is building the world&apos;s first low-carbon eco-city - the size of Bristol - at Dongtan."], "title": "But will it fly?", "article": "Cities, rather than states, are taking the lead on tackling climate change - but they can&apos;t do it alone. The fact that Ken Livingstone and I are writing about the same thing on the same website is more than happy coincidence. It indicates the level of alarm and urgency we both feel about the devastating consequences of climate change on humanity. The launch of a climate change action plan for London which goes well beyond anything else in this country is the result of several years of discussion, cooperation and nagging. As much as I enjoyed working with Ken as his deputy mayor in 2003, I have enjoyed a bit of hands-on control over the purse strings even more since 2004, when he started needing my vote to get his budget through. London&apos;s first climate change action plan (pdf) and this year&apos;s budget agreement between the mayor and the Greens are real breakthroughs. Billed as &quot;the first major city to set out a comprehensive plan to achieve the serious carbon emission cuts necessary to avert catastrophic climate change&quot;, the wide-ranging initiatives in the plan will cover households, offices, transport and industry. The plan comes none too soon. Ten years after the Kyoto protocol was signed emissions in London are continuing to rise. Last week&apos;s admission that home energy use has increased over the past two years demonstrates just how far there is to go. As previewed in last month&apos;s budget agreement between the mayor and the Greens, there are many exciting initiatives coming forward. The green homes service will hold the hand of residents through the often confusing process of improving energy efficiency. When trials are completed, all new buses in London will be hybrids or hydrogen-powered. A decentralised energy network will be set up to power London from local renewables and combined heat and power rather than distant and inefficient fossil fuel plants. Most significantly, however, the plan demonstrates that cities are showing leadership on the climate-change agenda, even when national governments and international institutions have been painfully slow to react. This pattern of cities taking responsibility is being repeated all over the world, including the US. While the UK has struggled to prepare the ground for road pricing, London&apos;s congestion charge has cut transport emissions within the zone by 16%. With the congestion charge extended westwards last week, emissions will drop even further. Despite slow take-up nationally of solar panels and wind turbines, London requires new developments to meet 10% of energy needs from on-site renewables, rising to 20% in 2008. In the US, while the federal government refuses to act, 407 cities (with a combined population of 59m) have now signed up to Kyoto, nine states have joined a carbon-trading scheme, and California is even suing car manufacturers over their climate damage. In China, carbon emissions are increasing fast (although, per person, they&apos;re still a fraction of the UK&apos;s), but the regional administration in Shanghai is building the world&apos;s first low-carbon eco-city - the size of Bristol - at Dongtan. But despite all this excitement, cities can&apos;t do it alone. Even if London&apos;s action plan manages to get Londoners out of their cars and on their feet or bikes, and on eco-buses, the Department for Transport&apos;s plans for airport expansion could override all progress. Flights from London airports currently account for over a third of London&apos;s CO2 emissions. In stark contrast to the target for a 20% cut in emissions by 2010, London is currently on track for a 20% rise, largely due to spiralling aviation emissions. At current rates of growth, by 2025, flights from London&apos;s airports would account for more carbon than London&apos;s target for emissions from all sources. So, as well as a plan of action, today&apos;s announcement is also a cry for help. Without a change of heart on airport expansion, all of London&apos;s good intentions could be lost.", "tags": ["Ken Livingstone", "London", "Green politics", "Climate change", "Airline industry", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Congestion charging", "Road transport"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-28T11:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/28/ftse.marketforces", "sentences": ["Today, China&apos;s main Shanghai stock index bounced back almost 4%, following a 9% slump yesterday, and Wall Street also recovered slightly amidst expectations that the US would still see moderate growth despite the current turmoil."], "title": "\u00a364bn wiped off value of FTSE 100 in two days", "article": "The FTSE 100 continued its downward march today, but the fall was not quite as sharp yesterday amidst a small rebound in Asian markets and a slight recovery on Wall Street.  On another tumultuous day, the index of London&apos;s leading shares dropped nearly 2% early this morning but by mid-afternoon had pared some of those losses to be down 1.2%, before dropping again to end down 114.6 points, or 1.8%, at 6171.5.   That followed a slump of 148.6 points, or 2.3%, on Tuesday in the wake of a sharp fall in Chinese equities and rising concerns about US growth prospects.   Today, China&apos;s main Shanghai stock index bounced back almost 4%, following a 9% slump yesterday, and Wall Street also recovered slightly amidst expectations that the US would still see moderate growth despite the current turmoil. That took some pressure of London&apos;s main indices and there was also support from a handful of bluechips.   Leisure group Whitbread issued an upbeat trading update, which lifted its shares 17p, or 1%, to \u00a316.48. It cheered the market with news that like-for-like sales growth had picked up across all four of its main businesses, which include Premier Travel Inn budget hotels and Costa Coffee cafes.   Nigel Parson, analyst at Evolution Securities, said the update revealed Premier Travel Inn had again been the star in the final quarter.   &quot;Helpful though this is, the share price driver remains bid hopes,&quot; he added in a morning note.   The shares have risen 53% over the last 12 months, thanks largely to takeover speculation. The group is seen as an attractive target thanks to its property assets.   Mr Parson said he was putting his &quot;underweight&quot; recommendation and \u00a316.82 target price under review, partly on the possibility Whitbread could choose to convert into a low-tax real estate investment trust (Reit) and operating company, or three operating companies.   &quot;Historically, we have been negative on this stock because of its poor trading performance and our scepticism over the mooted take-over prices suggested for this stock. However, the new Reit possibilities add a new dimension and there is a tick-up in trading performance,&quot; he said.   Elsewhere on the FTSE 100&apos;s top gainers, Capita, which manages London&apos;s congestion charge, was up 11.5p at 647p as Deutsche Bank upgraded the company to buy from hold, pointing to the recent weakness in its share price as a buying opportunity.   Home Retail Group rose 3p, or 0.7%, to 423p as talk of private equity interest persisted. The owner of Argos and Homebase had put in a brief rise yesterday - but then slipped back with the rest of the market - after speculation of a 530p offer.   On a tough day, retail seemed to be one of the few sectors in favour. Clothes chain Next was also among the FTSE 100&apos;s handful of climbers, up 14p, or 0.7%, at \u00a320.42.   On the FTSE 250, Debenhams added 3.75p, or 2.1%, to 181.75p thanks to bid talk and Carpetright was not far behind, up 10p, or 0.9%, at \u00a311.53.   Overall though, the index of mid-caps was down sharply again, adding to steep losses yesterday which had marked the largest percentage drop since May and the worst ever decline in points terms. By mid-afternoon the FTSE 250 stood at 11082.9, down 98 points, or 0.9%.   Back among the bluechips, banks were some of the biggest fallers as traders cited concerns about the global economic outlook. Britain&apos;s biggest mortgage lender, HBOS, led the downhill march, shedding 52p, or 4.6%, at \u00a310.81. The group had unveiled a 19% rise in annual profits ahead of the open but that was overshadowed by worries about its margins and a wary outlook. Updating the market on bad debts - the topic of the hour - the bank said losses on unsecured lending slowed in the second half of the year, but it remained &quot;cautious about future trends given the continued growth in UK personal insolvencies&quot;.   Rival bank Barclays was also one of the day&apos;s biggest losers, down 28p, or 3.7%, to 740p. Standard Chartered dropped 22p to \u00a314.28, Lloyds TSB shed 11p to 574p and in the wider financial sector, Royal and Sun Alliance lost 3.5p to 153.5p.   It was a similar story with the miners. After a bashing yesterday on the back of China&apos;s stock falls and higher tax fears in South Africa, there were more heavy losses as economic slowdown worries hurt copper prices. Concern about demand for commodities saw Anglo American fall 91p, or 3.6%, to \u00a324.16, Xstrata shed 84p to \u00a323.95 and BHP Billiton lose 29.5p to \u00a310.22.   Further down the market, Aim-listed miner CAMEC managed to buck the trend, adding 2.75p, or 5.6%, to 51.75p after it unveiled plans to buy a Chinese cobalt plant. The deal takes the Democratic Republic of Congo-focused group into China&apos;s rapidly growing market.   Elsewhere on the junior stock market, music group Mama added 0.25p, or 6.3%, to 4.25p after it announced it had taken a 25% stake in Lovebox, a company whose shareholders include members of the band Groove Armada. Mama, has an option to buy a further 25% in February 2009 in Lovebox, which has the rights to run the increasingly popular Lovebox Weekender festival scheduled for this summer.

He is, of course, playing Prospero. But do not fear that Rutter, 61 this year, has taken up Shakespeare&apos;s depiction of the old man surrendering his power to enchant in order to sing his own theatrical swansong. &quot;My revels aren&apos;t ended yet,&quot; he says, sitting in a dressing room after a busy rehearsal with his Ariels (there are three of them). &quot;I&apos;m not breaking my staff or burying my book - it&apos;s just a play.&quot; Neither, round-the-houses questions finally elicit, is it a farewell to life itself. Last year word went round that Rutter had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, so it seemed reasonable to assume that he might have taken on Prospero as dark clouds of mortality gathered. It took a bit of time before he cottoned on to where the bumbling questions were heading. And then he laughed. It emerged that any Prospero-prostate link was, well, total bollocks. &quot;It&apos;s not true but I could see where the fancy and the poetry could come in there,&quot; he says, the trademark upturned eyebrows heading for the ceiling. In January he was told that whatever was there was not malignant but that he might still have the possibility of cancer in some cells. &quot;When you are told that you have a malignancy, you don&apos;t want to hear it. It knocks you for six. But I&apos;m under supervision and I&apos;m glad of that.&quot; And so are those regulars (not just in the north) who turn up for Northern Broadsides shows knowing they can expect both invention and integrity, as well as - something not always acknowledged - textual fidelity. Perhaps there&apos;s a message for them in Prospero&apos;s curious curtain speech: Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. The unfailing Northern Broadsides project has pleased (most of the time) ever since it was launched with Richard III in 1992 to prove that Shakespeare&apos;s language could flourish in the northern voice. That seemed pretty daring at the time but the battle has long since been won. &quot;It&apos;s still important but I don&apos;t shout about it much these days,&quot; says Rutter. But, he adds, the company&apos;s significance is greater than the sound it makes. &quot;We are part of the fabric now. We have a very secure and growing fan base. And for that much thanks. We wouldn&apos;t have been going for 15 years if something had not been artistically working. You cannot just buy people&apos;s interest in you. That is not to say that we are not as vibrant and as filled with vigour and gusto as ever.&quot; Arts Council funding is secure for three years and Rutter&apos;s vision will take him and his company well into his pension book years. &quot;I&apos;m not short of things to do, I&apos;m not short of imagination and I have a six-year plan. We have new commissions out: a new version of Lysistrata from Blake Morrison, provisionally titled Lisa&apos;s Sex Strike, in the autumn and next year a dramatisation of David Pownall&apos;s novel The White Cutter.&quot; With luck and some desperately-sought cash, this Tempest, a co-production with the New Vic, travels to Beijing and Shanghai in the summer and Rutter hopes the company will be back there in 2008. And then of course there is Lenny Henry as Othello. Nothing definite yet, but hopes are high. It started when Henry did three Radio 4 programmes (recently repeated) in which he tried to overcome an aversion to Shakespeare bred at school in Dudley. For the second programme, Henry was coached by Rutter in the Moor&apos;s final speech (&quot;Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate...&quot;) and was heard to say in some amazement: &quot;Rutter has asked me to do Othello with him.&quot; &quot;Do&quot; here means perform in, take the leading role in, Othello - right, Barrie? Well: did you ask him? Are you going to let him do it? &quot;Yeah. As soon as he is free. We&apos;ll do Othello with Lenny. He really wants to do it.&quot; The old actor-manager has not lost his touch. But come on, Rutter, even you must get fed up with trundling round the country for 14 weeks at a time, getting in, getting out, different bed every week, endless motorway miles. Not a bit of it. &quot;It&apos;s what we have done, what we always do. Without wanting to wish your life away, it&apos;s better than playing 14 weeks in one place. The excitement, the difference of a change, going through the seasons in different places. We are in Truro for the first time at the end of April - I&apos;ve never been to Truro before - and Richmond in June. To see the seasons in different places is terrific.&quot; For those who were there, the quintessential Rutter touring moment came as he greeted his audience outside the cattle mart in Skipton (gateway to the Dales) before advancing into a wooden O that was in fact a concrete cattle ring to cry: &quot;Oh for a muse of fire...&quot; The two syllables that he made of &quot;fire&quot; are said to echo still. This year&apos;s tour of The Wars Of The Roses, Rutter&apos;s three-play version of the Henry VIs and Richard III, should have dropped in on Stratford for the RSC&apos;s Complete Works Festival. But then Michael Boyd decided he was going to do the plays himself. Rutter suggested one epic day in which to present his own cycle and there were murmurs of support by the Avon. But no invitation came. &quot;They just killed us by neglect. In my final email, I said: &apos;I wish you all the best with your year of the Bard but as for the treatment of us, may your soul lie chained to the Red Sea bottom&apos;.&quot; Did he get a reply? &quot;Did I fuck.&quot; But life goes on and so does the Tempest, chosen in part to mark the bicentenary of the beginning of the end of slavery. &quot;It&apos;s not us trying to make a colonial point or to do anything political other than saying that these are references to what has happened over the last 200 years. &quot;This play is often done very dark - the thing between Caliban, Prospero and Ariel, that relationship is often carried through darkly right to the end of the play. I don&apos;t buy that. After that first argument between Ariel and Prospero, there is no more mention in the text of an argument.&quot; The play, says Rutter, is about romance, romance in the way that Ted Hughes uses the word: the defeat of death by the imagination. &quot;The Tempest ends with forgiveness and the future passed on to the next generation.&quot; More bits of text fly by but Rutter comes back, eyes flashing (eyes, by the way, that can spot you in the darkened stalls from the back of the stage), to Prospero&apos;s big speech in Act V: &quot;The first sentence is 17 and a half lines long! It&apos;s all subordinate clauses. It&apos;s wonderful to do.&quot; In it, Prospero tells of his delight in his own powers: I have bedimmed The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds, And &apos;twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war...  For 15 years, actor-manager Rutter has done much the same, give or take the odd budgetary constraint, with the help of rough vowels, lots of imagination and his own so-potent art. \u00b7 The Tempest is at the New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, until March 17, then on tour until June.

Bad debts at the bank swelled to $629m last year from $319m in 2005, largely because of credit card defaults in Taiwan.

But Tuesday&apos;s blood bath on the world&apos;s stock markets turned that truism on its head. The rout started in Shanghai. The Chinese are just getting a taste of stock market buying and selling and, like other stock markets such as Bangkok and Mumbai, there has been a long, strong upward trend. China has accumulated huge foreign exchange reserves and a lot of those dollars, if not spent abroad, seep into the domestic money supply, which, in turn, makes credit cheap. The Chinese authorities are nervous about a likely bubble and tried to make noises that they may tax capital gains of the traders. This caused panic in Shanghai. But the spread of that panic has to do with other events which are related. Japan has run a very lax monetary policy as it has struggled to come out of a ten year-long recession. It also has large dollar reserves, which it is happy to pump into domestic credit. In the old days (the sixties and seventies), each money market was insulated from others, and low rates here did not matter for the borrowers there. With globalisation, the barriers between the markets are much lower, and money can be borrowed here where it is cheap and spent there where returns are higher. The Japanese Central Bank just recently nudged interest rates from 0.25 % to 0.5 %. This may not sound much, but in these speculative markets, volumes are large but returns are wafer-thin. A quarter-point increase in interest rates, if followed through by another rise later or appreciation of yen against the dollar, would mean that a profitable transaction can turn into a loss-making one. There has been excess liquidity in the world&apos;s markets for some time now. The US trade deficit has ended up as surpluses held by China, Japan, Germany and many others. But cheap as the money is, there has been a feeling that, sooner or later, the liquidity may dry up or that policy-makers will tighten policy if inflation threatens to go up. Then, two days ago, Alan Greenspan, who just recently retired as Fed chairman and has the reputation of a Delphic oracle, said there is a recession likely round the corner. This was the real straw that broke the camel&apos;s back. Add to that fears over Iran and US confrontation, and you see the scenario. But the players in these markets are grown-up and rich, and deserve no sympathy. The only danger to ordinary citizens will be if the stock market fall does not reverse itself within three or four days, and begins to affect growth. In that case, a worldwide recession will be difficult to avoid. Just when you thought globalisation had eliminated the old business cycle, it is back at your doorstep - thanks to the Shanghai stock market.", "tags": ["China", "Business", "Japan", "US news", "Economics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-02-28T17:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/28/viewpointcolumn", "sentences": ["A plunge of 9% in Shanghai, when it follows a 130% gain last year, is neither here nor there."], "title": "Viewpoint: It's not the bear, it's fear of the bear", "article": "Doug Noland, a bearish market strategist in the US, captured the current predicament for stock market investors very well last December when he said that &quot;the current global profits boom is unmatched in its scope, intensity and peril&quot;. In other words, rarely has life been so wonderful for so long - cheap money and low inflation have worked in glorious combination - yet rarely has it seemed so possible that the show could come to a sudden and very painful halt. Yesterday&apos;s little market wobble looks like one of those moments when the second thought was uppermost. Certainly, none of the other explanations looked adequate. The Chinese stock market, the supposed source, is a sideshow in global terms. A plunge of 9% in Shanghai, when it follows a 130% gain last year, is neither here nor there. As for Alan Greenspan&apos;s thoughts on the chances of US recession this year, well, he has said these things before now. And don&apos;t blame tensions in Iran: the price of oil and gold would have moved if that was the real worry. Frankly, if you are in the mood to worry, you can find any number of &quot;top of the market&quot; signals. Private equity seems to be determined to smash its own records for biggest-ever deals virtually every month. Old hands in the property market have been warning for months that asset prices have got out of hand. In the currency markets, the entire hedge fund industry, plus every Japanese saver, seems to be betting that the yen will remain weak. All are interesting developments, yet the most important medium-term guide to the direction of markets is probably still the willingness of American consumers to keep spending. At the moment, there is severe pain in the &quot;sub prime&quot; market, as HSBC knows too well. It does not appear to have spread yet, but the banks themselves are clearly terrified that it will. Lending standards are being tightened aggressively. Their actions are nowhere near panic levels, but a credit crunch is exactly what the bears have been predicting for the final chapter of the bull market. It does not feel like we&apos;re there yet, but the sense of peril is not subsiding. French toast Er, yes, we have stopped taking bets in France. This reluctant admission from PartyGaming yesterday was not made via the stock market, presumably because France contributes less than 5% of the company&apos;s business, which is usually taken as the official threshold of significance. Even so, territories such as France carry great hopes for Party and its ilk after the US was ruled off-limits last year. Rival 888.com saw sufficient potential in France to plaster its name over the football shirts of Toulouse, which may be one reason why the French authorities would like to speak to the company&apos;s former chief executive, John Anderson. Party&apos;s cessation of bets from France coincided with news of the same French inquiry into the industry, which is another reason why this story ought to interest investors. It seems the French request to interview a few leading online gambling executives has created utter panic among the operators. Most seem to have stopped taking bets from France overnight. Any other European government with a mind to curb online gambling has now been given a lesson in how it can be done. Primary legislation, which was the US route last year, is not necessary: huffing and puffing, plus a letter or two, can do the trick. It does not matter in Britain, where we are more tolerant of the industry, despite its disinclination to pay tax on its profits. But Germany and Scandinavia tend to be hostile. If they were to follow the French, Party certainly would have to explain what on earth is going on. Nutmegged At least Mike Ashley got in before the stock market wobble. The owner of Sports Direct got rid of 310m shares at 300p apiece, that&apos;s \u00a3929m in cash. Buyers will wish they hadn&apos;t bothered. The shares were going for 281p by the close yesterday. That was not what was meant by the appeal of discount retailing. Still, excitement, surprises and entertainment are almost guaranteed with this stock. That&apos;s not because entrepreneurial retailers tend either to fly or fall on the stock market, though that&apos;s true enough (DFS, Matalan and New Look come to mind). Rather, it&apos;s because Ashley has achieved the remarkable feat of submitting to the scrutiny of flotation while saying next to nothing about what makes him and his company tick. His reputation as the mystery man of retailing is intact. Nobody is any the wiser about why he bothered to float.

China was steaming ahead, in spite of Tuesday&apos;s drop of almost 9% in the Shanghai stock market. &quot;In short, the macroeconomic backdrop remains favourable,&quot; he said. &quot;Growth is robust and a lack of inflationary pressures prevents the need for substantial monetary tightening.&quot; With Wall Street recouping some of Tuesday&apos;s 415-point loss in early trading yesterday, the markets were last night reassuring themselves that February 2007 was more October 1987 than October 1929. A minor correction in an upward trend; nothing more. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, helped calm markets by telling Congress that the bank still predicted moderate growth. Not everybody sees it that way. For many years, Stephen Roach, head of global economics at Morgan Stanley, was the bear&apos;s bear, who could always find the cloud to any silver lining. Last April, he recanted and said he was now more optimistic about the outlook. On Tuesday, just before Wall Street nosedived, he had second thoughts. &quot;After four fat years, convictions are deep that nothing can derail a Teflon-like global economy. Investors, policymakers and politicians have now succumbed to a dangerous complacency. That&apos;s the time to worry the most,&quot; he said. Although some in the markets see Morgan Stanley&apos;s Dr Doom as a good contrary indicator, the undimmed confidence in the financial markets goes deeper than that. Firstly, the global economy has been growing rapidly, with the past four years seeing the strongest growth for more than three decades. The big developing countries - especially China and India - have been instrumental in underpinning growth. Cheap goods Secondly, the arrival of the market economy in China, Russia and India has meant the west has been able to plug into low-cost sources of production. Cheap manufactured goods and services from China and India have put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. For a time, the west has been in the happy position of having it all: high levels of growth together with modest increases in the cost of living and low borrowing costs. In those circumstances, investors have been able to take advantage of the manifold opportunities presented by the liberalisation of capital markets. The vast amounts of liquidity pumped into the global economy after 9/11 have given investors the financial means to make massive bets and the state of the global economy has reassured them that these bets are all one way. The events of the past 48 hours have suggested that this is not necessarily always the case. Central banks have been issuing warnings for some time that markets are not fully priced for risk, and to ram home the point that strong global growth and soaring asset prices pose a threat to low inflation they have been pushing up interest rates as well. But until this week, the warnings have been blithely ignored by the markets. Now the hunt is on to explain the sudden spasm. Is it overheating in China, a looming US recession or just the fact that investors have made too many dumb plays in too many out-of-the-way locations? Despite being the source of the crash, most analysts believe there is little reason to panic about a slump in the Chinese economy, although there are signs of a bubble in some sectors. Prices of houses, art and stocks have surged thanks to a huge inflow of capital and a miserly banking system, where the returns on most deposits are 0%. But most China-based analysts believe the share price fall is a market adjustment, after a year of spectacular gains, rather than evidence of fundamental weakness. It was sparked by a government initiative to dampen speculation and investigate brokerages. Ahead of a politically sensitive Communist party congress later this year and the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the government will do everything in its power to ensure that the economy maintains its spectacular 10% growth rate. The links to overseas stock markets are overstated, according to several analysts, who point out that strict capital controls imposed by the government in Beijing prohibit foreign investors from buying Chinese stocks and make it difficult for Chinese investors to buy overseas shares. As proof of the disconnect, Stephen Green, a senior economist with Standard Chartered Bank, noted that Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges ended yesterday up 3.9% and 3.8% respectively, recovering about half of the previous day&apos;s losses, while the entire of the rest of Asia fell. A slowdown in the US is a much bigger threat and was underlined by news yesterday of a sharp fall in sales of new homes and a downward revision to growth in the final quarter of last year. The Economist Intelligence Unit said it had &quot;long been concerned that financial market participants, particularly equities investors in the US, have not fully taken into account the ongoing slowdown, even if it is not as sharp as originally feared. The economic prospects in the US have not justified the gains seen until recently on Wall Street, and any resulting correction would have implications for world financial markets in general. In particular, it could result in massive selling in emerging market assets, as seen last May and June. Most emerging markets look well overbought.&quot; Panglossian Some of the more Panglossian investors in Wall Street and the City believe even bad news is good for markets as it will prompt cuts in interest rates, which will boost growth, corporate earnings and hence share prices. Stephen Lewis, an economist at Insinger de Beaufort, said this might not be the case. &quot;Some investors will look to the central banks for a bail-out. But central bankers the world over have been complaining in recent weeks that the financial markets are misplacing risk. If events occur which lead investors once again to price risk appropriately, policymakers are likely to see that as salutary.&quot; Things will have to get a lot worse, Lewis said, for central bankers to ride to the rescue.", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-01T00:06:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/01/business.usa", "sentences": ["But exactly why either an overdue cooling of Shanghai&apos;s booming market or a warning on the US economy from Alan Greenspan - who is no longer the chair of the Federal Reserve - should trigger such big losses is not clear."], "title": "Leader: Justified jitters", "article": "&quot;I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.&quot; So concluded Sir Isaac Newton after seeing \u00a320,000 of his savings burst into nothing in the South Sea investment bubble. Three centuries later the ups and downs of financial markets are a continuing source of puzzlement. Panic on world trading floors this week, which at one point yesterday had wiped \u00a355bn off London shares, has been attributed to two factors. But exactly why either an overdue cooling of Shanghai&apos;s booming market or a warning on the US economy from Alan Greenspan - who is no longer the chair of the Federal Reserve - should trigger such big losses is not clear. Yesterday afternoon saw some recovery in New York but not in London, where nervousness persists. Stepping back from the specifics, are there grounds for thinking that this outbreak of jitters reveals deeper doubts about the financial outlook? For four years now, stock markets have been on a bull run. The buoyant mood of investors has been much enhanced by a serious dose of cheap money, which the world&apos;s central banks have been relaxed about dispensing ever since they scrambled to avoid recession after 9/11. But now, as interest rates creep back up, the question is whether the authorities have encouraged history to repeat itself in record time by inflating a new bubble that has become ripe to implode only seven years after the dotcom balloon was popped. There may be something in such fears, but they can be overdone. For - in the terms of an earlier warning from Mr Greenspan - the exuberance is not so irrational this time round. So severe was the hangover from the millennium party that London&apos;s FTSE 100 index still remains below its peak in 2000 - and that is despite sustained growth since then in the corporate profits that give shares their underlying value. Even if share prices in themselves suggest an amber rather than red alert, the worries do not end there. For most of the last decade the US has been the engine of world growth, its free-spending households keeping the world&apos;s factories humming. Doubts about how long this can continue are not new, but they are becoming more salient, as US house prices start to fall and the debts of those who dwell in them become bigger. The macroeconomic counterpart is a current-account deficit that remains close to 7% of national income, an overdraft requiring finance on a scale that the rest of the world will not be able to provide for ever. Even after the dollar&apos;s recent fall, further adjustment is needed. The question is whether this will happen gradually or whether a hard landing is in store. Sixty years ago today the International Monetary Fund opened its doors amid hopes that governments could coordinate to solve such problems. That was always optimistic, and looks especially so at a time when capital flows round the world with fewer fetters than ever. Free-flowing money has come alongside prosperity, but the crucial role that this vast and anonymous force will play in shaping the outlook can only add to the uncertainty. If the economic tide goes out, the rot exposed on the shoreline could be exacerbated by potentially unstable financial trades. The burgeoning supply of derivatives - sophisticated contracts to trade risk - now dwarfs the global money supply, but most of those who understand them are busy making money. Regulators struggle to calculate whether risk is being sold to those best able to bear it or is instead being piled up in a house of cards that could soon come crashing down. Booming private-equity companies engineer buyouts with massive debts, and the betting is that at least one will soon default. No one knows how wide the repercussions could be. Prophets of economic doom have been wrong time and again for 15 years. They may be wrong again. But this week&apos;s market jitters are a reflection of the very many reasons why no one can be sure.", "tags": ["Business", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-01T00:07:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/01/11", "sentences": ["In February it unveiled a long-term partnership agreement with with China&apos;s Intex Shanghai Company, which owns and manages the Shanghai International Exhibition Centre."], "title": "Tarsus Group taps into booming Chinese traveller market", "article": "Exhibition and conference organiser Tarsus Group is looking to tap into a surging market for overseas travel shows in China to keep up solid growth, after posting a leap in 2006 profits this morning.

Yesterday, China&apos;s main Shanghai stock index bounced back almost 4%, following a 9% slump on Tuesday, and Wall Street recovered slightly amid expectations that the US would see moderate growth despite the current turmoil. That took some pressure off London and there was also support from a handful of blue chips. Leisure group Whitbread issued an upbeat trading update, lifting its shares 17p, or 1%, to \u00a316.48. It cheered the market with news that like-for-like sales growth had picked up across all four of its main businesses, which include Premier Travel Inn budget hotels and Costa Coffee cafes. Nigel Parson, analyst at Evolution Securities, said the update revealed Premier Travel Inn had again been the star in the final quarter. &quot;Helpful though this is, the share price driver remains bid hopes,&quot; he added in a morning note. The shares have risen 53% over the last 12 months, thanks largely to takeover speculation. The group is seen as an attractive target because of its property assets. Further down the market, shares in SMG closed up 1.5p at 67.75p after a late announcement that UTV merger talks had been dropped was followed by news of major board changes. Just before the close, it emerged that the chairman of the Virgin Radio owner had been ousted by an aggressive value investor with the support of other frustrated shareholders in the Scottish media company. Rob Woodward, erstwhile commercial director of Channel 4, has been drafted in as chief executive to turn SMG around. Activist shareholder Hanover Investors described SMG as a &quot;perennial underperformer&quot;, which nevertheless had a &quot;solid and good set of assets with quite a strong franchise&quot;. &quot;The share price has halved since 2004 and the share price has underperformed its immediate peer group by 80%,&quot; said Hanover&apos;s founding partner and new SMG board member Matthew Peacock. &quot;If all we did was as poorly as the rest of the peers, we would be doing better than we are doing today.&quot; Back with the FTSE 100, among top gainers, Capita, which manages London&apos;s congestion charge, was up 11.5p at 647p as Deutsche Bank upgraded the company to buy from hold, seeing the recent weakness in its price as a buying opportunity. Home Retail Group rose 3p, or 0.7%, to 423p as talk of private equity interest persisted. The owner of Argos and Homebase had put in a brief rise on Tuesday - but then slipped back with the rest of the market - after speculation of a 530p offer. On a tough day, retail seemed to be one of the few sectors in favour. Clothes chain Next was also among the FTSE 100&apos;s handful of climbers, up 14p, or 0.7%, at \u00a320.42. In the FTSE 250, Debenhams added 3.75p, or 2.1%, to 181.75p thanks to bid talk, and Carpetright was not far behind, up 10p, or 0.9%, at \u00a311.53. Overall though, the index of mid-caps was down sharply again, adding to steep losses on Tuesday which had marked the largest percentage drop since May and the worst ever decline in points terms. By mid-afternoon the FTSE 250 stood at 11082.9, down 98 points, or 0.9%. Back among the blue chips, banks were some of the biggest fallers as traders cited concerns about the global economic outlook. Britain&apos;s biggest mortgage lender, HBOS, led the downhill march, shedding 52p, or 4.6%, at \u00a310.81. The group reported a 19% rise in annual profits, but that was overshadowed by worries about its margins and a wary outlook. Updating the market on bad debts - the topic of the hour - the bank said losses on unsecured lending slowed in the second half of the year, but it remained &quot;cautious about future trends given the continued growth in UK personal insolvencies&quot;. Barclays was also one of the day&apos;s biggest losers, down 28p, or 3.7%, to 740p. Standard Chartered dropped 22p to \u00a314.28, Lloyds TSB shed 11p to 574p and in the wider financial sector, Royal and SunAlliance lost 3.5p to 153.5p. It was a similar story with the mining companies. After a bashing on Tuesday on the back of China&apos;s stock falls and higher tax fears in South Africa, there were more heavy losses as economic slowdown worries hit copper prices. Concern about demand for commodities saw Anglo American fall 91p, or 3.6%, to \u00a324.16, Xstrata shed 84p to \u00a323.95 and BHP Billiton lose 29.5p to \u00a310.22. John Meyer at Numis Securities said: &quot;We believe the Chinese situation has been largely misunderstood and China should continue to show economic growth ahead of expectations.&quot; Further down the market, Aim-listed miner CAMEC managed to buck the trend, adding 2.75p, or 5.6%, to 51.75p after it announced plans to buy a Chinese cobalt plant. The deal takes the Democratic Republic of Congo-focused group into China&apos;s rapidly growing market. Corac Group, the intellectual property company that develops industrial air compressors, continued its upward march as its shares rose 2.5p, or 6.3%, to 42p - the highest in over eight months - amid talk that a recent overhang of stock had been cleared. Shares in the company have risen by more than 22% in the last three days, with demand also fuelled by general bullish chat on the internet regarding the company&apos;s progress. Corac posts its full year results on Friday next week. Its downhole gas compressor technology is seen by analysts as having the greatest value potential. Field trials finish at the end of 2008. But analysts have warned that risks still remain in achieving full commercialisation success, with contract timing the key to a good performance.", "tags": ["FTSE", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-01T14:57:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/01/china.usnews", "sentences": ["Henry Paulson is set to renew his campaign for China to revalue the yuan in a visit to Shanghai scheduled for later this month."], "title": "China's slow leap forward", "article": "Having caught up with the world&apos;s leading economies in such a short space of time, China is reluctant to make structural reforms that are likely to destabilise its progress- as the US treasury secretary is about to find out. Henry Paulson is set to renew his campaign for China to revalue the yuan in a visit to Shanghai scheduled for later this month. Good luck to him. China is unlikely to budge as the government in Beijing prizes stability above all else. Any significant appreciation in the yuan would mean a slowdown in exports and in China&apos;s capacity to create jobs for the 10 million Chinese entering the labour market annually. This obsession with stability \u2013 which is understandable given China&apos;s turbulent recent history under Mao \u2013 came through loud and clear during a three-hour lecture (with time for interpretation thrown in) by the formidable Liu Meixun, director of the Research Institute of Economics at Beijing&apos;s Tsinghua university. In a seminar for selected western guests from three British companies doing business in China \u2013 B&amp;Q, AstraZeneca and the architecture firm Benoy \u2013 she pointedly drew the contrast between China&apos;s successful reform with Russia&apos;s disastrous experience. In an overview of China&apos;s reform programme dating back to 1978, Professor Liu, who brooked no interruptions as she rattled off a blizzard of statistics to show China&apos;s remarkable economic progress, said Russia had courted chaos by opting for shock therapy, whereas China under Deng Xiaoping had gone for &quot;progressive reform&quot;. Among the more telling figures Prof Liu, who has taught at Tsinghua for 50 years, came up with was this. It took the Russian economy until last year to get back to the $1 trillion GDP it had reached in 1990 (by contrast China&apos;s GDP is $2.6 trillion, the world&apos;s fourth-largest economy having just overtaken Britain&apos;s). Signs of China&apos;s boom are all too apparent: the six-lane motorway from the airport to Beijing which was once a semi-derelict road; the new 20-storey tower blocks on either side of the road; and the proliferation of cars since the appearance of the first private car in Beijing in the 1980s (belonging to one of Prof Liu&apos;s colleagues). But while Prof Liu lavishes praise on Deng for his pragmatic approach \u2013 &quot;feel the stones while crossing the river&quot; \u2013 she acknowledges that China&apos;s breakneck development that has lifted 400 million people out of poverty has created &quot;obvious contradictions&quot;. There is the growing gap between urban and rural, between regions, corruption has flourished and there has been massive wastage of energy and resources. The analysis is very much along the lines of Will Hutton&apos;s new book, The Writing on the Wall. But whereas Hutton argues that China needs to become more pluralistic and develop what he calls &quot;Enlightenment values&quot; such as accountability, the rule of law and freedom of the press, Prof Liu hews close to the party line. Asked whether she means that the Communist party should give up power when she talks about the need for China to become democratic, she avoids a direct answer. &quot;Whether the party can rule or adopt pluralism depends on the conditions of the country,&quot; she replies. &quot;The party might not rule for ever, it depends on whether the Communist party truly represents the people.&quot; Again Prof Liu returns to Russia, recalling her shock at the overnight disintegration of the Soviet Communist party. &quot;It was a sad fact that the party disintegrated after 70 years and no one stood up to support it. I was very shocked.&quot; When Mr Paulson comes to China he will be up against party officials who think very much along the same lines and who will resist any action that they think will endanger China&apos;s stability. It will be a clash of cultures between America&apos;s quick-fix approach and China&apos;s deliberate and pragmatic way of doing things. As Prof Liu pointedly noted, China took 20 years over its price reforms. It will take its own sweet time over revaluation.", "tags": ["Business", "China", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-01T15:39:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/02/china.economicdispatch", "sentences": ["While it is strong in what it calls the first tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, it still faces tough competition in smaller of second and third tier cities where local companies are strong."], "title": "How B&Q does it all in China", "article": "It is hard to miss the Golden Four Season B&amp;Q store in Beijing, with its giant orange logo clearly visible from one of the city&apos;s multi-lane ring roads. At 20,000 square metres, the Golden Four Season is the world&apos;s biggest B&amp;Q (the biggest in Britain is 15,000 sq m). The effect can be overwhelming when you step into its hangar-like interior. But Chinese customers apparently like the size and the choice.  Dan Wen, the general manager of the company&apos;s northern region that includes Beijing says: &quot;Chinese customers are used to this style. They are very sensitive to price, want more choices and big ranges. In a B&amp;Q in the UK you have 200 locks, here in Beijing we have 1,000 and 70 kinds of doors.&quot; There are also 60 different kinds of kitchen to choose from. Last October the Golden Four Season set a record for one-day sales for a B&amp;Q stores as customers flocked to the two-storey premises on China&apos;s national day, wracking up 10 million renminbi (\u00a3660,000). &quot;We had to keep the store open until midnight instead of nine,&quot; said Michael Sean (who is Chinese despite his name), B&amp;Q&apos;s district general manager. Only six of B&amp;Q&apos;s 10,000 staff in China are ex-pats. B&amp;Q, owned by Kingfisher, is part of the shopping revolution that has swept China, with Tesco, Carrefour and Wal-Mart among others piling into the \u00a3140bn retail market - and growing at double-digit pace. One of the early foreign retailers to enter China, B&amp;Q set up shop in 1999. It now has 54 stores and is the market leader in home improvement. In 2005, B&amp;Q acquired 13 stores of OBI China for an undisclosed sum, all of which have been converted to the B&amp;Q format.  Last year, sales reached \u00a3312.8m, compared to \u00a3211m in 2005. For this year, analysts are forecasting sales of \u00a3400m and profits of around \u00a310m. By 2010, B&amp;Q plans to have over 100 stores after China lifted restrictions on new store openings when it joined the World Trade Organisation in 2005. For B&amp;Q to have got this far, the retailer had to adapt. The first store pretty much followed the UK format catering to DIY customers until the company realised that Chinese don&apos;t do DIY. When Chinese buy homes, they buy an empty shell and furnish them from scratch down to the plumbing. They go to shops such as B&amp;Q or Orient Home, a big rival in northern China for the furnishings and the white goods.  Local workers - mostly migrant workers from the countryside - are hired to do the installation as labour is so cheap.  &quot;We have 800 million farmers in China,&quot; notes Mr Wen. So it&apos;s not so much DIY as CIY, create-it-yourself. You won&apos;t find small tins of paint to try on the wall at home; it all comes in big pots. The Golden Four Season sells everything from flooring and tiles to vacuum cleaners and washing machines, aiming to be a stop-shop. The home improvement market is growing on the back of China&apos;s housing market boom that makes Britain&apos;s look feeble by comparison. There is plenty of evidence in Beijing with half-finished tower blocks dotting Beijing&apos;s vast urban sprawl. Not that everything is going B&amp;Q&apos;s way. While it is strong in what it calls the first tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, it still faces tough competition in smaller of second and third tier cities where local companies are strong. &quot;Every city has its traditional store,&quot; said Mr Wen ruefully. In order to boost business, Mr Wen and Mr Sean, who enjoy a lot of autonomy, are constantly coming up with new schemes. The latest is to sell everyday products such as detergents, or impulse items such as cushions, small furniture and lamps. &quot;Our customers usually come only once when they are buying their home,&quot; says Mr Wen. &quot;We want more everyday customers like those who go to Wal-Mart and Carrefour.&quot; B&amp;Q also wants to boost its after-sales service as vendors of appliances and furnishings may lack the back-up personnel to sort out problems. Other ploys to stay ahead of the competition include devising strategies for particular cities instead of having the same strategy for all towns. In Beijing, for example, people have lots of time, apparently because there are many government people. &quot;Customers in Beijing have more time, they spend at least three or four days to buy here,&quot; says Mr Wen with a laugh. Foreign companies such as B&amp;Q enjoy one big advantage over domestic rivals when it comes to recruitment. Both Mr Wen and Mr Sean, who are both 40, wanted to work for a foreign firm. &quot;Most Chinese people prefer to work for foreign companies. Pay is one thing but we can learn more in terms of management skills, new concepts, more training and more stability,&quot; Mr Wen says. &quot;Chinese companies can have one good year and fail. There is no consistency.&quot; Mr Sean once worked for Wal-Mart but said there was one big disadvantage. &quot;They gave the opportunities to Hong Kong Chinese or outside Chinese and Wal-Mart is in a mature market. Here we have the chance to be more creative and innovative,&quot; says Mr Sean. B&amp;Q, which last year picked up an award from the Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific for its innovative approach in China, has undoubtedly benefited from being able to pick and choose from the local talent. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-02T15:39:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/02/chiangisonthewayoutinta", "sentences": ["There is only one China, agreed Richard Nixon in the Shanghai Communique."], "title": "The chairman's reign", "article": "One of the few occasions on which Jun Chang and Jon Halliday show Mao Tse Tung with any deep human feelings in their biography is when they describe how he went into mourning following the death of his old partner and rival, Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek. Their biography also showed how much Mao owed Chiang for giving him a free pass for much of the legendary Long March. Chiang and Mao had other areas of agreement as well, notably their common determination that Taiwan was part of one China, with one legitimate government, even though they begged to differ about which of their governments that was. So it will be interesting to see Beijing&apos;s reaction to the news that the Taiwanese government is downgrading the massive Mausoleum to Chiang Kai Shek in Taipei, and evicting the old Generalissimo&apos;s mortal remains from it. Taiwan&apos;s pro-independence government have already de-Chianged Taiwan&apos;s airport, the presidential palace and moved his omnipresent statue from military barracks. They have also begun to rename the old agencies, deleting the vestigial &quot;China&quot; in the title. The next move is to commemorate the massacre, which took place sixty years ago this week (February 28 1947) of some 28,000 Taiwanese that Chiang staged as a &quot;welcome-back to the motherland&quot; for the brief period in modern history when Taiwan and the mainland shared the same government. Back in Beijing, crowds still queue to see the pickled chairman in the mausoleum while his head still adorns the appreciating Yuan. And his successors still maintain the peculiar protocols of the People&apos;s Democracy, one of which is pointing more than 900 missiles at Taiwan and threatening to unleash them if the Taiwanese people should ever renounce their vestigial claim to the mainland and declare the island an independent entity. In fact, the mainland would be better off inviting Taiwan to take over. Since Chiang&apos;s death, the island has built a prosperous and vibrant, albeit boisterous, democracy, which in the social democratic sense - of unions, labour regulation and a national health service - is actually more socialist than the mainland. Taiwan&apos;s elected rulers are actively engaged in exorcising the tyrannical past, in contrast to the comrades in Beijing, who try to avoid mentioning Mao the way that John Cleese tried to avoid mentioning the war. The chairman keeps cropping up anyway. In contrast, the People&apos;s Republic still adheres to the old principle that the way to win hearts and minds is either to twist testicles or put bullets in brains. Those 900 missiles are hardly a Valentine&apos;s Day card to the broad masses of compatriots in Taiwan. In the modern world, as the British discovered in Ireland, and indeed earlier with the 13 ex-colonies, it is difficult to win love and respect at the point of a bayonet. China&apos;s threats are more than a little counterproductive in building a spirit of Chinese patriotism among Taiwanese. China spent decades supporting the right to self-determination for its chums in the non-aligned. It could try being consistent. Indeed one additional charge that pro-independence Taiwanese may bring against Chiang is that when the mainland won the China seat at the UN in 1974, he withdrew his delegation. In the nature of the UN, Taiwan, as the Republic of China, could have relied on sheer inertia to retain a seat in the general assembly. Now of course, Beijing bullies and the rest of the world kow-tows. There is only one China, agreed Richard Nixon in the Shanghai Communique. And the rest of the world is prepared, for example, to leave a diplomatic and global governance vacuum in the epicentre of the SARS and Avian Flu global potential pandemics because Taiwan can&apos;t join the WHO. China keeps growling in the UN about the peacekeeping force in Haiti because the Haitians still recognise Taiwan. It is past time for other countries to stop the kow-towing and bring the PRC up to speed with historical progress. The Middle Kingdom is, like Monty Python&apos;s parrot, &quot;dead, passed on ... no more ... a stiff ...b ereft of life&quot;, and should be left &quot;to rest in peace&quot;. The PRC&apos;s claim to Taiwan has all the legal and moral stature of a revanchist British claim to Ireland or New Zealand. In fact, less. The British ruled those places far longer than the mainland had any effective power in Taiwan. Even if one were to accept the PRC&apos;s claims, the Chinese delegation, along with the rest of the world, accepted the new doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect at the 2005 UN heads of state summit. Legally, Beijing can no longer croon &quot;&apos;t ain&apos;t nobody&apos;s business if I do&quot;, if they drop 900 missiles on Taiwan. The rest of the world has a responsibility to intervene - and a large self- interest. It also has a big incentive to start thinking about this. Perhaps most disturbingly for the future is the US guarantee to Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, which in turn, the Chinese have promised if the Taiwanese &quot;declare independence&quot;. A promise from Tricky Dicky is not the most negotiable currency in the world, and looking at the amount of money made in the US from buying Chinese goods cheap and selling them dear, it would be natural for Taiwanese to wonder about the protective umbrella. It was in return for those guarantees that they gave up on nuclear weapons. If the guarantees begin to look shaky then maybe the nuclear self-denial will be as well. If Taiwan is not a state it cannot join the non-proliferation treaty. and if it is part of China, then it benefits from the existing nuclear powers&apos; exemption in the treaty. Whether it builds or buys them (North Korea may have some on offer) there are few nuclear powers in the world with half the justification that Taiwan has. There should be some serious negotiations with China about ending this impasse, not from the usual prone posture before the throne. They should be told: you can woo, but you cannot rape. And they have to take no for an answer if that&apos;s what the Taiwanese want. Beijing&apos;s rulers can keep Mao on the banknotes, but should get him out of their heads.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "US news", "United Nations", "Nuclear weapons", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-02T20:55:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/04/theobserver.observerbusiness3", "sentences": ["From Shanghai, to Wall Street, to the Square Mile and back again - fear travels fast in financial markets, and last week saw a particularly virulent outbreak."], "title": "Shares slump sets alarm bells ringing", "article": "From Shanghai, to Wall Street, to the Square Mile and back again - fear travels fast in financial markets, and last week saw a particularly virulent outbreak. After four tumultuous days of frantic selling, some analysts were warning of worse to come, as nervous investors offload their riskier assets and retreat to safer ground. By the end of the week, the FTSE was down almost 300 points, the Dow Jones more than 500; and the Nikkei, in Japan, had surrendered all the gains it had made since the turn of the year. Several explanations were advanced for the rollercoaster ride, from cautionary remarks by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about the health of the US economy, to a rumoured crackdown on financial speculators in Beijing. But analysts said the markets&apos; violent reaction to a few snippets of information was best seen as a symptom of investors&apos; gnawing anxiety that their long run of good luck may be about to end. &apos;Markets have had quite a long run of positive momentum. The issue then becomes, what justifies equities continuing to go up in a straight line?&apos; says Richard Batty of Standard Life, who believes last week&apos;s movements were the beginning of what he calls a &apos;normal correction&apos; in equity markets. &apos;At a time when the markets are looking for a reason to sell, it&apos;s all grist to the mill. The fact that we are in the longest bull run for many years does indicate that investors are going to be cautious,&apos; agrees Peter Dixon of Commerzbank. He draws a comparison with last May, when equities, commodities and the foreign exchanges had a tumultuous 10 weeks, before calm was restored. Nine months later, he says, investors&apos; concerns are similar - but the economic background looks less positive. &apos;The US economy has lost quite a bit of momentum, and a large number of companies have surprised on the downside with earnings.&apos; Profits as a proportion of GDP have hit a 40-year high in the US, and few analysts believe these levels can be sustained. Last week provided fresh evidence that the slowdown in the US economy, which began in the housing market, is likely to be more serious than the &apos;soft landing&apos; many investors had been counting on. The economy was found to have grown at a sluggish 2.2 per cent annual rate in the final quarter of 2006, instead of the 3.5 per cent suggested by the government&apos;s earlier estimate. News that orders to US factories were down almost 8 per cent in February raised fears of further weakness. Higher than expected defaults on so-called &apos;sub-prime&apos; mortgages have also underlined the seriousness of the housing market slowdown. With economic growth remaining strong in the eurozone, China, India and Japan, despite the slowdown in the US in the second half of last year, many economists have argued that a global &apos;decoupling&apos; has taken place that would cushion the impact of American weakness. But the wave of panic that spread around global stock markets last week suggested investors are not so sanguine about the connections between the major economies. The US accounts for 20 per cent of China&apos;s exports, many of which are produced by American firms. And the US slowdown comes just as the authorities in Beijing are struggling to dampen the country&apos;s massive investment boom by raising interest rates, and increasing reserve requirements for banks. If successful, this process of squeezing investment could hit the prices of commodities such as copper and steel, which the resource-hungry country has been gobbling up. Stephen Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley, points out that investment spending in China was an extraordinary 45 per cent of GDP last year. Even Japan was only spending 34 per cent of its GDP on investment at the height of its post-World War Two reconstruction boom. Some economists believe last week&apos;s pessimism about a US-China slowdown is overdone. &apos;The growth fundamentals aren&apos;t rock solid, but they&apos;re reasonably robust,&apos; said David Brown, economist at Bear Stearns. &apos;This is not a long-term bear market, just a short-term blow-off.&apos; What worries market-watchers about the prospect of even a mild economic slowdown, however, is that investors have failed to prepare for the worst. Central banks have long warned that markets might be failing to put a high enough price on financial risks. After a long period of historically low interest rates around the world, investors have been borrowing cheaply and scouring global markets for higher-risk, higher-return assets, driving up their prices. &apos;There&apos;s been very little risk priced into the markets, so this is a timely reminder that things aren&apos;t as risk-free as we thought,&apos; says Paul Ashworth, US economist at Capital Economics. One example of this phenomenon, which analysts believe could have serious implications, is the explosion of the so-called &apos;yen carry-trade&apos;. Official interest rates in Japan are still at 0.5 per cent and speculators have been borrowing this cheap money and pouring the cash into higher-yielding assets, such as emerging market equities. If the yen begins to rise - because the Bank of Japan increases interest rates more quickly than expected, for example - the bet suddenly will not look so good. Investors might hurriedly start unwinding the carry-trade by pulling out of emerging markets and buying yen to pay off their debts. That could send the Japanese currency soaring and cause turbulence across all the high-yielding markets the carry-trade has helped to fuel - and it could happen very fast. In the autumn of 1998, when a previous bout of frenzied carry-trading went into reverse, the yen jumped almost 15 per cent against the dollar within little more than a fortnight. There were early signs on Friday that some unwinding is already underway - the yen climbed to an 11-week high against the dollar, up 1 per cent on the day. And the carry-traders are not alone. If leveraged-up investors decide to ready themselves for rockier times ahead, a wide range of asset classes, from steel, to the dollar, to equities, could be hit hard. The financial contagion that sent the sell-off whizzing around the world within hours last week was a reminder that if the US economy really does turn sour - and especially if China is affected, too - there will be nowhere for investors to hide.", "tags": ["Business", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-04T00:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/mar/04/shares.moneyinvestments", "sentences": ["In China, where the global falls started, share prices had risen by 13 per cent in the six days before the fall, topping a year in which the Shanghai index had risen almost threefold."], "title": "Heather Connon: Will the bears give investors a sore head?", "article": "Was last week&apos;s fall in global stock markets just a correction following a prolonged spell of rising markets or does it mark the end of the four-year bull market? About the only thing that can be said with certainty at the moment is that it underlines how nervous investors are. There are plenty of reasons to worry. In China, where the global falls started, share prices had risen by 13 per cent in the six days before the fall, topping a year in which the Shanghai index had risen almost threefold. In Britain, shares have been rising more or less consistently for four years. In the US, the Dow reached an all-time high last year while the wider S&amp;P 500 was flirting with it before last week&apos;s tremors. Everywhere, bids have been getting bolder: last week saw the biggest ever acquisition by private equity, paying $45bn (\u00a323bn) for Texan utility TXU. And investors are indulging in ever more complicated - and more highly leveraged - financial instruments. Mike Turner, head of strategy and asset allocation at Aberdeen Asset Management, says there is an &apos;extreme speculative element&apos; in the markets. &apos;Market makers [who price stocks] globally are aware of how much markets have been rising and of the impact of global liquidity on share prices and they did not want to risk being caught out, so they marked their prices lower.&apos; But he does not think there has been much panic selling by investors - nor does he think there should be, because there has been no major economic event, such as the return of inflationary pressures or a sudden slowing in growth, to change their outlook. Instead, he believes it is simply a correction. Many other fund managers seem to agree, although, given that their business depends to a large extent on persuading us to keep investing in stocks, that is hardly surprising. Jason Britton at T Bailey points out that, while the UK stock market has been rising for three years and is more than 80 per cent above its 2003 low, price-earnings multiples - a key measure of stock market valuation - have been declining for most of that time and are not high by long-term averages. Of course, p/e ratios reflect earnings forecasts as well as share prices: if these forecasts fall, p/e ratios could rise even if share prices stand still. And there is plenty of evidence that analysts are too optimistic about the outlook for earnings. Mike Lenhoff, equity strategist at Brewin Dolphin, points out that in September analysts were forecasting earnings growth in the UK of 6.8 per cent in 2007; now that has fallen back to 5.6 per cent. In the US, the fall has been even more marked, from 10.1 per cent in September to 6.6 per cent. Many companies have been warning of more difficult times ahead, although Lenhoff thinks the forecast downgrades are largely over. He does not expect much excitement from the stock market this year and history suggests that is a safe bet: according to the Barclays Capital Equity Gilt Study, which analyses market returns going back to 1899, there have been only five occasions when shares rose for five consecutive years. A bet that it will happen again is, therefore, rather high risk. The best advice for most investors is to exercise caution: if you want to put money into the stock market, it is better to feed it in gradually through a regular savings scheme than to pile it all in at once. All the research shows that this is a far better strategy than trying to buy in the dips and sell at the peaks. One of the key influences that sparked the market&apos;s recovery from last year&apos;s correction, and which had been fuelling this year&apos;s rise too, is bid speculation. Corus and Scottish Power have already succumbed to takeover this year and there are rumours about dozens of others, from Prudential and Lloyds TSB to Tate and Lyle and Rentokil. Buying into potential bid targets can be a good strategy: last summer, shares in Scottish Power were trading below 600p but the bid from Iberdrola is worth about 800p. Companies like J Sainsbury and Countrywide - the estate agent attracting interest from private equity groups - have enjoyed similar surges in their shares following bid speculation. Digital Look, the financial website, calculates that five of the companies recently subject to takeover rumours - Sainsbury, Spanish restaurant group La Tasca, Scottish Power, Countrywide and housebuilder Ben Bailey - enjoyed an average increase in their shares of 10 per cent in one month. The problem, however, is that not all bid rumours turn into real offers: consequently, the losses from holding a company when bid interest disappears can be high. Digital Look points to Regal Petroleum, whose shares fell by 10 per cent when it revealed that mooted bid talks had ended. Private equity can be particularly dangerous in this respect. These firms exist to do deals, so will constantly be assessing whether they can make a return by taking over some company or other. In many cases, however, they will conclude that a deal does not make sense. WH Smith, Woolworths and ITV have all seen their prices soar on rumours of private equity interest, only to plunge again when the interest disappears. For all but the diehard speculator, therefore, there is little point in trying to guess where bidders will alight next; the risks of substantial losses if the deal disappears outweigh the prospect of profits if a takeover goes ahead. Some special situations funds - like Antony Bolton&apos;s at Fidelity - look for bid targets as part of their investment process. Those who want to tap into bid fever would be better off buying into funds like these than into the companies themselves.", "tags": ["Money", "Shares", "Investments"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-04T02:14:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/04/china.theobserver", "sentences": ["China&apos;s emerging markets, in Shanghai and the southern boom city of Shenzhen, are not like others."], "title": "The stock-dealing communists: China's eager capitalists", "article": "A 9 per cent fall in the Chinese stock market was a major factor behind the global meltdown. Jonathan Fenby reports on how the authorities are trying prevent boom turning to bust. China&apos;s emerging markets, in Shanghai and the southern boom city of Shenzhen, are not like others. Though borrowing to buy shares has risen, leverage is low by western standards; most stocks are bought with real money that real people actually hold or draw from the nation&apos;s huge pool of savings. Still, Chinese markets remain speculative, buoyed on the liquidity spawned by the boom. Regulations have been tightened up, but the context in which they operate has to be understood to avoid future panics. The markets are dominated by holders of individual trading accounts, which, by and large, reflect the huge movement of households into dealing shares. Mutual funds are an infinitesimal presence, by contrast. The Chinese middle class has gone to the market with a vengeance. There is a nationalistic element in the satisfaction engendered by the bull market; indeed, a professor in Beijing reported last week that some of his students were even proud of the big fall on Tuesday, taking it as yet another sign that China does everything bigger. In a country without a welfare system and a gaping pensions black hole, stocks have become the way of paying for education, healthcare and old age. As a result, before last week&apos;s gyrations, the index was up 130 per cent year on year. A senior legislator was brought out last month to talk of a &apos;bubble&apos;; the effect lasted a day or so. The government said tax measures that have been held in abeyance for a decade would be applied to cool down the real estate sector; the biggest company fell by the maximum permitted amount of 10 per cent, and then bounced back. The government will go on trying, but it does not want a major bust before the National People&apos;s Congress holds its legislative session this month. But measures Beijing is taking to try to achieve greater social balance might make things worse; a scheme to allow rural post offices to lend out the savings they collect could encourage a multitude of farmers to go into the financial markets. \u00b7 Jonathan Fenby is editor-in-chief and China editor of the London-based analysts Trusted Sources; trustedsources.co.uk", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-04T02:22:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/mar/04/india.recycling", "sentences": ["For Dharavi&apos;s detractors, mainly Mumbai&apos;s city fathers and real estate developers, keen to get their hands on the prime land beneath the sprawl, the shanty is an embarrassing boil to be lanced from the body of an ambitious city hoping to become the next Shanghai."], "title": "Waste not, want not in the \u00a3700m slum", "article": "Wiping beads of sweat from his forehead, Mr Aziz stubs out a grubby cheroot on his counter and unwraps a glossy paan leaf the size of his palm. Holding it to his pockmarked face he inhales the aromatic betel nut paste inside. &apos;I sell these as a stimulant to the local nightshift workers,&apos; he says. &apos;I use them to escape the smell of this place.&apos; Around his tiny stall the unmistakable stench of ammonia and sewage hangs heavy over Apna Street, a packed industrial lane that dissects Mumbai&apos;s labyrinthine Dharavi slum. The paan vendor looks out towards the Arabian Sea, as if wishing an ocean breeze would somehow blow the foul air west, out over Asia&apos;s largest shantytown towards the desolate salt-pans and low-lying marshes encircling India&apos;s most chaotic city. A 175-hectare maze of impenetrable dark alleys and corrugated shacks, Dharavi swarms with more than a million residents. There is only one easy way into its true heart, according to local folklore - you follow the splotches of blood red betel juice, spat on to the muddy ground by Mr Aziz&apos;s satisfied customers. If you have the patience to look closer, you will find here one of the most inspiring economic models in Asia. Dharavi may be one of the world&apos;s largest slums, but it is by far its most prosperous - a thriving business centre propelled by thousands of micro-entrepreneurs who have created an invaluable industry - turning around the discarded waste of Mumbai&apos;s 19 million citizens. A new estimate by economists of the output of the slum is as impressive as it seems improbable: \u00a3700m a year. For Dharavi&apos;s detractors, mainly Mumbai&apos;s city fathers and real estate developers, keen to get their hands on the prime land beneath the sprawl, the shanty is an embarrassing boil to be lanced from the body of an ambitious city hoping to become the next Shanghai. But for a growing number of environmental campaigners Dharavi is becoming the green lung stopping Mumbai choking to death on its own waste. All along Apna St hundreds of barefoot street children, human recycling machines, scurry back and forward, hauling bundles of waste - plastic, cardboard or glass - retrieved from Mumbai&apos;s vast municipal dumps. From every alley comes the sounds of hammering, drilling and soldering. In every shack, dark figures sit waist-deep in piles of car batteries, computer parts, fluorescent lights, ballpoint pens, plastic bags, paper and cardboard boxes and wire hangers, sorting each item for recycling. Workshops reveal everything from aluminium smelters recycling drink cans to perspiring bare-chested men stirring huge vats of waste soap retrieved from rubbish tips and local hotels. Walking through Dharavi, home to an estimated 15,000 single-room factories, it becomes difficult to conceive of anything that is not made or recycled here. Typifying the slum&apos;s entrepreneurial spirit, Dinesh Sarin proudly shows The Observer around his &apos;new corporate headquarters&apos; - a gaudily painted bamboo and scrap wood shack, lit by a sodium strip light and connected to the world by a plastic phone shaped like a mermaid. In the mud behind the hut Dinesh&apos;s employees use metal bars to bash dents out of one-gallon cooking oil cans. In an adjacent courtyard 20 more of his workers squat on stones and clean and hammer two-litre cooking oil cans back into shape. Along the assembly line the cans are dipped into scalding water, given a scrub and then taken away to the next stop - the polishers. &apos;We process over 400 of these a day. We get cans in a terrible state, beyond repair for most, and we clean them up and sell them back to the oil companies and direct to local consumers. We save them a fortune.&apos; Dinesh&apos;s life is an amalgam of both suffering and relative success. Around midnight, once the last shift is over, he heads for the cramped, concrete room in the centre of the slum where he, his wife and five children cook, eat and sleep. Here, in the warren-like interior of the shanty town, the buildings meet overhead and no light can penetrate. At first glance Dinesh might seem just another one of India&apos;s desperately poor, grinding out his days in pursuit of subsistence, but he has just bought his family a new bungalow in his home state, Bihar. &apos;I&apos;m saving up to buy a Maruti van so I can take my family to Goa when the weather gets too hot,&apos; he grins through betel nut-stained teeth. If India&apos;s biggest city is seen by economists as its great hope, Mumbai also embodies most of the country&apos;s staggering problems. The obstacles hampering India&apos;s progress - poor infrastructure, weak government, searing inequality, corruption and crime - converge in Mumbai like nowhere else. Here, where \u00a34m penthouses look over filthy slums, India&apos;s class divide is at its starkest. Largely as a result of its association with Bollywood, India&apos;s financial capital remains a beacon of hope for the young people of India. Many who come here end up on assembly lines in Dharavi. &apos;You in the West so easily see the slum as a negative concept,&apos; said Sonu Badal, a spokesman for Chirag, a campaign to secure Dharavi from demolition. &apos;Yes, it is beset by deep poverty and neglect, but Dharavi has also been mirroring India&apos;s economic revival and it has done so largely by rejecting a local government that has long ignored it and by recycling its own resources.&apos; He continues: &apos;These slum dwellers use their imagination and work hard to make something out of the day-to-day objects others leave behind, yet have been abandoned by the government; Dharavi is an extraordinary success story, its recycling industry employs over 250,000 people, yet thanks to its prime location it is on borrowed time.&apos; According to Friends of the Earth, which criticised Northumberland council for sending its waste to India for recycling, Britons should learn more from the developing world. &apos;In the UK we could do worse than looking to the recycling endeavour of slum-dwellers in places like Dharavi for inspiration. The level of recycling in the UK is deeply disappointing,&apos; says Claire Wilton, of Friends of the Earth. &apos;There is a lot to learn from the developing world, where a scavenger mentality, grass roots recycling and sheer necessity can lead to imaginative leaps in redeploying waste.&apos; In the so-called &apos;13th compound&apos; Dharavi&apos;s recycling miracle is in full show. This is where 80 per cent of Mumbai&apos;s plastic waste is given a new life. All around young boys cart wheelbarrows filled with everyday plastic waste. Junk is a word that does not exist. Dharavi&apos;s plastic recycling industry employs almost 10,000 people, melting, reshaping and moulding discarded plastic. Close by you will find , the soap-makers, who reprocess soap from hotels and schools. In single rooms hundreds of men toil in the heat over large metal troughs filled with sinister-looking yellow-green liquid. Around them their co-workers boil vats of molten soap, stirring the cauldrons with oar-sized sticks. Yet survival in a slum rarely means adhering to the law. Barely 10 per cent of the commercial activity here is legal. Most of the workshops are constructed illegally on government land, power is routinely stolen and commercial licences are rarely sought. There is just one lavatory for every 1,500 residents, not a single public hospital, and only a dozen municipal schools. Throughout the slum filthy chicken and mutton stalls dispose bloody viscera into open drains thick with untreated human and industrial waste - cholera, typhoid and malaria are common. Taps run dry most of the time and tankers bring in potable water once in a fortnight. But Dharavi remains a land of recycling opportunity for many rural Indians. The average household in Dharavi now earns between 3,000 and 15,000 rupees a month (\u00a340-\u00a3200), well above agricultural wage levels. The new money through recycling has in effect spawned a new slum gentry. Certain corners of Dharavi have even gone upmarket with bars, beauty parlours and clothing boutiques. Last week a major bank opened the slum&apos;s first ATM. But the future of the slum is uncertain. The government has provisionally approved a plan called &apos;Vision Mumbai&apos; - to create a world-class city by 2013. But internationally renowned architect Charles Correa, who has worked in the city for 50 years, says: &apos;There&apos;s very little vision with this plan. They&apos;re more like hallucinations.&apos; Demolition work has begun and police are forcing out inhabitants, leaving thousands homeless. Author and architect Neera Adarkar is among hundreds of activists who see Vision Mumbai as impractical and inhumane because it ignores both the industry and hope of the slum. &apos;Why wreck the homes and lives of people who have built the city and lived in it for decades?&apos; he said. &apos;Because from your luxury high-rise apartment you don&apos;t want the humiliation of India&apos;s poor in your line of vision as you make your money and succeed. Forcing them out is the only option. You simply can&apos;t wish them away.&apos; \u00b7 Listen to Dan McDougall report from Dharavi and see the extraordinary pictures in our audio slideshow", "tags": ["Environment", "India", "Recycling", "Waste", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-04T02:23:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/04/shopping.homes", "sentences": ["B&amp;B has flourishing shops and outlets in Shanghai and Beijing, but Giorgio and Luca are exasperated by Chinese firms who copy their expensively developed designs."], "title": "Ideal foam exhibition", "article": "It started with a rubber duck. Some 42 years ago Italian furniture manufacturer Piero Ambrogio Busnelli was visiting a London trade fair, looking for a radical new method for producing sofas and armchairs which would allow him to abandon the traditional horsehair, wood and springs, and all the skilled craftsmen that they required. He was looking for an industrial, modern method. He found it in the yellow bath accessory. The bird was made from polyurethane formed in moulds. Busnelli&apos;s challenge was to mimic the method on a much larger scale. Back in Italy he improvised a machine, using motorbike chains and electric drills, that would mix the foam and allow it to expand like a souffle inside furniture-shaped moulds. With this invention a whole new realm of designs was made possible, and the world&apos;s most successful luxury furniture-maker was born. Today that firm is known as B&amp;B Italia, and the Busnelli family are still firmly in control. (The other B stands for the &apos;banks&apos; from which Piero raised the cash to buy his former partner Cassina out of the business.) On the factory floor the descendants of Piero&apos;s improvised matrix resemble giant toasted-sandwich-makers, clamped shut while the furniture sets. Each piece is made to order, slowly moving around the 30,000 sqm factory floor, through different stages of construction and finishing - there appears to be no shortage of takers for statement sofas with bank-loan price tags. Despite his 80 years, the dapper Piero spends most days attending meetings or checking up on one of the firm&apos;s three factories. One son, Giorgio, is chairman of the company; another, Emanuele, heads up the contract division (profitable fit-outs of offices, cruise ships and the like), while nephew Federico co-runs the R&amp;D department. This is not uncommon among the major Italian furniture companies. B&amp;B Italia, like Cassina, Boffi, Cappellini and others, has its headquarters in the Brianza district north of Milan. As Giorgio explains, this sometimes makes recruiting staff tricky. &apos;We can&apos;t recruit from our competitors because 98 per cent of the Italian furniture business is a family business.&apos; One of the reasons that they recently recruited a new managing director from outside the furniture fraternity. Luca Fuso was hired from clothing brand Diesel, although he is at pains to play down the idea that the furniture industry is beginning to resemble the fast-paced, fickle fashion world. After all, people are not changing their sofas as quickly as their shoes just yet. The longevity of some of the B&amp;B designs is one of the company&apos;s proudest boasts. Only this month they are reissuing the Bambole, a sofa design that takes full advantage of B&amp;B&apos;s innovations and doesn&apos;t feature feet, frame or rigid supports. To emphasise the uninhibited design La Bambole&apos;s original 1972 advertising campaign featured Andy Warhol Superstar Donna Jordan, topless and carefree, cavorting with the chair. B&amp;B Italia, now celebrating its 40th anniversary, has had some pieces in production for its entire history. The Coronado sofa, designed by Afra and Tobia Scarpa, has been in production for nearly 40 years, with customers returning them for re-covering in new fabrics. B&amp;B Italia has always worked with leading designers, who now include Naoto Fukasawa, Patricia Urquiola and Gaetano Pesce. The process from the initial designer&apos;s idea to production line is a long and complex one. &apos;What we are interested in is the idea of something that is not existing,&apos; explains Federico rather cryptically. He says that from 100 ideas they will make 25 models or prototypes, of which maybe three will make the finish-line - and revealed to the design world&apos;s buyers and journalists at the Milan furniture fair in April. The process from idea to final customer takes around 27 months. As Giorgio explains, this lengthy time-line makes trend-seeking difficult. &apos;If you present a product that&apos;s too avant-garde, and in six months&apos; time there are no sales, it is discontinued, unless it is declared an iconic piece. Our biggest challenge is to produce an iconic piece that is a long-seller.&apos; Last year B&amp;B Italia announced it had gone into partnership with Moooi, the Dutch design company co-owned by Marcel Wanders, an unorthodox and feted designer responsible for chairs made from resin-hardened rope and vases moulded from condoms full of hard-boiled eggs. &apos;Their approach was different,&apos; notes Giorgio. The firm sees two of its biggest challenges as China and women. B&amp;B has flourishing shops and outlets in Shanghai and Beijing, but Giorgio and Luca are exasperated by Chinese firms who copy their expensively developed designs. They claim to have seen whole brochures of B&amp;B product counterfeited. &apos;People ask if we will start production in China,&apos; says Giorgio. &apos;I say we don&apos;t need to, we can just buy one of the factories that is copying our product already.&apos; A lot of this product has been conceived and designed by and for men. The design business is male-dominated, but on the showroom floor women have more and more purchasing power. As the charmingly unreconstructed Federico observes, &apos;Men are more rational, women more emotional.&apos; So B&amp;B have employed female designers, most notably Patricia Urquiola. Since 2002, the Spaniard has contributed 14 product ranges to the B&amp;B massif, most covetable being her Tufty-Time sofa with its inviting chocolate bar-like structure. During the Observer&apos;s visit, she happened to be visiting the R&amp;D centre. The charismatic Urquiola animatedly describes her association with B&amp;B: &apos;The relationship is easy. I&apos;m trying to grow, in all the senses, to be innovative and to keep a kind of coolness.&apos; A B&amp;B utterance if ever there was one.", "tags": ["Life and style", "Homes"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-04T14:13:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/04/motorracing.motorsports", "sentences": ["Yet none of the F1 venues in that country could match the streets of Durban and a fast but tricky track that is more difficult than Bahrain and Shanghai, F1&apos;s charmless but highly touted models of efficiency."], "title": "Motor racing: Hulkenberg on road to glory", "article": "The A1GP series, launched by Sheikh Maktoum in 2004, regards itself as second only to Formula One in terms of global identity. It is a valid claim when the logistics are examined. A1GP&apos;s World Cup of Motor Sport raced in South Africa last weekend as it continued to demonstrate a wider reach than F1 while heading towards the conclusion of a championship that will have visited the Far East, New Zealand, Australia, Mexico and the Czech Republic before the final round at Brands Hatch on 29 April. The only problem is that this well organised and entertaining international contest remains one of motor sport&apos;s best-kept secrets, not that you would have guessed as Durban claimed 114,000 spectators over the three days. Motor sport has always been popular in South Africa thanks to F1 world championship races being staged, on and off, between 1962 and 1993. Yet none of the F1 venues in that country could match the streets of Durban and a fast but tricky track that is more difficult than Bahrain and Shanghai, F1&apos;s charmless but highly touted models of efficiency. The A1GP concept is similarly unique. Each team represents a different country, 22 in all, ranging from Great Britain and Ireland to the USA, Pakistan and Singapore. Drivers must hail from the nation in question, Britain being adequately represented last weekend by Robbie Kerr as the Englishman finished second in the main race, a tense 70-minute battle that included a mandatory pit stop to change tyres. While Britain, New Zealand, Switzerland and Portugal fought relentlessly for second place, Germany&apos;s representative, Nico Hulkenberg, dominated the race. One of the purposes of A1GP is to highlight young talent and it is succeeding because, on the basis of his speed and extraordinary maturity, 19-year-old Hulkenberg will be in F1 sooner rather than later. It was no coincidence that Willi Weber backs the German team, Michael Schumacher&apos;s manager travelling to Durban to oversee the moulding of his next world champion. Paradoxically, Weber&apos;s support for A1GP highlighted its greatest weakness, the immaculately coiffured impresario signing autographs and proving to be more famous than the young drivers he might wish to represent in the future. Perhaps the best thing Weber could do for the series would be to persuade Schumacher - when the inevitable boredom sets in during retirement - to take part in just one race. A well known name would trigger the media attention the series needs and provide the young stars with the best yardstick imaginable. Schumacher, in the unlikely event of him taking up the challenge, ought to win thanks to the emphasis being on the contribution of drivers in cars that are identical. But it would not be as straightforward as he might think. The Lola cars are not sophisticated and the number of technical staff per team is limited to 10, all of which helps keep costs at a manageable level. A one-car outfit competing at the 12 meetings comes at the exceptionally reasonable sum of $5m, a tenth of the figure demanded by any self-respecting F1 team. A lack of the excessive aerodynamic downforce, which dumbs down the raw excitement of F1, means A1GP cars are tricky to drive. The power from the 500bhp V8 engine exceeds the capacity of the chassis to handle it; a combination that has always provided the best examination of a driver&apos;s talent. Throw in the uneven surface of a street circuit and concrete walls lining its edges and you have the ingredients for as tough a challenge that any driver could wish for. Not that F1 cares particularly about the needs of spectators - mere second-class citizens when placed alongside the financial potential created by F1&apos;s world-wide television audience - but A1GP provides valuable lessons in respect for the paying punter. Each car is painted in national colours, thereby making it instantly recognisable, unlike an F1 car that carries a single number so insultingly small that the driver may as well give the crowd the finger as he speeds past. The A1GP website not only provides driver blogs but also invites participation by the fans. Sponsors&apos; guests are invited to mingle on the grid 20 minutes before the start of the race, a novel idea that would cause Bernie Ecclestone to have a fit. When A1GP made its debut at Brands Hatch at September 2005, some observers wrongly assumed the series was attempting to oust F1. Nothing could be further from the truth since A1GP consists of many ex-F1 people who know the world championship is unlikely to be matched, never mind toppled from its position of authority. None the less, the return to Brands Hatch next month will demonstrate just how much A1GP has grown and deserves a place at the important end of the sport&apos;s hierarchy.", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "A1GP"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-04T18:10:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/05/mondaymediasection.financialtimes", "sentences": ["At a conference in Dubai he met a vice-chairman of China&apos;s National People&apos;s Congress, Cheng Siwei, who said he thought there was a bubble in the Shanghai market."], "title": "Interview: John Ridding", "article": "John Ridding looks remarkably refreshed for a man who has just stepped off a transatlantic flight, and who spent the previous night at a party. As chief executive of the Financial Times, he had been hosting a celebration in New York to mark the 10th anniversary of his newspaper&apos;s US launch. &quot;It was fantastic,&quot; he says, talking excitedly of &quot;the fulsome tribute to the FT brand from Mayor Bloomberg&quot; and &quot;the wonderful guest list&quot;, before pointing to &quot;the happy coincidence&quot; of the American edition achieving a new circulation record of 157,000 copies a day. Ridding was also smiling for a slightly more personal reason. After spending seven hours on the plane at his computer he experienced one of those digital nightmares in which all his work vanished. Then, just before his plane landed, he found it all again. That incident could be a metaphor for Ridding&apos;s own career at the FT: he spent nearly 20 years as a journalist before becoming chief executive last May, rode out a difficult period in his early days as CEO when painful staff cuts were made, then had the intense pleasure of seeing a risky strategy succeed. Success indeed. Last week the FT reported a leap in profits for 2006 from \u00a32m to \u00a311m, with sales up 8% to \u00a3238m and advertising revenues rising 9%. So Ridding has a good story to tell, and he tells it with enthusiasm. In his sixth-floor office overlooking the Thames at Southwark Bridge, he talks animatedly about the paper&apos;s new-found sense of purpose under his leadership and the editorship of Lionel Barber, who was appointed in November 2005. He argues that the FT&apos;s strength is its ability to be both global and niche. In other words, it has a global presence and reports on global events, but it does so from the perspective of a niche audience - decision-makers in business and government. &quot;We are very targeted in terms of our audience to ensure that we can offer a very effective sale for advertisers&quot;, he says. &quot;We aim for a C-suite readership.&quot; For those, like me, who have yet to catch up on this piece of American jargon, &quot;C-suite&quot; refers to the high end of business chiefs: chief executives, chief operating officers, chief financial officers, chief technical officers, and so on. Ridding is, of course, a C-suite chap himself these days. Now 41, he has spent virtually all of his working life at the FT. He spent much of his journalistic career abroad, in Paris, Korea and Hong Kong, where he was bureau chief. This was in many ways a return to his roots; when he was seven his father&apos;s business relocated to Malaysia and the family lived in Kuala Lumpur, later moving on to Hong Kong and Singapore. Before his Hong Kong appointment Ridding had already shown his management skills as the FT&apos;s managing editor and deputy editor. If those stints had not sufficiently impressed Pearson, the paper&apos;s owner, then his work in setting up the FT in Asia in 2003 certainly did. When he arrived, in the immediate wake of the Sars epidemic, the future looked bleak. He recalls phoning Pearson&apos;s chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, from the empty lobby of the Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong to say: &quot;It&apos;s pretty tough out here. The economy has ground to a standstill.&quot; She told him she remained committed to the strategy. There was a core belief that the FT&apos;s audience was &quot;going global&quot; and this bit of the jigsaw was essential. Though its circulation, at 40,000, appears small, the FT&apos;s Asian edition has already secured the highest readership among international titles across the continent. Then there is the Chinese-language website, launched in 2004, which now has more than 800,000 registered users. Ridding led the development of the site, working closely with Ien Cheng, who is now overseeing the development of the FT site in London. Pearson had enough confidence in his abilities to appoint him as its chairman in Asia. But Ridding seems genuinely modest about his own achievements as he enthuses about the paper&apos;s change in fortunes. Just a couple of years ago commentators were pointing to the FT&apos;s ominous sales problems, particularly in Britain where circulation had slipped close to 100,000. Now it is touching 130,000. There was also a belief that the US operation was a mistake. &quot;We had to take heat on that,&quot; says Ridding. &quot;There were plenty who thought it was way too bold and risky. It hasn&apos;t always been easy but it has worked out well.&quot; So how has the FT pulled itself round? Throughout our conversation he returns to the same themes: staying close to a targeted audience, listening to their needs, stimulating their needs, and then &quot;selling&quot; that audience to advertisers. He says that &quot;the journalistic team are on fire&quot; - pointing to web innovations such as Alphaville, the blog that targets private equity and hedge fund players, and the &quot;view from the top&quot; video interviews - and emphasises the effectiveness of marketing initiatives, particularly the prioritising of subscriptions. But it is the creation of the global franchise that he sees as the key to understanding the paper&apos;s turnaround. It has been important to revenue too, with 74% of the paper&apos;s advertising carried in at least two editions and 50% carried in all four. The How To Spend It magazine, the FT&apos;s home for luxury goods advertisers, is also in rude health. Originally a Saturday supplement, it is now published occasionally on Fridays. But it would be misleading to see the paper&apos;s success through rose-tinted spectacles, even if it is printed on pink paper. Its rise has not been smooth; when the management announced last July that 51 jobs would have to go to accommodate the integration of print and online operations, the reaction from the journalists was unsurprisingly hostile. In announcing the move, Barber - at Ridding&apos;s request - said that if the cuts could not be achieved voluntarily there would be compulsory redundancies. That went down very badly indeed. Ridding chooses his words carefully to explain why the cuts were necessary. &quot;Our industry is clearly in a state of upheaval, and the ability to adapt is crucial,&quot; he says. &quot;The editorial management team had a clear vision of the integrated operation that we need to drive our digital ambitions and worked long and hard on how best to achieve it. That kind of reorganisation is clearly difficult, and painful. But it was handled sensitively and we were able to manage the restructuring entirely through voluntary means.&quot; And neither has every new editorial initiative been a success: FTpm, an afternoon freesheet launched in 2005, was quietly dropped last September, in favour of email alerts and other online developments. In spite of those difficulties, it is clear from FT staff I have spoken to that Ridding is well-liked. They appreciate that, as a former journalist, he understands their problems. There have been persistent rumours that Pearson would like to offload the FT. Until recently it seemed like a logical move - after all, the title was losing money. Analysts now claim (anonymously) that, despite the return to profitability, it does not fit with the rest of the company&apos;s educational publishing portfolio. Ridding brushes aside the speculation. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be here if I thought we were going to be sold,&quot; he says. He talks of &quot;substantial&quot; investment in digital innovations and refers to this being &quot;the year of ft.com&quot;. Then there are the other plans to &quot;unleash the brand&quot;, such as the FT&apos;s move into staging conferences. All of this will culminate in an ad campaign in April with the slogan, &quot;We live in financial times&quot;. Ridding is clearly comfortable with his transformation from reporter to chief executive. As he says: &quot;I&apos;m loving it.&quot; But he tells an anecdote which says a lot about his continuing love of journalism and about the FT&apos;s growing status in Asia. At a conference in Dubai he met a vice-chairman of China&apos;s National People&apos;s Congress, Cheng Siwei, who said he thought there was a bubble in the Shanghai market. When that remark appeared in the FT&apos;s Chinese edition the market immediately fell by 5%. Ridding says: &quot;On the one hand I thought, &apos;how fantastic, the power of journalism&apos;. On the other, I wondered how that was going to go down with the Chinese authorities. But we heard nothing back.&quot; It also suggests that the FT&apos;s growing presence in China gives a whole new meaning to C-suite.

Against predictions of a 100-point fall, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading just 12 points lower at 12101 by 6.30pm London time, having moved into positive territory early on. Shares in London staged a mini-rally on the back of Wall Street, paring earlier losses for the FTSE 100 index of Britain&apos;s leading companies from as much as 126.6 points mid-morning to 69.6 points, at 6046.6. At its lowest point today, the index moved decisively back below the 6000 point level, at 5989.6. And the market closed down 57.5 points to 6058.7, nearly 1% down on Friday&apos;s close. Traders said Wall Street may have gained strength from comments made by the US treasury secretary Henry Paulson, who started a three-day tour of Asia today. Speaking along with Japan&apos;s finance minister, Koji Omi, Mr Paulson said he was not concerned by the recent fluctuations in regional stock markets. He and the Japanese minister both stressed that the market mechanism is functioning well. Trading remained highly volatile throughout world markets today, however, although early predictions of a 100-point slide that would take the Dow Jones perilously close to the 12000 level proved too pessimistic. The Dow lost 120 points last Friday, closing at 12114.1. By the close on London, there were widespread falls, with mining stocks, oil shares and banks leading the losers. Xstrata slumped 33p to \u00a323.30 and BHP Billiton was down 19.5p to 983.5p. In oil, BP shed 5.5p to 511p while in banks Barclays lost 8p to 710p. Record-breaking results from HSBC saw Britain&apos;s biggest bank buck the trend with a 10p gain to 896p. This second week of turmoil in London follows last week&apos;s fall of 319 points, sparked by a 9% collapse in the Chinese market and compounded by worries over the US economy. Dealers had been bracing themselves for a rough ride today after the wave of selling continued on Wall Street at the end of last week. The London market looked to have steadied at the end of last week after three days of hefty losses, edging 0.2 points higher to 6,116.2 on Friday, although traders described the mood as one of &quot;fragile calm&quot;. Asian markets suffered a torrid session overnight, with the Nikkei tumbling 575.68 points, taking it back below the 17000 level at 16642.2. This represents a fall of 3.3%, its biggest one-day loss in percentage terms for nine months. Other Asian markets suffered losses of between 2% and 4%. Hong Kong was particularly hard hit while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 3.5%. Meanwhile in currency markets, sterling slumped against the yen, which also hit three-month highs against the dollar and the euro as investors rushed to close out risky trades and pay off the cheap yen loans that financed them. Jeremy Batstone at Charles Stanley said the same factors were in play as last week, with the Chinese-inspired contagion helping equities to pull-back from &quot;aggressively over-bought&quot; conditions. Mr Batstone said the carry trade - where investors borrow low-yielding currencies such as the yen or Swiss franc to fund purchases of higher return assets in other currencies - looks under threat as the yen recovers its poise on the foreign exchanges. He said it may be too soon to call the end of the yen carry trade, which is estimated to be worth as much as $1 trillion, &quot;but the possibility that a major source of global market liquidity might dry up should be sufficient to cause investors to seek less-risky bolt-holes in anticipation of further equity and bond market volatility&quot;. The pound had been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the carry trade but unwinding of short-yen positions has seen sterling shed around 8% from a 14-year high struck in January. Sterling also fell 1% against the dollar today to $1.9232. &quot;This move is generating a significant amount of momentum with a lot of things coming together - the Asian stock market sell-off has increased global risk aversion which is playing into the hands of safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and yen,&quot; Bank of America currency strategist Kamal Sharma said. &quot;Fundamentals do not seem to be playing a significant role ... this is all about risk perception and how other financial markets are performing,&quot; he added. Meanwhile oil, which had been relatively immune to last week&apos;s stock market falls, also weakened amid the market turmoil today. World crude oil futures fell by more than $1 a barrel, as oil traders fear a slowdown in the world economy will hit demand. Oil had delivered a seven-session rally, that ended only on Friday, built on falling gasoline stocks in top consumer the United States and Iran&apos;s standoff with the United Nations security council over its nuclear programme. A couple of weeks ago oil had been trading at close to $50 a barrel, 20% below current levels. But analysts say that continued nerves over the strength of the American economy - which consumes about a quarter of world energy - would likely undermine oil prices further.", "tags": ["FTSE", "Business", "Investments", "Michael Page International", "Misys", "Mitchells & Butlers", "Mitie", "Mondi", "Murray Income Trust", "Murray International Trust", "New Star Asset Management", "QinetiQ", "QXL Ricardo", "Reckitt Benckiser", "Reed Elsevier", "Regus", "Renishaw", "Rentokil Initial", "Restaurant Group", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-05T14:39:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/05/ukeconomy.economicdispatch1", "sentences": ["Given Asia&apos;s export-dominated growth is heavily weighted towards the US, investors should be prepared for the 9% fall in Shanghai last Tuesday to be the first of many bad days."], "title": "Correction: this could become a crash after all", "article": "With his low opinion poll ratings, George Bush needs a crash on Wall Street like a hole in the head. The days are ticking away towards the end of his presidency and the Pentagon is warning that unless the &quot;surge&quot; in Iraq works the United States could be heading for another Vietnam. Little wonder, then, that Washington did its best to rubbish any suggestion that last week&apos;s turbulence on the financial markets amounted to anything more than a little temporary difficulty. In this, the Bush administration was ably supported by the great and good of New York - or at least that part of the financial elite that wasn&apos;t banged up for alleged insider trading last week by the securities and exchange commission. As ever, the same reassuring story was spun. Like a hypnotist faced with a sceptical member of the audience, the words were repeated over and over again. Listen, this is a correction not a crash. Relax, the fundamentals of the global economy are strong. Are you listening to me? There will be no recession in the US. Did you hear what I said? There will be no recession in the US. By the end of the week, the trick seemed to have paid off. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, had downplayed the risks of recession brought to the public&apos;s attention by his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. And the markets were gagging for reassurance. After all, if you&apos;ve spent the past couple of years persuading yourself and clients that investing in the current climate is risk-free, the last thing you want to hear is that the glittering edifice of the global economy is a Potemkin village - the fake Crimean settlements set up to impress Catherine II. The dozen charged by the SEC are not the only ones guilty of rigging markets; they were just a bit more self-serving about it, that&apos;s all. Naturally, the consensus may be right. The consensus tends to be right more often than it is wrong, which is why real crashes of the sort seen in October 1929 and October 1987 tend to be a rarity. Indeed, the big sell-off of 20 years ago did prove to be far less of a threat than was initially feared. Even so, there are reasons for concern. One is that the soothing words were at odds with what happened in the markets. Wall Street suffered its biggest weekly fall in four years with the Dow Jones industrial average down 4.2%. Banks raised the cost of the dodgy loans in the sub-prime market, and the contagion affected other markets. The cost of insurance against credit defaults rose sharply and there was a flight to quality assets. This may prove temporary; if the self-hypnotism works the financial markets may soon again be seeking out all sorts of rococo investments, amplified by derivatives, in the belief that they are risk-free. This, in some ways, would be more worrying than a flight to quality or rising spreads on junk bonds, because the riskiest of all markets is the one where the players can see no risk. A second concern is that the US may be in a lot worse shape than Wall Street - cocooned by its sky-high salaries and lucrative bonuses - realises. One view of the US economy since the early 1990s is a glorious renaissance built on the coming industries of the hi-tech revolution; another is that an unsustainable stock market was followed by a bust, and that in turn was followed by an unsustainable boom in the housing market that has also now gone bust. Sure, the Fed could respond to the threat of recession by cutting interest rates, but the traction gained by cheap money is going to be a lot less this time. Why? For one thing, the two debt-driven bubbles have left consumers enormously over-extended. For another, inflation in the asset markets has spilled over into general inflation. Cutting the cost of borrowing might have more of an impact on prices than it would on activity. As Stephen Lewis of Insinger de Beaufort puts it, the real surprise, given what has been happening in the US housing market, is that consumer spending has held up so well. But there is a sense that the consumer is starting to run out of road, with spending propped up by the one-off impact of lower energy prices. Charles Dumas at Lombard Street Research agrees, and says the increase in borrowing on credit cards rather than the rising value of real estate, is a sign that US consumers are drinking in the last-chance saloon. The vast majority of Americans don&apos;t have a yacht and a summer home in the Hamptons; they don&apos;t have stock options and they have not seen their salaries rise at 10, 50 or 100 times the current inflation rate. Given Asia&apos;s export-dominated growth is heavily weighted towards the US, investors should be prepared for the 9% fall in Shanghai last Tuesday to be the first of many bad days. &quot;Household borrowing is the centre of the storm,&quot; says Dumas. &quot;When economies fluctuate, services fluctuate gently, construction and manufacturing more violently. Construction we know about: the housing slump is now beginning to be reinforced by a business construction collapse. The US manufacturing sector is now called China, or Pacific-developing Asia more generally. The current US downswing must take the gloss off growth in that region, where asset markets are priced for perfection.&quot; A different perspective comes from Stephen King at HSBC. His view is that the global economy is now more than the United States and its satellites. Even if America does slide into recession, there is no reason to assume the rest of the world will follow. This requires a radical re-think, since we have become accustomed, particularly since the collapse of the Soviet Union to assume the world is unipolar with the US the hegemonic power. King says the weaker domestic demand growth in the US last year did not seem to have knock-on effects elsewhere. Far from catching a cold when the US sneezed, the rest of the world went shopping. &quot;Relative to our own forecasts, the big surprise last year was the strength of domestic demand growth, notably in Canada, Mexico, China, the Middle East, Germany and the UK.&quot; On the face of it, this is a relatively reassuring interpretation of events. If there really has been a de-coupling going on under our noses, it is possible that a US recession could be isolated. Scratch beneath the surface, though, and King&apos;s thesis has some potentially serious long-term geo-political - and hence economic - consequences. What could be happening is that we are seeing the very gradual waning of US economic supremacy, with years of budget and trade deficits and two decades of excessive consumption chipping away at what is still a phenomenally powerful economy. Britain suffered from just this process in the final quarter of the 19th century; other nations were growing in strength and Britain was in the early stages of relative decline. Paul Kennedy argued in the late 1980s that political power derives from economic power. The first doubts crept in for Britain when winning the Boer War in the face of determined resistance and guerrilla attacks proved a lot more difficult than London had blithely imagined. History may show that South Africa between 1899 and 1902 is a better parallel for America under Bush than is Vietnam. larry.elliott@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Business", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-05T15:39:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/05/economicdispatch.economics", "sentences": ["The abrupt turn in the markets last week was triggered by a 9% drop on the Shanghai stock market, its biggest fall in a decade.", "It should have been an insignificant event as Shanghai is a tiny, illiquid market, accounting for a mere 2% of global markets.", "Analysts said the fall in Shanghai had to be put into perspective of a 107% rise in the last 12 months and expressed surprise at its impact on the rest of the world."], "title": "Hong Kong's stock market romance turns sour", "article": "What better place to discuss the vagaries of the stock market than the picturesque Sha Tin race course, with its well-tended turf and track courses and the aptly-named Horse Saddle hills providing a splendid backdrop? As spectators watched and placed large or trifling sums on some of the world&apos;s best thoroughbreds, including Vengeance of Rain, a senior Hong Kong executive reflected on the past week of turmoil on global exchanges. &quot;We like to buy shares but when the nanny starts to give out investment tips, you know things have got a bit irrational,&quot; said Allan Chan, who like many Hong Kong residents likes to dabble in the market.  The last few years have been particularly good for Hong Kong investors with the Hang Seng index soaring to more than 20,000 from just below 15,000 from over a year ago. It has since fallen back with the latest global share slump, closing at 18,664.88 today. &quot;In recent years, many mainland Chinese companies have listed in Hong Kong, which have been heavily oversubscribed,&quot; said Mr Chan. Some analysts had been warning since December that the Hong Kong market was due for an adjustment because it had risen so high so fast, so when shares nosedived last week, it did not come as a total surprise. Signs of Hong Kong&apos;s feverish romance with stocks and shares abound, with an upsurge of small punters enrolling in investment workshops. The South China Morning Post recently reported that enrolment for investment training at the Phillip Institute of Financial Learning is up 20% on 2003 with 15 to 20 workshops available every month. Books on investment have also sold well. Invest to Last: Ten Timeless Principles from Tony Measor \u2013 known as the Warren Buffett of the East \u2013 sold 30,000 copies in Chinese last year and 4,000 copies in English. But the romance with stock markets turned sour last week. Another nail-biting week looks in store, both for the Far East and the rest of the world. The abrupt turn in the markets last week was triggered by a 9% drop on the Shanghai stock market, its biggest fall in a decade. It should have been an insignificant event as Shanghai is a tiny, illiquid market, accounting for a mere 2% of global markets. But the Chinese sneeze was contagious. Wall Street lost more than 500 points, the FTSE fell more than 300 points and Japan&apos;s Nikkei surrendered all the gains it had made since the turn of the year, falling back below 17,000 today. Analysts said the fall in Shanghai had to be put into perspective of a 107% rise in the last 12 months and expressed surprise at its impact on the rest of the world. &quot;It is such a small market and reflects a lack of understanding of China,&quot; said Qu Hongbin, HSBC&apos;s chief economist for China. &quot;Some economists fly to Beijing and sit in five-star hotels but think they have an understanding of the market.&quot; Mr Qu did, however, expressed concern at the amount of money Chinese banks were lending - a reference to the enormous amount of bad loans in the Chinese banking system, and said the government should impose stronger standards. With the US about to put renewed pressure on China to revalue its currency, Mr Qu said China should be given time and that the US should not resort to protectionist measures. &quot;I expect China to revalue by 3-5% but don&apos;t expect 50%,&quot; he said. Today China&apos;s securities regulator attempted to distance the country from the global market rout, saying the market is too small and has too little foreign participation to be blamed for the collapse. &quot;China&apos;s stock market right now is relatively small and not very globalised. So it&apos;s not possible for it to have such an impact,&quot; said Shang Fulin, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Mr Shang said each market behaved according to its own characteristics: &quot;Markets in different countries are mainly influenced by their own domestic conditions and will influence each other according to the globalisation of their market,&quot; he said. One piece of economic data investors will be watching closely this week will be the non-farm payroll figures in the US amid concern about the health of the American economy. The Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke last week sought to soothe nerves by saying that the economy was poised to strengthen, but some analysts such as his predecessor Alan Greenspan seem to be less sanguine. One warning sign is the rising number of defaults in the market for subprime mortgage loans, those made to less creditworthy customers. Another source of concern for the stability of markets is the so-called carry trade. Ultra-low interest rates in Japan have encouraged many investors to borrow heavily in yen and invest in high-yielding currencies elsewhere. That has left borrowers vulnerable to interest rate rises in Japan or cuts in other countries. One big worry is that all investors try to unwind their carry trades at the same time, resulting in extreme currency fluctuations and creating further turmoil in the markets. Some analysts predict further market losses ahead.  &quot;This week&apos;s falls are the prelude to a correction that, to judge from history, could last four to six weeks and take the market down 10-20% in total. But robust Asian economic and earnings growth make it unlikely to turn into a bear market,&quot; Garry Evans, HSBC Asia-Pacific equity strategist told Reuters at the weekend. For many latecomers to the market, a 10-20% hit will be a nasty reminder that markets can fall as well as rise \u2013 and in less time than it takes for a racehorse to pass the finishing post.", "tags": ["Business", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-05T15:49:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/05/marketforces.uknews", "sentences": [" British Airways led the market fallers today, as the rout which began last Tuesday with a 9% fall in the Shanghai market showed little sign of ending.", "The Nikkei was 3.3% lower, the biggest one day percentage fall on the Japanese market for nine months, while Shanghai lost another 3.5%."], "title": "BA slides as market slump continues", "article": " British Airways led the market fallers today, as the rout which began last Tuesday with a 9% fall in the Shanghai market showed little sign of ending.   A better than expected opening on Wall Street - despite weak US service sector figures - helped pull leading shares back from their troughs, but by the close the FTSE 100 index had still fallen 57.5 points to 6058.7. Earlier it had slumped well below the key 6000 level, nursing a near 130-point drop to 5989.6 at its worst.   Even so the leading index has fallen nearly 300 points in the last week, and is now at its lowest level since December 4 last year.   Traders were in gloomy mood from the start, with Wall Street&apos;s 120-point fall on Friday followed by further falls in Asia overnight. The Nikkei was 3.3% lower, the biggest one day percentage fall on the Japanese market for nine months, while Shanghai lost another 3.5%.   Stock market historian David Schwartz said the losses were likely to continue. &quot;After reaching a bull market peak on February 19 the FTSE All Share index fell 5% in the next nine trading days,&quot; he said. &quot;In the last quarter century there were 64 short-term declines of at least 5%. The average length of these declines was 32 days.&quot;   The yen continued to rise, causing more concern about the effects of so-called carry trades, when investors borrow the Japanese currency at low interest rates to take advantage of higher rates elsewhere. &quot;A big unwinding of the yen carry trade could lead to further falls in the prices of risky assets, including equities,&quot; said Tony Dolphin, director of economics and strategy at Henderson Global Investors.   On top of everything, there are some key events due this week, not least the interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and European Central Bank on Thursday and US non-farm payrolls the day after, which could give a further clue about the strength of the US economy.   &quot;Given signs that interest rate sensitive parts of the economy such as the housing market and retail sales are slowing, as well as recent financial turbulence, we don&apos;t think the Bank of England will surprise us with a rate hike this week,&quot; said Credit Suisse analysts. They added that the ECB was set to raise European rates by 0.25% to 3.75%, however, and was unlikely to be put off by market volatility.   Traders also pointed out that a host of major companies will be quoted ex-dividend on Wednesday, including Barclays, BAT, Aviva, Lloyds and Rolls-Royce. This could knock 30 points or more off the index when it opens on Wednesday even before anything else happens.   Not everyone was quite so bearish. Lehman Brothers said, &quot;Though there are similarities between the current sell-off and that in May/June last year, we think the positioning this time is not as skewed as in the run up to the sell-off last year, and therefore the adjustment process could be quicker.   &quot;We think further downside should be limited as investors take advantage of the fundamental value on offer. We remain bullish on European equities.&quot;   Leading the fallers today was BA, down 35p to 496.5p after the US and European governments agreed the outline of an agreement which could weaken the airline&apos;s position on the lucrative transatlantic routes. Deutsche Bank analysts reckon the deal could lead to a 15% cut in fares, which would knock more than \u00a3490m off the airline&apos;s revenues in the first year.   There is also the prospect of a strike over the Easter holidays by pilots at its GB Airlines business.   Collins Stewart said, &quot;In a nervous market that is looking to de-risk exposures and take profits where they have been made, a major short term uncertainty has suddenly appeared which could outweigh the positive momentum that we were expecting from Wednesday&apos;s investor day.&quot;   Miners were also in decline as metals fell back. &quot;Gold fell substantially over the weekend and is probably being sold by Japanese speculators looking to take profits and to finance margins and losses elsewhere,&quot; said John Meyer at Numis.   Lonmin lost 96p to \u00a329.66, Kazakhmys fell 25p to \u00a310.61p, Xstrata was 33p lower at \u00a323.30 ahead of results tomorrow and Vedanta Resources edged down 37p to \u00a311.78.   There were some bright spots. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance was 5.75p better at 154p after it finally completed the sale of its US operations to the management team.   HSBC added 10p to 896p on its results, which were in line with forecasts but revealed that bad debts were less severe than some had feared.   Scottish &amp; Southern Energy was 1p better at \u00a314.66 on continuing hopes of a bid from Germany&apos;s Eon, which may now lose out in its attempt to buy Spain&apos;s Endesa.   Estate agency group Countrywide climbed 20p to 600p after it agreed a \u00a31bn takeover from American group Apollo. The talk is that investment group 3i, which failed in an earlier attempt to back a management buyout, may return to the fray.   And spread betting group IG rose 5p to 265p after a buy note from Merrill Lynch, upgraded from neutral.   Merrill also helped services company Serco climb 6.5p to 425p as it recommended a &quot;buy&quot; and said it was one of the most defensive stocks in the sector, with most of its revenues deriving from government outsourcing contracts.   Lower down the market, social housing specialist Mears fell 5p to 346.5p as it placed 7.5m shares at 334p to help fund the \u00a322.2m purchase of Careforce, which provides care at home for the elderly and disabled. Careforce takes the company into the domestic care provision market for the first time, an area where the company sees huge growth potential. Demand from investors for the placing was said to be strong. Mears also announced full year profits up 21% to \u00a312.5m, and traders believe the company will dispose of its vehicle collection business before the end of this year.   Retailer Game Group lost 6p to 130.75p, despite a fairly positive note from Shore Capital which has a 150p target on the shares. Shore said it is just three weeks until the launch of the Sony PS3, which should help the company given that there are expected - for once - to be sufficient stocks of the console to meet initial demand. &quot;We see potential for Game to delived a near-mythical first half profit, providing further momentum and more positive news flow for the autumn period,&quot; said Shore analysts John Stevenson.   Mobile communications business 2 Ergo was steady at 310.5p ahead of tomorrow&apos;s demerger of its Broca security division. All 2Ergo shareholders will receive one Broca share, expected to be worth some 52p and valuing Broca at \u00a319.5m.   Finally, technology group Filtronic lost 7.75p to 134p as it delayed a planned \u00a310m cash return to shareholders, partly due to a fall in the shares of US group Powerwave, where it holds \u00a327m worth of stock.

The Tussauds Group was bought for more than \u00a31bn by Merlin Entertainment, the owner of Legoland, Sea Life and the London Dungeon. The merger of Merlin and the Tussauds Group, creates a business with 50 locations attracting 30 million visitors a year, making it the nearest rival in the world to Walt Disney. Tussauds also owns the London Eye, as well as the theme parks Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures. The combined business overtakes Universal Studios, which draws 24 million people a year to its movie-themed resorts. The 11 Disney parks remain the clear leader, pulling in 100 million visitors a year. &quot;We still have a little way to go yet,&quot; said Nick Varney, Merlin chief executive. Merlin aims to open five new attractions a year, and is moving in on Disney&apos;s backyard in the US. On one side is a huge American corporation, with Hollywood film studios, massive financial firepower, a television network and one of the richest libraries of characters in popular culture. On the other, waxworks and brightly coloured plastic bricks. There is already a Legoland in California, north of San Diego, with a second soon to open in Missouri. There are five Madame Tussauds overseas, in New York, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Amsterdam and Hong Kong, with new locations planned for Washington DC and Hollywood. Although Tussauds and Legoland are the flagship brands, the company sees potential in Sea Life (22 locations attract 4 million visitors) and in the London Dungeon (there are sister attractions in Edinburgh, York, Hamburg and Amsterdam). It hopes to build more hotels linked to its sites, taking a leaf from Disney&apos;s book. &quot;I don&apos;t see us as being in competition with Disney,&quot; Mr Varney said. &quot;We are not about $2bn theme parks on the scale of Disney in Orlando. We are pursuing a very different model with very different brands. Ultimately though, Legoland and Madame Tussauds can stand shoulder-to-shoulder alongside Disney and Universal.&quot; Peter Phillipson, Tussauds&apos; chief executive and chairman-to-be of the enlarged group, calls his waxworks &quot;portraits&quot;. The company has tried to capture the interest in celebrity culture with models of Kylie Minogue and David Beckham. &quot;Consumers love celebrity and famous people,&quot; he said. In 2002, Tussauds decided not to feature a dummy of Iain Duncan Smith, the first time the leader of the opposition had not been represented in Tussauds&apos; history. Customer research found that few had heard of him and even fewer wanted to see a wax likeness. Repeat visits The company has also introduced more temporary exhibits themed around events like the World Cup to encourage repeat visits and has introduced more interactive elements. The consolidation of the leisure industry across Europe has been driven by private equity firms, trading companies like playing cards in a high stakes game. They are looking to build bigger businesses that can be sold on or floated at a profit.

It is selling the business for \u00a31bn and a 20% stake in the combined company, making itself a tidy profit. The American private equity firm Blackstone, which bought Merlin two years ago from another private equity owner, will retain control of the group. It expects to float the business on the stock exchange in three to four years time, Mr Varney said. Tussauds goes back to 1770, when Philippe Curtis opened a waxwork museum in Paris. After he died, Marie Tussaud, His housekeeper&apos;s daughter, inherited the collection and brought it to Britain in 1802. The museum has been in its current building in London since 1884. Lego opened its first park in 1968 in Denmark and its second in Windsor in 1996. The Danish toymaker sold its theme park business to Blackstone in 2005 and it was injected into Merlin, which is run from offices in Poole, Dorset. John Lord, an expert in the leisure industry at the University of Wales, saw a number of factors behind the growth in leisure attractions. &quot;We perhaps go out more as a family than we did in the past and we are more mobile. That means resorts can be developed on out-of-town sites without needing to worry about being close to town or to bus stops and train stations. Increased leisure time and wealth are also playing their part. These attractions are getting ever more expensive ... but that doesn&apos;t seem to put people off.&quot; Fun factories Tussauds group: 14m visitors a year \u00b7 London Eye: adult \u00a314.50/ child \u00a37.25 \u00b7 Madam Tussauds: \u00a323/\u00a319 \u00b7 Chessington World of Adventures: \u00a329/\u00a315 \u00b7 Alton Towers: \u00a332/\u00a322 \u00b7 Thorpe Park: \u00a322/\u00a315 \u00b7 Warwick Castle: \u00a315.95/\u00a39.95 \u00b7 Heide Park (Germany): \u00a318.40/\u00a315.70 Merlin: 16m visitors a year \u00b7 Legoland: \u00a331/\u00a324 \u00b7 Legoland Discovery Centre (opening Easter) \u00b7 Sea Life: \u00a312.75/\u00a39.75 \u00b7 London Dungeon: \u00a320/\u00a316 \u00b7 Gardaland (Italy&apos;s leading theme park): \u00a318.40/\u00a315.70 Walt Disney: 100m visitors a year \u00b7 Disneyland, California: adult 10+ \u00a332.75/age 3-9 \u00a327.55 \u00b7 Walt Disney World, Florida: \u00a334.85/\u00a329.10 \u00b7 Disneyland Paris: adult 11+ \u00a331/ age 3-10 \u00a325 \u00b7 Tokyo Disney \u00b7 Hong Kong Disneyland", "tags": ["Business", "Travel", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-06T00:14:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/06/chinathemedia.china", "sentences": ["Last year, Shanghai opened the country&apos;s first shelter for addicts."], "title": "China bans opening of new internet cafes", "article": "China will ban the opening of new internet cafes from this July in a government campaign to clamp down on online addiction and juvenile crime. The state media said today that the freeze is designed to protect young people from the harmful influence of the web, but freedom-of-expression organisations say it is a fresh attempt by the Communist government to control the spread of politically sensitive information. China has one of the world&apos;s fastest growing and most tightly censored internet markets. Last year, the number of users increased by 23% to 137 million people. In two years, it is expected to overtake the US as the biggest online population on the planet. But the authorities are increasingly concerned about the negative effects of the web, which has been blamed for school delinquency, teenage crime and youth suicide. A recent survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that teenagers are getting addicted to the internet at a younger age than in any other country. About 13% of users under the age of 18 played or chatted online for more than 38 hours a week - the definition of addiction. Last year, Shanghai opened the country&apos;s first shelter for addicts. Many play online games at the country&apos;s 113,000 cybercafes, which are often portrayed in the media as a breeding ground for crime. The issue has been raised at this year&apos;s National People&apos;s Congress - the Chinese parliament. &quot;It is common to see students from primary and middle schools lingering in internet bars overnight, puffing on cigarettes and engrossed in online games,&quot; NPC deputy Yu Wen was quoted as saying. In January, President Hu Jintao ordered Chinese internet regulators to promote a &quot;healthy online culture&quot; to protect social stability. Under regulations announced by the Xinhua news agency today, local governments will not be allowed to issue new internet cafe licenses this year. Businesses that have already received planning approval must be completed by June 30. International free speech campaigners said the freeze was not just aimed at curbing addiction to online games, but restricting access to information about Tibet, Taiwan, Falun Gong and websites that expose China&apos;s human rights abuses. &quot;There is something more behind this,&quot; said Julien Pain of Reporters Without Borders. &quot;When the authorities try to justify their internet policy, they always use the excuse of protecting children. But in China, this is not the whole story. They also block news websites.&quot; He said the freeze appeared to be a new stage in a prolonged crackdown against small, independent new cybercafes, which are harder to control than large chains. &quot;At the big chains, the government can insist that IDs be shown for all users, certain words be blocked and monitoring software be installed. But when you are looking at thousands of small cybercafes, it become much more difficult.&quot; Since 2002, the government has tightened regulations and closed down thousands of small internet cafes.", "tags": ["Media", "China", "Digital media", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-06T11:13:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/06/marketforces.britishairwaysbusiness", "sentences": ["British Airways led the market fallers yesterday, as the rout which began a week ago with a 9% fall in the Shanghai market showed little sign of ending."], "title": "Market forces: BA falls amid continued turbulence", "article": "British Airways led the market fallers yesterday, as the rout which began a week ago with a 9% fall in the Shanghai market showed little sign of ending. A better than expected opening on Wall Street - despite weak US service-sector figures - helped pull leading shares back from their troughs but by the close the FTSE 100 index had still fallen 57.5 points to 6058.7. Earlier it had slumped well below 6000, seeing a near 130-point drop to 5989.6 at its worst. The leading index has fallen 376 points since last Tuesday, and is now at its lowest level since December 4. On top of everything, there are some important events due this week, not least the interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and European Central Bank on Thursday and US non-farm payrolls the day after, which should give a clue about the strength of the US economy. Credit Suisse analysts said: &quot;Given signs that interest rate-sensitive parts of the economy such as the housing market and retail sales are slowing, as well as recent financial turbulence, we don&apos;t think the Bank of England will surprise us with a rate hike this week.&quot; They added that the ECB was likely to raise European rates by 0.25% to 3.75% and was unlikely to be put off by market volatility. Traders also pointed out that a host of big companies would be quoted ex-dividend tomorrow, including Barclays, BAT, Aviva, Lloyds and Rolls-Royce. This could knock 30 points or more off the index when it opens tomorrow, even before anything else happens. Not everyone was quite so bearish. Lehman Brothers said: &quot;Though there are similarities between the current sell-off and that in May/June last year, we think the positioning this time is not as skewed as in the run-up to the sell-off last year, and therefore the adjustment process could be quicker. &quot;We think further downside should be limited as investors take advantage of the fundamental value on offer. We remain bullish on European equities.&quot; Leading the fallers yesterday was BA, down 35p to 496.5p after the US and European governments agreed the outline of an agreement that could weaken the airline&apos;s position on the lucrative transatlantic routes. Deutsche Bank reckons the deal could lead to a 15% cut in fares, which would knock more than \u00a3490m off the airline&apos;s revenues in the first year. There is also the prospect of a strike over the Easter holidays by pilots at its GB Airlines business. Collins Stewart said: &quot;In a nervous market that is looking to de-risk exposures and take profits where they have been made, a major short-term uncertainty has suddenly appeared which could outweigh the positive momentum that we were expecting from [tomorrow&apos;s] investor day.&quot; Miners were also in decline as metals fell back. &quot;Gold fell substantially over the weekend and is probably being sold by Japanese speculators looking to take profits and to finance margins and losses elsewhere,&quot; said John Meyer at Numis. Lonmin fell 96p to \u00a329.66, Kazakhmys fell 25p to \u00a310.61p, Xstrata was 33p lower at \u00a323.30 ahead of results today and Vedanta Resources edged down 37p to \u00a311.78. The bright spots included Royal &amp; SunAlliance, which was up 5.75p at 154p after it finally completed the sale of its US operations to their management. HSBC was lifted 10p to 896p on its results, which were in line with forecasts but revealed that bad debts were less severe than some had feared. Scottish &amp; Southern Energy was 1p better at \u00a314.66 on continuing hopes of a bid from Germany&apos;s E.ON, which may now lose out in its attempt to buy Spain&apos;s Endesa. The estate agency Countrywide rose 20p to 600p after it agreed a \u00a31bn takeover by US group Apollo. The talk is that investment group 3i, which had failed in its attempt to back a management buyout, may return to the fray. The spread-betting firm IG rose 5p to 265p as Merrill Lynch upgraded to buy. Merrill also helped the services firm Serco climb 6.5p to 425p as it recommended a buy and said it was one of the most defensive stocks in the sector, with most of its revenues deriving from government outsourcing contracts. Social housing specialist Mears fell 5p to 346.5p as it placed 7.5m shares at 334p to fund the \u00a322.2m purchase of Careforce, which provides care for the aged and disabled at home. The acquisition of Careforce, up 37p to 148.5p, takes Mears into the domestic care market for the first time, where the company sees huge potential. Investor demand was said to be strong. Mears announced full-year profits up 28% to \u00a312.5m. The retailer Game Group lost 6p to 130.75p, despite a fairly positive note from Shore Capital, which has a 150p target, helped by the launch of the Sony PS3. &quot;We see potential for Game to deliver a near-mythical first-half profit,&quot; said Shore analysts John Stevenson. The mobile communications firm 2 Ergo was steady at 310.5p ahead of today&apos;s demerger of its Broca security division. All 2Ergo shareholders will receive one Broca share, set to be worth some 52p and valuing Broca at \u00a319.5m. Filtronic keeps cash Investors in telecoms technology company Filtronic must feel like bit players in Waiting for Godot. The company sold its wireless infrastructure business to America&apos;s Powerwave late last year, and promised to return a chunk of cash to shareholders. Since then Powerwave shares dropped sharply, and in January Filtronic said it would return a smaller amount than expected - \u00a310m or 13p a share - by the end of March, with more in October. The City had been hoping for closer to 100p a share. Yesterday, however, Filtronic said the Powerwave shares had fallen still further and it did not believe it prudent to pay the \u00a310m now. It plans to reorganise shareholder funds to allow the cash return, but this is unlikely to happen until October. The shares fell 7.75p to 134p. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Business", "British Airways"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-06T23:53:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/07/communities.travel", "sentences": ["Places like Vancouver, Shanghai, Hong Kong and New York realised 50 years ago that something needed to be done."], "title": "\u00a35.5bn plan to transform Liverpool's skyline", "article": "Liverpool&apos;s derelict and unloved waterfront could be transformed from a no-go area to a world class development of skyscrapers that will rival the skylines of New York and Hong Kong, it emerged yesterday. The \u00a35.5bn vision for the city includes 50 high rise buildings, some more than 50 storeys. One of the skyscrapers would have a huge metal spiral running through it to harness wind from the River Mersey. Liverpool Waters represents the largest investment in the north-west for more than 100 years and would create homes for up to 50,000 residents, as well as hotels, bars, restaurants and a marina. A monorail would link the city centre with its airport. The city has a history of not delivering on landmark waterfront buildings, such as Will Alsop&apos;s Cloud, but developer Peel Holdings&apos; vision is more spectacular than any other plans mooted. Two of the largest towers would be constructed next to the neglected six-faced Jesse Hartley clock at the gateway to the city, which would be restored to its Victorian glory. Lindsey Ashworth, the director of Peel Holdings, said the development would not be a pastiche of the Albert Dock development, which was conceived in the early 1980s as a driver for regeneration in Liverpool. The emphasis now was on clusters of tall buildings. &quot;This is our front door to the world,&quot; he said. &quot;At the moment, it is an absolute disgrace. Places like Vancouver, Shanghai, Hong Kong and New York realised 50 years ago that something needed to be done. This is part of a world heritage site, but it is in total dereliction.&quot; At a presentation at Liverpool town hall, Mr Ashworth said that if the proposals did not receive public support the company would bow out. &quot;Liverpool Waters is a visionary scheme that will transform the city waterfront and put the city in the same league as other magnificent waterside cities that are famed worldwide.&quot; Peel&apos;s previous developments include Liverpool John Lennon airport and the Trafford Centre in Manchester, which was constructed after a lengthy planning battle. The company purchased the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company for more than \u00a3700m two years ago and became the owner of 150 acres of derelict dockland. An outline planning application will be submitted by the company within 12 months.

PWC says the income generated by London&apos;s 8.5 million people is equivalent to the gross domestic product of small European countries such as Sweden or Switzerland. And with growth expected to average 3% a year between 2005 and 2020 - faster than any other city in the developed world - London is expected to edge its way up the league table of richest cities from its current ranking of sixth. In the 19th century, London&apos;s position as the capital of the world&apos;s biggest economy made it the richest and largest city in the world. But in 2005 Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Paris all had larger GDPs. By 2020 London will have overtaken Chicago and Paris, PwC says. John Hawksworth, head of macroeconomics at PwC said: &quot;Within the developed world, it seems likely that the most successful cities of the future will be those that have comparative advantages in intangible businesses, financial and consumer services that are not so easily emulated by the rising stars of China, India or Brazil.&quot; The report predicts that by 2020 there will be five megacities with populations in excess of 20 million: Mumbai, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, New York and Tokyo, which will contain more than 35 million people. The richest city in the world by per capita income adjusted for variations in the cost of living around the world is San Francisco-Oakland at $71,400 (\u00a337,000). The next 10 wealthiest cities by average income are all American, with London the first non-US city on the list in 12th place. London currently has a GDP per capita of $53,200 (\u00a327,600). Although London is expected to grow briskly over the next decade and a half, its rate of expansion is expected to be only half as fast as that in Shanghai (6.5%) or Mumbai (6%). Outside London, PwC says Birmingham, 71st in the PwC list of the world&apos;s 100 biggest cities, is expected to drop to 79th, while Manchester is projected to fall from 73rd to 82nd. PwC says this is not because their economies are stagnating, but that they are not expected to grow as quickly as cities in emerging economies. PwC says the world&apos;s megacities are comparable in size to fully fledged national economies. Tokyo and New York currently both have GDPs in excess of $1.1tn - making them as big as Canada and Spain, the EU&apos;s fifth biggest economy.

Rumbling away behind those topics are the forthcoming vote on Trident, and today&apos;s rise in the minimum wage - albeit only by 17p an hour. As always, expect mentions for Iraq, Afghanistan (another British soldier killed yesterday) and NHS closures. Council tax reform might also get a look-in. Following the suggestion at the weekend that Sir Menzies Campbell would favour forming a coalition government with Labour&apos;s expectant leader-in-waiting, Gordon Brown, over the Tories&apos; David Cameron, expect some barracking for the Liberal Democrat leader - possibly from both sides... Midday Slightly late, the Speaker calls the prime minister. Again, Tony Blair begins by paying his condolences to the four British servicemen who have fallen this week. &quot;They were displaying a heroism... almost unparalleled,&quot; he says. Labour&apos;s Jim McGovern (Dundee West) says that if the SNP wins in Scotland, the cost of living there will rise to the point where a pint of beer costs eight euros, as it does - he says - in some other small European countries. Mr Cameron rises to his feet, and also pays tribute to the dead British soldiers, pointing out that the operations in Afghanistan are Nato-backed.  Is the prime minister happy with the contributions of other Nato members? he says, a question he has asked before. &quot;Yes, of course we want our Nato members to do even more,&quot; replies Mr Blair, saying that he called for it at a recent summit. The Tory leader comes back, wanting other Nato members to &quot;take the caveats off&quot; their commitments to Afghanistan. Mr Blair: &quot;We continue to press them the entire time to do so.&quot;  But in the end, he says, the UK is responsible for discharging its own responsibilities.  Quite specifically, Mr Cameron wants to know who is providing the other battalion requested by Nato?  Will Mr Blair update the house, because apparently last week the defence secretary, Des Browne, did not know, he says. 12.10pm Labour&apos;s Ann Cryer (Keighley and Ilkley) wants the government to commemorate International Women&apos;s Day by supporting a Lords bill legislating against forced marriages. The prime minister points to the forced marriages unit created by the government, and says that he is looking at the private members&apos; bill on the issue. Sir Menzies&apos;s turn - and he gets cheered to the rafters. &quot;Where&apos;s Gordon?&quot; someone shouts, a reference to the possibility of a Lib-Lab coalition after the next election. The Lib Dem leader&apos;s question is whether the position of the attorney general is tenable in the wake of his role in decisions concerning Iraq, BAE and cash-for-honours, which has led to questions about his independence. The Speaker has to warn MPs not to heckle Sir Ming. Mr Blair answers simply that he disagrees with the Lib Dem leader. Labour&apos;s Mike Gapes (Ilford South) celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome by asking members to read a blog called &quot;Chameleons on Bicycles&quot;. Mr Blair points out that the council of Europe will be discussing climate change tomorrow. 12.15pm Mr Cameron returns - and he watched last night&apos;s BBC documentary on Mr Blair&apos;s legacy. He quotes a Downing Street adviser saying, &quot;Tony couldn&apos;t govern with Gordon and he couldn&apos;t govern with him either&quot;.  Why would anyone say that? asks the Tory leader cheekily. The prime minister pays tribute to the chancellor&apos;s economic record.  Mr Cameron points out that Mr Blair is better at paying tribute to the chancellor than Mr Brown is at repaying the compliment. &quot;Will there be a return to cabinet government under Mr Brown?&quot; he wonders. Mr Blair hits back by attempting to unravel the current Tory party policy on married couples&apos; tax allowance - quoting Francis Maude, the party chairman, and George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, who are apparently at odds with each other. Mr Cameron declares that the Tories are ahead in the polls on the economy - and asks Labour frontbenchers to put their hands up if they think there will be collegiate discussions under Gordon Brown. Only John Prescott puts his hand up.  &quot;That&apos;s the problem: they all think it will be dreadful but nobody has the guts to do anything about it,&quot; Mr Cameron concludes. Mr Blair tells him not to trust the polls - and claims that Mr Cameron&apos;s new alliance with a rightwing Czech party who think climate change is a dangerous myth &quot;puts him in the kindergarten&quot; of politics. Answering another question, the prime minister claims that he watched Liverpool&apos;s football match against Barcelona last night, and congratulates Liverpool and Chelsea on their success so far on the Champions League - and, after prompting from John Reid, the home secretary, he also wishes Celtic good luck for tonight. 12.20pm The Tory Stephen Hammond (Wimbledon) raises the plight of a constituent with a son with special needs who cannot afford to send him to a specialist school out of the constituency. The prime minister says that it must be a decision for the local authority - which, by the way, has received extra funding under his government. Labour&apos;s Ben Chapman (Wirral South) worries about the collapse in Shanghai share prices last week. Is the UK well-equipped to deal with the rise of the east? For a country like Britain in the 21st century, that will be through alliances as well as on our own, Mr Blair says. Tory Richard Ottaway (Croydon South) thinks new telecommunications allowances for MPs &quot;border on corruption&quot;. Labour&apos;s Rosemary McKenna (Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East) praises ITV for pulling their shows in the wake of the recent alleged scams over phone call quizzes. Mr Blair welcomes the &quot;temporary suspension&quot; of such interactive shows. Tory Rob Wilson (Reading East) asks, in reference to the Brighton situation this week, if Mr Blair would have accepted his children&apos;s school places being selected by a lottery system.  The prime minister says that on this occasion he agrees with the shadow education secretary that there should be more good schools - and, he says, the government is providing them. David Clelland (Lab, Tyne Bridge) asks which country with an elected second chamber &quot;is governed better than the United Kingdom&quot;. Mr Blair turns down the opportunity to answer, but says that tonight&apos;s vote is an attempt to find consensus on the future of the House of Lords. The SNP&apos;s Pete Wishart (Perth and Perthshire North) asks if Lord Levy offered nominations for peerages on the basis of being the prime minister&apos;s Middle East envoy, a friend of Mr Blair&apos;s or as Labour&apos;s chief fundraiser?  The prime minister refuses to comment on the cash-for-honours inquiry, but says that it &quot;says everything&quot; about the SNP that they are &quot;more obsessed&quot; about a London Metropolitan police investigation than Scotland&apos;s economy. 12.30pm Tory Michael Jack (Fylde) lays a litany of agricultural complaints at the government&apos;s door, from late payments onwards, and complains that the last farming debate was in 2002. Mr Blair says that they are trying to speed up the late payments problem. Judy Mallaber (Lab, Amber Valley) celebrates the recent democratic elections in Congo.

Surely it won&apos;t take that long, you say. Be quiet. It will happen like this. One summer&apos;s evening, she will be playing in the street with a bunch of other eight-year-olds and I will go out to call her in for tea. Thanks to the hovercars, free-floating teleportation platforms, jetpack-powered flying ice-cream sellers and other inventions that I confidently predict will be filling our skies come 2014, the noise will be so oppressive that I won&apos;t be able to make myself understood with words alone. So I will be forced to make a simple gesture to tell her it&apos;s time to come inside. What will it be? I will tap my wrist where a watch should be. The time-honoured sign that you should wrap up one activity and prepare for another. One problem: it won&apos;t work. Not in 2014. She won&apos;t know what I&apos;m on about. She will look at me blankly with that soul-destroying gaze that children are hard-wired to give their parents. (Don&apos;t worry, young techno-hipsters - such old fartdom will be your fate too. There will come a time when your grandchildren will recall how you used to sit them on your knee and play them your iPod or explain to them how you used ActiveSync to back up your email address list. Oh, how will they laugh, and how they will trash everything you held dear. iPods - can you imagine anything more tacky? All that shiny plastic - yeuughh! And emails! How sad is that? No videocalls or anything? Pathetic!) For months afterwards, my daughters&apos; playmates will tap their wrists satirically whenever they see her in the playground (if playgrounds exist in 2014), and so I will become a figure of fun. The old fart with his incomprehensible gestures. My daughter&apos;s shame. Why? Because few people will wear watches in the near future. Wrist-borne chronometers are so last millennium. In the US, a survey by investment bank Piper Jaffray &amp; Co found that nearly two-thirds of teens never wear a watch and that only one in 10 wears one every day. A quick glance around my office shows that I am, by virtue of wearing a watch, in the demographic most likely not to have broadband, know who/what Mika is, or bid co-workers farewell by saying: &quot;Laters!&quot; True, wrist-borne chronoporn devices continue to appeal to deeply inadequate men with high disposable incomes. But let&apos;s not allow the dreary fetishes of GQ&apos;s target audience to spoil the story. Today a watch is the opposite of a status symbol. Indeed, the main reason I&apos;m writing this piece is that I was spotted by an editor wearing a loser watch. It is a Lorus Sports, quite possibly purchased more than 10 years ago from Walthamstow market, and on its third rotting leather strap. It smells like feet. And not nice feet. If it was a song, my watch would be that one by Beck (&quot;I&apos;m a loser, baby, so why don&apos;t you kill me?&quot;). Keeps good time, though. Have you ever heard of Lorus? Of course not. If I was a winner, I would drop my watch in a canal and tell the time with my mobile. In fact, if I was a winner, I would do everything on my mobile phone - even film myself dropping the Lorus in the canal and happy-slapping myself along the towpath. Increasingly, all the stuff you need to get through the day is focused in one piece of kit. Thanks to what manufacturers like to call &quot;convergence&quot;, today&apos;s mobiles already allow you to tell the time, arrange your appointments diary, watch films, play games, and take pictures of your blocked sink that you can send as jpegs to your plumber, who will text you back a ludicrous estimate, which you can check by using your phone&apos;s calculator function. You can use the phone to play that &quot;hip&quot; Snow Patrol/Killers/Go! Team track as you straphang on the Victoria line to the mounting fury of fellow passengers. It can only be a matter of time before your mobile will allow you to operate the garage door, unlock the car, swipe your way into the office, bus, tube or nightclub. Already, the better type of phone can teach you to play the guitar, the screen showing finger positions for chords and the speakers telling you what they should sound like. If your phone is Wap-enabled, you can play DJ Rob&apos;s pub quiz from Chris Moyles&apos; Radio 1 show. You need never visit a pub again. Or you might want to shoot yourself in the head. Mobiles have become so much the focus of consumer technology that you might as well drop not just your watch, but your iPod, DVD camera, digital camera, calculator, alarm clock, diary, address book and PlayStation in the canal and go out with one sleek piece of kit. Soon you might even be able to burn your books because you&apos;ll have them on your mobile-cum-iTablet. One problem: you&apos;ll get mugged for your high-spec ponce-a-phone as soon as you pull it out of your trousers in public. And then, unless you&apos;ve backed up every bit of data (which, trust me, you won&apos;t have), you&apos;ll be screwed. That&apos;s because the omnicompetent mobile is a terrible thing. As HL Mencken put it: &quot;For every complex problem, there is a simple solution ... and it is wrong.&quot; That&apos;s the trouble with convergence. It can be rubbish. Better to have a shame-mobile like my six-year-old Nokia, even though, quite possibly, it was made in the former Soviet Union from old Sinclair C5s and barely works as a phone. Like my car (keys in the ignition, door open, motor running), I have been leaving my phone in situations where ne&apos;er-do-wells can steal it for years. No one has. Because I&apos;m a loser, baby. Convergence is not always what we want, but it is increasingly what we get. &quot;Take the so-called digital home,&quot; says futurologist Patrick Dixon. &quot;Convergence might mean total control with wireless TV/video/music/web in every room, all from one online PC, also used for children&apos;s games and homework - or a fridge that is also a web browser. But who really wants web access on a fridge door, or a single remote control for every device in the house, or a single device to play the same music in every room?&quot; Technological innovation doesn&apos;t simply supply what we want: it supplies more and more of what we don&apos;t need. As Homer Simpson put it: &quot;If they can put a man on the moon, why don&apos;t my feet smell good?&quot; Technology evolves irrespective of our desires. Its onward march leaves us in the lurch, haunted by memories of things we used to do. For example, when Steve Jobs showed off Apple&apos;s new iPhone earlier this year, he asked rhetorically how the thing would be operated: &quot;Are we going to use a stylus? No, we&apos;re not. We&apos;re going to use the best pointing device in our world: our fingers.&quot; Well, yes, Steve, but no. There&apos;s no need to diss the past. I miss styluses (styli?), especially the one I used to play a very spirited version of the Marvelettes&apos; When You&apos;re Young and in Love on a friend&apos;s Rolf Harris Stylophone. Tread softly, Steve Jobs, for you tread on my techno-memories. Technology&apos;s evolution, as a result, often leaves us queasy. We feel a nostalgia for the near past - for its soothing gestures, for the obsolete body language we mastered so well - but mere discombobulation in face of the near future. The new gestures unleashed by new tech (for example, holding your hands above your head to signify taking pictures with a digital camera) have not been sanctioned by the test of time. Years after the arrival of the hands-free headset, many of us still cross the road to avoid someone who seems to be talking to an imaginary friend, when we should be checking their lugholes for miniature earpieces. &quot;Technology changes what is socially acceptable all the time by pushing boundaries,&quot; says Tom Dunmore of Stuff magazine. &quot;In terms of people talking into their mobiles, that&apos;s become much more acceptable socially.&quot; Maybe in your world, Mr Dunmore. &quot;What amazes me now,&quot; he says, &quot;is how you see teenagers on trains using their mobiles like speakers, holding them up and playing music.&quot; It is a confusing development: the very point, I thought, of personal stereos, MP3 players, Discmans and the rest was that they kept the sound, for the most part, in the user&apos;s head. Technology takes us in socially discomfiting, unpredictable areas: it&apos;s a pain, and not just in terms of GBH of the earhole. For example, keyboards and computer mice (mouses?) will soon no longer be at the cutting edge of technology. Which is a shame for those of us who have only just got used to them. As a result, people will laugh at you if you make those spider moves with your fingers to signify typing, because in the future (according to Jobs), touch-sensitive screens will render keyboards obsolete. And that&apos;s before we even get on to voice recognition. Our typing days may be numbered. Amazing, isn&apos;t it? Amazing, that is, that I&apos;ve got so far through a piece on technology without referring to that scene in Minority Report where Tom Cruise sweeps his hands suggestively across a screen and thus gets the jump on the bad guys. The point, though, is that technological development is shadowed by the ghosts of gestures associated with obsolete gear. You may be old enough to remember that to suggest typing, one would bash away at an imaginary keyboard and - this is the crucial bit - slam the imagined typewriter carriage sharply back to start a new line. Nobody does that any more. I used to do it with the aplomb of newshound Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday for years. But now no one understands me, so I&apos;ve stopped. What speeds up the rise in the semiotic scrapheap is just that drive for convergence, whereby mobile phone companies build more and more features into their kit, like digital Swiss Army knives. That analogy breaks down quite fast: there will be no digital way of shaving, cutting toenails, opening wine or making fire. Or maybe there will be. Perhaps there are no limits to convergence. For instance, both Nokia and BlackBerry are poised to launch handsets with global positioning systems. Were it not for the fact that men find it hard to ask for directions, of course, satnav (&quot;sadnav&quot; to its critics) would have no reason to exist. But it does, and thanks to it, men will never have to ask for directions again. Instead, spoken instructions will guide them from power latte to power latte, from pillar to post, from Pontefract to Penzance. The press release for the BlackBerry 8800 says: &quot;The new smartphone includes a full complement of features to appeal to mobile professionals who want to manage their work and leisure time effectively.&quot; What a dismal world. Personally, I&apos;ve never wanted to manage my leisure time, still less manage it effectively. But then, I am a loser. What, incidentally, is a mobile professional? Another development will be bigger mobile phone screens. Tom Dunmore says that in the near future, watching films on your mobile won&apos;t be quite as barmy an activity as it now seems. &quot;The most significant development in that area is foldable screens, which will allow you to do proper web browsing and watch movies. You&apos;ll be able to get memory cards holding two or three films. They&apos;ll be great for flights where there isn&apos;t much in-flight entertainment.&quot; Convergence is not the only game in town. &quot;Mobile phone companies don&apos;t just launch one phone,&quot; Dunmore says. &quot;They target different people with different ranges. Vodafone has a Simplicity range targeted at older users. Smart multi-function phones are less than 10% of the market. And there will always be gadget nuts who want separate high-end pieces of kit - be they iPods or DV cameras or whatever. But the converged proportion of the market will start to grow as phones become sexier.&quot; Hence, perhaps, the looming sexyphone face-off this spring. Who can resist a sexyphone face-off? It will be between the soon-to-be-launched iPhone, LG&apos;s Shine phone LF KE970 (which has a makeup mirror that becomes a screen when you turn it on - sweet!), Samsung&apos;s Ultra Smart F700, Motorola&apos;s Z8, Nokia N610 Navigator, and the LG Prada. The last one should appeal to me: designed by Prada and built by Korean electronics giant LG, almost the entire front surface is a touchscreen (like the iPhone), and users can drag items around and navigate menus by tapping on the screen. It weighs 85 grams and looks droolworthily sleek. It is elegantly black, with an extra-wide LCD screen, MP3 player and a black leather Prada case. It also is less tacky than the Motorola phone designed by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, which, when opened, shouted &quot;Hello, Dolce &amp; Gabbana!&quot; But would spending \u00a3400 on the LG Prada do the most important thing - impress my daughter? Possibly. After all, she loves nothing more than dunking things in baby food until they become useless. Her critique of the fatuities of technological innovation is more devastating than mine will ever be.  \u00b7 Additional reporting by Laura Goodman. What the do-it-all mobile means for ... Photography What we&apos;ve gained Immediacy - you can see what you&apos;ve snapped immediately and send it out to all your mates pronto. Suddenly, lots of new uses for images become available. For example, one of my colleagues takes photographs of the back of his head with his mobile phone when he is shaving his hair to make sure the cut is even. A mirror is a difficult thing to hold, you see. But if he uses a phone, he can take the picture of the back of his head. Shave a little more off. Take another photo. Shave a little more off. And when you&apos;re happy with the cut, delete all the images (or send them to a mate). I&apos;ve suggested he send these images to a gallery to see if they want to exhibit them under the title My Ever Changing Head. What we&apos;ve lost Remember those happy moments finishing off a roll of film outside the chemist? Asking a passing stranger to snap you having a sunburned post-holiday snog before you went into Boots to drop off the negs? No? Perhaps it was just me. And then the long, tantalising days waiting for the photos to be ready? Only to pick them up and realise that you forgot to take the lens cap off? Twerp. Timekeeping What we&apos;ve gained Our beautiful wrists are now unbesmirched by ugly clobber. And remember, before wristwatches, how your waistcoat pocket was really heavy because it was filled with your fob watch? No? Me neither. The very idea! But if you did have a waistcoat pocket that one day did have a fob watch in it, imagine how much happier you&apos;d be now because it hasn&apos;t - you wouldn&apos;t walk with a lurch towards the left, as your pocket would be empty. All thanks to the advent of mobile phones. What we&apos;ve lost Annoyingly, if you wear a watch, you&apos;re often asked the time by mates who can&apos;t be bothered to get their mobile phones out of their bags and have a look at the digital chronometers themselves. Damn them! The only thing to do is to lose your watch and rely on your phone to tell you the time. Remember watching the second hand of your watch go round in circles for hour after hour? You can&apos;t do that any more when you rely on a mobile to tell you the time - which is just as well, because it made you economically unproductive. Listening to music What we&apos;ve gained Remember when you used to want to listen to a whole Wagner opera while on a train journey, you would have to take a box of CDs and feed them in succession into your Discman? And that it was such a palaver that by the end you didn&apos;t care whether Valhalla burned or not? No? Perhaps it was just me. The great thing about having an MP3 player built into your mobile is that you don&apos;t have to be burdened with gear. Not even an iPod Nano, which, as you know, weighs only as much as a bee&apos;s wing. What&apos;s more, your mobile has a speaker so you can annoy fellow travellers with your eclectic tastes. Result! Before Walkmen, you may not know, it was even worse: you would have to hire a man to carry your record player all around town. He would walk behind you, playing your LPs. Naturally, he had to walk very slowly so the needle didn&apos;t bounce. It was a dark age for recorded music in many ways. What we&apos;ve lost What about the lovely artwork? Nobody savours the Roger Dean artwork on those Yes gatefold sleeve concept albums any more in this barbarian digital age. Least of all when your mobile phone is the source of all your sounds. Phone calls What we&apos;ve gained We can call anybody whenever we like. For instance, you can call the hospital from the passenger seat and tell them (quite possibly) how much you&apos;re dilated, when you&apos;ll be arriving, whether you&apos;d like an epidural, sugar for your tea, book the water birthing facilities, etc. In the past you couldn&apos;t do things like that. Which was a shame. What we&apos;ve lost Punctuality is dead. In pre-mobile days, there was no way of letting someone know we were running late, so we made greater efforts to be outside the theatre at the time agreed. Now we can text them saying we&apos;re running late - even if we&apos;re not and, in reality, just can&apos;t be bothered to meet as planned. Social life is now more fraught with petty resentments than it was before mobiles got on the scene. And now, dammit, anybody can call us whenever they like - it&apos;s harder to hide from after-hours work calls. Virtual presenteeism is the norm. Worse yet, there are no longer movie plots where the guy knows the girl is alone in the flat and the killer is hiding behind the curtains. Today the hero would text Michelle: &quot;Killa in yr flat. behind curtains. scarper! lol :)&quot; And the film would be over in minutes. Rubbish, really. TV and radio What we&apos;ve gained You can make a film of your fancy feet during a tango class in Macclesfield and send it to Juan, the Hispanic hottie you met in Buenos Aires last summer. He will be dazzled by your skills and your devotion to his culture and send you a text saying how much he loves you in broken English. You will move to Argentina and have a lurid affair with him and come home five years later, tired but happy, with three children who won&apos;t like Cheshire at all. In the past you couldn&apos;t do that. Also, we can now watch My Family on our mobiles. And text Gardeners&apos; Question Time with complaints about their broadcast views on when is the right time to prune one&apos;s pyracantha. Goody! Can this really be what Mr Nokia (or whoever it was) intended when he had a dream of making our lives easier with a portable telephonic device the size of a pillow all those years ago? Quite possibly not. What we&apos;ve lost Moments of quiet contemplation on the top deck of a bus unbroken by happy-slapping ruffians who knock your Proust out of your hands and put your resultant discomfiture all over their mobile network and the world wide web, probably when they should be in detention. What&apos;s more, you can watch films on your phones in a format so small that any cinematographer worth their salt would cry to see you vandalise their art in such a manner. Neither of these developments is good. What, really, is the point of watching telly on your mobile? Why don&apos;t you just turn it off and do something else? Read a book. Remember them, for crying out loud? There&apos;s never anything on anyway. Watching telly on the bus? Good grief. That is so pathetic. Get a life. Dating What we&apos;ve gained No longer will you have to fumble for awkward opening lines in a club or pub teeming with fanciable techno sophisticates - instead you can let your phone do the introducing for you, as prospective partners wandering into range are automatically forwarded your profile. All you need is a Bluetooth-enabled phone and a roomful of hotties of either/both genders. If they like what they find in your profile, they can message you and perhaps even wind up having a non-virtual drink/snog/shag/child with you. Happy days! What we&apos;ve lost Talking like normal people used to. No longer do you need to deploy your marvellous range of pick-up lines (from &quot;That&apos;s quite a lovely Jackson Pollock, isn&apos;t it?&quot; to &quot;Your face or mine?&quot;) which you learned at a special evening class (Remedial Dating for Sociopaths 101) last autumn. But isn&apos;t that a shame? After all, getting shot down by some imperious beauty for daring to ask her if she&apos;d like a cr\u00e8me de menthe and kahlua used to be a rite of passage for a young man. But enough about me. Another downside is that rude people who you don&apos;t know sitting at the next restaurant table can send you porn film clips on their similarly Bluetooth-enabled phone. It happens. But that doesn&apos;t make it right. Using the internet What we&apos;ve gained It&apos;s marvellous to go to streetmap.co.uk when you&apos;re lost and equipped only with your mobile. And realise that the nearest Huang Chow Lane, where you are supposed to be meeting your friend, is in Shanghai, and you are in Walsall with only a West Midlands travel pass. Bummer. What we&apos;ve lost The possibility of being outside the techno loop while we&apos;re on the bus home. Time was you could just stare at the rain running down the windows as you sat in gridlock. You might even catch the eye of that person across the aisle and, by the time you had to change to get the number 92, would have their number. Now you&apos;ve got to check your email, text or study the news headlines. Otherwise you&apos;re a nobody. It&apos;s also a royal pain to write emails on your mobile, unless you&apos;ve got a plug-in keyboard.

My Sherry Amour by JonnyBoy71 (Jonathan Jones) You have to love Valentino Rossi. After posting a new lap record of 1:38.394 at an official MotoGP test at Jerez last week, Il Rossifumi claimed his prize - a shiny red BMW Z4 M Coup\u00e9 - and promptly scrambled up the bonnet to jump up and down in ecstasy. Carbon-soled boots and all. With no title points awarded, you could be forgiven for thinking that last season&apos;s runner-up was celebrating a bit too hard. But that would be to underestimate the psychological blow struck at Jerez by Yamaha over Honda, and by Rossi over everyone else. Dani Pedrosa had set the pace all week on the factory Honda, clocking 1:40, then 1:39. Rossi nailed pole and the record only on his last run. Pedrosa responded, but it was not quite enough. Of the next generation of MotoGP pilots, 2005 runner-up Marco Melandri finished 14th and team-mate Ton\u00ed El\u00edas placed tenth on the Gresini Honda, which lacks the overtaking power to put El\u00edas in a position to repeat his kamikaze heroics of last season. On the tighter, technical circuits like Shanghai and Estoril, El\u00edas could well come into his own on the lighter 800cc bike, late on the brakes and carrying corner speed. Melandri provided the prognosis for the early season: &quot;Qatar will be a very hard race, because the Yamaha and Ducati riders and Pedrosa are definitely going to be fast.&quot; Who&apos;d be Nicky Hayden? You&apos;re the world champion, on the best bike, but you don&apos;t even rate a mention in dispatches from your peers. Hayden finished a creditable fourth at Jerez behind Colin Edwards on the second Yamaha M1, but only a repeat of last year&apos;s stunning win will be enough for the man riding with No1 on his bike. So much for the talent. The subtext to the 2007 season lies in the new machinery and how the riders deal with it. The tight grouping of Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki and Suzuki pilots would suggest that the reduced weight of the MotoGP machines is evening out lap times and making for closer racing, but the FIM changes could well reward smaller jockeys. Enter Dani Pedrosa. Honda has been accused of pushing through the shift from full-litre bikes to 800cc this season just to suit Pedrosa&apos;s 5ft 2in, eight-stone frame. Anyone who saw him low-side into Hayden at Estoril last year will nod in agreement. The style required to ride the 2007 full-bore machines is a lot closer to 250cc bikes, moving your weight around in the saddle to place it over the back wheel for maximum down-force. According to Hayden, an American and one of the few riders in MotoGP with no 250cc experience, &quot;the rider can make a difference by using body position and weight to get more out of the bike, whereas on the 990 you were almost just holding on through those Esses.&quot; Titan v tadpole, Yamaha v Honda, Europe v America, plus the most entertaining commentary team in world sport (Toby Moody and Julian Ryder on Eurosport) makes MotoGP an unmissable experience. The season starts this weekend, and I can hardly wait. Jock the Vote by Christopher Beauchamp (CRBeauchamp) Evade, evade, always evade. The cameras are rolling and the poison pens are hovering over notepads. One slip and you&apos;ll be crucified on tonight&apos;s talk radio and in tomorrow&apos;s papers. Your handlers can&apos;t help you up here. The people - your people - need to see leadership, and if they don&apos;t get it from you, they&apos;ll turn you into a joke. For a politician, an error means a slide in the polls. For an American football player, it might mean having your face pile-driven into the turf. But the requirements of professional sports and political office are basically the same. Safe pair of hands wanted. Vision desirable. That may be why sportsmen - fewer women, so far - are choosing to press the flesh rather than pummel it, and are emerging from the jockstrap reek of the locker room into the fresh air of American politics. Step forward Heath Shuler, Democratic congressman from North Carolina. Washington&apos;s political class first got to know him a decade ago, during a truly dismal two-year stint at quarterback for the capital&apos;s Redskins. But the voters of upcountry Asheville, North Carolina remembered him best as a high school and college football star. That aura proved just enough last year to unseat representative Charles Taylor, who proved mortal despite hailing from Transylvania County. Shuler is now the poster-boy for a new breed of electable (read: hillbilly-friendly) red-state Democrats. Just wait until he tries to pass some legislation, mutter Washingtonians with long memories. It&apos;ll wobble five yards and get intercepted. If young Heath needs advice on his new role - other than from God, who speaks to him &quot;daily&quot; - he&apos;ll find plenty of other sportsmen who&apos;ve been there before. From pro football players Steve Largent and Jack Kemp in the House of Representatives to NBA legend Bill Bradley and baseball Hall-of-Famer Jim Bunning in the US Senate, the capital has seen an All-Star line-up in recent years. Most of the sporting polls have been Republicans, which may say something about the effects of repeated concussion, or it may not. So does the country really need another jock-turned-politician? Washington is already excessively macho, and the current president was only a college cheerleader. But consider this: of the recent crop of elected athletes, Kemp and Bradley made their names as thoughtful policy geeks, and only Bunning is certifiably thick. These men&apos;s shared career paths say more about the power of name recognition than about the candidates themselves. That means there&apos;s hope for Shuler. On the other hand, it should leave us dreading what comes next. The cost of running a campaign only goes up. At the same time, young players, even at college level, are already frighteningly media-polished and bland. Get ready for the (wince) Sportsmanchurian Candidate! Clich\u00e9s and lies, by Mike Pollitt (MikePoll) &quot;Every team needs a Makelele.&quot; In recent years the midfielder has become an indispensable staple not just of the Chelsea team, but also of the pundits&apos; lexicon. We are constantly being told how underrated he is. Underrated by whom exactly? Certainly not the clich\u00e9-mongers who harp on endlessly about his supposedly under-appreciated skills. But this is not an anti-Claude rant. Makelele&apos;s reputation as the supreme midfield destroyer is deserved. It is not his fault he has been hyped to the extent that he alone is thought to personify the ideal deep-lying midfielder. This Makeleleism has gone too far. The judgement that every team needs a Makelele is shorthand to mean that they need a ball-winner to act as the deepest midfield player and crunch the opposition into submission before playing &apos;the simple pass.&apos; In short - a water carrier. Makelele is accomplished in possession, more so than the likes of Didier Deschamps or Dunga, but his job is essentially the same. Roman Ambramovich&apos;s millions have ensured him the best of everything, and so it is that he has a thoroughbred rather than a mule transporting his water to the feet of his creators. The pundits tell us that this is how it has to be. But a look at two of the most successful teams of the last year suggest otherwise. Italy won football&apos;s greatest prize with a staggered midfield pivoting at its deepest point not around a physical ball-winner like Gennaro Gattuso, but rather one of the most elegant players of his generation, Andrea Pirlo. He controlled the game not by destroying but by creating. Italy&apos;s triumph was just reward for the team which was the best defensively, and also the most efficient at transferring the ball from one end of the pitch to the other. Pirlo was the man who made it all possible - whose composure and ability amidst the midfield wreckage made it seem as if he was perpetually in the placid eye of a raging storm. Manchester United look set to win the Premiership with England&apos;s closest approximation to Pirlo in the deep-lying role. Michael Carrick is much maligned, but just because Alan Hansen has taken an embarrassingly over-the-top liking to him is no reason to react into lazy Carrick-ter assassination. He was United&apos;s biggest summer signing and they are much improved this term, both defensively and in possession. It would be as wrong to deny him credit for this as to suppose he is solely responsible for United&apos;s success. But it&apos;s worth stating again: not every team needs a Makelele. And it is possible to win playing good football because of - and not despite of - this supposed deficiency.

Oh, we love it when you ask a straight question. And here&apos;s your straight answer. Buy. A. Silver. Shift. Could it be any easier? There are, however, certain rules. Obey them and you will look like a saucy Barbarella (rather than a squat R2-D2). Don&apos;t, under any circumstances, opt for Dolce and Gabbana&apos;s steel corset, which made the catwalk model look like she&apos;d been trapped in a car door. Go instead for something sparkly, witty and light - the kind of dress you&apos;d like to meet at a party. In sequins. Or chain mail. Or twinkly little pailettes. Remember that this is big-time glamorama, and not for people who prefer to skulk around on the periphery of a knees-up. Beyond the simple silver shift, a number of designers showed top-to-toe metallica for spring. The idea is to look vaguely sci-fi and futuristic, as if you read Isaac Asimov and believe in UFOs, without going the whole C-3PO. Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re at Balenciaga did precisely this with his paranoid android articulated metallic leggings, which, incidentally, cost \u00a37,500. We dare you to buy a pair - oh, go on, who needs to buy anything else this year? - and then wear them to collect the kids from school. Who&apos;s pushing it? Lanvin, Marc Jacobs, Jil Sander, Ralph Lauren, Giles, Chanel, Pucci, Gucci, Fendi, Zac Posen, John Rocha, Ungaro - you name it - anyone who didn&apos;t show a silver dress on their spring catwalk should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. The risk: You can very easily wind up looking like a Quality Street left over from Christmas. Or a Trojan foot soldier. Or even an oven-ready bird. All valid looks, we daresay, but not ones you&apos;ll want to exercise in public. The trick: Accessorise carefully. You could feasibly step out in just your silver shift and nothing else at all. Very Kate in Ibiza. Or you could just wear a pair of silver thongs ... The snip: You&apos;ll have no trouble tracking down a cheaper version of the shift. Try the Reiss silver mini &apos;Maggie&apos; dress, \u00a3225, and ruffle-skirt silver organza &apos;Jo&apos; mini, \u00a3145, or River Island&apos;s metallic one-shoulder mini dress, \u00a334.99. If you haven&apos;t been able to bag the Primark sequin shift, \u00a318, try the Marks &amp; Spencer Limited silver sequin tunic, \u00a389; or Warehouse&apos;s, \u00a355, silver frock. For top-to-toe metallics, Mango has silvery wide-legged pants, \u00a340, to wear with your go-go tunic. The mini-mini How old is too old for the Mini Mini? Ask J Lo. She&apos;s been stepping out in high old style lately. And she&apos;s 37. OK, so Jenny has a team of flunkeys whose job it is to enhance the texture and tone of each square inch of her inner thigh. But still, this is not about age, it&apos;s about legs. And if you have a decent pair, then why not knock yourself out in a new-season MM? Be aware, though, that this spring&apos;s hemlines aren&apos;t just common-or-garden short, they&apos;re micro-short, which promises quite a few more celebrity kebab shots on gossip web sites before spring is out. Vogue calls these little frocks &apos;Freedom Dresses&apos; (because &apos;the shapes make your legs feel totally liberated&apos;) - which is a lovely thought (such ventilation!) and all very well if your thighs are all lightning and no thunder. So, if in a dim light, you look like a heyday Twiggy (and here I am talking chiefly to Sienna Miller and, um, there was someone else ...), then go for it. If, however, your legs are logs, then give the MM a miss. Who&apos;s pushing it? Very few key designers sat this one out - you&apos;ll find it at Pucci, DvF, Chanel, Gucci, Giles, Chlo\u00e9, Philosophy, Dolce, Versace, Marc by Marc, Biba, Prada, Temperley ... pauses for breath ... so, you see, it&apos;s an unavoidable element in this spring&apos;s dressing. The comforting news is that the MM dress comes in a comprehensive variety of forms - the cling, the swing, the sack, the bubble, the tunic. What they all have in common, though, is a helluva high hem, so prepare to introduce your bikini line to the world, my friends. The risk: If your thighs meet in the middle, it&apos;s a no. If you&apos;ve kissed your ass goodbye, it&apos;s a don&apos;t-you-even-dare. If you&apos;re over 40, buy a mini dress and wear it as a top. The trick: Adapt to survive. The MM gets along fine with thick black tights, leggings and cigarette pants. Add a sturdy platform sandal (wear last year&apos;s, they&apos;re still hot to trot; actually, in a curious departure from standard fashion procedure, they&apos;re about to get hotter) to give the illusion of length to a leg, and also to balance out a chunkier thigh and/or knee. A big, over-large masculine cut blazer (and there are lots around), worn over longer mini variant, will make said mini look mini-er than it actually is, providing the illusion of MM, with much more coverage. The snip: We love the Wallis satin tunic \u00a365 and New Look&apos;s floral Shanghai mini dress \u00a325. Team with H&amp;M&apos;s orange coat \u00a359.99. But your best investment, as we tell you endlessly, is a pair of black opaque tights (see J Lo, and stock up on Wolford Velvet de Luxe 50). The bold print How loud is too loud a print? This season, they should be deafening. A cacophony of print. Shrug off your inhibitions. Your clothes should sing. And no querulous little blip of a sound, thank you very much. We want noise, great gusts of look-at-me colour and proud-to-be print. As Sienna Miller knows very well, a Pucci print has long been a girl&apos;s best friend - there&apos;s something uplifting about wearing an outfit that cries &apos;check me out&apos; to passers-by. Prints are the antithesis of winter&apos;s drab colour palette and they&apos;ll fly off the rails. Broadly speaking, there are three equally feisty ways to go with this one, making this a trend with universal appeal. Retro prints - like the bonkers Seventies button-and-bead tunics at Chlo\u00e9 - are huge. Bigger still are the florals: wild flower prints, like Oscar de la Renta&apos;s poppies or Moschino&apos;s brash sunflowers. Otherwise, and for anyone who is hoping to retain a modicum of sobriety, it&apos;s a graphic black-and-white story: zigs, zags, zebra stripes. Who&apos;s pushing it? Who isn&apos;t? Versace, Prada, Chanel and Pucci did it best. The risk: If you&apos;re built like a sofa, it&apos;s best not to dress like one. The trick: Don&apos;t think too hard about this print malarkey, you&apos;ll come over all shy and opt for something with less to say. You&apos;ve got to just embrace it. But one printed piece at a time, please: keep accessories low-key and go monochrome if colour is too difficult for you. The snip: Go to Mango for the wild black-and-yellow swirl tunic, \u00a332, or the very Versace retro-print dress, \u00a345. Two favourites are from New Look - the superb modernist print satin shift dress, \u00a335, and the chrysanthemum-print silk shift dress, \u00a335. Wallis is doing a gorgeous print tunic, \u00a330, in its limited edition range. If it&apos;s monochrome you&apos;re after, try the Marks &amp; Spencer Limited graphic black-and-white silk dress, \u00a339.50, Principles black-and-white flower print mini dress, \u00a349, or Zara&apos;s monochrome A-line tunic dress, \u00a369. The new sporty What&apos;s all this about Nu-Rave Body Con? It might sound like a difficult new class at your local gym, but what it boils down to is a bold fusion of sports kit and neon colour. You will, however, probably have to commit to a difficult new class at your gym if you have any hope of succeeding with this look. To give these second-skin dresses a snowball&apos;s chance in Hades, you require a hard bod, in the Madonna vein. This look clings. If you can summon up the energy, go DayGlo. If you insist on sticking to bold primary colours, Yves Klein blue and canary yellow are the colours du jour. Wear them together if you&apos;re both brave and mad. If you&apos;re not into cling, the Nineties Sporty vibe has trickled into all manner of clothes - with stripes and zips, hi-tech fabrics and racer stripes, sweats and hoodies, parkas and bombers cropping up all over, which means Prada Linea Rossa (formerly Prada Sport) is back in pole position. Admittedly, a neon-pink mini skirt isn&apos;t for everyone. But look upon this Body Con rap as a logical sequel to leggings. You love them, don&apos;t you? Didn&apos;t think you would, did you? See! The forward thrust of fashion at work. Who&apos;s pushing it? Christopher Kane who is now peddling a fab line in Topshop, alongside Body Con buddy Marios Schwab. Elsewhere, Dries van Noten&apos;s electric-yellow parka and Stella McCartney&apos;s romper catsuit sum up the playtime mood. The risk: No amount of Lycra will contain a vat of lard. So disrobe. Confront the mirror. Whisper &apos;Nu-Rave-Body-Con&apos; to your reflection. If it flinches, forget it (we are). The trick: Add a flash of neon: a fluoro patent belt or DayGlo bangles (M&amp;S, \u00a37). The snip: Try Topshop&apos;s electric-blue parka, \u00a355, with River Island&apos;s black satin jumpsuit, \u00a359.99. Otherwise, it&apos;s a silver parka, \u00a380, and electric blue satin top, \u00a335, at Wallis; or H&amp;M&apos;s green velour zipped play dress, \u00a339, and its khaki all-in-one catsuit, \u00a329.90. Five hot trends that leave us cold ... 1. The Urban Turban: Miuccia Prada really started the trend, declaring that, &apos;Turbans have always been worn in different cultures to represent beauty and strength, before becoming a symbol of glamour in Hollywood. It perfectly reflects today&apos;s world.&apos; Not convinced, sorry. In today&apos;s world, a turban makes a woman look as if she&apos;s halfway between a wash and a blow dry. Next, they&apos;ll be telling us to buy one of those cheap checked laundry bags. 2. Louis Vuitton&apos;s cheap checked laundry bag: Actually, this bag has been christened the &apos;East West&apos; and elicited a rash of adoration from the front row at the show. We&apos;re sticklers for authenticity, though, and thus prefer the original purchased from our local Bubble-O-Matic launderette. 3. Rucksacks: Nothing against rucksacks per se. Perfect up Pen Y Fan with a slab of Kendal Mint Cake and a Thermos of tea. Besides, the Prada nylon backpack was great back in the dawn of the Nineties. But a 50-litre ruckie? However would you find your lippie? 4. Ankle-biters: The latest trouser stops just north of the ankle. This is a fiendishly silly look and will make you look like Norman Wisdom. 5. 80s cropped tops.

I had a good run in Shanghai last year, qualifying fourth and maintaining that position to the end of the race. Unfortunately I found myself struggling slightly with a lack of rear-tyre grip and at one point was losing three seconds a lap. As the track dried out there was only really one dry line but it was all great fun, reminding me of my kart racing days. We&apos;ll be out to do better than fourth this year. Shanghai dislikes The traffic. I can&apos;t stand it. The congestion, pollution and the driving drives me mad. When I&apos;m not racing The markets. I&apos;ve had a couple of suits made there and they&apos;ve been really good. No signs of them falling apart. On the grid I&apos;m thinking Try to miss the massive bump going into turn one. If you hit that when the tyres are cold and the pressures are low you&apos;ll lock up. I&apos;ll aim to overtake at Turn six, also into turns 11 and 14. Key to a quick lap Breathing.

The \u00a3123m construction bill for (yet another) Hermann Tilkedesigned track makes it the most expensive grand prix circuit ever built. Its similarity to the Chinese character shang, which means above or ascend, was not intentional. You could probably land a private jet in the huge paddock area but Bernie Ecclestone has yet to try.

Photograph: Jason Plotkin/AP Stepping out of Copenhagen station a few weeks ago in the winter dark, I felt welcomed by the colourful glow of the rooftops of the otherwise straight-laced office blocks and hotels of the close-by neighbourhood. These are crowned with neon advertisements. Nothing fancy, and yet warm, alive and happily cheerful in the otherwise biting winter gloom. Here is an example of subtle neon lighting used to make a winter night in a dark and cold winter city shine like some modern, and urban, equivalent of Jacob&apos;s coat of many colours. Not exactly Piccadilly Circus, not quite Times Square, but rainbow-like, heart-warming and fun. The neon sign is indeed one of the great everyday classic designs. It can be subtle. It can be all singing, all dancing, yet never ever dull. The mastermind, and master eye, behind the cheerful neon sign was Georges Claude (1870-1960), a French chemist, engineer and inventor. Claude discovered that an electric charge applied to a sealed tube of neon gas, would produce a joyous coloured light. Red. And, that other of the family of gases to which neon belongs, treated in the same way, would bring alive other colours, too. Blue in the case of mercury. White with C02. Helium turned gas and electricity to gold. Phosphor-coated glass tubes could spin any number of colours - some 150 to date. Neon itself had been identified by the British scientists, William Ramsey and MW Travers, in 1898; yet, it was up to Claude to suggest its popular and commercial potential. The gas was certainly special - just one part in 65,000 of the Earth&apos;s atmosphere - but once distilled, could enliven shops, arcades, squares and city centres from Los Angeles via London to Rome and Shanghai. Claude demonstrated the first neon sign in Paris at the World Expo of 1910, although the first commercial application - above the door of a Parisian barber&apos;s shop - had to wait another two years. Claude first exported the invention, or concept, to the US in 1923 when ritzy neon lamps showcased a Packard car dealer&apos;s showroom in Los Angeles, and the rest, was colourfully-lit history. Neon lighting can, of course, be wholly over-the-top, and absurdly vulgar; yet, at its best, it warms the cockles, and cornices, of any number of otherwise dark buildings and glum streets in winter, and whenever, in fact, the blazing sun, all hydrogen and helium, and only a tiny bit of neon, disappears.", "tags": ["Design", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-13T14:43:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/13/cheltenhamfestival2007.cheltenhamfestival", "sentences": ["Jumping the fourth, Shanghai joins the leaders."], "title": "Horse racing: Cheltenham Festival, day one, live!", "article": "Preamble And so it begins. Four days of optimism and despair, ups and downs, losers and more losers. Day one of the Cheltenham Festival should be a cracker, with Detroit City trying to buck the trends by winning the Triumph Hurdle as a five-year-old, and Fair Along and My De Solzen slugging it out in the Arkle. Those looking for tips could do worse than to listen to Ron Cox, the Guardian&apos;s chief tipster, and Eddie &quot;The Shoe&quot; Fremantle, the Observer&apos;s excellent betting expert, and completely ignoring everything I have to say. Competition Every day this week, there&apos;s the chance for you to win a \u00a3100 bet (first prize) and a \u00a325 bet (second prize) with Blue Square. Simply email one nap and next best selection for Cheltenham today (*** Channel 4 TV races between 2pm-4pm only ***) to me before 2pm, the winner(s) will be the ones with the best points tally. Rules: \u00b7 Points are calculated as \u00a31 on each selection, so a loser costs you one point, a 25-1 winner gets you 25 points. \u00b7 Only winners count.

The judges decision is final. Emails: We&apos;ve already had over 100 predictions in, the most confident of which comes from Paul Bassett. &quot;Nap - Pouvoir in the 5.20. This thing is nailed on,&quot; he says. &quot;NB - New Alco in the 4.20. It&apos;s a name that deserves to win. Added to that Ferdy Murphy is the shrewdest man for the handicaps! Won&apos;t be outside the top two. Can you do the necessary paper work on organising my blue square account etc after I win?&quot; Er, we&apos;re only taking picks from the TV races, Paul... 2pm: Supreme Novices Hurdle Preview: Amaretto Rose, who has a seven-pound allowance for being a mare, is a huge, huge favourite for this. Mick Fitzgerald reckons she&apos;s &quot;an aeroplane&quot; and she&apos;s favourite at 9-4. But others have a chance, including Hide the Evidence, and lively outsider De Soto. Meanwhile Tony Richards asks: &quot;What&apos;s the biggest betting coup anyone reading this has pulled off? A few years ago, I had \u00a320 on Sir Rembrandt each way at 40-1 in the Gold Cup, and it duly obliged. Can anyone beat that?&quot; Trends: Usually 5-6 year olds win this, with females winning between 1995-98 and in 2002. Speaking of which Amaretto Rose has come into 2-1 favourite. &quot;Nap for the day must be Fair Along to pip My Way de Solzen in the 2:35 over 2m,&quot; says Robin Mounsey. &quot;My Way is a great stayer at 2m4f but the dry weather means Fair Along will be hard to reel in over the shorter trip.&quot; True, although Buena Vista looks a lively outsider. Latest betting: 2-1 Amaretto Rose 2-1, 8-1 Granit Jack, 10-1 Hide the Evidence, 11-1 De Valira. Oh, just to clarify, we only want two predictions in total for today&apos;s competition. Just five minutes to go now My colleague Barry Glendenning reckons Orbit O&apos;Gold is a decent e/w chance at 25-1. Meanwhile your betting coup stories are trickling in. &quot;A magical streak a few years ago saw me rack up two 100-1s in a matter of months,&quot; says Rohan Grove. &quot;Fergal O&apos;Brien each way to reach a snooker Masters final and Hasim Rahman to win in the fifth against Lewis (with quite a bit on him just to win as well). Small stakes but very satifying.&quot; Hats off Rohan. Anyone else? The Race ... Paul Nicholls, in today&apos;s Racing Post, reckons Granit Jack has a chance &quot;but will have to step up to beat Amaretto Rose,&quot; who starts 2-1 favourite. We&apos;re off! No we&apos;re not ... the starter calls them back. To huge boozy cheers, we finally get underway and Orbit O&apos;Gold takes the early lead ... it&apos;s pretty bunched up after two fences, with She&apos;s Our Daisy leading from Orbit O&apos;Gold ... Amaretto Rose is midway ... Jumping the fourth, Shanghai joins the leaders. It&apos;s all very bunched up ... to huge cheers, Amaretto Gold makes a little charge to sixth or seventh position. Granit Jack leads with three out ... Amaretto Rose looks comfortable and hasn&apos;t come off the bridle with two out but five could still win it ... Amaretto Rose us battling on, but she&apos;s not going to win ... Ebaziyan takes it, with Granit Jack second and Amaretto Rose third! Silence greets the 40-1 winner. Result 1st: Ebaziyan 40-1, 2nd: Granit Jack 15-2, 3rd: Amaretto Rose 2-1. 2.35pm: Arkle Trophy Preview: This could be a classic, with Fair Along (who has won all three chase starts) and My Way De Solzen heading the betting, just ahead of Don&apos;t Push It which is highly rated by Tony McCoy. This is a mighty tough race to call, with Buena Visa a lively outsider. &quot;&apos;Silence greets the 40/1 winner,&apos;&quot; chuckles Gary Naylor. &quot;Horse racing is the only sport in which a plucky underdog&apos;s success is greeted in this way - it&apos;s why it&apos;s not really a sport at all.&quot; Trends: What you want here is a five, six or seven year old that&apos;s finished first or second in any of the two to five chases it&apos;s completed. Look for one that&apos;s run in in Grade 1 or Grade 2 class before, but not one that&apos;s run in the last three weeks or trained up north. Buena Vista and My Way De Solzen fit the bill here. Latest betting: 7-2 Fair Along, 4-1 My Way De Solzen, 9-2 Don&apos;t Push It, Buena Vista 10-1, Twist Magic 14-1. &quot;I had Sir Percy at 12-1 and Dylan Thomas at 50-1 e/w for last year&apos;s Derby,&quot; says Simon Thomas. &quot;I almost wet myself at the finish when Sir Percy sneaked through to win.&quot; Surely he was 6-1 on the day, Simon? The race: Here we go... or not, as we have another false start. Lennon and Tidal Fury both charge down to the first fence before being hauled back. The starter is giving the horses a couple of minutes to recover. Bettingwise, Fair Along is 10-3, My Way De Solzen is 7-2 and Don&apos;t Push It is into 4-1. We&apos;re off! Jack the Giant goes into a two-length lead ahead of Gemini Lucy ... Fair Along is in fourth, but doesn&apos;t look that comfortable ... Jack the Giant still leads, with the big contenders all roughly midway ... My Way De Solzen moves into fourth, with Don&apos;t Push It and Fair Along, who is normally a front runner, just behind ... Jack the Giant still leads from Lennon with My Way De Solzen third and Don&apos;t Push It fourth three out ... Don&apos;t Push It goes down with two to go ... it&apos;s looks like being My Way De Solzen ... he makes a huge leap at the last to win by six lengths from Fair Along with Jack the Giant Third. Result: 1st: My Way De Solzen 7-2, 2nd: Fair Along 10-3F, Jack The Giant 14-1. 3.15pm: Champion Hurdle Preview: The big race of the day. Detroit City, the brilliant five-year-old, takes on previous winners Hardy Eustace and Brave Inca. As James Willoughby points out in the Racing Post today, Detroit City beat Fair Along and Blazing Bailey in the fastest Triumph Hurdle ever last year, beating the track record. My ante-post money is on Detroit, but Irish challengers Hardy Eustace and Brave Inca, along with Straw Bear, could easily win this. Trends: Usually short-priced horses between 6 to 8 win this. There&apos;s not been a five-year winner since See You Then won the race in 1985, and he was pretty lucky that year as 4-6 favourite Browns Gazette veered badly at the start and lost 20 lengths. It usually helps to be Irish too (six of the last eight winners). Latest betting: The money is pouring in for Detroit City, who has come into 13-8 from 9-4. Hardy Eustace (3-1) is also being backed while Brave Inca is out to 6-1, a huge price. &quot;I once won \u00a3436 from an 80p Placepot at Huntingdon when I was 16-years-old,&quot; says Dave Smith. &quot;That&apos;s a return of 545-1. Although I was a regular in the bookies almost every afternoon in those days, I still sent my mum in to collect the winnings just in case the manager suddenly became less accommodating.&quot; Latest news The punters continue to come in for Detroit City - he&apos;s now 6-4 in some places. I got him at a shade over 7-2 antepost. Come on Detroit! I&apos;m fearful of Brave Inca, who looked well coming down to post, but he is still friendless in the market. The race We&apos;re off! (at the first attempt, but only after lots of angry shouts of &quot;walk! walk!&quot; from the starter) ... Hardy Eustace leads from Asian Maze ... Brave Inca moves into second but Detroit City is going backwards ... he&apos;s recovered now though ... Hardy Eustace continues to lead from Brave Inca with Asian Maze in third ... Detroit City has kicked up and is now disputing the lead ... racing up the hill Brave Inca, Hardy Eustace and Detroit City are in front ... not long afterwards however Detroit City starts going backwards ... Straw Bear has pulled up ... Brave Inca and Hardy Eustace are disputing the lead but Sublimity is closing going over the last. Sublimity wins! And my colleague Barry Glendenning, who backed him at 20-1, is waving his hands in delight. Sickening. The result: 1st: Sublimity 16-1, 2nd: Brave Inca 11-2, 3rd: Afsoun 28-1. 4pm: William Hill Trophy Preview: I&apos;m zero for three so far. And the William Hill Trophy Handicap Chase doesn&apos;t look any easier to predict. Juveignur, who is always there or thereabouts, will probably start favourite, but Little Brick - who is being lined up for the Grand National, Distant Thunder, Rambling Minster, Mon Mome and Heltronic all have chances. The GU Sports desk, meanwhile, have had a small gamble on Irish Raptor at 25-1. Trends: Every winner of this race in the last 15 years has had at least three runs over the season, except Betty&apos;s Boy in 1999. Very short priced horses usually lose, while the last seven winners have carried 10st 11lbs.

He inhales the aromatic betel nut paste inside. &quot;I sell these as a stimulant to the local nightshift workers,&quot; he says. &quot;I use them to escape the smell of this place.&quot; Around his stall the unmistakable stench of ammonia and sewage hangs over Apna Street, an industrial lane that dissects Mumbai&apos;s labyrinthine Dharavi slum. A 175ha maze of dark alleys and corrugated shacks, Dharavi swarms with more than a million residents. But if you have the patience to look closer, you will find here one of the most inspiring economic models in Asia. Dharavi may be one of the world&apos;s largest slums, but it is by far its most prosperous - a thriving business centre propelled by thousands of micro-entrepreneurs who have created an invaluable industry - turning around the discarded waste of Mumbai&apos;s 19 million citizens. A new estimate by economists of the output of the slum is as impressive as it seems improbable: $1.4bn a year. For Dharavi&apos;s detractors, mainly Mumbai&apos;s city fathers and real estate developers, keen to get their hands on the prime land, the shanty is an embarrassing boil to be lanced from the body of an ambitious city hoping to become the next Shanghai. But for a growing number of environmental campaigners Dharavi is becoming the green lung stopping Mumbai choking to death on its own waste. Along Apna Street hundreds of barefoot street children, human recycling machines, scurry back and forward, hauling bundles of waste - plastic, cardboard or glass - retrieved from Mumbai&apos;s vast municipal dumps. From every alley comes the sounds of hammering, drilling and soldering. In every shack, dark figures sit waist-deep in piles of car batteries, computer parts, fluorescent lights, ballpoint pens, plastic bags, paper and cardboard boxes and wire hangers. Workshops reveal everything from aluminium smelters recycling drink cans to bare-chested men stirring huge vats of waste soap. It is home to an estimated 15,000 single-room factories. Typifying the spirit, Dinesh Sarin shows me around his &quot;new corporate headquarters&quot;, a gaudily painted bamboo and scrap wood shack, connected to the world by a plastic phone shaped like a mermaid. His employees use metal bars to bash dents out of cooking oil cans. In a courtyard 20 more workers squat on stones and clean the cans. &quot;We process over 400 of these a day. We get cans in a terrible state and we clean them up and sell them back to the oil companies and direct to local consumers. We save them a fortune.&quot; Mr Dinesh&apos;s life is an amalgam of suffering and relative success. Around midnight, once the last shift is over, he heads for the concrete room in the centre of the slum where he, his wife and five children cook, eat and sleep. Here the buildings meet overhead and no light can penetrate. At first glance Dinesh might seem just another one of India&apos;s desperately poor, but he has just bought his family a new bungalow in his home state, Bihar. &quot;I&apos;m saving up to buy a Maruti van so I can take my family to Goa when the weather gets too hot,&quot; he grins through betel-stained teeth. If India&apos;s biggest city is seen by economists as its great hope, Mumbai also embodies most of the country&apos;s staggering problems. The obstacles hampering India&apos;s progress - poor infrastructure, weak government, searing inequality, corruption and crime - converge in Mumbai. Largely as a result of its association with Bollywood, India&apos;s financial capital remains a beacon of hope for the young people of India. Many end up on assembly lines in Dharavi. &quot;You in the West so easily see the slum as a negative concept,&quot; said Sonu Badal, a spokesman for Chirag, a campaign to secure Dharavi from demolition. &quot;Yes, it is beset by deep poverty and neglect, but Dharavi has also been mirroring India&apos;s revival and it has done so largely by rejecting a local government that has long ignored it and by recycling its own resources.&quot; Yet survival in a slum rarely means adhering to the law. Barely 10% of the commercial activity here is legal. Most of the workshops are constructed illegally on government land, power is routinely stolen and commercial licences are rarely sought. There is just one lavatory for every 1,500 residents, not a single public hospital, and only a dozen municipal schools. Throughout the slum chicken and mutton stalls dump viscera into open drains thick with human and industrial waste; cholera, typhoid and malaria are common. Taps run dry most of the time. But Dharavi remains a land of opportunity. The average household here now earns between $80 and $200, well above agricultural wage levels. Certain corners of Dharavi have even gone upmarket with bars, beauty parlours and clothing boutiques. Last week a major bank opened the slum&apos;s first ATM. But the future is uncertain. The government has provisionally approved a plan called &quot;Vision Mumbai&quot; to create a world-class city by 2013. But architect Charles Correa, who has worked in the city for 50 years, says: &quot;There&apos;s very little vision with this plan. They&apos;re more like hallucinations.&quot; Demolition work has begun and police are forcing out inhabitants, leaving thousands homeless. Author and architect Neera Adarkar is among hundreds of activists who see Vision Mumbai as impractical and inhumane because it ignores both the industry and hope of the slum. &quot;Why wreck the homes and lives of people who have built the city and lived in it for decades?&quot; he said. &quot;Because from your luxury high-rise apartment you don&apos;t want the humiliation of India&apos;s poor in your line of vision as you make your money and succeed.&quot;", "tags": ["Global development", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-16T23:54:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/17/china.leadersandreply", "sentences": ["The exhibition has been organised at the request of three museums (in Shanghai, Guanzhou and Beijing) which identified it as what their young audiences wanted to see."], "title": "Letters: China ready for shock of the new", "article": "Madeleine Bunting writes with justified enthusiasm about the British Museum exhibition which opened in Beijing this week (Comment, March 15). The museum&apos;s director, Neil MacGregor, makes a compelling case for the role of major international exhibitions, and for using the nation&apos;s cultural assets effectively in pursuit of a &quot;foreign cultural policy&quot; that builds bridges with people overseas. On Monday another British exhibition opens in Beijing. Aftershock brings the work of a generation of young British artists, including Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, the Chapman brothers, Mark Wallinger et al, to China for the first time. The exhibition has been organised at the request of three museums (in Shanghai, Guanzhou and Beijing) which identified it as what their young audiences wanted to see. The exhibition has been organised by the British Council and we invited Chinese curators to the UK to meet the artists, make the selection of work and become involved at every stage of the preparation and organisation of the show. But we do not only &quot;do contemporary&quot;. In 2003, for example, we organised the hugely successful Constable exhibition in Paris. In 1997 we organised an exhibition of the British Museum&apos;s treasures for Delhi and Mumbai, to mark the 50th anniversary of Indian independence. And we are currently working with both the British Museum and Tate Britain to enable exhibitions they have organised to travel to the Middle East.  However, our primary focus remains in areas which our national institutions are less able to undertake: in education, in long-term exchanges involving contemporary literature, art, film music, drama and dance.Andrea RoseDirector, visual arts, British Council I&apos;m delighted that Charlotte Higgins (Global capital of culture, March 12) achieves more cultural climaxes in London than in any other capital city. But I wonder if, in the ecstasy of her achievement, she misses the real reason. It goes much deeper than blockbuster exhibitions, creativity in new theatre and film, the world-class music and dance, the contemporary art scene, fashion and design, brilliant as each sector is. What really makes London fizz as the world&apos;s arts capital is that we deploy our art forms, companies and institutions with more flair and imagination: internationalism, cross-disciplinary collaboration, innovation, risk and diversity are words engraved on the hearts of most of the curators and directors, not to mention artists. London creates more, London produces more, London&apos;s programmes are more challenging and provocative, London markets more effectively. The artistic interplay among the city&apos;s multiple ethnic strands works in a more electrifying and stimulating way than in any other capital, making the multiculturalism of our arts scene a major asset for the whole nation.Graham SheffieldArtistic director, Barbican", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-17T00:09:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/18/comment.china", "sentences": ["In the middle of the 19th century, an area the size of Germany located between Beijing and Shanghai in central China was run for more than 15 years by the Nian rebels, a 50,000-strong network of bandit groups who lived by pillage and rape.", "Chinese cities such as Shanghai or Guangzhou report 90 per cent of crime from unmarried migrant men."], "title": "Will Hutton: The calamity of Asia's lost women", "article": "In the middle of the 19th century, an area the size of Germany located between Beijing and Shanghai in central China was run for more than 15 years by the Nian rebels, a 50,000-strong network of bandit groups who lived by pillage and rape. The inability of the Imperial armies to quell the rebellion for so long was a sign of the system&apos;s vulnerability that would eventually lead to its collapse. Importantly, the Nian bandits were men without women, long understood in China as the principal stimulus to their rebellion and cause of their violence. They originated in a district in northern China - Huai-pei - where the killing of infant girls to conserve food for more economically valuable boys in response to famine had been particularly terrible. By 1850, the official records show that there were 129 men to every 100 women, an astonishing imbalance in the ratio between the sexes. Lower-class Huai-pei peasants could not find wives; hungry, economically displaced and, in Chinese terms, &apos;bare branches&apos; - not proper men because they could not marry and father children - they turned to banditry as providing meaning and sustenance alike. Those womanless bandits cast a long shadow over not just today&apos;s China, but the whole of Asia. Asia is estimated to suffer from up to 100 million missing women - aborted as foetuses or murdered in infancy because of their sex. Pakistan, erupting in protests last week against President Musharraf&apos;s anti-democratic high-handedness in suspending a senior judge, is a volatile tinderbox where the capacity for such insurrection to spread is everpresent. Fanning the flames of injustice and Islamic fundamentalism is the country&apos;s sex imbalance. Dispossessed, displaced men with no prospect of ever finding a partner more readily take to the streets like Nian rebels; violence demonstrates masculine meaning. In today&apos;s China, there are now 119 men for every 100 women. In some areas, the imbalance is greater than it was in Huai-pei in 1850. Earlier this year, an official Chinese report projected that by 2020, one in 10 men between 20 and 45 would be unable to find a wife. Professor Valerie Hudson of Brigham Young University in the US estimates that by 2020, there will be 28 million surplus Chinese men and 31 million surplus Indian men. Both governments are becoming more and more worried about the psychological and social consequences, not to mention the sheer criminality of it. As one Indian commentator remarks, the most dangerous period of a woman&apos;s life is her first few months in the womb. China&apos;s President Hu Jintao, remembering the Nian rebellion, has publicly recognised that such a huge population of &apos;bare branches&apos; constitutes one of the biggest potential threats to the communist regime&apos;s survival. Real unemployment in China is more than 20 per cent, inequality is growing rapidly and there is plenty of injustice for rootless, violently inclined, womanless men to protest about. For its part, the Indian government is increasingly alarmed by the explosion of woman trafficking and prostitution, and the threat to the rule of law implied by such mass infanticide and abortion of babies because of their sex. In the last few weeks, it has stepped up its campaign to make the battery of laws against such practices stick. It is illegal in India to require a wife&apos;s family to pay a dowry to her future husband&apos;s family, a disastrous disincentive for poor peasants to be the parents of girls; illegal to use ultrasound equipment to establish the sex of an unborn baby; illegal to perform abortion because of a baby&apos;s sex. Yet the practices are on the increase, with the use of ultrasound becoming ubiquitous. The problem is that peasant societies economically and culturally value boys - and India and China remain peasant societies. Wives go to live with men in their villages; it is through men that the blood line continues; it will be your son&apos;s family that looks after you in old age. In rural China, where there is no pension system for 800 million people, terror of old age with no carer or pension is rampant, accentuated by the one-child system. If your one child is a girl, she will marry out and you face an old age of desolation and neglect. The incentive to abort or kill the baby girl and try for a boy is immense. It is nearly always the mother, aware of the disadvantage of being a woman, who commits the crime, which makes policing so very hard. You might expect hard economics would provide some counterbalance; as women become scarcer and their co-equal and vital part in constructing healthy societies ever more obvious across Asia, you would expect their value to rise. Yet the mores of marriage trump economics. Daughters move out to live in the villages of sons, so that sons continue to be more valuable. Rather than women in general being valued more in the face of a woman shortage, what is happening is that lower-class women are marrying further up the social scale. In India, dowries are rising, not falling, as the average income of marrying couples increases. What is left behind, just as in Huai-pei, is an ever-growing pool of men at the bottom who are both poor and without the prospect of finding a wife. In both China and India, there is a near complete correlation between the growth of violent crime and those cities and provinces where the sex ratio is worst. It is Indian provinces such as Uttar Pradesh and parts of the Punjab that have both the worst sex imbalance and highest levels of recorded crime. Chinese cities such as Shanghai or Guangzhou report 90 per cent of crime from unmarried migrant men. Most Chinese regimes in history, as the communists know, have been toppled from below. Western commentators like to project China and India as economic giants effortlessly on the move. But societies that are so dysfunctional rarely sustain rapid growth or stable government for long. There will be change.

Pick me!&quot; Not that it&apos;s advisable to actually write any of those things on your CV, however tempting it might be after you&apos;ve done a few applications. This is one area of life where being conventional, or at least seeming conventional, can pay off. Brightly coloured paper and weird squiggly fonts will not impress the team of stony-faced HR professionals who have spent the whole day going through CVs, and find yours at the bottom of the pile. Jocular comments will be about as welcome as a squashed frog. So what kind of CV will make them leap up from their chairs in delight at the mere prospect of interviewing you? The dull, but inevitable, answer is this: one showing a rock-solid career record that completely qualifies you for the job in question. Bad news, you might think. But who has honestly gone from brilliant job to brilliant job in a perfectly smooth career progression? Boring types, that&apos;s who. Most people have done a bit of this, a bit of that and a bit of travelling about - and making it all add up to the perfect CV takes ... not lies exactly, but a bit of lateral thinking and imagination. In short, embellishment. The first thing is plug gaps in your employment history. Gaps look bad. The unimaginative reader of your CV will assume you&apos;ve been unemployed. The imaginative one will think you&apos;ve been in prison or running an opium den in Shanghai. It might be really, really tempting not to mention the six weeks in a sandwich shop before storming out. But put it down, and talk up your responsibilities. In the real world, all you did was make sandwiches. In CV world, you&apos;ve &quot;managed&quot;, &quot;overseen&quot; or &quot;executed&quot; the sandwich-making process. Even in the lowliest job you can make things happen. Your biggest achievement might have been getting through the day without bursting into tears. But remember that slightly-less-than-usually-ghastly afternoon when you invented a sandwich filling? Say that you proactively extended the menu range, and bingo, you&apos;ve demonstrated the creative, can-do attitude they&apos;re looking for. Now you&apos;ve a watertight employment history, you can loosen up and add a bit of colour with your personal interests. If, like most people, your true weekend activities revolve around shopping, lie-ins and spaghetti carbonara, this might take a bit of imagination, but don&apos;t just make it up. Put down photog- raphy (because you&apos;ve got a camera) or walking (because you have just walked to the interview) and you might end up being seen by someone who&apos;ll want an in-depth discussion of shutter speeds or hiking in the Grampians. Don&apos;t be shy about something a bit unusual. The truth might even strike a chord. I once had a manager who was keen on interviewing someone after her CV stated that she had a collection of more than 100 pairs of vintage high heels. She didn&apos;t get the job, but she certainly made an impression. So, if you have an exciting hobby, put it down. A pair of Manolo Blahniks might be just what your CV is crying out for.

The 19-year-old is currently nursing a gruesome graze on his knee, another on his elbow, a bruised hip and a sore ankle and, though none of those appears serious enough to cause long-term concern, together they must cast some doubt on his ability to compete successfully in this week&apos;s Sony Ericsson Open in Miami.  &quot;Miami is the No1 priority just now. I want to get ready for that and give 110% there and just take it sort of day by day,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope I&apos;ll be fit.&quot;  The British No1 would move heaven and earth to play the \u00a31.77m Masters Series tournament, which is widely regarded as the most important date on the calendar outside of the four grand slams. Three wins there would probably be enough to get him inside the world&apos;s top 10 for the first time and edge him closer to being in the running for the eight-man, year-end Masters Cup in Shanghai.  Before anything else, though, he and his personal physio, Jean-Pierre Bruyere, must concern themselves with getting him fit for his first match, and that will take some doing. He sustained his injuries in a spectacular fall during Friday&apos;s quarter-final win over Tommy Haas in the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells. After a nine-minute injury break - and two match points against him - he somehow managed to win the match 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 but when he woke up the next morning he realised the extent of his physical problems. &quot;It&apos;s just every single place that I moved to, whether it be my elbow or my side or the cut on my knee, I felt pretty uncomfortable,&quot; he said. &quot;Everywhere I put my arm or my leg it was kind of bruised somewhere.&quot;  He refused to withdraw from Saturday&apos;s semi-final against Novak Djokovic but began to regret the decision only minutes into the match, when everything started to ache at once. &quot;It was a bit of an unprofessional decision on my part to have gone on,&quot; he admitted after his 6-2, 6-3 defeat. &quot;I guess the older you get the more you learn that it&apos;s not always about just going on.  &quot;I wanted to go out and try and play and maybe see if I could, you know, see if I could move OK. But after the first couple of games I kind of realised that when you can&apos;t change direction, and when the movement, which is generally the best part of your game, is missing, it&apos;s quite hard to play.&quot; Murray should not be too harsh on himself, especially since he had been told that the risk of aggravating the injuries was minimal. He is likely to ask for a late start in Miami and will hope he heals quickly so that he can keep up the forward momentum he gained in Indian Wells. His run to the semi-finals should have pushed his ranking up two more places to 12 and, although he left California yesterday feeling battered and bruised, overall it was another week of progress. In yesterday&apos;s final Rafael Nadal beat Djokovic 6-2, 7-5 to win his first title since last year&apos;s French Open. The Spaniard, who did not drop a set during the tournament, held off a strong charge by the Serbian in the second set but finally subdued him with punishing attacks from the baseline. &quot;Before coming here I was never thinking about this victory so this is an unbelievable tournament for me,&quot; Nadal said.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Andy Murray"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-19T02:37:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/mar/23/business.shanghai.asia", "sentences": ["A week in Shanghai (especially if you were there 10 years ago) will leave you a little disorientated but amazed by the rapidity of China&apos;s progress and its zealous embrace of Western life."], "title": "Business traveller's diary: March 4-17", "article": "Flights: 10Miles flown: 29,797Destinations: Tokyo, London, Munich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, DusseldorfNights in a hotel: 12Nights on a dancefloor: 5Satisfaction rating: 9.81/10 How time flies.

Some 93,128 flying miles and innumerable BA hot chocolates later, I have the joy of writing to you for a fifth time.  To continue the prevailing sense of self-satisfaction, it&apos;s been a delight to be back in Asia over the last fortnight. Nothing can provide the cultural, roller-coaster ride of a fortnight on the earth&apos;s largest continent. Granted it&apos;s hard. The jet lag is violent (I once ironed my head as well as a shirt on my arrival in Beijing) and the simplest exercise appears to be riddled with difficulty. Any business traveller who has tried to reach their destination in a barely functioning Chinese taxi will recognise the sentiment (and accompanying rage). We may have disparaging views of Chirac and Bush, but we understand France and America. We recognise their culture, their people and, broadly at least, their ways of working. But much of Asia remains a touch bewildering. And so naturally we simplify. Either we think, &quot;all of Asia is the same&quot;. Or we are over-influenced by vastly exaggerated film or literature which suggest India is full of ineffectual, head-wobbling dancers clad in pink and Japan is a land where business is conducted by alcoholics in sleeping pods.  What I&apos;m trying to say (and whisper it softly) is that I&apos;m convinced that our predecessors&apos; picture of Asia as a frantic land full of deferential, comically short men grappling meekly with poverty, dictatorship and corporate inactivity hasn&apos;t completely been eradicated.  What a crying shame this is. Firstly, most Asians are significantly taller than Jimmy Krankie. More significantly perhaps, the people you&apos;ll meet are booming and confident, with a dynamism often missing within our tired manufacturing sector in Europe. The zeal for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial growth among the Chinese and Indians in particular is thrilling for any tired European business person.  And they live in countries that are increasingly sophisticated and yet still authentic, that fuse the best of their historic cultures with the modernity of the west. As a roving businessmen, you can stay in magnificent, state-of-the-art hotels but spend the evening munching delicious masala dosas on banana leaves; or you can stay in a ryokan blessed by Japanese samurai but spend the evening listening to English funky house in a super-hip night spot. Cultural exploration plus reassuring familiarity: it&apos;s a winner. And let me not give you the impression that &quot;all of Asia is the same&quot;. A month spent working in various parts of Asia can provide unparalleled variety. A week in Mumbai will exhaust you, but provide unforgettable memories of colourful bustle, ceaseless energy, boundless intelligence and genuine warmth. A week in Shanghai (especially if you were there 10 years ago) will leave you a little disorientated but amazed by the rapidity of China&apos;s progress and its zealous embrace of Western life. And a week spent in Japan will leave you lusting for more: a better understanding of its dedication to aesthetic beauty and the singular traditions of its people.  So this week I have one, rather simple tip for you. Go to Asia: just as quickly as BA or Virgin can take you. Before I leave you, however, a quick note on a completely different topic: the highly contentious open skies agreement. For those of you who don&apos;t know, currently only BA, Virgin, AA and United are allowed to fly from Heathrow to the US; but now the open-skies agreement has been ratified by the EU, a wide series of airlines (Delta, Lufthansa, etc) will be allowed to pull the same highly lucrative trick. As a deep lover of BA and Virgin, with an avid interest in their profit margins, my first instinct was one of rage. But on reflection, this could be a highly beneficial development for the business traveller.  First, the agreement will also open up other European airports. So BA could fly Frankfurt to JFK or Paris to LA if they wished; and allow you to fly your favourite airline over the Atlantic without returning to London. And second, if we Brits negotiate successfully, BA might also be able to fly internally within the US, ie New York to San Francisco or Washington to LA. Imagine the joy of that. We business travellers crave choice and the whole open skies caboodle might just give us a lot more. Exciting times ahead. That&apos;s it for now. Good night and good luck.

Yesterday a brief notice in the China News Service recorded the death of Mao Anqing, who survived his father to live on into a new China that the dictator would not have recognised. Mao Zedong&apos;s second child, who died on Friday, lived through civil war, the execution of his mother, street life in Shanghai, and a journey to Paris and to Moscow, where he studied under Stalin&apos;s surveillance. Eventually he returned to China, where he was largely ignored by his father. Anqing was born in 1923, during a rare settled period in his father&apos;s life, one of three sons from the second of Mao&apos;s four marriages. Having left his first arranged marriage to a girl in his native village, the young librarian fell for Yang Kaihui, the daughter of an ethics professor. Though Mao&apos;s record as a womaniser was already established, his bride wrote that she was &apos;living for him&apos; and, if he died, would die with him. They set up house just outside the East Gate of Changsha, capital of their home province of Hunan. Three sons were born in the next seven years - Anqing was the second. Mao was frequently away, working for the Communist Party, touring the countryside and participating in the United Front with Sun Yat-sen&apos;s Nationalists in Canton. His biographer, Philip Short, writes that &apos;perhaps for the only time in Mao&apos;s life, he had a truly happy family to come home to&apos;. Hunan was an unsettled place in which to grow up as warlords vied for power. In 1927 the Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek, allied with one of the province&apos;s militarists and led a motley force north to the Yangzi. On their way, they took Changsha without trouble, workers&apos; militias helping to chase out the warlord troops. Chiang then launched a &apos;White Terror&apos; against the Communists, first in Shanghai and then across the country. Abandoning his wife and sons for good, Mao began his long career as a guerrilla leader, sheltering with bandits in the rough mountain country on the eastern border of Hunan, and then setting up a bigger base in Jiangxi province, where he lived with the daughter of a local scholar. Depressed by his faithlessness, Yang Kaihui considered suicide, but decided she could not do this to the sons. Poems that she wrote, which she hid in cracks in the walls of her house and which were seen by the author Jung Chang when she was researching her biography of Mao, vividly express her solitude and fears. &apos;You are now the beloved sweetheart,&apos; one ran. &apos;Return, return...&apos; She appears to have had doubts about her Communist belief, and wrote in another poem: &apos;I want to flee. But I have these children. How can I?&apos; In 1930 tragedy struck the family that Mao had left behind. The Communist leadership ordered frontal attacks on cities the Nationalists held. The campaign was a disaster. In Changsha the attackers held ground in the city for nine days, but were then beaten off. Two months later the victorious Nationalist general ordered an anti-Communist purge. Yang Kaihui was arrested, with her elder son, on his eighth birthday. Given a chance to save her life if she denounced her husband, she refused. She was taken to the execution ground and killed. Learning of her death, Mao wrote that &apos;the death of Kaihui cannot be redeemed by a hundred deaths of mine!&apos; Despite his infidelity, he always called her his true love. But that had not led him to try to rescue her and their sons during the battle for Changsha. Later he would show similar lack of scruples in abandoning his third wife, who was badly wounded in the head on the Long March, for his best-known partner, the one-time Shanghai actress, Jiang Qing. She became one of the Gang of Four in the Cultural Revolution, and was imprisoned after Deng Xiaoping took power, dying in 1991, apparently having hanged herself in her bathroom. After his mother&apos;s execution, Anying, the eldest son, was released and the three children were smuggled to Shanghai, where the youngest died of dysentery aged four. The two surviving brothers spent at least part of their time on the streets, scavenging for food and sleeping on pavements. In 1936, after the Red Army had staged the Long March from Jiangxi to northern China, Stalin invited Mao to send his sons to Moscow, following a pattern of getting the children of prominent Chinese under Soviet control. After a delay in Paris waiting for visas, the Mao boys arrived in the Soviet Union and stayed until the 1940s. In a rare letter, their father advised them to study science and &apos;talk less politics&apos;. By this time Anqing&apos;s health was evidently poor. When his elder brother headed back to the Communist base area in China in 1943, he asked the head of the Communist School in Moscow to look after his younger brother. &apos;He is an honest person, only he has hearing ailments and his nerves are wrecked,&apos; he added. After his second son returned to China in 1947, Mao saw little of him, and he was reported to have spent much of his life in mental institutions. Mao met Anying more often, but he was killed in the Korean War in 1950. Mao&apos;s other known offspring, two daughters Li Na and Li Min, have passed quiet lives, living in apartment buildings in Beijing, venerating their father but keeping out of the limelight. Other children born on the Long March were abandoned along the way; a woman turned up a few years ago along the route who claims to be one of the infants left behind by the Chairman. \u00b7 Jonathan Fenby is author of Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the China He Lost (Free Press) Children of Power Josef Stalin The Soviet leader had three children. Vasily was imprisoned after his father&apos;s death for anti-Soviet propaganda and died in 1962. His other son, Yakov, died during the Second World War. His daughter Svetlana, who was 81 in February, fled in 1967 to the US. Benito Mussolini Italy&apos;s fascist Duce had five children. The youngest, Romano, who died in February 2006, was a gifted jazz musician. One of his granddaughters is Alessandra Mussolini, now a far-right MEP. Idi Amin The Ugandan dictator married at least five times and had as many as 43 children. One of his sons, Jaffar Amin, recently called for a commission to investigate his father&apos;s reign. Fidel Castro Cuba&apos;s leader had one child, Fidel Jr, with his first wife and five more with his second. Fidel Jr, now 56, is a nuclear scientist.

In fact, it takes place in Balado, by Kinross. This has been corrected. It will feature a loch, a castle, the Beastie Boys and, its organisers hope, 20,000 &quot;discerning music fans&quot; who like their festivals with &quot;a little more comfort&quot; and can overlook the risk of drizzle. The promoters behind the music festival T in the Park, held in Balado, by Kinross, last week announced they were launching a new festival, called Connect, to take place in Inveraray Castle in Argyll and Bute in September. It followed the launch a few days earlier of Fflam, another new event, scheduled for Swansea in July and featuring Keane, the Manic Street Preachers and Placebo. 30,000 tickets are now on sale. The new events are merely the latest in what has become an increasingly packed festival calendar. Festival-going has been growing sharply in recent years, but this year, say music industry insiders, the demand for tickets and new events is unprecedented. It is estimated that as many as 450 festivals, large and small, will be taking place around the country this summer. T in the Park, already Scotland&apos;s biggest annual music event, has expanded from two days in July to three, with capacity for up to 80,000 fans. When the last 10,000 tickets for the event were released for sale earlier this month, they sold out in 20 minutes. Oxegen, an Irish festival, sold all its 60,000 tickets within an hour and 20 minutes and its promoters said they could have sold out three times over. Today, meanwhile, the organisers of the Glastonbury festival are expected to be granted permission by Mendip district council to extend the capacity from 150,000 to 177,500, the biggest legal attendance it has ever had. The festival has had to introduce a new system of pre-registering for tickets, due to go on sale on April 1, to cope with the unprecedented demand. &quot;There is no doubt about it, festivals are incredibly fashionable at the moment,&quot; says Neil Greenway, founder of efestivals.co.uk, an independent festival listing website. Yesterday, the site listed 273, though Mr Greenway says a further 50 are currently being added. &quot;We only list the ones we get to hear about, and each year more and more events are getting in touch with us. There is a definite growth in the number of events.&quot; &quot;It is a total boom time for festivals,&quot; agrees Paul Stokes, news editor of the NME. &quot;They are as much a part of the summer now [for young people] as going on a Club 18-30 holiday.&quot; How does he explain the surge in demand? &quot;The British music scene at the moment is incredibly healthy, and the appetite for it is massive. Five years ago, going to gigs was seen as a bit of a minority interest. Now bands can sell out arenas after one album. And if you go to a festival, you can see your entire record collection in one weekend.&quot; John Curd, the promoter behind Fflam, says he had been wanting to get involved in the festival scene for some time, but found the market &quot;chock-a-block&quot;. &quot;Everywhere around the country was already covered. I was looking around the south coast, but always in my mind was the thought, you&apos;re crazy, it is already so crowded for festivals. Then we realised that the one place where there was no major festival was Wales.&quot; He hopes to build attendance up to 50,000, &quot;a nice workable capacity&quot;. Even away from the big rock gigs, there is a boom in smaller events. All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties, the line-up of which is &quot;curated&quot; each year by a different artist, has for the past seven years been held at a small holiday camp in East Sussex. This summer it is moving to a Butlins site, to double its capacity to 6,000. Last year, Simon Taffe sold his house in order to fund a new event called End of the Road, held in Dorset in September and already much raved about by aficionados. &quot;There are a lot of big events, but I felt there weren&apos;t really that many small festivals at the time that had quality and some really good bands. That was it, really.&quot; He feels a lot of festivals will have folded in a few years&apos; time. &quot;I think we are overpopulated. I know it has become a recent trend, but you get so many festivals with the same line-up.&quot; Aside from the very big events, he says, only those offering something quite distinct will survive. Mr Stokes agrees that the trend will inevitably fade, though perhaps not for some time. &quot;It is like all music fashions. Look at the superclubs that were hugely popular 10 years ago. Now they are completely gone. At the moment, going to a festival, spending a weekend in the rain watching a bunch of guitar bands, seems amazing, but whether that will always be the case, we will have to wait and see.&quot; One weekend&apos;s parties Some of the festival events scheduled for the weekend of July 6-8 Roskilde, Roskilde, Denmark After Glastonbury, the biggest music festival in Europe, established in 1971.

The funds - almost 40% more than was spent on Tibet&apos;s infrastructure in the past decade - were hailed as a sign of the central government&apos;s commitment to raising the living standards of poor Himalayan communities. But Tibetan rights groups fear the cash will be used to cement the region&apos;s economic dependence on Beijing and extract the raw materials needed to fuel China&apos;s economic expansion. The investment will be spent on 180 projects, including the construction of an airport at Ngari, at an altitude of 4,334 metres (14,220ft). Rail links will also be improved. The Golmud-Lhasa line, which opened last year, will be extended 170 miles to Shigatse, Tibet&apos;s second-largest city. Although funds have flowed into Tibet in recent years, critics say most end up in the hands of Han Chinese migrants. The regional government&apos;s vice-chairman, Hao Peng, was quoted as saying that the investment would be tilted towards herding regions &quot;so farmers and herders and the grassroots population will fully enjoy the fruits of reform and development&quot;. The money would be used to connect 80% of Tibet&apos;s villages by road, provide safe drinking water for the 2.76 million people and pay for the education of all children. No breakdown was provided, however, raising concerns that most of the money will pay for hydroelectric dams and mineral mining.

Indeed, the photography exhibition The World of Beer: An International Language follows a survey by international marketing analysts AC Nielsen that found that beer is the world&apos;s favourite beverage, followed by soft drinks, then wine. Sales are surging, especially in countries such as China and Russia, where supplies were restricted for decades. China By the end of the decade, China is expected to overtake the US as the world&apos;s biggest producer of beer. Consumption grew by 88% between 1995 and 2000. Since the liberalisation of the economy, global brewers have descended on this vast market and either built new plants or taken stakes in existing ones. Anheuser-Busch, America&apos;s biggest brewer, has a 30% stake in China&apos;s oldest and best-known producer, Tsingtao (&quot;ching-tow&quot;). Germans built the brewery in 1903 and also planted hops in the area; China today is the third biggest hop- producing country in the world. It is thought there are some 850 breweries in China and more in the pipeline as the likes of Carlsberg, Foster&apos;s, Guinness, Heineken and Scottish &amp; Newcastle muscle in. These global brewers are concentrating on urban areas, where 70% of the population is under 35: young people consider beer to be a sign of western sophistication. With the exception of Guinness, global brewers concentrate on pale lagers with little bitterness and with rice added as a cheap adjunct to barley malt. Tsingtao is widely exported, as is Swan Lager from Shanghai. Czech Republic Bohemia, a region of the modern Czech Republic, has two claims to beery fame. The Czechs drink more beer per head than even the neighbouring Germans (293 pints or 166 litres a year compared with 253 pints/144 litres in Germany: the Brits are eighth in the bibulous Premier League), and the first golden lager beer was created in the region. In 1842, the new Burghers&apos; or Citizens&apos; Brewery in Pilsen produced beer made by the cold maturation system - known as lager, from the German for store place - developed in Bavaria. Bavarian lagers were dark while the beer from Pilsen was an enticing pale gold and took the world by storm. Soon brewers throughout the world were reproducing the new style dubbed Pilsner, Pilsener or just Pils for short. In a bid to maintain its claim to the origins of the style, the Burghers&apos; Brewery changed its name to Pilsner Urquell, which means Original Source Pilsner. It has a toasted malt and pungent hop character. The quality of Czech beer was legendary but it was rarely drunk by westerners during the cold war. The communists maintained some 70 breweries but global brewers rushed to pick up cheap, privatised companies as soon as they could. SABMiller owns Pilsner Urquell, Gambrinus and Kozel, while InBev has bought Prague Breweries, whose best-known brand is Staropramen (Old Spring). The superb Budweiser Budvar is another widely exported Czech beer. It has a rich toasted malt, vanilla and spritzy hop character and is still state-owned: the government wants to keep it out of the clutches of its American namesake. The United States The country is currently enjoying a revolution in craft brewing with more than 1,300 &quot;micro&quot; breweries. Their sales grew by 16% last year and they now enjoy a market share of more than 10%. Many of these &quot;micros&quot; are extremely big by British standards: Sierra Nevada in Chico, California, for example, produces 800,000 barrels a year. Its Pale Ale and India Pale Ale are sold in Britain. Prohibition in the 1920s and 30s destroyed a brewing industry with a rich heritage of British and German-style beers. Only a handful of giants, led by Anheuser-Busch with Budweiser, saturated the vast market afterwards with thin and insipid interpretations of lager. The label on a bottle of Bud, for example, announces it is brewed from the finest rice, barley malt and hops. Rice is tasteless and sums up the beer. Other giant breweries use large amounts of cheap corn. In 1965, a beer aficionado named Fritz Maytag bought the ailing Anchor Steam Brewery in San Francisco and fired the first shots in the second American revolution. The success of his beers encouraged others to open small commercial plants. Some were enthusiastic followers of the Campaign for Real Ale in Britain; others of German descent have fashioned lagers of such quality they should bring a blush to Budweiser&apos;s cheeks. Today the likes of Brooklyn Brewery in New York City, Pike and Redhook in Seattle, Rogue in Newport, Oregon, and Samuel Adams in Boston are a power in the land. And Goose Island IPA from Chicago, on sale in Britain, may just be the best beer in the world. India While some Indian states ban alcohol, the country&apos;s indigenous breweries range from the far north in the Simla hills to Bangalore and Hyderabad in the south. The main brewing groups are Mohan Meakin and United Breweries. Mohan Meakin was India&apos;s first commercial brewery, established in the 1820s by an Englishman, Edward Dyer. Its main brands today are Lion and Golden Eagle lagers. United Breweries, another major producer, is best known for Kingfisher, brewed under licence in England and the mainstay of many Indian restaurants. Cobra Lager is nominally based in Bangalore but the brand was founded in England in 1989 by a Cambridge graduate, Karan Bilimoria, and is brewed in Bedford by Charles Wells. All Indian lagers tend to be malty and sweet with little hop character. India&apos;s main claim to bibulous fame is the style known as India Pale Ale, the beer that refreshed the Raj. It was first brewed in London at the end of the 18th century but was seized on by big brewers such as Bass in Burton-on-Trent who were looking for new markets. The style was heavy in alcohol and hops to help withstand a three-month sea journey to Bombay and Calcutta. By the end of the 19th century, IPA was replaced in India by German brewers with their lager technology. South America A great brewing continent. Bavaria of Colombia, along with Modelo and Moctezuma in Mexico and Polar in Venezuela are among the world&apos;s biggest producers, while Ambev of Brazil has merged with Interbrew of Belgium to form the undisputed world&apos;s number one, InBev. The Spanish built breweries in the lands they conquered, though the modern influence is German and lager-style beers abound. But long before the Europeans arrived, Aztecs and Mayans made beers - some rudimentary, some surprisingly sophisticated - using corn. A black beer called Xingu, made commercially in Brazil and exported to the US, is based on an ancient style made in the Upper Amazon. In Mexico another European influence can be seen in such beers as Dos Equis and Negra Modelo, dark lagers based on a style known as &quot;Austrian red&quot;. They reflect the period when Mexico was part of the Austrian empire and are brewed with dark malts that give them a fine chocolate, roast and spicy character.

To prove the point, he found a cat and swung it. The artist claims that the animal was already dead when he made the 45-minute performance video, which shows feline entrails being spattered across the walls. But the piece established Zhen as the rising star of the new generation of Chinese artists whose work now features in The Real Thing, an exhibition at Tate Liverpool that is the most comprehensive show of contemporary Chinese art ever staged in this country. The Liverpool show opens at the same time that a group of Young British Artists make their first appearance in China. Aftershock: Contemporary British Art 1990-2006 brings items such as Tracey Emin&apos;s bed and the Chapman Brothers&apos; Stephen Hawking statue to the Capital Museum in Beijing. But while these pieces have a retrospective feel, China arguably has the most vital, imaginative and uncontainable art scene in the world today. Xu Zhen and his peers represent a new wave of firebrands set to make the Tate Liverpool show go off, quite literally, with a bang. Tomorrow evening, the exhibition launches with an explosive piece by the Yangjiang Group entitled If I Knew the Danger Ahead I&apos;d Have Stayed Well Clear. The work takes the form of a massive firework battle worth \u00a350,000. If the YBAs are set to be supplanted by YCAs in terms of talent and notoriety, Xu Zhen is arguably the Chinese Damien Hirst. In June 2006 he organised a warehouse show of 30 young artists in Shanghai, of which the centrepiece was a video of a panda being masturbated for artificial insemination. The show was forced to close on its opening night. It is, however, now quite difficult to provoke the authorities into closing an exhibition, as the Chinese government seeks to co-opt contemporary art to advertise the productivity and tolerance of the new China. In 2006, the Shanghai Biennale became the first major state-sponsored exhibition of contemporary art - even the fringe show, entitled Fuck Off, was left to run unimpeded. The Beijing exhibition of Young British Artists is another example of this eagerness to embrace international influences. The U-turn in the official attitude can be gauged by the fate of Beijing&apos;s avant-garde in the wake of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989, when Beijing&apos;s radical artists relocated to an area beyond the city&apos;s third ring road, known as the East Village. With no money or conventional outlets for their work, the artists began to conduct increasingly extreme experiments on themselves. One, Zang Huan, covered himself in fish paste and honey and sat for several hours in a public toilet in 100-degree heat. The piece - a comment on the fate of the poet Ai Qing, who was forced to clean toilets during the Cultural Revolution - provoked the police to raid the East Village and evict its inhabitants. In 2001, the area was bulldozed to make way for a public park. A new artistic community sprang up in the north-east of the city at Dashanzi, centred on a former machine tool plant known as Factory 798. This time, the government sanctioned the area as a cultural quarter, opening up a flood of international investment. Today, Dashanzi is a hub of international galleries, plush apartments and restaurants, with few practising artists left. The official acceptance of the avant garde is a paradox for Chinese artists. Beijing-based critic and curator Pi Li identifies the emergence of &quot;a kind of official, harmless contemporary art&quot; which leaves artists in danger of losing their identity. &quot;Their position had been the underground. Now they are widely shown and can sell their work very successfully. This has not brought about a good situation for Chinese art; on the contrary, it made the art lose its energy.&quot; Works by Chinese artists have recently changed hands for as much as $1.5m - the amount paid recently by Charles Saatchi for a painting by Zhang Xiaogang - but The Real Thing&apos;s curator, Simon Groom, hopes the exhibition will re-establish Chinese art&apos;s radical edge. He has taken the bold, possibly even foolhardy, step of inviting Xu Zhen to collaborate in the selection process. &quot;Some of his initial suggestions were a little unworkable,&quot; Groom says. &quot;He proposed that we kidnap a drunk, lock him in the gallery and witness his reactions when he wakes up.&quot; Zhen also suggested handing out knives to exhibition visitors. One piece that did make the display is the tip of Mount Everest, lopped off by the artist during an expedition to the mountain and mounted in a glass case. The Liverpool show also features a mammoth engineering project by Ai Weiwei, now China&apos;s best-known artist. Ai Weiwei recently collaborated with architects Herzog and de Meuron on the innovative &quot;bird&apos;s nest&quot; design of Beijing&apos;s Olympic Stadium. For Liverpool, he has created a soaring, illuminated spiral floating outside the Tate in the Albert Dock. &quot;It&apos;s the kind of piece that could only be realised in China, where material and labour costs are low,&quot; says Groom. &quot;But you cannot underestimate the speed of change in China. Young Chinese artists are less interested in politics than their own dreams and desires. That has never happened in China before, where art had always been a response to the state.&quot; Groom still doesn&apos;t know if Zhen plans to attend. &quot;In some ways, I&apos;m rather hoping he doesn&apos;t. He&apos;s more likely to show up in disguise, or try to sabotage the show in some way. He might even try to close it down.&quot; That could be seen as the ultimate irony - once, the Chinese authorities used to shut down exhibitions. These days, the artists do it themselves.

It is snagged on a twig above a Chinese stream that&apos;s choked with rubbish from around the world. Argos and Wal-Mart logos are visible in the fetid water and along banks that are strewn with plastic bags. There is even a green and white Help The Aged carrier with a UK website address on it. Here in Mai, a village in Guangdong Province, southern China, a community of recyclers ekes out a living from items considered so worthless in the west that they are given away free and quickly discarded. Carrier bags and bottles are shipped here from London, Rotterdam, Hong Kong and cities within China for chopping, melting and remoulding into pellets. Like many jobs outsourced to China, it&apos;s dirty, smelly, labour-intensive and poorly paid. There is so much rubbish to be recycled that parts of the village look like a dump. &quot;The river is foul - we can smell it from our classrooms,&quot; says Wang Yanxia, a student at a local middle school. &quot;When it rains, the water floods on to the path and the stench is everywhere.&quot; Villagers may not have heard of Tesco, but the British high street giant has an all too visible presence. One factory has even decorated its front gates with huge plastic banners advertising a Tesco mobile phone offer. If China is the end of the line for the plastic bag, it is also the beginning. Most of the carrier bags used in Britain are made in Chinese factories just a few hours&apos; drive from Mai. From there, they travel halfway around the world, are dished out to British shoppers - and then at least some of them find their way back. The 10,000-mile odyssey between manufacturing and dumping is the story of our age, part economic miracle, part environmental tragedy. In the space of just 20 years, the fishing village of Shenzhen, in the south of China close to Hong Kong, has become an industrial powerhouse with a population of more than eight million and a container port that handles more cargo than anywhere in the world other than Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. This is where most of the planet&apos;s toys and shoes are made, where Apple outsources much of the production of its iPods, where Wal-Mart fills its shelves. And, naturally, it is also the place that makes billions of the plastic bags that briefly contain all these consumer goods. Shenzhen Delux Arts Plastics is a typical manufacturer, paying its workers about \u00a360 a month to churn out 25,000 plastic carriers every day, a fifth of which go to Europe, some to Next in the UK. It is a simple, three-part process. Bags full of plastic pellets are fed into an induction pipe, melted together at a temperature of 180C and then stretched and wound on to rolls the width of the desired bag. Next, the rolls are fed through a series of cylinder printing presses, each adding a different colour, until the logo and lettering are complete. Finally, an army of workers on the second floor carries out the more labour-intensive process of melting handles on to the bags, checking quality and packing. From start to finish, it takes just five minutes to make a bag. The production cost for each bag is less than four pence, most of which goes on machinery maintenance, management and materials. The primary ingredient is polyfabric polypropylene or other types of plastic, all of them petroleum based and imported directly from Saudi Arabia or from refineries in Singapore and Japan. The industry has a significant carbon footprint. By one estimate, the US alone requires 12 million barrels of oil for the 100 billion bags its consumers use annually. For factory manager Andy Lue, the main concern is that the cost of plastic is rising along with the surge in oil prices. &quot;Our customers would complain if we tried to pass on the extra cost of the materials,&quot; he says. The factory&apos;s main competitive advantage is labour, which accounts for less than a 10th of the production costs of a plastic bag. Wages in Shenzhen are low, and more than three-quarters of the population are migrants, many of them living in huge company dormitories far from their homes and families, and working in dirty, dangerous conditions. Over at the Delux Arts Plastics factory, pay and working conditions are above average for Shenzhen. The manager will not permit us to talk to employees, but we are introduced to &quot;group leader&quot; Chen Ping, a migrant from Guangxi Province, who tells us that the situation has improved enormously since she started working and living in the factory 11 years ago. &quot;The managers realise they must let us eat and sleep better if they want us to work harder.&quot; Chen earns more than double the average factory salary, but her life is far from easy. Because she is a migrant, her two children will have to return to their home town to go to school, which means she will see them for only a few days each year, at spring festival. But she expresses no sense of grievance, even though the consumers who use her Next bags can easily pay more for a single shirt than she earns in a month. &quot;I don&apos;t think it is unfair. We make these bags to be used. They have their own value.&quot; In Britain, plastic bags have long been a cause of irritation, partly due to their visibility. In gutters and branches, the useless, ugly flutter of discarded, brightly coloured plastic taunts us with human fecklessness. They pose problems for wildlife, they block drains. And 17 billion plastic bags a year are handed out to British shoppers. What has made them, suddenly, a very hot issue is the launch of another kind of bag - an item that has already become the status bag of 2007. This is not the reissued Chanel quilt-and-chain classic, the 2.55. It is not even the YSL Downtown, with its modish zips and snap fastenings. And - here&apos;s the thing - it costs \u00a35. There is nothing inherently remarkable about Anya Hindmarch&apos;s I&apos;m Not A Plastic Bag. It is a simple, rope-handled, sturdy cotton shopping bag, albeit one that&apos;s rather beautifully designed, as you would expect from the British Accessory Designer of the Year. What is significant, however, is the reaction to it at every stage, from the sketchbook to the checkout. There have already been queues at the Mayfair store Dover Street Market, when a few preview bags went on sale. At around the same time, the British Retail Consortium has announced a voluntary initiative to reduce the environmental impact of carrier bags by 25% by the end of next year, through the use of alternative materials to make lighter-weight bags, by encouraging reuse, offering and promoting &quot;bags for life&quot;, always asking customers whether they require a bag at all and providing bag recycling points. In other words: reduce, reuse, recycle. Friends of the Earth are quick to point out that, in the context of the scale of the environmental issues with which we are faced, plastic bags, which account for only 0.3% of the domestic waste stream, are not their top priority. Even so, the average person in the UK accepts, on average, five plastic bags a week. The decision as to whether to take a bag is almost a daily one. The supermarket checkout has become, therefore, a frontline of the battle for the environment, even more so because, unlike recycling or composting of domestic waste, it is a decision we take in public, and so reflects not only personal beliefs but what we see to be public norms. It is for this reason that Decline Plastic Bags Wherever Possible is the first action suggested in the book Change The World For A Fiver. &quot;Declining plastic bags is totemic of lots of things,&quot; says Eugenie Harvey, co-founder of the global social-change movement We Are What We Do, which produced the book. &quot;It&apos;s the most visible aspect of a whole set of behaviour around shopping: do you buy environmentally friendly washing powder; do you buy locally produced food?&quot; Trevor Datson, spokesman for Tesco, calls the &quot;Do you need a bag?&quot; moment at the checkout &quot;a constant conversation between us and the customer. I was in the Sandhurst store yesterday and my colleague on the checkout remarked to me how many more people remember to bring in their own bags these days.&quot; Hindmarch&apos;s bag may help. She has a knack for reading the zeitgeist, as illustrated by the phenomenal success of her Be A Bag range, whereby family photos could be made into smart handbags, a concept that in the six years since it was launched has been copied all over the world. The low price of the I&apos;m Not A Plastic Bag - a fiver - was absolutely essential to the project, Hindmarch says. &quot;And so was the point of sale, which had to be the supermarket checkout.&quot; Hindmarch is, however, a businesswoman, and as such knew that too many \u00a35 Anya Hindmarch bags on the market would damage her upmarket brand. (To put the price in perspective, the Elrod, one of the key Anya Hindmarch leather handbag styles for this summer, sells for around \u00a3500.) Production therefore had to be limited, and so the bag had to be made in China if the figures were going to add up. &quot;That was not ideal, of course,&quot; Hindmarch concedes, &quot;but we have been careful about carbon-offsetting the project. Our aim was for the project to break even. None of the retailers involved in the project is making any money from it.&quot; A limited number of bags are currently on sale via Hindmarch&apos;s website, and from April 11, the remaining 20,000 bags will go on sale in Sainsbury&apos;s. The purpose of the Hindmarch bag is, says the designer, &quot;to cast a spotlight on the issue. Just to plant an idea in people&apos;s heads that will make them think before automatically reaching for a bag.&quot; Finding a complete solution to the plastic bag problem is extremely complicated. All the supermarkets profess commitment to the issue, but all have different policies. Tesco produces all-degradable bags and operates a clubcard scheme to reward people for reusing bags, on the principle that &quot;incentive is better than coercion, because if people do something resentfully, they are not making such a deep-seated change&quot;. Waitrose emphasises the &quot;bag for life&quot; scheme, which they were the first retailer to introduce 10 years ago. The Co-op&apos;s bags are degradable; Sainsbury&apos;s are made of one-third recycled material. The opening of the country&apos;s first organic supermarket, Whole Foods Market in Kensington, in June, may further accelerate the process of change - the store, like its Fresh &amp; Wild predecessors, will refund customers 5p for not taking a bag. Friends of the Earth, however, would like to see a government tax on all plastic bags. Degradable and biodegradable bags are &quot;not an environmentally friendly option&quot;, they say, and &quot;will lead to the public becoming increasingly confused as to what they are supposed to do with them. Degradable plastic bags usually can&apos;t be recycled with normal plastic bags, and people may think they can put degradable bags into their compost bins, which they can&apos;t.&quot; Degradable bags are still made from plastic, so placing demands on oil resources. They contain a metal additive to make them degrade and tend to require sunlight to break down. If biodegradable bags end up in landfill, they will eventually produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Paper bags are no better, say Friends of the Earth, because they have less capacity for being reused, and require more energy and resources in manufacture and transport than plastic alternatives. Bags made from recycled plastics, which are then reused or recycled, are considered by many a better option, but recycling points for bags are as yet not widely accessible. In any case, all too often, a promise by municipal government to recycle simply means sending the rubbish to China. In trade terms, it makes an odd kind of sense. Historically, British merchants have always found it easy to fill their ships with goods on the route from China, but all too often they have been stuck with empty cargo holds in the opposite direction. This trade gap is the main reason why English gunboats forced opium on China in the 19th century. Today, however, the answer is not drugs, but garbage. China exports almost \u00a312.6 billion-worth of manufactured goods and other products to the UK each year. In return, the UK sends back 1.9 million tonnes of rubbish, for the simple reason that it&apos;s cheaper than dumping it at a UK landfill site. Because the ships are almost empty on their way back to China, the cargo costs are tiny - it&apos;s cheaper to send a container of waste from London to Shenzhen than it is to truck it to Manchester. Under EU law, waste cannot be dumped abroad, but shipments for recycling are permitted. This means business for Guangdong Province, which is scattered with Steptoe and Son communities. There are the e-waste centres of Guiyu and Qingyuan, where families make a living from chopping up and melting down toxic plastics and metals from discarded computers, printers and mobile phones. Below them on the waste chain are the recyclers of plastic bags and bottles in Shunde and Heshan. Until recently, the most notorious of these was in Nanhai, a town just outside Guangzhou, where the streets were once piled high with rubbish and the streams thick with trash and pollution. Last month, however, after a series of embarrassing reports in the British media, the government was shamed into shutting down the entire area and banning imports of foreign garbage. Today, the streets of Nanhai are swept clean and the small recycling sheds are shuttered up. For many locals, however, this sudden concern about the environment is a financial disaster. &quot;We were ordered to close last month because some foreign rubbish contained toxins,&quot; says Ding Chunming, who used to process bottles and bags. &quot;It&apos;s a terrible blow because we only started this business last year. We get no compensation. All we can do is wait and hope the government allows us to restart business.&quot; But the industry has learned how to bypass laws and regulations. Many Nanhai refugees simply moved their scrapheaps to a new location. Two hours&apos; drive away, we found a new recycling centre under construction in Shijing village. The concrete is still wet on the floor and many of the sheds are only half complete, but the task of buying, selling and sorting rubbish is already in full flow. The operation is remarkably specialised. There are sections just for discarded hotel welcome mats, the bases of revolving chairs, black buckets and the lids of shampoo bottles. A local businesswoman, who gave her name only as Ms Liang, was terrified that another critical news report would force her to relocate again. &quot;We have only just got here from Nanhai,&quot; she says. &quot;I have never dealt with foreign waste. I can&apos;t do it now and I won&apos;t do it in the future.&quot; But for others the trade in foreign waste is too lucrative to disappear quickly. We were approached by a scrap dealer who asked if we had any rubbish to sell. He was after PVC, but he put us in touch with a factory in Shenzhen that said it could deal with carrier bags despite the ban. &quot;It can be done as long as the plastic is well enough packaged to get through customs,&quot; says the owner. &quot;You should ship them to Hong Kong and we will deal with them from there. If the bags are sorted by colour, we can pay you as much as $100 a tonne.&quot; Farther away from the media spotlight and the scrutiny of environment officials, many factories are still reprocessing British carrier bags and other rubbish despite the government&apos;s ban. Another hour&apos;s drive away is Shunde, where European trash is baled up on the roadside. Much of it is from the UK - Tesco milk cartons, Walkers crisp packets, Snickers wrappers and empty packets of Bisto gravy and Persil powder - but there are also bales containing the packaging for Dutch confectionery and Italian nappies. The village of Mai is close by. Running through the community is a street of recycling firms, outside each of which stands a blackboard detailing the type, colour and quality of the plastic they deal in. Some are no bigger than a shed in which migrant workers sift by hand through hundreds of thousands of tiny plastic pellets, picking out discoloured flecks and bits of fluff. Mai Weibo buys semi-processed bags for 9,000 yuan a tonne (around \u00a3600) and, after painstakingly cleaning up the contents, sells the plastic on for 10,500 yuan - &quot;We don&apos;t make much of a profit.&quot; The recycled plastic is not of sufficiently high quality to be used a second time for UK bags, so instead much of it is turned into red, white and blue plastic sheets, which are used for building site coverings and holdalls. Many locals believe the pollution is ruining their health. A local doctor says the village suffers from an unusually high incidence of respiratory diseases. &quot;Perhaps it was the pollution or perhaps it was because everyone smokes cigarettes,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a sensitive topic. Of course we want a garden-like environment, but people here have to make a living.&quot; Others say they have other priorities. &quot;I don&apos;t care about the environment,&quot; says one migrant labourer. &quot;I only want to make money. If your stomach isn&apos;t full, how can you worry about health?&quot; Everyone condemns as an eyesore the ditches full of carrier bags, but nobody seems to take responsibility for clearing up the mess. In fact, the main concern of local businessmen and government officials is to avoid scrutiny. &quot;The government has banned imported waste because of the media attention,&quot; says one local factory manager, whose warehouse includes giant baskets full of rubbish from the UK. &quot;The Nanhai recycling business has been shut down. This area doesn&apos;t want to suffer the same fate because it would hurt the government&apos;s income.&quot; Britain&apos;s stance is also equivocal: dumping waste overseas is forbidden, but sending it to another country for recycling is acceptable. When told of the foul conditions at Mai, an official at the UK consulate in Guangzhou says that individual companies have to take action. &quot;It is the responsibility of producers to make sure that waste is dealt with properly at all stages of the chain.&quot; Foreign governments have started to take action specifically on plastic carriers, some going much further than Britain&apos;s retailers and their aim for a voluntary 25% reduction in bag use by 2008. Ireland, for example, introduced a 15p &quot;plastax&quot; on carrier bags way back in 2002, which has subsequently led to a 90% reduction in use. Australia has launched a &quot;Say No To Carrier Bags&quot; campaign. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, the government has obliged supermarkets to charge for bags at least two days a week. Italy is promoting the use of biodegradable bags. In France, reusable plastic bags - which are heavier, easier to recycle and less likely to blow away - now account for more than half of the \u00a4770m market. Inevitably, however, even those eco-bags are made in Shenzhen. The main producer is the Richall Group, which must be one of the world&apos;s fastest-growing companies. Launched in 2003 with starting capital of just \u00a31,000, last year it recorded sales of more than \u00a33m, and this year that figure is expected to triple, thanks to business from Sainsbury&apos;s, Unilever, Disney, Budweiser and Nestl\u00e9, all of whom are looking towards reusable bags. Richall&apos;s president, Liu Tianyan, says attitudes are changing but, more importantly, so are materials. &quot;We&apos;re never going to get rid of plastic bags completely, because in some cases, such as food wrappings, there is no good substitute. But in the case of shopping bags, I believe the flimsy plastic can be completely replaced.&quot; Not everyone thinks that would be a good thing. Peter Woodall, communications manager for the Carrier Bag Consortium, says, &quot;It&apos;s important to forget the emotion and look at the science. We are not filling our landfill with plastic bags. That is simply a myth. When real science is taken into account, the best environmental choice is plastic. Life-cycle analysis shows that if you use a conventional bag four times and then recycle it, that is better than using a &apos;bag for life&apos;.&quot; Environmental campaigners, meanwhile, believe the only solution is to make rich countries deal with their waste locally. &quot;That&apos;s the only way to make the whole community feel the impact,&quot; says Kevin May at Greenpeace&apos;s office in Beijing. &quot;If you can easily dump waste overseas, then there is no motive for having a waste-reduction programme at home. The argument that developing nations need recycled resources from wealthy nations is only partly true. The environmental costs are too high. Just look at the filthy water and polluted air of China. If we can stop the waste trade, I am sure it will lead to more sustainable development around the world.&quot; The apparent intractability of the plastic bag problem is all the more remarkable considering that our dependency on them is a recent phenomenon. Polythene was not even invented until the 30s, and plastic bags did not become common in supermarkets until the 70s. The idea that we can&apos;t live without them is a very modern one.", "tags": ["Environment", "China", "Waste", "World news", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-03-31T22:56:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/apr/01/art", "sentences": ["In videos, you enter monstrously crammed flats in Shanghai and highrises on the Pearl River delta."], "title": "Art review: The Real Thing: Contemporary art from China", "article": "The Real Thing: Contemporary art from ChinaTate Liverpool, to 10 June The Chandelier shivers and twinkles on the surface of the Mersey - four tons of crystal rising up in a towering spiral. It is a stunning vision: a great twisting column of light emerging from the waves, as it seems, or perhaps about to capsize and go under. The shape of this tower on its floating platform might look familiar. It is, or would have been, one of the great wonders of the world. Vladimir Tatlin&apos;s Monument to the Third International - two interlocking spirals of glass and steel designed to stand almost twice as high as the Eiffel Tower - was intended as a spectacular symbol of Soviet progress. It was never built, of course, and remains for artists to this day the spectacular symbol of an avant-garde lost in the 1920s. This fragile construction in Liverpool is therefore a homage - holding a candle, as it were, to the original - but also a site-specific revival. I guess by night it will look almost like a nautical hallucination. Working Progress is the ambiguous title of this work by China&apos;s most famous living artist, Ai Weiwei. Most famous, that is, in the closed quarters of the art world. For it is more than likely that you have never heard of Ai Weiwei despite the fact that contemporary Chinese art is so big that art insiders are already talking of burn-out. China was the hit of the Venice Biennale in 1999. There have been shows round the world from New York to Florence ever since and the resale market is so high that Sotheby&apos;s held a special auction last year that surpassed all expectations. Chinese artists once reduced to eating scavenged frogs - truly, in one case - have now become millionaires and yet the whole thing has more or less bypassed the gallery-going British public. Which is one reason why Tate Liverpool must be congratulated on this full-scale museum show, another being that it is in many ways terrific. Anyone who imagines that Chinese art is all a blaze of ironic red and furious indictments of Mao would have been right about 10 years ago. But there are young Chinese curators involved in this selection, making it intensely up-to-the-minute. It is a reflection of the post-Cynical Realism generation, as it was known; what is expressed now comes pretty much straight. Arriving, you step right on to the factory floor of what seems to be a deserted steelworks. The massive engines are becalmed, the rollers motionless and the only trace of live sparks are the burns in the carpet. The scale is immense, inhuman, except for tiny lockers that would hardly take more than a lunchbox. The walls are scrawled with numbers but there&apos;s also an unnerving spatter of what could be blood. Zhuang Hui, the artist, once worked in this very place, a place where one of his predecessors lost his legs in a terrible accident. Even if you didn&apos;t know this, the human absence is palpable and intimations of mortality hang in the heavy industrial fug. When Zhuang Hui first showed the installation in China, people couldn&apos;t understand how he got hold of the machinery. But he hadn&apos;t. Everything you see was made of polystyrene, with the help of the factory workers themselves: a monument to the unbearable lightness of being. The sense of immediacy is exhilarating and continues throughout the show. You walk the streets of Beijing with an artist who draws a line of string behind him wherever he goes, baffling bystanders who nonetheless make no effort to cut the wretched line even when it gets in their way. In videos, you enter monstrously crammed flats in Shanghai and highrises on the Pearl River delta. Old men with enormous brushes paint calligraphic scrolls on the ground. Provincial art classes are evoked. In Yang Fudong&apos;s searing multi-screen projection, wild dogs fight over the bones of a dead cow in the shadow of a ruined fortress. It puts you on the spot in ferocious close-up, yet it still feels unimaginably strange and remote. What&apos;s here would be of moment anywhere in the world, in terms of originality and skill, yet it does feel peculiarly of its place. The artist who walked the country in manacles, in the footsteps of colonial cartographers, collects tiny fragments of discarded metal wherever he goes to make a poignant toy train. The labourers building the concentric ringroads of Beijing, each of which seems to be the last and is then replaced with another and another, are filmed trying to make dwellings out of the reclaimed bricks of villages destroyed in the process. This vicious circle - the bricks are beginning to run out, the ring roads are proliferating: where will the workers live? - is in some ways emblematic of this show. For if any generalisation could possibly be made about a nation so inconceivably populous, it is that its contemporary art is against the official line on Chinese progress. The government may want to tear down the old and build the new at proleptic speed and mass but these artists keep pointing out the lost dreams and the human cost. And we need to see what they make, to hear what they say. One artist summarises international attitudes very acutely in the catalogue. &apos;How do we make others understand,&apos; he asks, &apos;that China is not a concept?&apos; The best answer in this show is also the most affecting exhibit - Cao Fei&apos;s beautiful film set in the Guangdong Osram factory. In the first part the delicate bulbs are machine-blown and flooded with fluorescence to a score of unearthly music. Then the workers are shown hunched over the sharp filaments and fuses, bringing light to the world in nocturnal shifts. It is a stunning piece of art, reminiscent of Tatlin in some respects - fluorescent tubes radiating like bright geometry behind the stackers; ballet dancers and musicians wandering through like strange angels: the dreams of the workers. And finally the camera comes to rest upon each face, one after another, making a precious portrait of each person, drawing them out of the machinery and into the light. Vox pop: Is Liverpool taken with contemporary Chinese art? Ames Hawkins39, business analystThere was more variety than I was expecting, and much more humour. I like the video about the lightbulb factory. It was about as emotionally engaging as you can get from a lightbulb factory. John Treacher24, decoratorI got really sucked in by the art. The Everest piece was brilliant and really funny, and I liked the industrial stuff - the big chunks of metal and big old tools and machines. Peggy Wong34, tourist from Hong KongI hadn&apos;t seen any of the artists before, and I don&apos;t usually like modern art. I thought it would be quite pretentious but this is more real. It&apos;s expressing something in a way I understand. Alan Berry25, fine art studentI liked the show as a whole but a lot of it was underwhelming.

We meant to say primary schools. This has been corrected.  It is half past three and a dozen little boys in long shorts, blue check shirts and ties are sitting around tables in a London schoolroom that is decked out with typical infant-class paraphernalia - alphabet charts, winter-themed paintings, posters of healthy foodstuffs. On the teacher&apos;s instruction, the four-year-olds close their eyes, then open them on command to describe a scene drawn on the back of a paper plate. The picture is unremarkable - a stick figure dancing around to a stereo - but the words cheerfully shouted by the pupils are something of a shock in the middle of Kensington: every one of the boys calls out &quot;My mother is listening to music!&quot; in perfect Chinese. The scene, at Hawkesdown House prep school, is increasingly common in classrooms around the country and not just in the sort of establishment where the children wear ties, caps and matching gabardines. In the most deprived inner-city boroughs and in rural areas where Chinese faces are few and far between, as well as in the cloisters of Eton and other top private schools, Mandarin is taking off. Katharine Carruthers, Chinese networks coordinator for the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, says interest has gone &quot;from busy last academic year to manic. It is terribly exciting&quot;. It is not only school-age children who are getting caught up in the Mandarin rush. A handful of British parents are following the example of zealous New Yorkers and hiring Mandarin-speaking nannies to give their infants the ultimate head start. At the other end of the scale, the language, with its chime bar-like patterns of tones and beautiful but, to westerners, initially incomprehensible script, is being wrestled with in universities and adult learning centres as never before. Magdalena Corso, collecting her son Oliver, four, from Hawkesdown House after his Chinese lesson, says she first sent him to a weekend Chinese club at three, and plans to do the same with her two younger children. &quot;Just looking at how the world is changing, the economic impact of China in the future, you can&apos;t start early enough with children. And he loves it: it&apos;s his secret world that I can&apos;t understand,&quot; she says. Is the current cult of Mandarin merely a passing fashion, or might the subject reinvigorate language learning in this country, as some people predict? Can a nation that struggles to ask for &quot;un verre de vin rouge&quot; really master a language that requires a knowledge of 2,500 characters just for daily use? The trouble with trying to gauge the growth of the official Chinese language in the UK is that our new-found interest has rather caught the government unawares, and few accurate figures exist on who is learning it and where. A survey of schools conducted last autumn by CiLT, the national centre for languages, found that out of the 1,500 secondary schools that responded, 38 - approaching 2.5% - were teaching Chinese to pupils aged 14 to 16. Most respondents said the subject had been introduced in the past three years, suggesting that things are changing fast. Indeed the latest department for education and skills estimate is that more than 80 secondaries and a small number of primaries are now offering Mandarin. Another CiLT survey found that part of the pressure to learn Chinese is coming from employers: global companies are keen that schools should give up on French and German and teach Mandarin, Spanish and Arabic instead. And businesses want graduates who understand not only the language, but the culture, as they attempt to penetrate Chinese markets. The Chinese government is also doing its bit to promote Mandarin. New Confucius Institutes - modelled on the Goethe Institute, British Council and Academie Fran\u00e7aise - are springing up worldwide to support the teaching of Chinese language and culture, with six now open or in the pipeline in Britain, including one based within London University&apos;s School of Oriental and African Studies. Around the world, an estimated 30 million non-native speakers are now believed to be learning Mandarin. Theresa Tinsley of CiLT suggests British A-level students, in particular, may be attracted by &quot;the lure of the new&quot; - the chance to study a subject they have not covered at GCSE and do not view with weary familiarity. The chance to combine some language learning with Chinese studies or even other subjects also appeals to some pupils, she adds: one Dudley secondary school has tempted students to sign up for Mandarin and business studies after they showed little enthusiasm for French. The possibility, too, of trips to China, including growing numbers of language immersion courses part-funded by the British Council, are also a more attractive option for many than the traditional school exchange spent trailing a mismatched penfriend around Lille or Cologne. Lincoln Christ&apos;s Hospital school, a specialist language college in Lincoln, benefits from strong links with a school in Tangshan, a city south of Beijing. Nick Brown, its head of languages and a passionate advocate of the opportunities provided by language learning for those who may have few advantages in life, says that the school now offers Mandarin to all pupils other than year sevens (who take a modern European language on entry to the school). Around 40 are currently studying the subject, either in curriculum lessons, at lunchtime or after school. In an attic classroom adorned with posters showing Mandarin characters, A-level students Jenny Haire, Josh Porter and Sarah Gilbert work their way through a translation passage describing the rush among foreigners to learn Chinese in China. All have been to China and have tried speaking the language there - an experience which convinced them they could just about manage day to day, though Josh admits: &quot;We got laughed at a bit the first time we went, but I don&apos;t think it was mean laughing.&quot; Sarah, whose interest in all things Chinese was inspired by her grandfather&apos;s business travels in the region and who will herself visit Shanghai in September on a highly coveted year-long British Council scholarship, insists that, despite the tones and characters, she finds Mandarin easier than Spanish. &quot;You don&apos;t learn tenses because you just attach time words like tomorrow or yesterday and the verb stays the same.&quot; Jenny, opening her file to show a page of her immaculately formed Chinese characters, admits that she enjoys writing best but, like many English speakers, struggles with the four tones, the use of which is frequently crucial to meaning. The school, lucky enough to have a resident Chinese teacher, Qinmei Chen, proudly points to its first Mandarin GCSE grade A*, gained last year by a 16-year-old pupil. For parents who are keen that their children have the chance to learn Mandarin, but who have no easy access to lessons for them, there is always the Muzzy option, from the BBC. The DVD-based language-learning programme for children features a friendly, clock-eating green monster who descends on the imaginary kingdom of Gondoland. The cartoon has so far been available only in European languages, but the new Mandarin version has proved highly popular in America and is shortly to go on sale here. The Guardian asked two children - Lara Slyce, eight, and Ailis Halligan, six - to try out the Muzzy Mandarin course. Both had previously watched Muzzy in French and were a little baffled initially to hear the same characters suddenly spouting Mandarin, but both quickly got into the swing of things, jumping up and down to try to identify Chinese words and phrases. Despite the growing enthusiasm for Mandarin in this country, however, significant barriers remain. There are too many institutions chasing, at present, too few teachers, and teaching materials remain far less developed than for other languages. In many state schools, languages have been wound down to little more than a token presence on the curriculum and it will take great efforts and financial commitment to restart them. Those who are already converted, though, are basking in the spotlight that is suddenly shining on their subject. Katharine Carruthers says that many state primary schools now band together to share Mandarin teachers, who she says have a &quot;missionary zeal&quot; for their subject. &quot;I would be thrilled to bits if it became a core language in the UK, but it should certainly be taught as a main curriculum subject,&quot; she says. &quot;I feel the anecdotal evidence and the level of interest mean it is definitely here to stay.&quot;", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2007-04-02T10:11:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/apr/02/inthealphabet", "sentences": ["Rather than finishing school, these days young men in the countryside board a train to the bright lights of Shanghai, Shenzhen or Chongqing to work in a factory or on a building site, earning wages that far outstrip the few hundred dollars a year typical for farming families."], "title": "In the alphabet soup", "article": "China, as we are reminded every five minutes or so, is this century&apos;s emerging economic and political superpower. As well as constant double-digit economic growth, the country produces two million graduates a year, a statistic Gordon Brown has trotted out somewhat gloomily at regular intervals since visiting the country for the first time in 2005. And yet, the state-run China Daily reports today, overall literacy levels in the country are actually getting worse. Between 2000 and 2005 the number of illiterate people in China increased by 30 million, to 116 million. The primary reason for this rise is the growing wealth gap between the population in China&apos;s booming cities, especially those in the east, and the still desperate poverty of the population in many rural areas, where around three-quarters of Chinese people live, with a conspicuous lack of visiting foreign dignitaries. Rather than finishing school, these days young men in the countryside board a train to the bright lights of Shanghai, Shenzhen or Chongqing to work in a factory or on a building site, earning wages that far outstrip the few hundred dollars a year typical for farming families. The China Daily also blames the paradoxical success of previous literacy campaigns, which meant some programmes were dissolved. Either way, it is a curious state of affairs, especially - as the Guardian chronicles today - during a time when millions of people outside China are struggling to tackle Mandarin&apos;s four vocal tones and thousands of characters. That very surfeit of letters must itself affect literacy levels. While you need to master just 26 letters to read English, students of Mandarin have to memorise innumerable characters - the Chinese government&apos;s definition of literacy is being able to remember at least 1,500 of them.", "tags": ["World news"], "publicationDate": "2007-04-02T11:27:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/02/thenailhouseofchongqing", "sentences": ["The couple are not alone - &quot;nail houses&quot; exist elsewhere including one occupied by a tough old woman in a Shanghai street."], "title": "The grassroots are stirring", "article": "The &quot;nailhouse&quot; of Chongqing in China&apos;s Sichuan province stands out in the middle of an excavated building site in a city that is due to contain more than 30 million people when its development is completed. It has become an unlikely symbol of rising popular discontent - a process that has major implications for the authorities in Beijing and may show that while democracy and accountability remain far off, the authoritarian Leninist party that rules the world&apos;s most heavily populated nation is having to take notice of the grassroots. The days when Mao Zedong could blithely state that the people were behind him and whatever new initiative he chose to launch are long gone. For China&apos;s managerially minded leadership of the early 21st century, a delicate deal has been struck between the economic growth needed to keep the show on the road and dealing with the discontent spawned by that growth, from wealth disparities greater than those in the US or Europe to disastrous ecological damage, from huge gaps in health, education and pensions to the gap between the booming coastal cities and the backward interior. The causes of anger are precise, down-to-earth and can turn violent - 20,000 people went on the rampage in Hunan in March after bus fares were increased during the lunar new year holiday. Last week, hundreds of police were called in to deal with demonstrators elsewhere in the province who had just learned that their local Secretary had sold off communal woods on his own account. In each case, one man was reported killed. In Guangxi province, thousands marched to a hospital to protest at heavy metal poisoning of their land. In Zhejiang province, a major demonstration sacked a polluting chemical plant. Though carefully controlled official figures report a decline in &quot;mass actions&quot; (that is by more than 100 people), the relevant ministry admits that there were more than 100,000 land grabs last year by local officials - a major cause of the increasingly violent protests. Last month, partly in response to the crisis, the National People&apos;s Congress passed a law protecting private property. This was expected to be used by farmers and middle-class property owners - and was denounced by some as offering safeguards to people who have acquired land illegally or through their official positions. Yang Wu, the &quot;nail house man&quot; of Chongqing (the term means somebody who refuses to move and so sticks out like a nail), is clear about what he wants - higher compensation for following the example of his neighbours and moving out as well as a guarantee of alternative ground-floor accommodation so that his wife can run her restaurant. His wife, who acts as the family spokesperson, says the law is on their side, particularly since the passing of the property law. This, however, does not come into force until October. The couple are not alone - &quot;nail houses&quot; exist elsewhere including one occupied by a tough old woman in a Shanghai street. The case shows how determined at least some Chinese are to assert their rights and not be short-changed by officials or, in this case, by property developers. This is not a revolt of the kind China has faced in the past. There is no organised opposition, no People&apos;s Liberation Army waiting to march out of its base. But what the case, and the protests across the countryside, do show is that a regime based on control is having considerable difficulty imposing it. President Hu Jintao and the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, are well aware of the challenge, as indicated by the property law and a raft of measures designed to help rural dwellers. Wen&apos;s statement at the NOPC that the environment would be the &quot;fulcrum&quot; of growth also showed that he is sitting up and paying attention. But implementation runs into the nature of the system that props up the regime - apart from anything else, serious improvements will require taking local officials out of the business world which funds their lifestyles. Tellingly, media and websites have been told not to cover the Sichuan &quot;nail house&quot; case. Control remains second nature to the leadership, but the grassroots are stirring.

There is, however, an exhibition in Barcelona jointly organised by the Prado and the National Museum of Art of Catalonia, entitled Still Lifes: From S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n to Goya. A few days ago, as I was wandering around Madrid&apos;s Prado museum, mesmerised by its marvellous Tintoretto exhibition (the first large assembly of his works since 1937), Spain&apos;s Minister of Culture was unveiling the Prado&apos;s \u00a392m extension - in Barcelona. Tate Modern&apos;s annexe, given the go-ahead last week, will not be as far from its parent, a matter of yards away on London&apos;s South Bank. The Louvre in Paris is eschewing annexes for a more profitable enterprise - being paid a fortune to set up a Louvre in Abu Dhabi. There, it will face competition from yet another Guggenheim, the biggest of them all, designed, as is the one in Bilbao, by Frank Gehry. There are also Guggenheims in New York, Venice, Berlin and Las Vegas (inside a huge casino hotel). Paris&apos;s Pompidou Centre is setting up a branch in Shanghai; the Rodin museum is negotiating with S\u00e3o Paolo in Brazil; St Petersburg&apos;s Hermitage is flirting with Rome. This explosion of annexes, extensions and branches, and the proliferation of &quot;brand&quot; museums - already Guggenheim and Tate, soon Louvre, followed by many others - seems, at first, a good thing. It is surely beneficial that more people will be able to see more art in more places. But then it raises the question that troubled me when doing the rounds of Madrid&apos;s art collections last week. I started with the recently extended Thyssen-Bornemisza museum, which has a lot of terrific paintings but also some which occupy their space because they formed part of the Thyssen collection rather than for their artistic excellence. I was not then aware of the coincidental opening of the Barcelona son-of-Prado, but I thought when trying to cope with the original&apos;s immensity that there was too much on display, some of it unimpressive. Yet I read that the reason there is now an outpost in Barcelona is so that paintings which the main Prado has no room for can be seen by the public. Tate Modern, for all its successful special exhibitions, imaginative Turbine Hall installations and attendances well above expectations, has been widely thought disappointing in the content of its permanent exhibition. Where, then, will they find the first-class works for the annexe? The voluminous Guggenheim collection is already being spread thinly over its branches; Abu Dhabi, with all its money, will eventually add to the collection it begins with, but that may take time. In the meantime, will Guggenheim have to rob Venice or Vegas in order to set up in the Emirates? All the world-class museums have huge reserves of art languishing in dim basements and cobwebbed storerooms. There is no question that the Louvre and the Prado could find thousands of paintings to fill several new buildings. But how much of that art will be worth exhibiting? At some stage, a decision must have been taken that those paintings were inferior to ones chosen to be shown to the public. I&apos;m sure mistakes have been made and that, lurking among the rejects, are works of distinction deserving to be seen by the visiting crowds. But I do not believe there are many great but unjustly neglected paintings, only waiting for new extensions to be built so that they can emerge into the light and have their value and their artists&apos; talent recognised. The fact is that there will be too few great, or very good, works of art available to meet the demands of all the new annexes or museums. Either they will palmed off with second-division material, or the &quot;father&quot; museum will have to give up some of its really good stuff so that its offspring can get a decent start in life. You want to see the Mona Lisa? Sure, take a trip to Abu Dhabi. \u00b7 It was once thought of the United States supreme court that, whatever else, it could be counted on to uphold people&apos;s rights to habeas corpus, protected under the US constitution. That was before 9/11, and the flurry of restrictive laws that followed. More than five years after the setting up of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, nearly 400 detainees are still held there, untried, not knowing the allegations against them, denied every legal right that Americans used to cherish, and left virtually wholly abandoned by the courts that were supposed to protect them. On Monday, the supreme court made another contribution to its lamentable post-9/11 record. It refused even to hear the case of 45 Guant\u00e1namo detainees claiming illegal detention and challenging a law that, in effect, took away their rights under habeas corpus. The nine judges are not obliged to hold a full hearing of every case submitted to them, but it was hoped that they would use the opportunity to hear the arguments and make an important ruling on a basic legal and consti- tutional issue - the rights of a detainee. The judges funked it by a 6-3 majority. Respect for the supreme court waned in 2000 when it handed presidential victory to George Bush. In the eyes of anyone concerned with justice, it has declined even further since 2001. Once again, Bush has won, and many believe that he and his outrageous laws have got away with it only because of the pusillanimity of the court. \u00b7 This week Marcel saw Harold Pinter&apos;s The Caretaker, at London&apos;s Tricycle Theatre: &quot;I used to be iffy about Pinter.

A report by the Commons science committee calls on ministers to scrap the proposed ban and accuses the government of basing its opposition to the research on a &quot;deeply flawed&quot; consultation. The committee&apos;s demands - which follow a letter to the prime minister signed by 223 medical charities and patients&apos; groups supporting the research - leave the government increasingly isolated in its intention to prohibit the experiments. Many scientists believe the research will pave the way for new treatments of diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s, Parkinson&apos;s and cystic fibrosis. They want to create animal-human embryos to understand the molecular minutiae behind such conditions. The researchers would pluck a cell from a patient and insert it into a hollowed cow or rabbit egg and stimulate it with a jolt of electricity. The two cells then fuse to make an embryo which is 99.9% human and 0.1% animal. Embryonic stem cells extracted from the embryo could be grown into nerves and other tissues, giving scientists insight into how the disease develops. Under existing laws, the embryos must be destroyed no later than 14 days old and cannot be implanted. Using plentiful animal eggs will allow the researchers to overcome a major stumbling block caused by the shortage of fresh human eggs that would otherwise be needed for the work. The proposed ban has already drawn criticism from scientists, including Sir David King, the government&apos;s chief science adviser, the Human Genetics Commission and the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust. Plans to outlaw the research were revealed in December by the public health minister, Caroline Flint, in a white paper which has become the basis of a wide-ranging overhaul of fertility laws. It recommends a blanket ban on the creation of embryos which are part-animal, part-human, with a provision for some research in the area to be conducted under licence. The Department of Health defended the proposal by citing a public consultation in which many respondents said they were opposed to the research. The committee&apos;s report calls for the proposals to be dropped from the fertility draft bill, due to be published on May 8. It concludes: &quot;We have found the government&apos;s published proposals for future regulation in this area to be unacceptable and potentially harmful to UK science.&quot; At a briefing in London, the committee chairman, Liberal Democrat MP Phil Willis, criticised the public consultation exercise used to defend the ban. The consultation attracted around 300 responses, with 277 opposed to the research, but many came from groups opposed to any research on embryos, he said. The MPs called for permissive legislation, allowing research into human-animal embryos to go ahead under licence after scrutiny by the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. The technique was pioneered by Hui Sheng, a developmental biologist in Shanghai. Scientists at Newcastle University and King&apos;s College London have already applied to the HFEA to create animal-human embryos for stem cell research, but their licences are not expected to be granted until the authority completes its consultation in September. In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Health said: &quot;Whilst we have proposed an initial ban in general terms, we recognise that there may be potential benefits from such research and are certainly not closing the door to it.&quot; How are hybrid and chimeric embryos made? There are three different types. Hybrid embryos are made by fertilising an egg with the sperm of another species, the same technique used to make a mule. For a hybrid to fertilise, the egg and sperm have to come from very closely related species. Chimeric embryos are made by injecting cells or genetic material of one species into the embryo of another. Scientists at Stanford University plan to use this to create a mouse with 10% human brain cells. The third type of embryo is called a cytoplasmic hybrid, created by inserting a cell, or DNA, from one animal into the hollowed-out egg of another species. Scientists in London and Newcastle hope to create these by fusing human cells with cow and rabbit eggs.

It is snagged on a twig above a Chinese stream that is choked with rubbish from around the world. Argos and Wal-Mart logos are visible in the fetid water and along banks strewn with plastic bags. Here in Mai, a village in Guangdong province, southern China, a community of recyclers ekes out a living from items considered so worthless in the West that they are given away and quickly discarded. Carrier bags and bottles are shipped here from London, Rotterdam, Hong Kong and other Chinese cities for chopping, melting and remoulding into pellets. Like many jobs outsourced to China, it is dirty, smelly, labour-intensive and poorly paid. There is so much rubbish to be recycled that parts of the village look like a dump. &quot;The river is foul - we can smell it from our classrooms,&quot; says a student. &quot;When it rains, the water floods on to the path and the stench is everywhere.&quot; If China is the end of the line for the plastic bag, it is also the beginning. Most of the carrier bags used in Britain are made in factories a few hours&apos; drive from Mai. From there they travel halfway around the world, are dished out to British shoppers - and then at least some of them find their way back. The 16,000km odyssey between manufacturing and dumping is the story of our age, part economic miracle, part environmental tragedy. In 20 years the fishing village of Shenzhen, in the south of China close to Hong Kong, has become an industrial powerhouse with a population of more than 8 million and a container port that handles more cargo than anywhere in the world other than Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. This is where most of the world&apos;s toys and shoes are made, where Apple outsources much of the production of its iPods, where Wal-Mart fills its shelves. It is also the place that makes billions of the plastic bags that briefly contain all these consumer goods. Shenzhen Delux Arts Plastics is a typical manufacturer, paying its workers about $120 a month to churn out 25,000 plastic carriers every day, a fifth of which go to Europe. Bags full of plastic pellets are fed into an induction pipe, melted together at a temperature of 180C and then stretched and wound on to rolls the width of the desired bag. The rolls are fed through a series of cylinder printing presses, each adding a different colour, until the logo and lettering are complete. Finally an army of workers carries out the more labour-intensive process of melting handles on to the bags, checking quality and packing. From start to finish the process takes five minutes. The production cost for each bag is less than eight cents, most of which goes on machinery maintenance, management and materials. The primary ingredient is polyfabric polypropylene or other types of plastic, all of them petroleum-based. By one estimate the US requires 12m barrels of oil for the 100 billion bags its consumers use annually. The Delux factory&apos;s main competitive advantage is labour, which accounts for less than a 10th of the production costs of a plastic bag. Wages in Shenzhen are low and more than three-quarters of the population are internal migrants, many of them living in huge company dormitories far from their homes and families, working in dirty, dangerous conditions. Delux&apos;s pay and conditions are above average for Shenzhen. We are not allowed to talk to employees, but we are introduced to &quot;group leader&quot; Chen Ping, a migrant from Guangxi province, who says the situation has improved enormously since she started working and living in the factory 11 years ago. &quot;The managers realise they must let us eat and sleep better if they want us to work harder.&quot; Chen earns more than double the average factory salary, but her life is far from easy. Because she is a migrant, her two children will have to return to their home town to go to school, which means she will see them for only a few days each year at spring festival. But she expresses no sense of grievance, even though the western consumers who use her bags can easily pay more for a shirt than she earns in a month. &quot;I don&apos;t think it is unfair. We make these bags to be used. They have their own value.&quot; Plastic carrier bags are totemic of all kinds of issues to do with shopping - food miles, food packaging, profligate waste. They pose problems for wildlife. They block drains. Friends of the Earth says plastic bags, which account for only 0.3% of the UK&apos;s domestic waste stream, are not its top priority. However, it would like to see a tax on the 17 billion bags that are handed out to British shoppers every year. Degradable and biodegradable bags are &quot;not an environmentally friendly option&quot;, it says, and &quot;will lead to the public becoming increasingly confused as to what they are supposed to do with them. Degradable plastic bags usually can&apos;t be recycled with normal plastic bags, and people may think they can put degradable bags into their compost bins, which they can&apos;t.&quot; Degradable bags are still made from plastic, continuing to place demands on oil resources. They contain a metal additive to make them degrade and tend to require sunlight to break down. If biodegradable bags end up in landfill, they eventually produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Paper bags are no better, says Friends of the Earth: they are less easily reused and require more energy and resources to make and transport than plastic alternatives. Bags made from recycled plastics, which are then reused or recycled, are considered by many to be a better option, but recycling points are not yet widely accessible. In any case, all too often a promise by municipal government to recycle simply means sending the rubbish to China. It is cheaper to ship a container of waste from London to Shenzhen to truck it to Manchester. Under EU law waste cannot be dumped abroad, but shipments for recycling are permitted. This means business for Guangdong province. There are the e-waste centres of Guiyu and Qingyuan, where families make a living from chopping up and melting down toxic plastics and metals from discarded computers, printers and mobile phones. Below them on the waste chain are the recyclers of plastic bags and bottles in Shunde and Heshan. Until recently the most notorious of these was in Nanhai, a town outside Guangzhou, where the streets were piled high with rubbish and the streams ran thick with pollution. In February, however, after a series of embarrassing reports in the British media, the government was shamed into shutting down the area and banning imports of foreign garbage. The streets of Nanhai are swept clean and the small recycling sheds are shuttered up. For many locals, however, this sudden concern about the environment is a financial disaster. &quot;We were ordered to close last month because some foreign rubbish contained toxins,&quot; says Ding Chunming, who used to process bottles and bags. &quot;It&apos;s a terrible blow because we only started this business last year. We get no compensation. All we can do is wait and hope the government allows us to restart business.&quot; But the industry has learned how to bypass laws and regulations. Many Nanhai &quot;refugees&quot; just moved their scrap heaps. Two hours&apos; drive away a recycling centre is under construction in Shijing village. The concrete is still wet on the floor and many of the sheds are only half-complete, but the task of buying, selling and sorting rubbish is in full flow. The operation is remarkably specialised. There are sections for discarded hotel welcome mats, the bases of revolving chairs, black buckets, the lids of shampoo bottles. One businesswoman, terrified that another critical news report will force her to relocate again, says: &quot;We have only just got here from Nanhai. I have never dealt with foreign waste. I can&apos;t do it now and I won&apos;t do it in the future.&quot; But for others the trade in foreign waste is too lucrative to disappear quickly. We were approached by a scrap dealer who asked if we had any rubbish to sell. He was after PVC, but he put us in touch with a factory in Shenzhen that said it could deal with carrier bags despite the ban. &quot;It can be done as long as the plastic is well enough packaged to get through customs,&quot; says the owner. &quot;You should ship them to Hong Kong and we will deal with them from there. If the bags are sorted by colour, we can pay you as much as $100 a tonne.&quot; Further away from the media spotlight and the scrutiny of environment officials, many factories are still reprocessing carrier bags and other rubbish from abroad despite the ban. Another hour&apos;s drive away in Shunde, rubbish from Europe is baled up on the roadside - British milk cartons, Dutch confectionery packaging, Italian nappies. Nearby in Mai, many villagers believe that the pollution is ruining their health. A doctor says the village suffers from an unusually high incidence of respiratory diseases. &quot;Perhaps it was the pollution or perhaps it was because everyone smokes cigarettes,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a sensitive topic. Of course we want a garden-like environment, but people here have to make a living.&quot; Others have different priorities. &quot;I don&apos;t care about the environment,&quot; says one labourer. &quot;I only want to make money. If your stomach isn&apos;t full, how can you worry about health?&quot; Everyone condemns as an eyesore the ditches full of carrier bags, but nobody seems to take responsibility for clearing up the mess. In fact the main concern of businessmen and officials is to avoid scrutiny. &quot;The government has banned imported waste because of the media attention,&quot; says one factory manager. &quot;The Nanhai recycling business has been completely shut down. This area doesn&apos;t want to suffer the same fate because it would hurt the government&apos;s income.&quot; Other countries are tackling the problem at differing speeds. British retailers will aim for a voluntary 25% reduction in carrier bag use by 2008. Elsewhere governments have started to act. Ireland introduced a &quot;plastax&quot; of about 30 cents on carrier bags in 2002, which has led to a 90% reduction in use. Australia has launched a &quot;Say No To Carrier Bags&quot; campaign. In Taiwan and Hong Kong the government obliges supermarkets to charge for bags at least two days a week. Italy is promoting biodegradable bags. In France reusable plastic bags - heavier, easier to recycle and less likely to blow away - account for more than half of the market. Inevitably even those eco-bags are made in Shenzhen. The main producer is the Richall Group. It was launched in 2003 with starting capital of less than $2,000. Last year it recorded sales of more than $6m. This year that figure is expected to triple. Richall&apos;s president, Liu Tianyan, says attitudes are changing. More importantly, so are materials. &quot;We&apos;re never going to get rid of plastic bags completely, because in some cases, such as food wrappings, there is no good substitute,&quot; he says. &quot;But in the case of shopping bags, I believe the flimsy plastic can be completely replaced.&quot; Not everyone thinks that would be a good thing. Peter Woodall, communications manager for the Carrier Bag Consortium, says, &quot;It&apos;s important to forget the emotion and look at the science. We are not filling our landfill with plastic bags. That is simply a myth. When real science is taken into account, the best environmental choice is plastic. Life cycle analysis shows that if you use a conventional bag four times and then recycle it, that is better than using a &apos;bag for life&apos;.&quot; Environmental campaigners believe that the solution is to make rich countries deal with their waste locally. &quot;That&apos;s the only way to make the whole community feel the impact,&quot; says Kevin May at Greenpeace&apos;s office in Beijing. &quot;If you can easily dump waste overseas, then there is no motive for having a waste-reduction programme at home. The argument that developing nations need recycled resources from wealthy nations is only partly true. The environmental costs are too high. Just look at the filthy water and polluted air of China. If we can stop the waste trade, I am sure it will lead to more sustainable development around the world.&quot; The apparent intractability of the problem is all the more remarkable considering that our dependency on the plastic bag is a recent phenomenon. Polythene was not even invented until the 1930s. Plastic bags did not become common in supermarkets until the 70s. The idea that we can&apos;t live without them is a very modern one.

China yesterday unveiled plans to build thousands of miles of roads to create a network that would broadly follow the ancient route linking old trading hubs such as Samarkand in Uzbekistan and Merv in Turkmenistan. The vast transport system is a crucial element in Beijing&apos;s strategy to tighten trade links with the oil and gas rich countries of central Asia. According to the Xinhua news agency, the longest new motorway, Asian Highway One, will stretch more than 3,000 miles from Urumqi in China&apos;s north-west region of Xinjiang to Istanbul in Turkey. Once completed in 2010, its route will take it through areas rich with untapped resources, including Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, and Mashhad in Iran. Eleven other roads will link Xinjiang to Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Pakistan, the report said, citing the transportation department of China&apos;s north-western territory of Xinjiang. The plan is part of an ambitious road map for Asia drawn up two years ago by China, Japan and 30 other countries. That 87,500-mile network of motorways, bridges and ferry routes will connect the trans-European landmass as never before, easily surpassing the old Silk Road, the camel route by which the occident and orient once traded with one another. China is at the heart of the network. In addition to existing roads, it is building more than 10,000 miles of new highways. The push into central Asia is making some of the world&apos;s most remote regions more accessible. Last summer, the China Road and Bridge Corporation began work on a three-mile tunnel in the mountainous Sughd region of Tajikstan. Construction has also begun on the stretch of Asian Highway One through Kyrgyzstan. The primary motivation is to boost trade with neighbouring countries and raise living standards in the far west. In recent years, Beijing has wooed central Asian states with political and economic incentives. The Shanghai Economic Cooperation, a loose grouping of states in the region, controls almost a quarter of the world&apos;s oil supplies and is building pipelines across the region.

Will Alsop, in his crumpled black shirt, black jacket and long, lank, greying hair, looks more like a hairy biker - amazingly scruffy and obviously not a man familiar with gyms. His favourite watering hole is the Chelsea Arts Club, which to put it mildly is not the place to order wheatgrass juice. He smokes even more than me. At one point he tells me he is 59 then pauses and adds, &apos;You&apos;re supposed to say I don&apos;t look it.&apos; Oh, OK, I tell him, leaving open the question of whether he looks older or younger. Actually 59 is still quite young for a top architect because architecture is a famously late-flowering profession - Philip Johnson started a new practice when he was 90. But with Alsop you slightly wonder if he&apos;ll make old bones. Since his Peckham Library won the Stirling Prize in 2000, Alsop probably counts as number three in the hierarchy of British architects, after Lords Rogers and Foster. His recent building for Goldsmiths College, New Cross, and the Blizard Building, his science institute for Queen Mary&apos;s College in Whitechapel, won rapturous praise - the Guardian called the latter &apos;rational and romantic, questioning, quixotic and necessary&apos;. Other much admired buildings include the Hotel du Departement (seat of regional government) in Marseille which was his first big commission and the Ontario College of Art and Design. The former is known as Le Grand Bleu because it is blue, the latter as the Dalmatian because it has black and white spots. His buildings often have playful elements - strong colours, blobby shapes, and stilts at crazy angles - but they are functional too. When I said something about the &apos;wonky legs&apos; of the Peckham Library he corrected me sharply: &apos;There is a good structural reason for putting the legs at an angle. Not that I believe in having to justify everything you do, but if you have straight legs in parallel you have to put in some bracing otherwise they might shift sideways but if you have a series of legs at angles they&apos;re bracing the lateral load anyway, so there is a reason for it. People say, Oh, that&apos;s just Will being wilful but not a bit of it.&apos; He once said he could best teach his students about load-bearing by making them form a human pyramid. Anyway, his buildings stand up, they are weatherproof, and the people who use them like them, which is more than you can say for some famous architects. And he is good fun. He has a dry wit and merry chortle. His studio in Battersea is a bright and bustling place, full of eager-beaver young things, with his own colourful abstract paintings round the walls. He believes that cheerfulness is important and that &apos;Being an architect is to some extent a performing art because you&apos;ve got to keep people up, you&apos;ve got to keep the whole situation buoyant and I&apos;ve noticed that the best and most successful projects are when everyone just keeps smiling. Architects are the only profession that actually deal in joy and delight - all the others deal in doom and gloom. Yet it&apos;s surprising how many architects dress as though they&apos;re accountants, and behave like accountants. They manage to make something that should be thoroughly enjoyable into a rather dull grind.&apos; It is noticeable that accountants often feature as bogeymen in his conversation - his father was an accountant. But he was 64 and already retired by the time Will was born. The family were comfortably off and lived in Northampton. Neither parent showed the slightest interest in architecture - though Will recalls that his mother was very houseproud and liked rearranging furniture, which might be relevant. When he was six he designed a house for her to live in - its most striking specification was that it had to be built in New Zealand. He always wanted to be an architect, even before he really knew what architects did. But he remembers that there was one modernist house in Northampton, New Ways, designed by Peter Behrens in 1926 and actually the first Modern Movement house in Britain, and his mother took him to see it, though she always used to say how ugly it was. The lady who lived there gave Will and his twin sister ice cream, &apos;And it was really good ice cream, so maybe that had a certain positive effect.&apos; When Alsop was 16 his father died, so he decided to leave school, where he was bored, and do his A-levels at evening classes while working for a local architect. (&apos;Even today I think, Why are these kids going to school full-time to do A-levels? They don&apos;t need to.&apos;) He did a foundation course at Northampton Art School and thence to the Architectural Association (AA) where he entered the competition to design the Pompidou Centre in Paris and was runner-up to Richard Rogers. His first proper commission was a swimming pool for Sheringham in Norfolk in 1984 (the start of a love affair with the Norfolk coast) and then a visitor centre for Cardiff Bay. After that he got a lot of work in Germany, including the Hamburg Ferry Terminal, before beating Norman Foster in the competition to build the Marseille Hotel du Departement in 1994. But even then, the work still didn&apos;t exactly flow. &apos;I came back here and went round to see potential clients and they&apos;d say they wanted to see what you&apos;d done - and I&apos;d say, the Hotel du Department, because I was proud of it and it was well received - and they&apos;d say, Yes, but what have you done here. I&apos;d say, But I built this in a foreign language, 800 miles away, on time, on budget - all the things you say - and they&apos;d say, Ah, but it doesn&apos;t count because it&apos;s not in Britain. Scary.&apos; (He says it was even worse for Richard Rogers - he was out of work for two years after he built the Pompidou Centre.) But he gradually got more commissions in his fifties and is probably now one of the busiest architects around. However, Alsop was never very good at handling the finances and, after several rocky patches (especially when his major &apos;Fourth Grace&apos; project for Liverpool was cancelled), he sold his practice last year to the design conglomerate SMC for \u00a31.8m. He says that&apos;s fine - it allows him to concentrate on architecture. &apos;I think you have to have the intelligence to recognise that you&apos;re not a good businessman and therefore find someone who loves money to look after that aspect for you. I worked for some other architects before I started on my own, and one of them I thought was rather good but he could have been better had he spent less time looking at VAT returns. And I decided then that I didn&apos;t go through seven years of training and meandering and travelling and trying to educate myself to end up doing VAT returns.&apos; He and his wife (they have three grown-up children) live between an Edwardian mansion flat in London and a converted stable block in Norfolk. But why hasn&apos;t he built his own house? &apos;Lots of people ask me that. And the answer is: I rather like my wife. If I built my own house, she&apos;d leave me. So I feel very comfortable not doing that, though of course I often have daydreams about it.&apos; In fact he has built his own studio in Norfolk - &apos;Sheila was very happy about that because it got me out of the house! But I spend a large proportion of the day talking or thinking about new buildings so it&apos;s quite nice to go home and have her taste imposed on me. And I do like her taste. She likes antiques and I don&apos;t dislike them at all. She&apos;s very good at making things comfortable - somewhere you can curl up on the sofa in front of the fire and just veg out looking at telly with a glass of wine, and I&apos;m very happy to do that.&apos; He tries to veg out at weekends as much as possible and also takes a month off in the summer to go painting in Majorca with his friend Bruce McLean. He is a strong believer that &apos;the Victorian work ethic drags us down&apos;. But actually he has a pretty hectic schedule - when I met him he was just back from Delhi and Vienna (where he is professor of architecture) before leaving for New York. He also has offices in Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing and Toronto which he visits regularly. He says he doesn&apos;t mind all the travelling - &apos;The trick is to make sure you go in the proper class! Otherwise you would die, simple as that&apos; - but he still thinks of himself as very much an English architect and spends as much time thinking about, say, Croydon (&apos;Croydon is pregnant with opportunity&apos;) as Yonkers, New York, where he is converting a disused power plant into a residential tower with shops, museum and swimming pool. He has more projects on the go than he can actually list - the next one to be opened will probably be &apos;Chips&apos;, a residential building which is part of his big master plan for New Islington, Manchester. Isn&apos;t it difficult keeping all these balls in the air? &apos;Well, that brings into question the business of how you actually work. At architecture school, generally speaking a group of students are set a project and given a term to do it. And I think this creates the wrong mindset, because they&apos;re given 10 or 12 weeks to do a really simple project. So then they start doing &quot;research&quot; and getting up late and going to the bar - and that&apos;s all right, that&apos;s what being a student is all about. &apos;But what it means in the profession is that when a project comes along, they think you have to take a long time to do it. Whereas Lutyens said, Sometimes I&apos;ll go and have a drink with someone on my way home and get a new project. But if I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do with it before supper, I know it&apos;s going to be difficult. He had this idea that you could see the essence of the project in 20 minutes.&apos; And is Alsop the same? &apos;Well I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any rules. Some things take longer but sometimes you do see very quickly what you can do. And of course the older you get, the quicker - not always but often - because you have a whole body of stuff to draw from.&apos; He has an equally brisk approach to site inspections. When I asked how long he spent familiarising himself with a site before designing for it, he said, &apos;Oh, sometimes five minutes. Some sites you can just drive past if there are no distinguishing features - as long as you know where it is and where south is, that&apos;s enough.&apos; You need to know where south is for the light - in China, he says, you can&apos;t sell an apartment if it doesn&apos;t have south light. Is that feng shui? I asked. &apos;No, it&apos;s common sense!&apos; What he does like doing is consulting local people about what they want for the area. He devotes much time to holding workshops and asking people what their town means to them, and what they would like to see there. He believes that we all crave civic identity and that that&apos;s what&apos;s missing in much of Britain. &apos;I get them to do all the work and then I sit down and try to make sense of what they&apos;re talking about. And they&apos;re quite usefully mad in a way. The politicians and planners make terrible assumptions about a lack of imagination in the general public, but they&apos;re much more imaginative and what they&apos;re really saying by and large is that they want the place that they live in to have an identity and be different from anywhere else.&apos; Alsop&apos;s architectural heroes are Le Corbusier, Sir John Soane, Mies van der Rohe and John Vanbrugh, which shows a typical eclecticism. I tried to goad him into being snide about some of his British contemporaries, especially Foster and Rogers, but he said, No, they all have their good points, and he likes the fact that so many different styles can co-exist. &apos;With architecture today there&apos;s no predominant style or methodology - it&apos;s more open that it has ever been in history and that&apos;s a good thing because it allows people like Quinlan Terry to do what he does and me to do what I do and others to do what they do, and as long as we all do it well and with commitment, I think that&apos;s terrific because it means we get some sort of variety in our towns and cities. It&apos;s the variety that&apos;s important. The most dangerous thing for architecture is to have a theory, because then it&apos;s all the same.&apos; Unlike most architects, he thinks Prince Charles was right to make his carbuncle speech in 1984 because: &apos;It shook things up, it brought architecture more into public consciousness. And it was the beginning of a broadening out, whereas before the Modernists had had it all their own way. I&apos;m not against Modernism either - it&apos;s what I was brought up on - but it was time to stir it up and he did.&apos; Alsop even has a good word for Poundbury, Prince Charles&apos;s model village of &apos;traditional&apos; houses in Dorset. &apos;I can cope with Poundbury! I wouldn&apos;t do it myself but I can appreciate that it has certain qualities - an element of surprise, an element of disorder - that people respond to. Whereas they don&apos;t respond to the clean lines and rationality of modernism, because we are not rational by and large.&apos; The awful thing about being an architect, I&apos;ve always thought, is that you spend half your time designing buildings that never get built. Alsop says that actually it&apos;s far more than half - usually only about 10 per cent of your designs are ever built. But that&apos;s fine, he says - even when he has no particular commission or competition in mind, he likes designing buildings. &apos;It&apos;s like tennis - you have to keep doing it all the time, whether you have a client or not. I believe that absolutely. You can speculate in your sketchbook - you&apos;re allowed to think about anything, with or without a client.&apos; He recently designed an ideal prison and researched it by staying in HMP Gartree and talking to prisoners. Now his thoughts are turning to hospitals, and he has been reading up Le Corbusier&apos;s ideas for a hospital (never built) in Venice: &apos;He thought that as soon as patients were in shuffle mode they needed somewhere to shuffle to, so he designed what was basically a club overlooking the lagoon with leather armchairs, a bar, smoking! And where the boys could meet the girls and possibly fall in love. So I thought it was those sorts of ideas that are missing in our ideas for hospitals.&apos; I do hope Alsop builds a hospital one day - I would enjoy shuffling along to his club. And with any luck he will, because he has no plans to retire, ever: &apos;I still feel that all my best work is yet to come.&apos; He has the rare knack of making buildings that people enjoy using. But he won&apos;t explain how he does it because &apos;If you can explain it, you spoil it&apos; and also you risk creating a theory or set of rules, which is the last thing he wants. &apos;I think it&apos;s good to have some sort of mystery, which is best left unexplained.&apos; But his approach to architecture can broadly be defined by his statement: &apos;I like people. I hope it shows.&apos; Five of the best Alsop buildings Hotel du Department des Bouches du RhoneMarseille, 1994Alsop&apos;s breakthrough, won in a competition against Norman Foster, among others.

Peckham LibraryLondon, 2000Won the 2000 Stirling Prize. Alsop&apos;s cantankerous artiness lends itself to projects in challenging urban areas. The library, whose form is inspired by an open book, was realised for a very modest budget. This exuberant, colourful building has attracted record attendances.

At the centre of this was control of Chinachem, Hong Kong&apos;s biggest privately held property company, which also has real estate investments in Britain, a shipping company in Taiwan, entertainment businesses in Asia and North America, a US biotechnology firm, a Canadian video games enterprise and a meat-packing plant in China. In the ranks of sober-suited Hong Kong businessmen, Wang was an original with her pigtails, impish grin and miniskirts which, she said, she wore &quot;because I have great legs&quot;. Five feet tall, she turned up for business meetings with a large German shepherd dog, and sometimes took dinner guests to McDonald&apos;s, where she preferred the Filet-O-Fish. The last time I saw her, at a reception in a hotel in the Central district, she was carrying an aluminium case. It was, she explained, her handbag and &quot;good for hitting anyone who attacks me&quot;. Like many Hong Kong tycoons, she originated from Shanghai, where her father-in-law, Wang Din-shin, ran a successful chemicals, property and paint business under the nationalists and during the Japanese wartime occupation. In 1946, as civil war with the communists gripped China, he moved to Hong Kong with his son, Teddy. The young man&apos;s childhood friend Kung Yu-sum followed. They were married in 1956. She became known as Nina, and acquired the Cantonese nickname of Siu Tim-Tim - Little Sweetie - from a Japanese cartoon character. In later life, she commissioned a cartoon book about herself. Teddy built up Chinachem as a big player in Hong Kong&apos;s booming property market. Despite their wealth, he and his wife were known for their sense of economy. Nina bought her clothes at discount shops, and, when invited out to dinner, they were said to borrow Tupperware containers to take uneaten food home. Teddy applied his tight-fistedness to business, and made plenty of enemies. In 1983, he was kidnapped from his Mercedes as he was driven to work. Nina came up with a \u00a36m ransom, and Teddy was freed. He had been kept chained to a bed for 11 days and was found trussed up in a refrigerator where he had been held by the gang. It was said that he told his wife off for having paid too much. In 1990, Teddy was snatched again. A Hong Kong source once told me that, as a precaution, he had had a homing device fitted into the soles of his footwear; his shoes were found at the dock where the kidnappers took him on to a boat. He was never seen again. Subsequent evidence indicated that he was thrown over the side when a police vessel was sighted about to carry out a routine check. Refusing to accept that Teddy was dead until a formal legal ruling was delivered in 1999, Nina used her power of attorney to run and expand Chinachem as the &quot;chairlady&quot;. But she and her father-in-law became involved in the lengthy suit about different versions of Teddy&apos;s will. A first verdict in 2002 found that one version, leaving the dead man&apos;s assets to his wife, replete with uncharacteristic romantic expressions from stone-hearted Teddy, was a forgery. That handed the fortune to his aged father, who sat in his wheelchair in court staring straight ahead. Three years later, Nina won on appeal, gaining control of Chinachem for the rest of her life. Despite her eccentricities, she was a canny businesswoman, expanding the empire internationally, staying friends with both the People&apos;s Republic and Taiwan, earning political capital in the US by helping to fund the preservation of Bill Clinton&apos;s birthplace and giving $7m to Harvard for scholarships for Chinese officials. But, aware of her husband&apos;s fate, she was said to employ dozens of bodyguards. Yet she failed in her biggest ambition - to build the world&apos;s tallest structure on the Hong Kong waterfront. It was to be dedicated to Teddy, but called the Nina Tower. However, it was on the flight path to the new airport.

As the story made clear, their feelings were mutually requited but unconsummated. To him she was &quot;my little Kraut&quot;, or &quot;daughter&quot;, to her he was simply &quot;Papa&quot; - and it was love at first sight when they met aboard a French ocean liner in 1934. A set of 30 unpublished letters and telegrams from the legendary American writer Ernest Hemingway to the German singer-actress Marlene Dietrich, which have been made public for the first time, reveal the depth of their passion for each other - although theirs was a relationship in which they never went to bed together. Hemingway and Dietrich started writing to each other when he was 50 and she was 47, remaining in close contact until the writer&apos;s suicide in 1961. But they never consummated their love, because of what Hemingway referred to as &quot;unsynchronised passion&quot;. Although it was not a physical relationship, they certainly knew how to flirt. In a letter dated June 19 1950 at 4am, Hemingway wrote: &quot;You are getting so beautiful they will have to make passport pictures of you 9 feet tall.&quot; He continued with a question: &quot;What do you really want to do for a life work? Break everybody&apos;s heart for a dime? You could always break mine for a nickel and I&apos;d bring the nickel.&quot; Another time he wrote: &quot;I can&apos;t say how every time I ever put my arms around you I felt that I was home.&quot; He ends a letter: &quot;I love you and I hold you tight and kiss you hard.&quot; In 1951 he wrote to her from the tropical heat of Cuba where he was trying to write The Old Man and the Sea. &quot;It was too hot to make love, if you can imagine that, except under water and I was never very good at that.&quot; The correspondence has now been released by the Kennedy Library in Boston on the instructions of Dietrich&apos;s daughter, Maria Riva, who wanted the letters to be kept under wraps for 15 years after her mother&apos;s death. Tom Putnam, director of the Kennedy Library, said: &quot;When combined with the library&apos;s collection of correspondence from Dietrich to Hemingway, these new letters help to complete the story of a remarkable friendship between two exceptional individuals.&quot; The couple met in 1934 on a French luxury liner, the Ile de France, when Hemingway was returning to Key West via Paris after a safari in east Africa, and Dietrich was travelling back to Hollywood after visiting relatives in Nazi Germany on one of her last trips home. Much later Hemingway revealed to a friend why he believed the relationship had never been consummated. &quot;Victims of unsynchronised passion. Those times when I was out of love, the Kraut was deep in some romantic tribulation, and on those occasions when Dietrich was on the surface and swimming about with those marvellously seeking eyes, I was submerged.&quot; There are now plans to put their correspondence into a book, including 31 letters from Dietrich to Hemingway. In one of them from 1951, she addressed him as &quot;Beloved Papa&quot;, and continued: &quot;I think it is high time to tell you that I think of you constantly. I read your letters over and over and speak of you with a few chosen men. I have moved your photograph to my bedroom and mostly look at it rather helplessly.&quot; Their letters reveal the insecurities and fears of both, and frequently touch on Hemingway&apos;s lifelong fight against depression. &quot;Toi and moi have lived through about as bad times as ever were,&quot; he wrote in June 1950. &quot;I don&apos;t mean just wars. Wars are spinach. Life in general is the tough part.&quot; Dietrich made no secret of her dislike of physical relationships. In that sense she might not have been a bad match for Hemingway, despite his womanising reputation. Referring to his fourth wife, Mary Welsh, in a 1950 letter, he wrote: &quot;Mary is still the best woman in the bed that I have ever known. Of course I have not been around much and am basically shy.&quot; Brief lives Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in Illinois in 1899 and became one of the most influential novelists of the 20th century. He lived in Paris in the 1920s, becoming part of what he referred to as the &quot;lost generation&quot; of expatriates. Hemingway was married four times and had a reputation as a heavy drinker and womaniser. He received the Pulitzer prize in 1953 for The Old Man and the Sea, and was awarded the Nobel prize for Literature in 1954. He suffered from depression and just before his 62nd birthday, on July 2 1961, shot himself in the head at his home in Ketchum, Idaho. Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin in 1901 and became an actress, entertainer and singer. She studied the violin before getting a job as a chorus girl and actress in Berlin and Vienna in the 1920s. She made her film debut in 1923, and went on to star in The Scarlet Empress and Shanghai Express, which cemented her reputation as a femme fatale. Dietrich went to Hollywood rather than become a puppet of the Nazi regime, for which she was considered a traitor by her fellow Germans for decades. She was best known as a singer, and her signature tunes included Falling in Love Again and Lili Marlene. She spent her last decade bed-ridden at her home in Paris, where she died of renal failure in 1992. \u00b7 Have your say in our blog", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "Books", "Germany", "Film", "Culture", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2007-04-10T09:26:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/10/climatechange.blocparty", "sentences": ["Confirming the seventeen headliners who will perform at Wembley in a gig reminiscent of the original Live Aid, Mr Gore said: &quot;By attracting an audience of billions, we hope Live Earth will launch a global campaign giving a critical mass of people around the world the tools they need to help solve the climate crisis.&quot; Live Earth concerts are also scheduled to take place in Sydney, Rio De Janeiro, Johannesburg, Tokyo and Shanghai."], "title": "Madonna and Red Hot Chili Peppers on Live Earth line-up", "article": "Madonna, Bloc Party and Razorlight are among the acts set to take part in Live Earth, a global series of concerts aimed at raising awareness of climate change.

And, as a dyed-in-the-wool greenie, I regard being happy and having a good time as one of the most life enhancing things that we should all spend our days doing. I won&apos;t claim that Live Earth will fundamentally change the world, any more than Live Aid or Live 8 did, but if it changes the lives and world outlook of even a few thousand people it will have achieved something good. I must admit that holding a set of rock concerts to raise worldwide awareness about climate change, 10 years after the governments of the world signed the Kyoto Treaty agreeing to do something about the problem, does seem slightly back to front. But in a strange way it isn&apos;t. I&apos;ve been chatting about climate change on various doorsteps for almost as long as Genesis have been reforming the band (they are one of the rock combos on show at Live Earth, but minus the essential Peter Gabriel). Climate change is a generational thing, with worldwide awareness coming in waves, storms and rising tides. Global warming will be reinvented as an issue every few years and in different places around the world. What makes it different from every other worthy cause that has ever been blessed by a rock star&apos;s presence is that we are now stuck with global warming. We are waking up to the reality that it could be bad, or really, really bad, depending on how much we decide to change our lifestyles, habits and economies. Climate change will define our lives in the coming century and I&apos;m only half joking when I imagine people gathering for Live Earth 2057: the Zimmer frame reunion. I also agree that the date of July 7 for a London concert is not ideal, as the bombings are still fresh in our collective minds. However, the date and the initial organisational zeal for this attempt at making climate change mainstream have come from the United States. Over there, Live Earth will be catching the wave of public awareness unleashed by Hurricane Katrina and Al Gore&apos;s An Inconvenient Truth. Over here, we are on the second tide and more interested in knowing why our government allowed far more CO2 to be produced last year than in 1997. Perhaps the real impact of Live Earth won&apos;t be felt in either New York or London, but among young people living in Shanghai, Johannesburg or Brazil. As much as we need to act now and act urgently in this country, we can only play the role of innovators and example setters, for the billions of people who must join us in creating a different kind of future for this planet than the one currently on display in the opulent shopping malls of airport terminals. So my appeal to the leftie cynics, armchair anarchists and sceptical campaigners is: please find a harder target than Live Earth. I know that the event will generate a virtual mountain range of cynical texts and emails, aimed at pointing out the hypocrisy of a jet-setting collection of rock stars and of B-list celebs playing at being day-trip greenies. But with the ice caps melting and mass extinctions of species threatened, can we please take a day to celebrate the fact that climate change awareness is (once again) going mainstream? And if you don&apos;t get tickets for Live Earth, or don&apos;t fancy the music, then by all means join me and half a million other people for the biggest celebration of cycling this country has seen, when the prologue stage of the Tour de France hits London, along with lots of men in lycra.

Two of them were bowlers, and the other a batsman. One of them won Australia&apos;s young player of the year award, and he seemed tipped for the very top of professional cricket. Later, one of the three went on to star in State cricket, one of them managed a handful of first class games, and the last never came close to that standard. A few years on and that last guy had met an Irish girl, like in all the best stories they fell in love and got married. His best mate, the one who was once a young cricketer of the year, came over for the wedding. While he was there, he too met an Irish girl. And he fell in love with her - at a wedding who could blame him? So these two Aussie mates, straight from the Sydney suburbs settled down in Ireland with their new lives and wives, having abandoned those dreams of playing in the green and gold strip of their homeland, turned their attention to other things. Not least of those was playing for the Irish national side, who, for several years, played a lower standard than the St George&apos;s club they&apos;d once turned out for. The last of the three did no such thing. He went on through Grade and State cricket and into the National team. His name is Nathan Bracken, and he&apos;ll be opening the bowling today. Several years on from when they wrote off their international cricket careers, those two old teammates of his, Jeremy Bray and Dave Langford-Smith, are playing for the opposition, Ireland. What&apos;s more, they&apos;ll be captained by Trent Johnston, who did better than either of them and played with Michael Clarke, Stuart Clark and Bracken for New South Wales for a time in the early years of this millennium. He&apos;s as Aussie as an Irishman can possibly come - all squint-eyed grit and hard-nosed determination. In the end he too succumbed to the charms of Irish womanhood and abandoned his first-class career to settle in his new nation. There are three morals to this story. One is that you never know where life is going to take you - it&apos;s certainly true that 15 years ago none of those young players expected to be talking sides against each other in the later stages of a World Cup. The second is that there is nothing in life that most men wont drop for a pretty girl with a nice Irish accent. And the third is that, if you want a good cricket team, you&apos;d better recruit some gorgeous sirens and teach them to trap men. You can add your own gags about Scotland&apos;s chances of improving anywhere you like roundabout here. Yes, it is Friday 13th. Yes, that&apos;s not a good omen for anyone. But, I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s more worrying for Ireland than the Aussies. If they win today, they&apos;re through to the semi-finals. With that in mind, ruthless relentless-swigging swine as they are, they&apos;re playing their first XI today. What is more, Australia have won the toss and will bowl first. So, with that I reckon pretty much any chance Ireland did have of winning on this bowler-friendly pitch has gone. They could have hoped to sneak through fifty tight overs, relying on the seam-movement and spin to draw a through careless dismissals from the Aussies, get them out for, say, 200 and then try to grind it out. Instead we&apos;re going to see them get blown away in the first innings. It&apos;s going to be a long sick demoralising prosession of a match. Here&apos;s one man enjoying himself: Andy Stiff: &quot;All talk of this being an unmemorable World Cup is highly annoying, I am enjoying every minute. I had an accumalator which said the Aussies will win and both Pakistan and India would go out before the Super Eights. All I need for it to come up is for Des Browne to be the next Prime Minister...&quot;. On the topic of unlikely prospects, why not go have a look at my bag-of-a-fag-packet musings on Australia. Or, if you&apos;re after a little more quality, have a look at an angry Mike Selvey slamming Michael Vaughan. By the by, I don&apos;t mean body-slamming, it&apos;s not a Youtube clip and I don&apos;t want to raise your hopes in that respect. Here&apos;s the Aussie team then: AC Gilchrist, ML Hayden, RT Ponting, MJ Clarke, A Symonds, MEK Hussey, BJ Hodge, GB Hogg, SR Clark, SW Tait, GD McGrath. Which has totally knackered what Jeff Ando calls my &apos;Jackanory&apos; opening because Bracken has been rested and Stuart Clark is in. I don&apos;t get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield taught me that line. He made a whole career out of it. And if you don&apos;t know what I&apos;m on about, go find a copy of &apos;Back to School&apos; or &apos;Caddyshack&apos;. Anyway, what the hell was I on about? Ireland&apos;s team, yes. Here it is: WTS Porterfield, JP Bray, EJG Morgan, NJ O&apos;Brien, KJ O&apos;Brien, AR White, DT Johnston, WK McCallan, JF Mooney, D Langford-Smith, WB Rankin. So Mooney (the only man in world cricket who shares his name with a religious cult?) is in for Gillespie and sadly Andre Botha, their miserly bowler, is injured and doesn&apos;t play. Tom Janes knows I&apos;m right: &quot;I came to Ireland for six weeks before taking up a job in London. Six years later i&apos;m still here after meeting a pretty girl with an Irish accent. I can&apos;t bat for toffee though, which is why I&apos;m emailing the OBO instead of quivering before the second-string Aussie attack.&quot; Which is probably wise. What you don&apos;t say Tom, is whether this girl liked you, or ever actually even spoke to you after you&apos;d &apos;met&apos; her. Still, I&apos;m sure she&apos;d have been impressed by your &apos;once I emailed OBO and it was great because&apos; anecdotes. Why is it that the BBC are so much better than everyone else at sport montages? They are the undisputed kings. Maybe it&apos;s because Sky soundtracked theirs with Moby. Shudder. WICKET! Bray 1 b McGrath (1st over: Ireland 2-1) &quot;Have you not just abandoned your first point of 7 ways to beat Australia? Or should point 1 read: Bat first (unless you are Ireland, England...etc)&quot; Paul McGrath, not just a quality pro footballer cum boozehound, but an astute cricket fan too. I am indeed a muddle of contradictory nonsense. Good time to talk about the cricket then - Bray blocks a single to the off from McGrath&apos;s first ball. Porterfield attempts a swiped hook but simply screws the ball to mid-wicket. In the end he too settles for a scrambled single. And there the romance ends.... if Bray did ever imagine playing against his beloved Australia in a World Cup, I doubt he planned on being bowled by McGrath for one. And that&apos;s what happened: a full ball, on off stump and swinging in enough to clip the outside stump and shudder off the bails. 2nd over: Ireland 2-1 (Porterfield 1 Morgan 0) Tait&apos;s first ball is as fast as anything these batsmen will have ever faced and draws a collective gasp from the crowd, commentators and players alike. And because we lost a little of the romance in that last over, we&apos;d better have some more Tom Janes: &quot;Yeah, we broke up after two years,&quot; it&apos;s a good start, &quot;and she hated cricket, and me eventually. Found a better prettier Irish girl, and I&apos;m slowly converting her, with the help of Trent and the lads. She won&apos;t let me listen to TMS in bed though. Yet.&quot; She&apos;ll come around Tom , especially if you can&apos;t think of anything more entertaining to do under the sheets than listen to CMJ and Aggers. That&apos;s a maiden from Tait. 3rd over: Ireland 2-1 (Porterfield 1 Morgan 0) Even the ECB are catching on with the sirens thing: &quot;I&apos;m Irish, a few years ago I met an English girl, we will be getting married and I will be moving to England next year. I&apos;ve never played cricket in my life before but I&apos;m convinced than I&apos;m a better batsman than Michael Vaughan, Ed Joyce, Andrew Strauss...&quot; Time to get Martin McElroy in the team then. Are you sure your not Dermot Reeve using a pseudonym for a late shot at a recall? Morgan cracks a delicious four runs that should have been, had the ball not been plucked from the air by a leaping Andrew Symonds. That&apos;s another maiden. WICKET! Porterfield 1 lbw Tait WICKET! O&apos;Brien 0 b Tait (4th over: Ireland 12-3) Porterfield runs off the pitch looking, I&apos;m afraid to say, a little like he wants to go home to his mum. Tait put a fast ball on a length and swung it towards leg where it rapped Porterfield on the pads. Everyone knew it was out, and eventually the umpire&apos;s finger confirmed it. O&apos;Brien&apos;s gone! The two best batsmen have gone already! It&apos;s a total rout! Tait scorches the earth with a wider ball outiside off and O&apos;Brien attempted a drive but edged the ball onto his stumps, sending the bails flying. It&apos;s a shocking start and these batsmen just can&apos;t cope with Tait&apos;s pace. He&apos;s so close to a hat trick too, shaping the ball half an inch past the edge of Kevin O&apos;Brien&apos;s straight bat. He gives up a wide, which at least brings runs level with wickets. Another wide gives the run total the edge. Kevin essays a lovely shot to the next, clipping a half-volley to square leg for four. Tait pings him on the arm with a bouncer for his impudence. What a reply! K O&apos;Brien clips another four runs to square leg. What an extraordinary over. WICKET! Morgan c Hayden b McGrath (5th over: Ireland 13-4)  Morgan goes. He&apos;s edged a neat little cutter off to slip for a simple catch. Utterly ruthless stuff from the Aussies. Well, seems like this match is as good as done, so a suitable moment to say: &quot;Any tips for the Grand National from any of today&apos;s millions of OBOers then Andy?&quot; that actually comes from Andrew White, who, on my screen, has just come out to bat. Must have sent it from the dressing room. I&apos;m surprised you couldn&apos;t guess Andrew, the only horse that OBO&apos;ll be backing? &apos;Idle Talk&apos; of course. Neil Goodall&apos;s imagination knows no bounds: &quot;Just think, if we&apos;d sent Bananarama on an Antipodean tour in the early nineties, their delicate charms could have snared us Warne, McGrath and Ponting. It&apos;s clear now that Kylie&apos;s early 90&apos;s UK tours were a blatant Aussie plot to steal um... I&apos;ll get back to you with that one.&quot; Andrew Symonds perhaps? 6th over: Ireland 22-4 (O&apos;Brien 11 White 2) Taits sends down an atrocious wide. And another one, flung down leg as he grossly overcorrects. Two dots and then another wide. Any one lend Jose a hand with this one: &quot;On the subject of weddings: I&apos;ve been asked to be the MC at my significant other&apos;s sister&apos;s wedding in Cape Town tomorrow. The bridal couple are from London. I don&apos;t know them very well. I&apos;m expected to make my short speech entertaining / and or funny. The only thing vaguely amusing about them is that he supports Crystal Palace. Any suggestions?&quot; Not much to go on is it. Is that really the only &apos;amusing&apos; thing about him? Bloody hell you must be desperate. Dropped him! Ponting tumbles away to his right at second slip, trying to gather a thick edge, but the ball slips out of his grasp. This is ridiculous, Tait adds a no ball to his three wides, and another wide. What a curious mix of dross and excellence Tait is, who taught him to bowl? Devon Malcolm? O&apos;Brien clips three off his legs from the last. 7th over: Ireland 23-4 (O&apos;Brien 12 White 2) Simon Hudd points out that &quot;Bananarama clearly did go on tour, yet all we got was Alan Mullally, Martin McCague and Geraint Jones.&quot; I knew we should have sent Sonya instead. Just the one from this over, but then, at least they didn&apos;t lose any wickets. 8th over: Ireland 24-4 (O&apos;Brien 12 White 2) Tait is hauled off and subjected to a chorus of &apos;you flamin drongo&apos; from his teammates or somesuch thing. Anyway, Stuart Clark comes on for his first ball and.... immediately spits it down leg for a wide. Ponting gurns. Clark has White lbw but umpire Koetzen gives him unreasonable benefit. Nick Hughes must be ever so slightly smug with himself after this effort, and frankly, I can&apos;t blame him for that: &quot;Compared to the &apos;Slim Pickings&apos; available on other sites, one can but admire the OBO&apos;s &apos;Gallant Approach&apos; to cricket coverage, even if it is hard to understand what &apos;Le Duc&apos; you&apos;re talking about most of the time.&quot; If you&apos;re baffled, check the runners for tomorrow&apos;s national. A neat series of little dots have broken out next to Stuart Clark&apos;s name in the scorebook. Six of them in fact. 9th over: Ireland 26-4 (O&apos;Brien 12 White 4) Here you go then Jose, some wise words on how to write a corking best man&apos;s speech from Ronan Hayes: &quot;He could always amuse the drunk table (there is always one) at the wedding by going on ad nauseum about how if the bride is half as good as her sister in the sack, the groom is in for a great night. That should do the trick.&quot; Altogether more tasteful is that drive from White, pushing the ball out through extra cover for two runs. McGrath doesn&apos;t like it: he sends down a vicious bouncer, White ducks into it and the ball smashes into the side of his helmet. Ouch. That was ugly stuff, and the Aussies come straight in to check on him. 10th over: Ireland 30-4 (O&apos;Brien 16 White 4) More good advice, god bless you OBO&apos;ers, for our best man: &quot;How about this for an opening gambit? &apos;The husband is so dull that not only has he had to ask a stranger to MC his wedding, but that stranger has had to ask hundreds of other strangers how to make this whole terrible charade sound interesting.&apos; And then mention something about Crystal Palace&quot;. Anthony Pease writes these speeches for a living you know. Over at point Michael Clarke is yawning, in close-up, satisfyingly O&apos;Brien creams the next ball past Clarke&apos;s right hand and away at furious pace to the boundary for four. WICKET! White 6 b McGrath c Hogg (11th over: Ireland 32-5) White takes two runs off his first ball since that knock on the bonce. McGrath opts for a change of tack and diddles White into chipping his slower ball up into the air. Brad Hogg, running back at mid-off, takes a good catch one handed over his head and that makes it 32 for five. What a brutal innings for White that was. Anyway, Trent Johnston, my favourite journeyman of the entire tournament, is in. I&apos;m glad Neil left his surname off this email, because I think this is pretty damn poor: &quot;if the OBO listeners are giving out wedding advice then perhaps they can help me. My mother is getting married tomorrow in Sydney and not only will I not be there but I haven&apos;t gotten around to sending a present (or a card). Is there any way to get out of this one?&quot; No. No there&apos;s not. You cad. 12th over: Ireland 33-5 (O&apos;Brien 16 Johnston 1) &quot;The idea of the batsman reading the OBO before coming out to bat tickled me and got me thinking. As the new season is starting very soon, do any of the OBO team fancy coming up to Newcastle to cover some of Blue Flames Second XI Games? We can offer you a filling (though not particularly high quality) tea as recompense?&quot; Bloody hell, what kind of shambolic set up do you think we run here? Honestly James Thorley, we&apos;re not sodding amateurs. And anyway, it&apos;d take more than tea to get me out of bed and off the bottle, and I happen to know that Smyth will be spending the entire English season in a tanning salon reading old Wisden Almanacks in preparation for the end of year quiz. You could at least have offered us your girlfriends.... 13th over: Ireland 42-5 (O&apos;Brien 16 Johnston 10) Aah, have a bit of that. The journeyman battles back as Johnston punches McGrath away for four runs through long-on. He popped two to the off from the ball before too, and that was enough to rile Glenn into sending down a bouncer. Trent&apos;s having none of it, ducks out of the way and dispatches the sixth ball away for another pair into the off. WICKET! O&apos;Brien 16 c Hodge b Clark (14th over: Ireland 47-6) A quick word from Gary Naylor on events at Lord&apos;s on this, the first day of the English season: &quot;Alastair Cook has just hit the first century of the English first class cricket season for MCC, which he, intriguingly, is captaining. But then again, MCJ Nicholas is indisposed and I don&apos;t think Hoggy went to a fee-paying school.&quot; Meanwhile, back in the Caribbean, O&apos;Brien has clipped a neat shot straight to mid wicket, where he was easily caught. Johnston is still hammering away mind, and has uppercut a huge looping four to the square boundary. McGrath could have stopped it but couldn&apos;t be bothered to dive. 15th over: Ireland 50-6 (Johnston 14 McCallan 3) Tait returns. &quot;How about something like: &quot;No wonder he loves his new wife because, like his beloved Crystal Palace, she&apos;ll probably go down every three years&quot;?&quot; Steven Randell, raising both the bar and the tone with his best-man suggestions. And Mark Bedford has many similar efforts, of which I&apos;ll pick this: &quot;Q: What do Crystal Palace fans use as birth control? A: Their personalities.&quot; A hoy hoy, the fifty is up now and doesn&apos;t that just warm your cockles. 16th over: Ireland 53-6 (Johnston 17 McCallan 3) Neil the cad, you have some sympathisers, but as Will Frost suggests, it&apos;s too late already: &quot;What makes it worse is that it is already tomorrow in Sydney so that he can&apos;t even use the power of OBO to get someone in Sydney to buy a card and post it from there.&quot; Still - interflora will do international delivery, while some spawny tightfist has suggested you send an e-card. JM Coetzee, yes that one, yes the famous author, suggests you use this for your wedding speech Jose: &quot;the crime latent within us we must inflict on ourselves.&quot; Ok. So Max Hildebrand sent it in on his behalf, but I still like to think he&apos;s reading. WICKET! Johnston 17 b Tait (17th over: Ireland 59-7) WIDE! Guess who&apos;s bowling? Yes, Tait. More help for Neil the bounder: &quot;he might retain some maternal affection by sending an effusive telegram, to be followed up by a call to his mother&apos;s hotel to arrange (and pay for) a champagne breakfast for the happy couple&quot;. Johnston goes, that&apos;s such a shame. He&apos;s shaking his head, baring his teeth, he&apos;s gutted. Tait just beat him for pace, clattered the ball through his gate and dismantled the stumps. It was a good knock for an ocker, lad, chin up. John Mooney is in - by the by whoever emailed earlier suggesting that Arthur Christian also shared his name with a religious cult really needs to re-evaluate their world view sometime soonish. 18th over: Ireland 59-7 (McCallan 3 Mooney 5) Now here is a good offer: &quot;Would any of your multitude of readers be interested in bringing their pub or village team over to a Croatian island in the middle of the Adriatic for a game of cricket? The William Hoste Cricket Club on Vis is looking for sides of sufficiently amateur ability to give them a game this summer. So far VCC has been spanked by a Royal Navy Representative XI, a pub from Cambridge and a band of travelling Aussies who bowled them out for 15. They&apos;re desperate to have a game against - ahem - more modest opposition and thus record a rare win. Does anyone think their outfit could fit this generous bill? Vis is a gorgeous place for some cricket with a holiday squeezed in...&quot; Ben Heywood is the man asking, but I guess you should email me if you&apos;re interested. You could always ask Duncan Fletcher if his boys fancy a knock? 19th over: Ireland 70-7 (McCallan 4 Mooney 12) Tait attempts the total decapitation of Mooney with a snorting bouncer that disappears down the leg side for three wides. And a scintillating shot from Mooney, cover driving Tait away for four runs. 20th over: Ireland 72-7 (McCallan 5 Mooney 13) Ok. To get sober for a moment, here is Stephen Todd, one of many to be fair, suggesting that the cad should: &quot;Find a Florist in Sydney, (I hear the internets are good for that sort of thing) give them a call (They&apos;re already open over there!), and tell them to deliver a bunch of flowers and a card and maybe even some sort of mechanical son who won&apos;t forget their mother&apos;s weddings. Give them your credit card and *poof* you look like you planned it all along.&quot; Now just the problems of Irish cricket to solve and you can get back to work. So, Brad Hogg is on, because, well, why not? He gives up a pair of singles without ever looking menacing. WICKET! McCallan c Tait b Symonds (21st over: Ireland 72-8) Ponting, like a cat with a mouse, seems to have decided to have a little fun with Ireland before he eats them (not literally), and he&apos;s brought on Symonds for a trundle. Has he not watched any Bond movies? Does he not know that when you&apos;ve cornered your foe you have to kill him right there and then rather than stop, make him a mint julip and dawdle your way through asn explanation of his plans? Does he not know that the sooner this is over, the quicker I&apos;ll be down the pub? Oh, yes, it appears he does know all those things. Sorry Punter. McCallan swats a rather rubbish shot, given how well he&apos;d resisted so far, up in the air and he&apos;s caught out by Tait at mid-on. Here&apos;s the last of that trio of Irish Aussies from our opeing story then, Dave Langford-Smith. 22nd over: Ireland 74-8 (Mooney 14 Langford-Smith 1) More useful wedding speech suggestions, these from Iain Wilkinson: &quot;Compare the skintone of the bride&apos;s mother with that of Simon Jordan. Tie in a short rant on the utter uselessness of Clinton Morrison to the history of apartheid. There&apos;s probably room to get a Big Ron quote in this portion of the speech. Remind the crowd that Palace for years shared their ground with someone (was it Wimbledon?), and compare and contrast that happy cooperation with the sharing of Africa between racist settlers and native Africans.&quot; For the second over in succession I can say this of Hogg: he gives up a pair of singles without ever looking menacing. 23rd over: Ireland 80-8 (Mooney 19 Langford-Smith 2) Didn&apos;t see much of this over, as I was inadvertantly day dreaming. By the time I did look back, Mooney had stroked a four down to third man. WICKET! Langford-Smith 2 c Ponting b Hogg (24th over: Ireland 81-9) Boyd Rankin is in then, because Hogg managed to spit a ball high off the pitch. It caught the shoulder of Langford-Smith&apos;s bat and popped up to Ricky Ponting at silly point. One more wicket and I&apos;ll be done for the day tee hee then I can get away from the likes of Ryan O&apos;Hare and his tedious accusations. 25th over: Ireland 82-9 (Mooney 19 Rankin 0) Symonds skims one past Rankin&apos;s outside edge, an event which leaves me a little light on quality prose, so I&apos;d better print Alistair Leadbetter: Compare the bride to a kiwi fruit: Juicy, yet firm to the touch, sweet, yet a little tart, and covered all over with short brown hairs&quot; and hope no one grumbles too much. 26th over: Ireland 82-9 (Mooney 19 Rankin 0) Brad Hogg goes full his full repetoire of variations: fuller, shorter, flipper, wrong un and a quicker ball. Needless to say Mooney can&apos;t get bat on a single one of them. 27th over: Ireland 84-9 (Mooney 20 Rankin 2) Stuart Clark returns. Alan Synott, I can see you&apos;ve learned a lot from following us here on OBO: &quot;My mate is on holiday in the south of France, with no coverage of the game, so I&apos;ve been keeping him up to date. He is thrilled that Ireland are 160-2 from 30 overs with Australia in disarray.&quot; A bouncer deflects of Rankin&apos;s chin and almost hits the stumps. It doesn&apos;t but Mooney is charging up from the non-striker&apos;s end, Ponting shies at the stumps, and misses an easy run out. Clark has hit is stride and is totally unplayable for the tailenders. 28th over: Ireland 88-9 (Mooney 22 Rankin 2) Aaah, whoever was telling us that the florists were already open in Sydney must have an aged array of &apos;international time zone&apos; clocks on their wall, you know the ones: &apos;Shanghai 3.15pm, Putney 11.00am&apos; that kind of thing. Here&apos;s Chris Tangye putting us all right: &quot;Greetings from ABC studios Sydney where I can comfortably declare that there will be absolutely no florists open for our desperate wedding boy. Its 1.15am and the only things open are kebab shops, pubs and the good ol&apos; ABC bunker. I guess he could order his mother a beer and kebab and I could run it over for him if he likes but otherwise he&apos;s as buggered as the Irish. By the way - do you think the Aussies have been sledging the Irish/Aussies?&quot; I&apos;d make it a definite yes to that last one Chris. And seeing as Neil hasn&apos;t yet supplied anything for the weeding, a beer and a kebab might go down quite well. 29th over: Ireland 91-9 (Mooney 23 Rankin 4) Oh come on, we just want one wicket now don&apos;t we? I do. Rankin carts two runs to the off side. WICKET! Mooney 23 run out Tait (30th over: Ireland 91) Niall Mullen knows the score. And so he should, because it&apos;s written above this line, oh hold on that&apos;s not what I meant at all: &quot;Back To School is Rodney Dangerfield&apos;s seminal work if you discount his brilliant turn as Mr Burns&apos; son Larry in the Simpsons. He even has an Annie Hall moment inwhich Kurt Vonnegut sort of plays the Marshall McLuhan role. I wonder if Kurt thought Back to School was his great work?&quot; And that&apos;s enough of that, in more ways than one. Mooney is out: sprinting a quick single but failing to beat Tait&apos;s throw from mid-on. Right I&apos;m done, gone, you won&apos;t see me. Till tomorrow, when I&apos;ll be back here. In the meantime, I&apos;m leaving you with the oh so capable Paolo Bandini, who&apos;ll be happy to answer all your questions as Ireland romp to a famous win against Australia.

It will be another monstrous engineering work that risks environmental disaster, and will cost upward of $5 billion. Whatever transpires, it will be another episode in the extraordinary story of western man&apos;s compulsion to wrestle with nature in the central American swamps and rainforests. Ever since, in 1513, the Spanish explorer Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa stood with the Atlantic behind him &quot;silent upon a peak in Darien&quot;, and saw for the first time with European eyes the unknown Pacific just 40-odd miles away, the linking of the oceans had been a great cause. For some it promised to unify the world, for others to bring infinite riches. Panama was one of five possible routes surveyed and to this strange spit of land were drawn between 1870 and 1913 idealists, dreamers, speculators, soldiers, scoundrels, bankers, statesmen, and an army of labourers who came mainly from the British West Indies. The artist Paul Gauguin was one of the few who went and made his fortune. Vast numbers never returned. Crossing the isthmus, says Matthew Parker, a historian equally at home with geography, central American politics and Victorian medical advances, was closer to waging war - against the forests and mountains of Panama - than it was to other engineering projects. In the 30 years that the canal took to build, he says, at least 25,000 people died of fevers and accidents, and many more were maimed or debilitated. In that time a mountain was literally laid waste by men with shovels and gunpowder; more than 300m cubic yards of rock and spoil were extracted. This was history&apos;s greatest engineering marvel, the most expensive and deadly enterprise ever attempted. Victory, it was said, would be an achievement for mankind. Parker does justice to this political and social drama. This was the culmination of the Victorian dream of progress, the last great act of nations before the first world war. The elite truly believed they could do anything, at whatever human or ecological price, and the forces of progress would prevail. They did, but at what cost. This was war waged not just on the rocks and the trees by humans, but on whoever came to Panama for the cause. Typhoid, dysentery, smallpox, pneumonia, yellow fever and above all a vicious form of malaria were rampant. Three out of four French engineers died within months of arriving; in 1885 70 men in every 1,000 died. In 1906 nearly 22,000 men were treated for illness and 80% of the workforce had malaria. Five hundred lives were lost for every mile of canal dug. One West Indian remembered: &quot;You turn up in the morning with a gang of 125 men and by 11 o&apos;clock 40 of them fall down with malaria. They spin like a top before they fall&quot;. Why did these brave men flock to work in such conditions? They were desperate for cash, but underpinning the whole enterprise, argues Parker, were concepts of national duty, patriotism and self-denial for the greater good. For the campaign generals the draw was history itself. Ferdinand de Lesseps, fresh from his triumph completing the Suez canal, woefully overreached both himself and France by opting for a sea-level route. In its last years the project was guided by the American president Theodore Roosevelt, who arrogantly claimed that he alone had &quot;taken the isthmus&quot; and started the project. He told the workforce they were soldiers in &quot;one of the few great wars of the world&apos;s history&quot;. Did the end justify the means? Parker notes the poet Heinrich Goethe&apos;s prediction in the 1820s that the canal would have &quot;incalculable results&quot;, which turned out to include the dawn of an age of American imperialism and of state-sponsored great projects; but he is ambivalent on the environmental cost. Today other armies of impoverished workmen build Dubai, Shanghai or the Three Gorges Dam with barely a murmur of the real price paid by them and by nature. It is a shame. We need writers capable of depicting these epic projects with the same skill Parker brings to portraying the 19th century&apos;s great engineering dream.", "tags": ["Books", "History", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-04-14T22:45:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/17/tennis.sport", "sentences": ["With two new joint men&apos;s and women&apos;s tournaments scheduled for Shanghai and Madrid in 2009, the Monte Carlo and Hamburg Masters have come under threat of being downgraded."], "title": "Tennis: Murray a doubt after spasms", "article": "The central court at the country club here is the most sublime setting in world tennis, especially on a day such as yesterday when the weather was still and warm and the Mediterranean like deep blue glass. But there was trouble in paradise. Late in the evening Andy Murray, when playing a first-round doubles match with his brother Jamie, injured his back and was forced to retire when a set down, although he hopes to play his first-round match against France&apos;s Marc Gicquel today. &quot;I hit a shot and my back went into spasms and it got worse and worse after every game. So now I just have to see what it&apos;s going to feel like tomorrow,&quot; Murray said. Earlier in the day there had been rumours that he was unwell, although by lunchtime the 19-year-old Scot, who entered the world&apos;s top 10 this week, emerged to say he was well, despite appearing decidedly pale. Murray had been at pains to underline his new level of fitness on Sunday, although his coach, Brad Gilbert, had said he was still not 100% after injuring his groin during the Miami Masters when he was knocked out 6-1, 6-0 in the semi-finals by Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic. Prior to that he had fallen during the Indian Wells Masters and hurt his hip and knee. Tim Henman&apos;s problems were more obvious in losing 7-5, 6-2 to the former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain. This tournament has served the Briton well over the years, establishing him as a clay-court performer of considerable reputation, culminating in his semi-final appearance at the French Open three years ago. Now, as he approaches his 33rd birthday, Henman&apos;s body, and particularly his back, increasingly rebels. Much was made of his return to the Davis Cup against the Netherlands this month, with the captain John Lloyd greeting him like the prodigal. Henman duly won both his matches in the 4-1 win that took Britain into a world group play-off later this year but not without cost. His back seized up afterwards, minimising his preparation for this tournament and underlining the relative fragility of his physical state. Henman has played only five matches on the ATP Tour this year and yesterday&apos;s defeat by Ferrero left him still with just one win. He began well enough and might have established a decisive first-set lead with a little more luck. Then at 5-5 he missed a backhand volley off a ball that may have been drifting out and from that point the Spaniard&apos;s confidence increased while Henman grew in frustration. &quot;The back is unpredictable. It has been good for long periods but it flares up,&quot; he said. Flare-ups were a theme yesterday, with leading players getting more angry at the way that Etienne de Villiers, the president of the ATP, is trying to force changes to the calendar. With two new joint men&apos;s and women&apos;s tournaments scheduled for Shanghai and Madrid in 2009, the Monte Carlo and Hamburg Masters have come under threat of being downgraded. Both are resorting to legal retaliation. The players, who co-own the ATP with the tournaments, believe they are being railroaded into change without due consultation. Roger Federer, the world No1, sitting alongside his great rival Rafael Nadal of Spain, described the players&apos; plea for more time as &quot;a little scream for help&quot;. It is fast growing into a full-blooded yell. Henman could proffer no easy solution. &quot;I sympathise with Etienne, who is trying to make scheduling changes for the benefit of the game, but it&apos;s a pretty unfortunate scenario where you have the ATP made up of 50% players and 50% tournaments effectively suing itself. I think there are quite a few players who feel that perhaps we would be better off as a separate organisation.&quot; Rebellion is in the air. The ITF, the overall governing body of tennis, also came under fire from Federer for not changing the scheduling of the Davis Cup, which the men want played immediately after the four grand slam championships. Francesco Ricci Bitti, the ITF president, at once issued a statement assuring the players that the federation was working &quot;quietly behind scenes&quot;. Pride of place British players who have made world top 10.

Very comfortable. Very, very good,&quot; said the 20-year-old Mallorcan, which sounds like bad news for his opponents. Not that Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic was overawed any more than one would expect from the youngest player in the top 10. Was he going to be the one to beat Nadal on clay? &quot;I hope so,&quot; he said after defeating the 2004 French Open champion Gaston Gaudio of Argentina 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 for a place in the last 16. And did he think he could? &quot;Yes.&quot; Djokovic has already defeated the Spaniard on the United States hard courts this season and last year had his best grand slam championship at Roland Garros, reaching the last eight before retiring when two sets down against Nadal. &quot;I am much more mentally and physically stronger this year,&quot; said the 19-year-old, one week younger than Andy Murray, whom he has beaten twice this year. Djokovic, mature and confident, reached the finals of the two previous Masters events, losing to Nadal in Indian Wells and beating Argentina&apos;s Guillermo Canas in Miami. The possibility of Monte Carlo being dropped as a Masters series event, currently comprising the top nine tournaments outside of the four majors, appears to have receded after a lengthy meeting on Tuesday between Etienne de Villiers, the president of the ATP, the world&apos;s top two players Roger Federer and Nadal and Croatia&apos;s Ivan Ljubicic, president of the player council. Federer had called for greater consultation over the 2009 calendar and it is probable the Masters series will remain at the current number and not be reduced to eight. Madrid will move from the autumn to the spring as a clay-court tournament and Shanghai will be added in the autumn.

After reaching a 26-year-high on Wednesday, the pound dipped to within a whisker of the $2-level against the US currency on the foreign exchange markets after it was revealed that China - already expanding faster than any other economy - has failed to respond to previous attempts to put on the brakes. Data released in Beijing showed that the economy grew at an annual pace of more than 11% in the first quarter - an acceleration from the 10.4% growth in the last three months of 2006. The expansion was driven by investment and exports rather than consumer spending, with a rise in inflation above 3% for the first time in two years, stoking speculation that the Chinese authorities will have to tighten monetary policy further. The Shanghai composite index closed down 4.5% yesterday on worries over higher interest rates, while US stock markets initially lost ground as investors fretted that American exports could be hit by a slowdown in China. On the foreign exchanges, investors bought large quantities of the yen, a move that helped to undermine the value of sterling. Copper prices, too, fell back on fears that demand from China might slow if interest rates rise. That, in turn, punished the share prices of mining companies such as Anglo-American, Xstrata and BHP Billiton, which extract copper and other metals. Copper fell to $7,915 a tonne, down from Tuesday&apos;s peak of $8,100. The drop in mining stocks also weighed on the FTSE 100, which fell 8.8 points to 6440.6, but an expected early tumble on Wall Street failed to materialise following news of strong profits at US companies. Analysts said higher rates in China were inevitable. &quot;Tightening measures are a matter of when, not if. The authorities have tightened a lot already this year, including the March interest rate hike,&quot; said Tim Condon at ING financial markets. &quot;In view of this I still expect the authorities to wait and see the April data before tightening further.&quot; China&apos;s benchmark one-year deposit rate is 2.79% and the equivalent lending rate is 6.39%. Both were raised on March 17. The central bank, the People&apos;s Bank of China, in an effort to rein in an investment boom, has already raised interest rates once and increased banks&apos; required reserves three times this year. Many analysts expect further moves soon. The premier, Wen Jiabao, underlined the need for vigilance, saying the authorities needed to take timely measures to prevent the economy from overheating. &quot;We need to prevent the economy from shifting from relatively fast growth to a state of overheating and to prevent big ups and downs,&quot; he said. &quot;We will work hard to keep basic stability in the overall level of prices,&quot; he told a regular cabinet meeting. The national bureau of statistics said annual consumer price inflation reached 3.3% in March, the first time it has gone above 3% - the central bank&apos;s comfort level - in more than two years. Statistics agency spokesman Li Xiaochao said the economy might be on its way towards overheating. &quot;Whether we need to raise interest rates depends on whether our economy will turn to overheating from fairly fast. If this happens, interest rates need to be raised. If this does not happen, then there is no need to raise them,&quot; he said. Analysts had expected inflation to rise but not as far as it did. &quot;A 3.3% rise in CPI inflation in March will greatly boost the possibility of an interest rate hike,&quot; said Gene Ma, an economist with CITIC Securities in Beijing. The figures prompted some analysts to raise their forecasts for full-year growth. Standard Chartered increased its 2007 forecast to 10.6% from 9.6% while JP Morgan upped its forecast to 10.8% from 10%. &quot;Another big number proves that China&apos;s supertanker economy is still nowhere near slowing,&quot; Stephen Green, an economist with Standard Chartered in Shanghai.", "tags": ["Interest rates", "Money", "Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-04-19T23:07:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/apr/22/houseprices.property", "sentences": ["&apos;It speaks the new universal language of English, has an easy air hub at Heathrow, good schools, a welcoming tax regime for foreign owners, and the world&apos;s financial capital in the City.&apos; In the past year Peerless has visited Singapore, Dubai, the US and (three times) Shanghai, to explain London&apos;s property market to wealthy would-be buyers."], "title": "Billionaires in battle to buy London's best homes", "article": "It could be the stuff of World War III: Arabs, Americans and Russians trying to outfox each other and seize control of valuable land. A new terror crisis? A stormy session of the United Nations? No: this is a typical scene from central London&apos;s super-wealthy and overheated housing market, where the rich and famous compete for the rarest of commodities - a perfect property in a prime location. The whole of the London property market may be hot at the moment, with the average asking price nearly \u00a3379,000, according to property website Rightmove, but central west London - from Kensington and Holland Park in the west, through Bayswater to the north of Hyde Park, past the mews of Mayfair and Knightsbridge and down to Belgravia and Chelsea in the south - is at melting point. According to Rightmove, in Kensington and Chelsea average property prices have soared by \u00a3120,000 to \u00a31,329,878 in the past month and by \u00a3620,000 in a year. There are two reasons for this extraordinary increase: the first is pure economics: there are far more wealthy buyers than there are homes for sale. The second is status: when the world&apos;s wealthiest buyers want to add another prestigious address to their real estate portfolio, they look to Pimlico rather than Paris, to Marylebone instead of Manhattan. &apos;London has what the world&apos;s richest people want - security,&apos; says Charles Peerless of Winkworth estate agents. &apos;It speaks the new universal language of English, has an easy air hub at Heathrow, good schools, a welcoming tax regime for foreign owners, and the world&apos;s financial capital in the City.&apos; In the past year Peerless has visited Singapore, Dubai, the US and (three times) Shanghai, to explain London&apos;s property market to wealthy would-be buyers. &apos;The number of high net-worth individuals (HNWIs) is expanding more rapidly in North America than in Europe for the first time since 2001, while Singapore, South Africa, Hong Kong, India and Australia have seen the highest growth in HNWI numbers,&apos; explains Liam Bailey of Knight Frank, an estate agent that at any one time has about 300 of London&apos;s most expensive homes on its sales books. Bailey says Britons now buy only half of the most expensive homes in prime central London, where apartments routinely cost over \u00a31m and houses usually over \u00a32.5m. That share drops to just 40 per cent of the &apos;super-top-end&apos; homes costing more than \u00a34m. The surge in overseas interest means central London&apos;s market is the hottest in the country and now operates to totally different rules to those of other major cities in the UK. For one thing, foreign buyers don&apos;t have a home to sell in London, so they add to demand without helping to maintain supply. Therefore prices go up faster and competition intensifies. Another issue is safety. &apos;Security is key,&apos; says Peerless. &apos;Although fear of terrorism has eased, there&apos;s a lot of concern that any property lived in by a wealthy buyer&apos;s family must have the security associated with exclusive new developments in the very prime areas of London - CCTV, direct access from underground car parks to flats, and so on.&apos; The underlying economic attraction of London has rarely been stronger. City bonus payments this winter have hit \u00a38.8bn, of which about 60 per cent will be spent on property, mostly in London. Oxford Economic Forecasting, a consultancy, says the City&apos;s financial institutions - where average annual pay is already over \u00a3120,000 - will add another 12,700 to their staff by late 2007. Over 65 per cent of Fortune&apos;s Global 500 companies, a key barometer of the world&apos;s financial operations, have chosen London as their European or world headquarters, and the capital has more foreign banks than any other city. So where does this leave British buyers in the capital? &apos;Wealthy Brits buy a small mews house or pied-a-terre in London, then have a main house or estate in the country,&apos; says Robert Bailey, who believe the summer will see another influx of foreign buyers just as domestic purchasers start their holidays. &apos;If Britons want a substantial house in the capital, they&apos;ll probably find themselves relegated to south London - Battersea, Wandsworth or Clapham,&apos; suggests Bailey. &apos;These are lovely houses, of course, but a little further away from the action in the centre. That&apos;s where the rest of the world is.&apos; Where the money is Belgravia Property: It doesn&apos;t get much grander than this - think big, then bigger again.

So it was for Roger Federer, the world No1, when Rafael Nadal arrived on the other side of the net for this Masters series clay-court final. One minute all was as smooth as glass, the next the 20-year-old Spaniard has slewed past him leaving turmoil and frustration. Nadal beat Federer 6-4, 6-4, his fifth successive win against him on this surface including last year&apos;s finals here, Rome and Paris. In doing so, he extended his unbeaten clay-court run to a remarkable 67 matches, and also became the first player since Romania&apos;s Ilie Nastase from 1971-73 to win the title on three consecutive occasions. Someday, perhaps when the wind is in the east and a blue moon climbs above the horizon, he will be beaten, although for the moment nothing short of an injury seems likely to stop him. Federer always knows that he will need to be at his absolute best to down the French Open champion on the terre battue. The nearest he has come so far was the tumultuous five-set final in the Rome Masters last year. This time he was never particularly close although for 38 minutes, and with the score at 4-3 in the opening set, he had some reason to believe he might stop the unstoppable. Twice, while trying to nail Nadal&apos;s serve, it was his forehand that let him down. It was to become a theme. Federer knows he has to press and take risks, however such is the pace and mule-kicking spin that Nadal puts on the ball that Federer&apos;s footwork must be Fred Astaire perfect in order that his every shot is delivered with optimum speed and angle. And there lies the difficulty. Nadal does not play soft points. His level of intensity is simply remarkable, so much so that any young player who might doubt the correlation between effort and success needs only watch him once. Before losing to Nadal in Monte Carlo last year, Federer was of the opinion that the more he played against him, the better his chances were of ultimate success, even suggesting that the Spaniard&apos;s game was a little &quot;one-dimensional&quot;. If so, it is a dimension that he has yet to fathom on clay where Federer&apos;s most potent weapons, the serve and forehand, are robbed of the razor edge they have on grass or hardcourts. Before this 10th meeting, Federer had reduced Nadal&apos;s head-to-head advantage to 6-3 by beating him in last year&apos;s Wimbledon final, and then again in the semi-finals of the Tennis Masters Cup on the Shanghai hardcourts. Yet whatever confidence or optimism those two victories instilled were quickly dissipated by the young man&apos;s near infallibility on the clay, leaving Federer to strain as much for answers afterwards as he did for solutions on court. The pair have now played 19 sets on clay, with Federer winning only five. Despite this obvious disparity, Federer continues to cling to the belief that the margin between success and failure is a matter of a few shots: &quot;It&apos;s his No1 surface, not mine, but I still always come so close,&quot; he said. &quot;I should have used the chances when I had them early on. Unfortunately it turned around with a few mistakes. I think I&apos;m absolutely in the mix with him on clay, which is how I wanted to feel. I enjoy playing against him and I think [it is] the same for him.&quot; Had Federer not won 10 grand slam titles and dominated almost everybody else in the world, this might be deemed to be bordering on delusional. Nadal was asked what he thought Federer might need to improve in order to beat him on clay. The Spaniard&apos;s expressive eyebrows almost shot off his head. &quot;What can I say when he has won 10 slams against my two,&quot; he said. Nadal still refuses to consider himself as a favourite against Federer on the slow surface. &quot;I knew now you were going to have this question for me. I&apos;m going to have to say the same thing: he&apos;s the world number one and he&apos;s the favourite,&quot; he said. He also felt that Federer had been playing the better tennis initially, and that holding his serve for 4-4 had been a significant moment. Federer knows that however many slams he may ultimately win, he needs the French Open title if he is ever to be acclaimed the greatest of all time. And as long as Nadal remains fit, that task continues to look an increasingly tall order.

Mr Yang, a former ambassador to the US with close links to the Bush family, studied in Britain in the 1970s before becoming friends with George Bush senior when the latter ran the US liaison office in Beijing.  The 56-year-old helped interpret for the future president on trips around the country, with Mr Bush reportedly nicknaming him &quot;Tiger&quot;. Today&apos;s mini-reshuffle - which also saw the ministers of resources and science and technology step down - was announced by China&apos;s state-run Xinhua news agency. The removal of Mr Li had been widely expected because, at the age of 66, he was &quot;already a year past the customary retirement age&quot;. However, he had been expected to stay in the job until the five-yearly congress of the ruling Communist party later this year, which traditionally thrashes out top appointments. The change of minister is unlikely to mean much in substantive terms because China&apos;s foreign policy is overwhelmingly set by the president, Hu Jintao, and a handful of other top leaders. However, analysts said the appointment of Mr Yang - who spent almost 13 years in the US, working at the embassy in the 1980s and 90s before returning as ambassador between 2001 and 2005 - was a clear signal of the importance Beijing gives to ties with Washington. During his period as ambassador, Mr Yang &quot;was said to be able to tread a fine line in both firmly defending China&apos;s national interests and maintaining smooth and stable ties with the United States&quot;, Xinhua reported. While Mr Li was also a former ambassador to Washington before becoming minister, he was known for his sometimes pugnacious attitude. While in the US, he led severe criticism of the 1999 bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war. In contrast, Mr Yang tends to take a more low-key in approach. Soon after becoming ambassador in 2001, he helped defuse a potentially explosive stand-off when the crew of a US spy plane were detained for 11 days on the southern Chinese island of Hainan after their craft collided with a Chinese fighter jet, killing the pilot. The Shanghai native first left China in the early 1970s, escaping the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution when he was sent to study in England, first at Bath University and then at the London School of Economics. There had been speculation that, despite his reputation, he might not rise any further because of his history of heart trouble, leading some to question whether he could keep up the tough travel schedule of a foreign minister. In wider terms, the reshuffle marks a further sign of Mr Hu&apos;s grasp on power nearly five years after he took the top job in the Communist party - the traditional precursor to becoming president - at the last congress. Two of the departing ministers, Mr Li and the outgoing science and technology minister, Xu Guanhua, were closely linked to Mr Hu&apos;s predecessor, Jiang Zemin.

We called him Coulton in the article below. This has been corrected.  Fancy spending your sandwich year mouldering in a regional backwater with no-hoper colleagues akin to the cast of The Office? Not especially? Then let loose your imagination to visualise your fantasy work placement - and then get ready for the hard slog of securing it. &quot;Twelve-month placements are increasingly competitive - often as competitive as graduate jobs,&quot; says Darren Scott, head of the work placement centre at Leeds University. &quot;Especially with the bigger organisations, the process you have to go through is exactly the same as for a graduate position.&quot; Emma Hogg, 21, who is studying for a BA in fashion design at Leeds, agrees. When she decided to work for a small, luxury designer that would give her hands-on experience, she applied to the exclusive bespoke womenswear designer Elspeth Gibson. So did hundreds of others. Eight months on and now deeply immersed in the small team which conjures up dreamy frocks for celebrity clients attending the Oscars and Baftas, Hogg still seems a little dazed at the outcome. &quot;I found out later that they interviewed for the position all week, and only had one 12-month placement to offer,&quot; she says. So, what made her application stand out? &quot;I think it&apos;s getting a really good fit with you as a person and what the placement will involve. I love the femininity of Elspeth Gibson&apos;s designs and I researched her work, especially when it came to preparing for the interview,&quot; she says. Being on a respected course was also helpful when her boss Lisa Redman was sifting through sheaves of CVs. &quot;I knew that the standard of the Leeds fashion degree was high because I&apos;ve had a student from there before, and so I knew Emma&apos;s skills would be excellent just to have been accepted on the course,&quot; Redman explains. But technical and artistic skills are only a part of getting a top-rated placement. Having the right personality to fit in and work happily in Elspeth Gibson&apos;s small team was crucial. Redman also needed her sandwich-year student to be able to deal diplomatically with high-profile and demanding clients. Liaising with celebrities and drawing lovely pictures of floaty dresses that cost upwards of \u00a34,000 isn&apos;t all this kind of placement entails. You&apos;ll need the right attitude to flourish in a highpressure environment where you can switch from creative diva to delivery woman in an instant. &quot;I&apos;ve had a student come here for a interview and announced : &apos;I&apos;m not a DHL delivery service, I&apos;m a designer&apos;,&quot; says Redman . &quot;But the smart ones know it&apos;s a chance to network, to get to know stylists, photographers and specialist fabric people. That&apos;s really invaluable later on in your career if you build up relationships and can make that part of the job work for you.&quot; Unusually for a sandwich year - though not for the ferociously competitive fashion industry - Hogg&apos;s placement isn&apos;t salaried. Most students do get paid, says Scott, and salaries for the most prestigious jobs can be in the region of \u00a327,000 . That&apos;s more than Jacob Colton, 22, is paid to drive around in his Astroturf covered grassy van, but given that he presumably has unlimited access to Innocent smoothies in his role as a Berry Persuasive salesperson, he&apos;s not complaining. When he applied in his second year of a business information systems degree at Oxford Brookes, he was one of 200 students chasing just two placements at Innocent&apos;s Fruit Towers HQ. Having squeezed his way down to the last four, Colton almost missed out, until a third placement was created for him in the new business development team. &quot;Innocent has just launched into schools, so I&apos;m out and about a lot in my grassy van talking to local education authorities and headteachers and sampling our Fruit Wedges with children,&quot; he explains. &quot;We have a strategy for getting smoothies into the education sector, but within that I&apos;m given a lot of freedom as to how I persuade schools to stock our stuff.&quot; Being left to his own devices has, Colton explains, cultivated his ability to work on his own initiative, and selling smoothies to council officials, pupils, parents, caterers and teachers all in the space of a single day has honed his negotiation and presentation skills, as well as requiring him to adapt swiftly to each new audience. No matter what your degree , it seems that communication, communication, communication is the acidtest of a sandwich-year workie. Bjorn Emtage, 21, taking a BSc in cruise operations management at Plymouth University, says that the customer service element of his placement as a junior assistant purser on liners sailing around Alaska, Russia, Shanghai, Beijing and the Caribbean can be stressful. &quot;The chance to travel is a top perk, but part of the day-to-day job is dealing politely with people complaining their food is cold or the loos aren&apos;t working,&quot; he explains. &quot;It&apos;s a real challenge and a learning experience - you definitely develop better people-handling skills.&quot; Mirra Sondhi, 22, an electronics and communications engineering student from Leeds, won the 2006 Year in Industry undergraduate business award, for her mobile workflow management system she researched and designed from scratch for Alpheus Environmental.

Critics said A1GP - a novel concept with each team representing a different country - would not see out its first season, never mind enjoy a gradual growth in credibility that the organisers hope will draw more than 70,000 fans to the Kent track this weekend. The attraction was further increased yesterday when Team Great Britain&apos;s Robbie Kerr qualified on pole for the first of two races today, the Englishman beating Germany and France despite sliding on to the grass during his out lap from the pits. This will be the final round of a championship designed to run throughout the European winter months. The schedule makes it clear that A1GP does not intend to rival either Formula One or GP2, the junior formula that supports grand-prix meetings and spawned F1 drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. GP2 is popular thanks to close racing among potential F1 stars and a plan by Bernie Ecclestone to consider a winter GP2 series is being seen as a threat to A1GP. It could also be interpreted as a sign that A1GP is worth worrying about. In the past, Ecclestone has been accused of crushing any racing series that might erode the popularity of his F1 powerbase. Such a motive is unlikely in this instance. If anything, A1GP and F1 could work together by helping cover the drop in revenue in their respective closed seasons. A GP2 winter championship would lose much of its attraction through not being part of a grand-prix weekend and, in any case, GP2 lacks the appeal unique to A1GP. The concept of country against country - there are 22 represented at Brands Hatch - has attracted sponsors new to motor racing. &apos;We&apos;ve attracted support from companies that have previously shown no interest in motor racing,&apos; said Mark Gallagher, joint owner of Team Ireland. &apos;LM Developments, for example, is an Irish property company that&apos;s never been involved before. They were not interested in sponsoring a driver - as you would in GP2 - but they are interested in any sporting event that has a sense of occasion and enjoys a strong Irish connection. A1GP fits the bill perfectly because it is about the country, each car being painted in national colours in what amounts to a world cup of motor sport.&apos; Such a theme has prompted the claim that A1GP does little to nurture drivers in preparation for F1. It is a debatable point since the first race at Brands Hatch was won by Nelson Piquet Junior (currently a driver in waiting with the Renault GP team) and this year&apos;s championshipwinning team, Germany, have highlighted the superb talent of Nico Hulkenberg, a 19-year-old who is already under the care of Willi Weber, the manager who shepherded Michael Schumacher through F1. Hulkenberg won eight races as the championship moved through countries such as Holland, New Zealand, Czech Republic and South Africa, many of which do not support F1. By performing in Indonesia and China, A1GP could be doing F1 a favour and paving the way for a grand prix. On the other hand, the return to Brands Hatch, with its swoops and blind fourth-gear corners, serves as a reminder of the type of traditional track that F1 is leaving behind in the pursuit of dollars on offer from emerging nations keen to promote their image on new but generally bland tracks. Zandvoort in Holland is no longer used for F1, but the popularity of the Dutch track was emphasised tlast week when 15,000 tickets were sold on line during the first day of sale for September&apos;s opening round of the 2007-2008 A1GP championship, an indication of the formula&apos;s appeal and a confidence to be prepared for a new season before the old one has finished. Today&apos;s pair of races will settle second place in the championship with Britain, very much the team on form, looking to close the 14-point gap to New Zealand. Kerr, who won and finished second in the last pair of races in Shanghai, is in line to make Britain the first team to win at home. Counting the number of spectators who turn out to see if he does it will be as important to the A1GP organisers as the quality of racing that, so far, has been close and exciting enough to catch the attention of Ecclestone and other curious F1 personnel making the journey today to the former home of the British Grand Prix.", "tags": ["Motor sport", "Sport", "A1GP"], "publicationDate": "2007-04-28T23:01:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/30/china.jonathanwatts", "sentences": ["Beijing has been trying to rein in corruption for several years, but despite a handful of high-profile arrests \u2014 such as Chen Liangyu, the party secretary of Shanghai \u2014 the problem remains endemic.", "Four months later, the director of the national bureau of statistics, Qiu Xiaohua, was sacked amid claims that he milked public funds to maintain a bigamous relationship with a woman in Shanghai."], "title": "China's corruption crackdown enters the bedroom", "article": "China&apos;s 6.5 million civil servants were warned today they could be fired for keeping a mistress or neglecting elderly relatives, under new ethical guidelines aimed at curbing rampant corruption.

Birmingham University&apos;s professor of modern English language (1965-2000), he was a pioneer in the field of discourse analysis, a superb lexicographer, and an outstanding corpus linguist, whose books are compulsory reading for any serious language student. John was Scottish and proud of it - I remember him piping in the haggis on Burns Night in full kilted regalia. He went to George Heriot&apos;s school in Edinburgh, and took a first in English language and literature at Edinburgh University. After RAF national service he returned to the city as a research student in 1958 and was quickly appointed to a lecturership in English language and general linguistics. Then, at just 31 and with barely a publication to his name, he was appointed to the foundation chair at Birmingham. This turned out to be the making of the university&apos;s reputation as a world centre for English language studies. A paper in a volume in memory of JR Firth in 1966 showed the direction his work would take. Strikingly up to date, it defines the collocation - the tendency for words to associate with each other in partly arbitrary ways - now deemed central in descriptive linguistics but counter to most of the then current theories of language. He ran one of the first research projects in computational linguistics, and its continued relevance is indicated by the fact that the 1970 report on that project was republished three years ago. At the same time he directed a research team producing innovative task-based language development materials for the children of West Indian immigrants. In 1972, he published a competent but unoriginal account of English grammar. It was a commissioned work, but he never again allowed his research agenda to be set for him. In 1975 he published, with Malcolm Coulthard, one of his greatest works, Towards the Analysis of Discourse, the first truly systematic account of a genre of spoken discourse. He and Coulthard show that the hierarchy of structures that operate in grammar can be applied effectively to exchanges in the classroom. In the late 1970s John became chief adviser to Collins on its English Dictionary, and on the strength of this, and his work on collocation, he proposed a new kind of dictionary for advanced learners of English, written from scratch on computers and involving the creation of the largest corpus of English language texts in the world. He collected a team of gifted linguists and lexicographers, and the result was the Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary (1987). This dictionary was the first to show how the collocations of a word affect its meaning, the first to use authentic and representative examples drawn from a corpus, and the first to use a natural defining language. It was also the first to take seriously the possibility that a dictionary might have an important part to play in improving students&apos; writing and speaking as well as helping with their reading and listening. Today all major advanced learners&apos; dictionaries have engaged with these features. In 1991, John published his second masterwork, Corpus, Concordance, Collocation, the bible for a generation of corpus linguists. In it he explains in deceptively simple English how collocations can be identified and what their implications are for a proper description of English. Here too he proposed his revolutionary &quot;idiom principle&quot;. According to this, when we speak or write, we make use of semi-preconstructed phrases, and these account for fluency in speech, with grammar being used as a fall-back resource when we run out of suitable semi-preconstructed phrases. In 1995, John took partial retirement from the university, but there was a continued flow of publications. In Reading Concordances (2003), he gave practical advice in corpus linguistics, but it was Trust the Text (2004) his third masterwork, that took this area of research forward. In this book he proposed a new way of describing lexical items, identifying their grammatical and semantic patterns and their &quot;semantic prosodies&quot; (crudely, their communicative effect on the reader or listener). Linear Unit Grammar (2006), co-authored with Anna Mauranen, revisits the idiom principle and absorbs it into an integrated theory of grammar. It is likely that this will posthumously be recognised as a further major contribution to our understanding of English. Helped by his second wife, Elena Tognini Bonelli, he founded the Tuscan Word Centre. Located in Certosa di Pontignano, it became famous for corpus-based language research and ran courses for budding corpus linguists, thereby training a generation of researchers. John was an honorary life member of the Linguistics Association of Great Britain, a member of the Academia Europaea, the holder of an honorary doctorate from Gothenburg University, and honorary professorships at Glasgow, Shanghai and Jiao Tong Shanghai, universities. John could be robust with equals but was unfailingly generous with his time and kind to anyone who sought his help. There are linguists all around the world who readily acknowledge their deep debt to him in this respect. He leaves Elena, their two children, and three from his first marriage. \u00b7 John McHardy Sinclair, academic and lexicographer, born June 14 1933; died March 13 2007", "tags": ["Education"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-02T23:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/03/motoring.lifeandhealth", "sentences": ["&quot;The DTI and the inspectors are intent on completing this inspection as quickly as possible, with due regard to the fairness of procedures, and the thoroughness of the task.&quot; Many of the assets of MG Rover and its sister company, Powertrain, were bought by the Chinese car maker, Nanjing Automobile Corporation, after a bidding war with the rival Chinese carmaker, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the company with which Rover had sought, unsuccessfully, to strike an alliance which it hoped would have kept it in business."], "title": "Rover inquiry costs \u00a38m and still not finished", "article": "The official inquiry into the events surrounding the demise of MG Rover two years ago has so far cost the taxpayer almost \u00a38.4m - more than the emergency loan granted by the government to pay workers&apos; wages in the immediate aftermath of the company&apos;s collapse.

This spring everyone wants to talk about the end of the world. There are signs everywhere. I spend an afternoon with my family digging in the local sandpit. &apos;This is mad,&apos; I say, smiling nervously as we build sand castles in the brilliant sunshine. We dutifully enjoy ourselves in all the ways we&apos;d normally save till the summer: gardening, barbecuing and lingering outside long into the evening.

I&apos;m waiting to pick the car up from its service on the Old Kent Road when a journalist calls to quiz me on my memories. Of course people already know about the rampant speed of development in Beijing and Shanghai. When we were shooting, there seemed to be a building site on every corner. Driving across Shanghai is like crossing several consecutive Manhattans and more. It&apos;s hard to fathom how on earth the world is going to cope with the vast impact of Chinese development. However, much of the film is set in a rural, cholera-ridden society, so we moved south to Guangxi province. This was a different story. We were lucky enough to film in remote villages five hours from the city of Guilin. Here we spent our days high in the extraordinary, nuggety Karst mountains far, far from Osterley tube station. These strange, crooked peaks sit like witches&apos; teeth overlooking small towns and agricultural villages up and down the range. This felt like a glimpse into a previously unseen China, where things will change far more slowly.

BAC is a unique venue. Over the years it has provided a ladder of development for independent theatre-makers by nurturing their ideas and shepherding them into production. Some of the most original work in the country begins at this hive. Earlier this year, David and his board managed to come up with a rescue plan for the theatre which will involve arts enthusiasts gradually taking actual ownership of the building. This is all terrific news because it means he can plan for the future. I readily accept his invitation to celebrate BAC&apos;s 25th birthday in the autumn.

When on form, I can perform these sequences so mindlessly that I can prolong the numbness of sleep through the lacing of shoes, the cursing at the radio right up to the losing of keys. When not on form, I&apos;m cutting the fruit when I should be feeding the cat. I think the goldfish may have suffered most in all this. But our goldfish are mysteriously resilient. When I enter the kitchen in the morning they group themselves into a trio, stare me out and howl in silent unison. Fascinating. A revenge of sorts arrives on set when I spend the afternoon having my head repeatedly dunked into a fish tank. I&apos;m the scapegoat of the St Trinian&apos;s staff room. Fenella Woolgar, playing a pugilistic PE teacher, apologises between takes, before she once again plunges me into another shoal of hungry-looking goldfish. Against the odds, the bursar - that&apos;s me - lives to fret another day. An email arrives from Allison Edwards at the Booktrust. I&apos;ve been piloting a creative writing project there, with Chris Meade as part of their Everybody Writes programme in schools. We&apos;ve been devising strategies to get children writing in new ways and new places. She has attached some magical photos of children playing with words: weaving, stringing, planting and sculpting sentences. One photo has a sign renaming the school library as &apos;a silent parlour of study&apos;. It is the proportions of the imminent environmental catastrophe that I&apos;m finding hard to reconcile. I switch off my lights and sort out my rubbish, but I also fight the private feelings of futility. Of course I hope and believe that it does make a difference but then someone asks me: &apos;Are you prepared to ditch the cellphone?&apos; Hmm, probably yes, but not yet. I try to cobble together some argument about a group needing to feel that a change is unavoidable... or some such. Then everyone starts talking about Adam Curtis&apos;s documentary series The Trap and how that articulated and explained the demise of group action. I was away, I missed the series. I need to see it. I venture into YouTube in search of Adam Curtis only to be distracted down several corridors - as always with YouTube. Then I sit in one of the smaller theatres at the Young Vic and watch Brecht&apos;s characters driving each other into action through the coherence and confidence of their belief and argument. It&apos;s like remembering a much earlier week in my life. The Jones CV  The Life: Born in Oxfordshire in 1967. Son of character actor Freddie Jones. Lives in London. Two daughters.

His remarkable legacy is his design work at such renowned institutions as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Horniman Museum, south London, and the Royal Museum of Scotland, as well as an eclectic mix of World Expo pavilions and prestigious visitor attractions. He was an influential member of a generation of communicative designers who transformed museums from hushed halls and dusty glass cases into lively and interactive educational environments that attract millions of visitors. John&apos;s grandmother, Countess Olga Cs\u00e1ky, and his father Alex came to England from Hungary in the 1920s. The family settled in Shrewsbury, where John, his twin Mick and younger brother Adrian were born. Their father was passionate about countryside pursuits, but John was happiest nurturing the rooks and squirrels that survived the shooting parties. His mother Mary, an English botanist, encouraged him to draw and paint from nature, establishing a lifelong love of the natural world. John attended Bedales school, in Hampshire, and Portsmouth School of Art, where, in 1967, he constructed a geodesic dome from dozens of hand-beaten metal rods. At the Royal College of Art he then designed his first theatre sets and exhibitions, and was inspired by Festival of Britain designer James Gardener and Sir Hugh Casson, who awarded John a silver medal for his student achievements. After college and with schoolfriend Richard Meade, John designed the lighting for the 1970 Isle of Wight festival, headlined by Jimi Hendrix, The Who and Joan Baez. At the end of his life, he was particularly nostalgic about this exciting first project. After working briefly for the brand consultant Wolff Olins, John moved to Buckinghamshire with his first wife, Iryna Pasznyk, to work for the architecture and planning division at Milton Keynes development corporation. His most notable achievement there was to design and subsequently run the 60,000 capacity Milton Keynes Bowl, which showcased a host of famous artists, including David Bowie, Queen, Sting and Bruce Springsteen. In 1985 he was invited by Fitch design consultancy to become director of a travel and leisure division, a collaboration which led to the innovative design of the Chinese gallery in the V&amp;A, a project close to John&apos;s heart. Dame Elizabeth Esteve-Coll, director of the museum at the time, recalls: &quot;John and the curators were constantly testing out new ideas, new approaches to display and challenging traditional museum interpretations. Working with John was fun, it was exacting and the TT Tsui gallery was, and is, spectacularly successful as a result.&quot; John also had &quot;great fun&quot; designing the British pavilion at World Expo &apos;88 in Brisbane and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia pavilion, the Navigation pavilion and the interior of the Puerto Rican pavilion in Seville &apos;92. He was an authority on international Expo design and his consultancy skills were recently sought for the British presence at the 2010 Expo in Shanghai. In 1993, John established his own highly successful practice, John Cs\u00e1ky Associates, in London, specialising in museums, exhibitions and visitor attractions. His most significant projects include Wildwalk@Bristol, Future Vision: This is Tomorrow for Granada, and The Hail pavilion for the Al Janadriyah festival in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The Deep, the futuristic aquarium in Hull, won the Museums and Heritage award for the best permanent exhibition in 2003. Sir Terry Farrell, the architect for the \u00a345m millennium project, said: &quot;John&apos;s contribution was critical to its success - always serious and consistent in all that he did, bringing his mature experience and wisdom to meetings. He has brought added joy to the lives of millions of visitors.&quot; In 2000 John Cs\u00e1ky Associates was sold to the Mice Group, where John designed a number of challenging international projects before moving with his colleagues to Portland Design in 2005. He was particularly proud of two of his final projects; the design of a religious theme park in Medina, Saudi Arabia, and Battle Abbey and battlefield for English Heritage. John was modest about his extraordinarily successful career, and did not see himself as a business person by nature. He was a courteous and honest man, motivated by each design challenge and forever on a somewhat old-fashioned quest for honesty, beauty and truth - qualities that sometimes set him apart from his contemporaries. His concern for the highest design standards was awesome, and nothing but excellence would satisfy him. He is survived by his second wife, Tina, their four-year-old son Alex, and two daughters, Taissa and Roxi, from his first marriage. \u00b7 John Cs\u00e1ky, designer, born August 31 1945; died April 5 2007", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2007-05-06T23:20:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/12/politicalcolumnists.politics", "sentences": ["She was with her husband, with whom she lives in Shanghai."], "title": "Simon Hoggart's week", "article": "Even we press persons know that, in the end, people aren&apos;t all that gripped by news. &quot;Blair resigns&quot;, &quot;terrorism swoop&quot;, &quot;five dead in M-way crash&quot; are interesting, even fascinating or horrible, but our own lives are always more immediate. Perhaps one day it will be possible to publish an e-newspaper which grades all news for us personally. &quot;Roof repairs: &apos;you&apos;re talking telephone numbers,&apos; says builder&quot; might be the lead story. &quot;Teenage boy&apos;s bedroom - still hopeless mess&quot; could be underneath, along with &quot;The big promotion: will it go to that bastard Nugent?&quot; How your favourite team got on last night might also make page 1, along with &quot;Hustle back on BBC1 - Thursday nights on TV improve.&quot; But some stories seem to swell up and mean almost as much to us as they do to the people condemned to live through them. I&apos;m sure I wasn&apos;t alone last week in almost beseeching fate to send Maddy McCann back to her parents, feeling the despair when it wasn&apos;t the lead story on the bulletin because nothing had developed, sensing the hope beginning to ebb away, hour by hour, day by day. Maddy is every parent&apos;s child. I remember my sister going missing on the old Queen Elizabeth as we crossed the Atlantic when she was eight and I was 10. We were ploughing through a storm, and I can still feel and almost taste my parents&apos; terror until the moment she turned up. Our two-year-old daughter toddled off in Miami airport once, and if you&apos;ve ever been to that modern Gehenna you&apos;ll know exactly how we felt. It&apos;s awful: we should be more concerned about &quot;thousands die in Darfur&quot; or even &quot;Kansas tornado kills 12&quot;. But Maddy has become woven into our lives, as much as our own children&apos;s illnesses, as much as our hopes, concerns and daily problems. (Oh, and I don&apos;t agree that the McCanns were irresponsible. All parents - except the most neurotic - leave their children at times. The Portugese authorities cannot say: &quot;They shamefully left them in harm&apos;s way&quot; and, at the same time: &quot;We didn&apos;t know how to cope because this kind of crime never happens here.&quot;) \u00b7 This is an astonishingly globalised world. Until I was 13 we lived in Hull, that fabled city on the Humber. This week, at our pub quiz, I met a very handsome woman, the niece of a friend. She was with her husband, with whom she lives in Shanghai. He was Dutch, but about to go off for a trip to America. Her parents live in Spain, and her brother in South Africa. She comes from Hull, and went to my old school. In my day a trip to Grimsby seemed faintly exotic. \u00b7 Dreadful but funny joke number 872: The mother superior gathers the nuns into the refectory. &quot;I have to tell you,&quot; she says gravely, &quot;that there is a case of gonorrhoea in the convent.&quot; A voice at the back pipes up: &quot;Yippee! I am so fed up with Chardonnay!&quot; \u00b7 The last Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, has now become the most pre-ordered title of all time, with 1.5m books already sold on Amazon alone, fully two months before publication. This is five times as many pre-orders as there are for all other books coming out this year. The other day a friend of mine signed up with a new literary agency, which also handles the author of Harry Potter. The chap who looks after him took him on a tour round the offices. At one point they looked into a room where eight busy people were sitting in front of computer screens, phones and directories to hand. He asked what they did and was told that they were all engaged, full time, in gathering JK Rowling&apos;s royalties from around the world. Most of us writers dream of producing a book that would keep one person busy for more than 20 minutes a year. \u00b7 Last week I found a second-hand bookstall in a market and spent \u00a32.50 on Alec Guinness&apos;s memoirs Blessings In Disguise, which I had never read, but is every bit as good as friends promised. It seems a little unfair that someone who was such a beguiling actor should have been such a skilful and engaging writer too. But what always strikes me about theatrical memoirs is how ephemeral the art is! A great deal of the time Guinness was appearing in the classics. But what were the popular hits of the day? Who remembers Evensong, or Daphne Laureola, or Moonlight Is Silver, or Richard Of Bordeaux, or Queer Cargo, or Mission to Galele, King Of Dahome, or Robert&apos;s Wife, or The Waters Of The Moon? Yet they all made the West End stage, often starring the finest actors of their day. \u00b7 Peter Mandelson seems to have given up his efforts to persuade Gordon Brown that he has now become his greatest friend in politics. It wouldn&apos;t have been much use. Brown is not someone who dispenses forgiveness with a light laugh and an invitation to share a few pints; Mandelson has not been shriven, and never will be, for deserting Brown in 1994 to clamber on to Blair&apos;s speeding bandwagon. I was chatting to an old Brussels hand the other day. &quot;Peter has made a terrible mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter whether he&apos;s been any good as a trade commissioner. If you are a commissioner you are regarded as the hotline to your own national government. If, like him, you admit that from July onwards you will be detested by your prime minister, you might as well pack it in now.&quot; \u00b7 This week I reported a speech by Oliver Letwin in which he used convoluted jargon - &quot;socio-paradigms&quot;, &quot;internalising externalities&quot; etc - as a means of poking fun at Gordon Brown. Since then he has been subject to constant abuse from some who have decided that he meant these phrases seriously. Tony Blair had a go on Wednesday. On Thursday Letwin was assailed by a Blimpish person in the Times letters page, and in the gossip column of the Daily Mail. It was a good joke, but like those off-colour gags that doom the careers of American politicians, it seems likely to haunt him forever.", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-11T23:05:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/14/business.china", "sentences": ["After a 130% gain in 2006, the Shanghai index is already 50% up this year.", "In February, a mere hint from Beijing that it might try to rein in markets knocked 9% off Shanghai stocks - and panicked Wall Street into its biggest one-day slide since 9/11."], "title": "Leader: Chinese economy", "article": "Capitalism with Chinese characteristics is how Beijing&apos;s high command describes its economy. Which must make its stock market a bubble with Chinese idiosyncrasies. The bubble part is familiar enough. The market locals invest in keeps charging into uncharted territory, last week vaulting over the 4,000-point level for the first time. After a 130% gain in 2006, the Shanghai index is already 50% up this year. Stupendous gains mean silly prices: bog-standard manufacturers are on dotcom valuations. What makes this bubble distinctive is its newness. Many millions are encountering shareholder capitalism for the first time - and they want in on it. A million share-dealing accounts were opened on April 30 alone, according to F&amp;C fund managers, more than the whole of 2005. The problem of employees trading in work time is such that businesses have been forced to introduce fines. A national headache to be sure but, like nearly everything else made in China, it can be exported. In February, a mere hint from Beijing that it might try to rein in markets knocked 9% off Shanghai stocks - and panicked Wall Street into its biggest one-day slide since 9/11. The link is more than psychological. As traditionally happens in bull runs, investors are putting more money into exotic places. The same thing preceded the Asian financial crisis, which began 10 years ago this summer. That was sparked by hot money, domestic and foreign, flooding into relatively primitive markets and causing wasteful over-investment. Only Dr Pangloss would see no similarity between then and now. This is not to say the bubble will burst soon. After all, China&apos;s economy is still growing at an extraordinary 11% a year. And policy-makers would hardly want a market meltdown to precede the Beijing Olympics next year. Still, they are getting anxious, especially as their prescription so far - tighter money - has not had the desired effect. Time was when a well-placed newspaper editorial (of all things) could induce caution. Yet last week&apos;s record smashing came despite a widely-reported warning about asset prices from the head of the central bank. Headiness in the stock market is symptomatic of the wider problems of an economy too skewed towards investment and exports. Beijing is concerned about both, and it is not alone. Ahead of their own big event next year - the elections - American politicians are getting increasingly assertive about the need for China to rebalance its economy in order to give US manufacturers some relief. The stock bubble will surely deflate.

Terrible aesthetics, miniscule lodgings and vile furniture all justified in the name of functionality. The global chains have become masters in the art of selling business travellers short (for often astronomical prices) but I implore you not to be fooled: a fast wireless connection will never be a substitute for beauty, warmth and character. You wouldn&apos;t design your house around your laptop, so why would you stay in a hotel room that does? Fortunately, the frequent flyer now has a choice \u2013 where all hotels used to look and feel the same, design visionaries (Schrager, Starck and Balazs among others) have radically changed the lie of the land over the last 15 years. The &quot;boutique hotel&quot; \u2013 rich in cutting-edge design, loaded with artistic merit and dripping with aesthetic appeal \u2013 has revolutionised leisure travel over that time.  The discerning jetsetter has stopped frequenting any kind of hotel chain (the Hyatt and Four Seasons excepted) for his precious vacation. The lure of a lodging with immaculate, personalised service, spacious rooms and impeccable design has simply become overwhelming. Businessmen are following suit. Indeed, as a community, I think our mood is changing. A hotel is no longer just for conducting business, executing email and sleeping for six hours. It&apos;s also for pleasure. The pleasure of eating and drinking well. The joy of conducting business or just lounging with clients and colleagues in a beautiful environment. And the thrill of being able to fly in your friends and family for an indulgent, hedonistic weekend. Here are my top ten hotel choices for mixing business with pleasure in the world&apos;s great cities: 1. The Mercer Hotel, New York Is there a better city hotel anywhere in the world? If there is, I haven&apos;t seen it. Gorgeous d\u00e9cor, large rooms (especially for SoHo), fabulous food and extraordinary service. The centre-piece, its understated but much photographed lobby, is the perfect lounge for a working lunch or an exuberant dinner. If you can, book a Loft Studio to sleep in; room 507 is especially brilliant. 2. Park Hyatt, Tokyo If it&apos;s good enough for Scarlett Johansson, it&apos;s good enough for you. The real star of Lost In Translation, this towering masterpiece is the best way of retreating after a bewildering working day in Tokyo. The New York Bar on the top floor is super-hip and the swimming pool/spa, on the 53rd floor, is breathtaking. The Diplomatic Suite, with its own library, dining room and grand piano, is a spectacular way to wow your clients.  3. Widder Hotel, Zurich An extraordinary project that took five years to complete, this Swiss lodging meshes together eight immaculately restored townhouses. No two of the 42 rooms are the same and yet the same philosophy imbues all of them: stunning interiors faithful to the original, historic design plus state-of-the-art technology (Bang &amp; Olufsen stereos are a particular highlight). The hotel&apos;s dog friendliness is an extra bonus. 4. Sukhothai, Bangkok &quot;An oasis of tranquillity&quot; may be a massively overused phrase in travel writing but it is a perfect description of this wonderful venue. The ridiculous hustle and bustle of Bangkok is quickly forgotten on entering the Sukhothai&apos;s beautifully sculpted grounds. Lounging by the pool and pottering around in your vast one-bedroom apartment are bound to be highlights. 5. Murano Urban Resort, Paris Paris is beginning to do boutique better than any other European city. Competition appears to increase by the day, but the Murano is surely still the best. It&apos;s restaurant \u2013 with stalactites hanging from the ceiling \u2013 looks as stunning as the models dining within. And its rooms, to be opened by fingerprint only, are fabulous: the suite with its own swimming pool is the one to book (if you can afford it). 6. Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower, Mumbai More grand than boutique, this Mumbai icon still deserves its place in the top 10. The haven of businessmen, politicians and celebrities for decades, the Taj maintains the very highest of standards. Its restaurants serve the finest Indian cuisine, its spotlessly clean pool doubles up as the hotel&apos;s social hub, and its club (Insomnia) is irrefutably the best in India. Best of all, the hotel makes every guest feel truly special.  7. Grand Hyatt, Shanghai The Hyatt delivers again (and remarkably it is a chain). Set on the top floors of the Jin Mao Tower, the highest hotel in the world is also one of its best. I can&apos;t ever remember more scrummy room service or more delightful cocktails. A wonderful base from which to enjoy the delights of China&apos;s best city. 8. The Setai, Miami If you have business in Miami, don&apos;t make the mistake of staying in faceless downtown. Stay on South Beach and enjoy the delights of this spectacular venue. Its funky neighbours \u2013 the Delano and the Shore Club \u2013 tend to try a little too hard, but the Setai strikes the perfect balance. Hip but laidback, its Asian-themed d\u00e9cor is unique in the US. The perfect place to fly your friends and family in for a holiday. 9. Hempel Hotel, London / Dylan Hotel, Amsterdam Anouska Hempel is something of a legend. Both of these signature hotels, splendidly located in Notting Hill and overlooking the Keizersgracht Canal respectively, have set new standards for boutique living in Europe. The gorgeous furnishings \u2013 almost exclusively black-and-white \u2013 are to die for. Never have hotels felt more like home.  10. Chateau Marmont, Los Angeles Built in 1929, this might be the world&apos;s first boutique hotel. The self-styled hotel of the stars, Marmont has a remarkable history \u2013 everyone who&apos;s anyone has stayed there and John Belushi famously died there. In the 1990s it was taken over by Andre Balazs, and the beauty and comfort of its hallowed turf has (remarkably) increased even further. Los Angeles simply wouldn&apos;t be the same without it.", "tags": ["Travel", "Hotels", "Business travel", "New York holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "Bangkok holidays", "Zurich holidays", "Paris holidays", "Mumbai holidays", "Shanghai holidays", "Miami holidays", "Los Angeles holidays", "Amsterdam holidays"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-14T11:58:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/15/marketforces1", "sentences": ["However the bank saw its 18.6% stake in China&apos;s Bank of Communications leap in value after the business floated on the Shanghai exchange."], "title": "Pubs get real estate bonus", "article": " Investors were toasting the listed pub companies day after positive news from Enterprise Inns.   Enterprise, the country&apos;s second biggest pub owner, reported first half profits in line with expectations but also said it hoped to convert to Reit status without having to split in two, an operating company and a property business.   Analysts have been suggesting that pub groups could benefit from the tax free status of Reits - real estate investment trusts - but may need to separate their property operations to do so. But Enterprise said it was talking to its advisers to see whether it could become a Reit without changing the company&apos;s structure.   Enterprise climbed 42.5p to 769.5p, but analysts gave a mixed reaction to the announcements.   Kaupthing recommended a buy, as did Evolution Securities, but Numis advised clients to reduce their holdings and suggested switching into Punch Taverns.   Citigroup issued a hold note with a 762p target. It said the Reits news was positive for the rest of the sector, especially pubs with tenanted estates such as Punch, Greene King and Marstons. &quot;Indeed, if Enterprise is successful at converting into a Reit it will bring into focus whether Punch should be operating both a tenanted and managed estate,&quot; said Citigroup. Punch added 41p to \u00a313.84.   There was also a couple of deals for traders to get their teeth into. Building materials group Hanson jumped 50p to \u00a311.07p after it agreed an \u00a38bn, \u00a311 a share, cash offer from Germany&apos;s HeidelbergCement. Meanwhile information group Reuters rose 20.5p to 626p as it recommended a \u00a38.7bn bid from Canada&apos;s Thomson Corporation.   Overall the market struggled for direction and after trading in a 40 point range, the FTSE 100 ended 13.1 points higher at 6568.6.   The mood was helped by a positive opening on Wall Street - up around 100 points by the time London closed - and a fall in UK inflation from 3.1% to 2.8% in April, making another imminent interest rate rise less likely.   Among the fallers, Rio Tinto fell 45p to \u00a334.80 as takeover speculation faded. Consumer goods giant Unilever was 22p lower at \u00a316.16 after Deutsche Bank reduced its recommendation from buy to hold.   And banking giant HSBC dipped 2.5p to 947.5p as its US-based consumer finance arm reported another large rise in bad debts, mainly due to the problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market. However the bank saw its 18.6% stake in China&apos;s Bank of Communications leap in value after the business floated on the Shanghai exchange. BoCom&apos;s shares surged 80% on their debut.

The commission doesn&apos;t deal in bland statements like &quot;the value of shares can go down as well as up&quot;. It is obliged to spell out the dangers starkly. &quot;There exists no stock on earth whose prices only surge and never slump,&quot; it declared last Friday. Did the locals listen? Of course not. The Shanghai Composite index rose again yesterday, by almost 1%, as it has been doing on average every day for the past two months. It will clearly take something stronger than words to prick this bubble. As China&apos;s new breed of investors see things, they are making a rational bet. They get 2.8% by leaving their cash in the bank, which doesn&apos;t even match inflation. So why not have a punt, especially when the authorities appear terrified of triggering a crash ahead of the Beijing Olympics? That leaves plenty of time to be in and out of the market. Such thinking, however simplistic, illustrates how difficult it will be for the Chinese authorities to calm the mania. They can increase savings rates, but even a doubling might be insufficient. They can float more state-owned companies to increase the supply of shares, but that can&apos;t happen instantly. Or they could loosen the rules on Chinese investors moving cash abroad, but that would be a big philosophical leap. All three measures will probably happen eventually, but the deeper problem here is that China is accumulating foreign exchange reserves at the rate of $500bn (\u00a3250bn) a year. The cash has to be released somewhere, and shares have always been a natural home for speculation in emerging markets. In this climate, a crash could happen at any moment. From current levels, the pain might be tolerable, though even February&apos;s one-day fall of 9% rippled around global markets. Even to return to those levels would now require a plunge of more than 25%, which shows why the authorities need something to happen sooner not later. If Chinese markets sustain their current pace until next summer, then the Olympic flame will ignite a rout. Snail-pace race One can argue all day, as advisers to Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays did yesterday, about the phrase &quot;Merrill Lynch undertakes to underwrite&quot;. Does it imply, in RBS chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin&apos;s phrase, that his consortium was &quot;good for the money&quot;? Or does it indicate that the banks had still to reach the final stage of financing, and that the ABN Amro board, with a duty to be careful, was right to take the view that there is many a slip &apos;twixt cup and lip, especially when you&apos;re talking about raising \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn) in cash? That semantic debate - fascinating to the bankers trying to earn fees - is also irrelevant now. The hundreds of pages of documentation also show that whatever Merrill Lynch was undertaking to do had a deadline attached - May 6. So if RBS and friends want to re-enter the fray, they will have to renegotiate their fund-raising arrangements on the basis that support from the ABN board will not be forthcoming. That doesn&apos;t mean the task is impossible, but the underwriting fees definitely won&apos;t go down in the interim. As it happens, Goodwin probably will come back. His advisers still mutter about a &quot;once in a lifetime opportunity&quot;, and the consortium seems prepared to proceed even if the target has sold its US unit, LaSalle, to Bank of America by then. So why are ABN&apos;s shares becalmed? At \u20ac35.2, they are not much above the value of Barclays&apos; all-share offer, and reflect little excitement about the battle to come. The explanation is probably simple - the plot will now move at a snail&apos;s pace. ABN is yet to set a date for a vote on the LaSalle deal; banking regulators have yet to get stuck in. The victor probably won&apos;t get its hands on the prize until next year. Branson mission Branson versus Murdoch, or Virgin Media versus Sky, is entertaining viewing. The spin-off - Sir Richard Branson versus his American cable shareholders - could be special as well. They don&apos;t do understatement over there, and Virgin Media&apos;s tilt at ITV last year strikes them as bonkers. Why would a newly formed company, struggling to offer respectable customer service, want to introduce more complexity to its operation? The investors are right on that point, of course, but try telling that to Branson, who seems to be on an anti-Murdoch mission. Peace with the shareholders won&apos;t happen until Virgin Media starts producing decent numbers. On current form, internal warfare will happen before then. nils.pratley@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Business"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-15T22:37:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/15/china.internationalnews", "sentences": ["Since January, the Shanghai Composite index has gained 50%, following a rise of 130% last year.", "Last week, the Shanghai Composite index broke the 4,000 mark for the first time, two months after hitting 3,000.", "Even Tokyo - long the dominant market in the region - was made to look a pygmy in comparison with the 377bn yuan worth of business done in Shanghai and Shenzhen.", "The last great bull run in China ended in 2001 when the Shanghai bourse nosedived, countless individuals lost everything and the newspapers were filled with stories of suicides."], "title": "Change of culture gives Chinese a taste for people's capitalism", "article": "Even before the doors of the securities trading hall opened at 9am, Yang Jingshan was queuing up to part with a huge chunk of his life savings and much of the ideological baggage of his youth. On the advice of his daughter, the 50-year-old Beijing shop manager joined the morning surge of speculators on a mission to buy his first shares. Waving his registration paper amid a jostling crowd at the CITIC Securities centre, Yang opened an individual trading account, on which he plans to stake 100,000 yuan (\u00a36,600). Such an act would have been unthinkable during his teens. In the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the mere mention of such capitalist behaviour would have led to public denunciation, imprisonment or death. In today&apos;s China, it is those who fail to speculate who feel they are losing out as bourses surge amid a stock-buying frenzy. In trading halls, on internet sites and through mobile phones, millions are playing the markets. &quot;Stocks are doing so well that everyone in Beijing is excited. That is why I am investing,&quot; said Yang. &quot;I don&apos;t know much about it, but I will listen and learn from more experienced players.&quot; Even by the standards of the world&apos;s fastest growing major economy, share values are rising to staggering levels - and so are the risks to novice investors such as Yang. Since January, the Shanghai Composite index has gained 50%, following a rise of 130% last year. Despite fears that a bubble may be forming, records tumble almost every day. Last week, the Shanghai Composite index broke the 4,000 mark for the first time, two months after hitting 3,000. On Wednesday, trading volume in China was greater than the rest of Asia combined. Even Tokyo - long the dominant market in the region - was made to look a pygmy in comparison with the 377bn yuan worth of business done in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The social impact is huge. Unlike in the west, where big institutions are the main market movers, the supercharged growth in China is being fuelled by individual investors. People are buying stocks to boost their retirement funds, students are speculating to pay for their education and housewives are borrowing from banks to expand their families&apos; share portfolios. Thrifty In the past year, the number of A-share trading accounts has jumped from 65m to 95m as more and more people chase the get-rich-quick dream. It is already a frenzy, but the pace is accelerating. According to the domestic media, 370,000 new accounts were opened on May 8 alone - equivalent to almost half the total for the whole of last year. Despite its reputation as a nation of thrifty savers, China is seeing a huge shift of capital from safe banks to risky stocks. The logic for the change is beguiling. Bank interest rates are often lower than the 3% inflation rate so money loses value. Stock valuations, however, have tripled in less than two years. So far, almost everyone is a winner. The domestic media is filled with stories of instant fortunes and huge gambles. In the west, the Chongqing Morning Post has proclaimed a 60-year-old former cleaning lady as the &quot;goddess of stocks&quot; because she doubled her 20,000 yuan investment in two months. In the south, Nanjing newspapers have reported on Xiao Feng betting his three apartments and two cars on the market. Further north in Xian, the focus is on a Buddhist monk, Shi Changxing, who opened a trading account last week. Initially, it was reported that he was motivated by a desire to raise more money for charitable causes, but it emerged he was lending his name to a friend who wanted to speculate more than he was allowed. The bigger the risk, the more it seems to pay off - at least for now. Qi Xiaotong, a newspaper editor in Shenzhen, put her family home up as collateral for a 1.3m yuan bank loan, then bet the lot on the stock market. &quot;I felt a huge pressure at the time, but now I don&apos;t think there is any risk at all because I have already doubled my money,&quot; she said. &quot;My family trusts and supports me in this.&quot; For others, making money has become a passion. Yang Yugong, aged 53, gave up his job as a drama teacher at Beijing&apos;s top performing arts academy so that he could spend more time at the trading hall. He claims to have made about \u00a35,000 in the past week, on top of the 1.2m yuan (\u00a380,000) profits in the previous 18 months. &quot;I hate weekends because this place is closed and I love coming here so much.&quot; Despite strong corporate earnings, the authorities are increasingly worried that a bubble is forming. In recent days, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochu has publicly expressed &quot;concern&quot; at the sharp rise in stock prices while the security regulatory commission has ordered brokers to educate clients about risk. Tougher moves may be ahead. The state council has consulted economists about the possibility of a new capital gains tax. The Macroeconomic Research Institute, one of the government&apos;s leading thinktanks, has called for an interest rate rise. According to analysts, the longer such cooling measures are delayed, the greater the potential damage from a correction. &quot;A-share valuations could soon advance into clearly unsustainable territory,&quot; warned Goldman Sachs in a recent report. More bearish analysts said social stability is at stake because millions of people are exposed to a downward shock. &quot;Mainland investors are about to learn a painful lesson that stock prices do not reach the sky and not everyone can be rich,&quot; wrote Andy Xie in the South China Morning Post. &quot;If the bubble grows for another year or two, the unsustainable demand may become too large for a soft landing... At some point this will destabilise the country.&quot; Hiccup There have been collapses in the recent past. The last great bull run in China ended in 2001 when the Shanghai bourse nosedived, countless individuals lost everything and the newspapers were filled with stories of suicides. This time, a lot more money and people are involved. The stakes were apparent on February 27 when a 800bn yuan hiccup in the Chinese markets was blamed for a huge sell-off around the world. Yet the optimism is unshakeable, partly because of a widespread belief that the government will not allow a meltdown ahead of the Olympic games. Despite a 60% increase in new accounts, Gu Xiaoyi, the manager of CITIC Securities trading centre in Beijing, said the market still had plenty of room to grow. &quot;I&apos;m not worried about overheating. There are probably only about 50m people trading in China. That is a small fraction of the population. Most people I know are making money. That is because everyone is buying now. When they start selling, that is when people could lose out.&quot; For newcomers to the market, however, a downturn seems a remote possibility. &quot;Yes, I have heard the warnings from experts and from the government,&quot; said Yang after buying his first shares. &quot;But I believe that nothing bad will happen before the Olympics. Until then the trend will be up.&quot; Marching to a new tune Such is the new passion for capitalist speculation that pranksters in Beijing have proposed a change in the lyrics of the national anthem. &quot;The March of the Volunteers&quot; is the call to arms enshrined as the anthem when Mao Zedong took power in 1949. Its lines tell citizens to rise and &quot;brave the enemy&apos;s fire&quot; in the fight to defend China and communism. A satirical version has recently been buzzing across Beijing mobile phones, which urges residents that they should rise to &quot;invest all of their funds in the tempting stock market&quot;, the Beijing Evening News reported on Wednesday. &quot;The Chinese nation is at its most crazy hour, all let out the cry to buy! ...

Professor Andrew Pettigrew&apos;s office offers panoramic views of this centre of honeyed stone and ancient slate. As dean of the school of management, he has constantly to contemplate how best to thrust his students into more abrasive working environments - the City of London, the teeming streets of Mumbai or the business parks of Swindon. Like most heads of top business schools, he has been exercised by criticism from employers and the Conservative party that &quot;too many graduates are not ready for the workplace&quot;. Pettigrew would argue that Bath has done more than most to ensure that they are. Its business undergraduates spend two six-month attachments at very different workplaces during their four-year course. Blue-chip experience And now the university is launching an MSc in advanced management practice. The dean claims that it will &quot;bring the career into the degree&quot; by requiring students to spend between 20 and 22 weeks of their year working in one of the 150 blue-chip companies with which the school has links. It is that word &quot;requiring&quot; that makes the course unique in the UK, in Pettigrew&apos;s estimation. Other business and management schools offer masters students the chance to spend time in the workplace. Warwick, for instance, has the option of 22-week internships as part of its MBA. The London Business School, Manchester and Lancaster offer similar packages. Warwick is also preparing an MSc in management for younger graduates who lack the four years&apos; experience necessary for entry to its MBA course. Up the road in Aston, Birmingham, the university&apos;s business school is launching a new course, conscious perhaps that only 29% of British students go on work placements compared with 66% in Germany and 79% in France. The European master in management links graduates with their equivalents in Lyon and Munich. There will be around 45 of them altogether and they will travel between the three institutions to prepare themselves for the international profile of blue-chip companies. There will be a requirement to spend some time in the workplace, but it will be 12 weeks out of two years rather than Bath&apos;s 20 to 22 weeks out of 12 months. Bath&apos;s new MSc will begin in October and, initially, offer places to 20-25 graduates with first or upper-second degrees from certain business schools. &quot;It&apos;s going to be high quality for students with the right intellectual, social and political skills,&quot; the dean says. Political? &quot;It&apos;s important for youngsters to understand that you have a problem if you don&apos;t know how to exert influence in the workplace. Most graduates leave university without those skills. But employers want people who can deliver outcomes on time and at a certain quality. So what we need are graduates who have a sound knowledge of the basics but are now ready to look at the big thematic issues that are important to business. In other words, we&apos;ll be tackling the issues thematically rather than functionally, going across disciplines to confront students with what business is all about.&quot; It almost goes without saying that the global scale of 21st-century industry and commerce can hardly be ignored. &quot;Employers want students with international experience,&quot; Pettigrew says, &quot;and we&apos;re working hard on getting into Shanghai, Beijing and Tokyo. At MSc level there&apos;s nothing quite like this course in the UK right now. We&apos;ve been able to offer it because we have the capacity. We have a first-rate placement office with nine people working under the direction of someone who has been able to internationalise our operation. That someone is Gurprite Lehal, who already has plenty of experience of finding workplace projects for undergraduates on Bath&apos;s business courses. &quot;We&apos;ve built up a special relationship with a range of companies,&quot; she says, &quot;and, every year, around 25 of them will come to the university for ice-breaking sessions. They&apos;ll offer coaching in areas such as online job applications and carry out mock interviews. Later, the students have two opportunities to test out their skills and, what&apos;s more, they&apos;ll be paid for it, helping to offset the costs of the programme fees. The average salary for a second placement on our BSc in business administration is currently \u00a322,500 per annum, pro rata.&quot; Foreign placements For Alex Ho, 22, from Swansea via Hong Kong, it was more like \u00a3250 a month. But then he was in Mumbai at the time, where an annual salary of \u00a33,000 is not to be sniffed at, especially when your accommodation is being paid for. He was working in the finance transition team of investment bankers Lehman Brothers. &quot;I was liaising with Tokyo, New York and London,&quot; he says. Nick Jones, meanwhile, was working for HSBC bank in the UK, sending work out to India. Helen Lardner, 21, from Worcester, enjoyed her second placement - at Barclays Global Investors in London - more than her first, at an outpost of the nuclear power industry in Oxford. &quot;I hadn&apos;t quite envisaged myself going to Sellafield in the smallest aeroplane I&apos;ve ever seen,&quot; she shudders. Fred Harboe, 24, from Norway, had a &quot;brilliant&quot; time working for the auditors PriceWaterhouseCoopers. &quot;They gave me a lot of responsibility early on, and I relished that. You can&apos;t learn about business from books.&quot; But you can prepare for business with some simple coaching on campus, according to Lardner. &quot;I think they were quite pleasantly surprised at Barclays,&quot; she says, &quot;that I could do a PowerPoint presentation and knew how to organise a spreadsheet.&quot; Expectations of what business students are capable of are evidently not as high as they might be.

Britain&apos;s biggest bank has been dogged by its mortgage business in the US. It was the cause of the bank&apos;s first profits warning earlier this year when thousands of customers with second mortgages failed to make payments on time. The so-called sub-prime crisis is still affecting the HSBC Finance Corporation operations in the US, where the bank has installed new management. In the first three months of the year, HSBC Finance Corporation doubled its provision against bad debts to $1.7bn (\u00a3900m) compared with the same period last year which had the effect of cutting pre-tax profit by 42% to $900m. But, compared with the final quarter of 2006 when the provision - or impairment charge - was $3.2bn, the situation is showing an improvement. The bank&apos;s shares lost 2.5p to end at 947.5p. Brendan McDonagh, the new head of the operation, admitted in the second half of the year, some $9bn of mortgages were due to come off their initially attractive two year rates. This may have implications for future provisions in the US where interest rates have risen 17 times in the past 18 months. But he pointed out that the problem was small in comparison to the overall mortgage business in the US, where the bank has $46bn of loans outstanding. Mr McDonagh also stressed that the US mortgage operations were only a quarter of the bank&apos;s business in the US. Alex Potter, analyst at stock broker Collins Stewart, said he took confidence from what he saw as a &quot;rapid reversal in the rate of provisioning&quot;. &quot;The US in aggregate has first quarter profits of $900m up from the $688m fourth quarter loss,&quot; he said. Just over $100m of the provision was generated in the UK as a result of a one-off change in the way the bank is treating the position of its customers in difficulties. The bank published the first quarter trading update of its US subsidiary as it enjoyed a gain on its stake in China&apos;s Bank of Communications which floated in Shanghai yesterday. Douglas Flint, HSBC&apos;s finance director, described the $12bn gain as &quot;quite enormous&quot;.

Analysts have been suggesting that pub groups could benefit from the tax free status of Reits - real estate investment trusts - but may need to separate their property operations to do so. However, Enterprise said it was talking to its advisers to see whether it could become a Reit without changing the company&apos;s structure. Enterprise climbed 42.5p to 769.5p, despite a rather mixed reception to the figures themselves. Kaupthing recommended a buy, as did Evolution Securities, but Numis advised clients to reduce their holdings and suggested switching into Punch Taverns. Citigroup issued a hold note with a 762p target. It said the Reits news was positive for the rest of the sector, especially pubs with tenanted estates such as Punch, Greene King and Marstons. &quot;Indeed, if Enterprise is successful at converting into a Reit it will bring into focus whether Punch should be operating both a tenanted and managed estate,&quot; said Citigroup.

Overall the market struggled for direction and after trading in a 40 point range, the FTSE 100 ended 13.1 points higher at 6568.6. The mood was helped by a positive opening on Wall Street - up around 100 points by the time London closed - and a fall in UK inflation from 3.1% to 2.8% in April, making another imminent interest rate rise less likely. Among the fallers, Rio Tinto lost 45p to \u00a334.80 as takeover speculation faded.

Analysts said China had acted to defuse tension ahead of today&apos;s meeting of G8 finance ministers in Potsdam and next week&apos;s strategic economic development talks between US treasury secretary Henry Paulson and a Chinese delegation led by vice-premier Wu Li in Washington. America&apos;s burgeoning trade deficit with China has fuelled demands for the Bush administration to sanction import tariffs amid claims that Beijing has deliberately held down the value of the yuan to make life easier for Chinese exporters. Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign exchange economist with CMC Markets in New York, said the concessions by Beijing were unlikely to be enough. The US has been demanding an appreciation in the value of the yuan but yesterday&apos;s move merely widened the band in which the Chinese currency can fluctuate - up or down - from 0.3% to 0.5%. Beijing admitted that the changes were unlikely to lead to a substantial appreciation of the currency. &quot;The announcement is unlikely to prevent Congress from resurrecting its threats to impose import tariffs,&quot; Mr Laidi said. Daniel Katzive, senior currency strategist at UBS, said: &quot;While this may be an effort by the Chinese authorities to signal their willingness to allow more yuan appreciation ahead of next week&apos;s US-China dialogue meetings in Washington, the fact is that the previous 0.3% band was not even being fully utilised, and today&apos;s move will not necessarily result in a firmer yuan.&quot; On the foreign exchange markets yesterday, a knee-jerk fall in the value of the dollar was quickly reversed as dealers decided that the action taken by China would have little practical impact. The dollar rose against the euro but was down against the Japanese yen. Mark Williams, international economist at Capital Economics, said that despite a &quot;triple whammy&quot; of measures, little had changed. &quot;The implications for other currencies are therefore minimal. And, once the dust has settled, the threat of protectionism will be undiminished.&quot; Beijing also sought to dampen growth and limit speculation on the Shanghai stock market by raising the one-year deposit rate by 0.27 percentage points to 3.06%. Reserve requirements on banks were raised by half a point to 11.5%. Until yesterday&apos;s move, interest rates for savers in China were lower than the inflation rate, encouraging people to borrow money to invest in the stock market. With share prices in Shanghai up 51% so far this year, the move was thought unlikely to halt the heavy investment in the equity markets. But the action by Beijing was seen as evidence that the authorities are concerned about the recent wave of speculation. China&apos;s economy grew by more than 11% in the first three months of the year and despite the tightening of policy, analysts expect the pace of growth to remain fast until the country hosts the Olympic Games next summer.

The burgeoning middle classes have caught the trading bug, and their enthusiastic buying spree has sent prices rocketing. China-watchers are already asking how soon the boom will turn to bust; and how damaging the fallout could be for the rest of the world. &apos;The Chinese stock market is just a gambling pit,&apos; says John Calverley of American Express, author of Bubbles and How to Survive Them. He says the anecdotal tales of ordinary investors rushing to stake their savings on shares are clear evidence of &apos;irrational exuberance&apos;, as former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan once called it. The authorities in Beijing are keen to bring share prices under control, and have already raised interest rates and bank reserve requirements several times, most recently last Friday; but as Greenspan himself discovered, bringing about a soft landing in these circumstances is never an exact science. &apos;The challenge confronting the Beijing authorities is to find the happy medium between doing too much and too little,&apos; explains Stephen Lewis of Insinger de Beaufort. &apos;If they are heavy-handed, the danger is they will precipitate a financial crisis as the bubble bursts. If, however, their response is too gentle, the bubble could well go on inflating. This would reduce the chances of a soft landing for China&apos;s asset markets.&apos; Judged by size alone, the Shanghai market is still small, and with most shares owned by domestic investors there would be little direct impact on world markets from a crash. But when prices dropped 9 per cent in February it triggered sell-offs from Tokyo to New York, as anxious investors fretted that China could be the first domino to fall in an emerging-markets shake-out. Since then, Shanghai has bounced back - prices are now 45 per cent higher than they were in February - but another wobble could shake global confidence. &apos;It&apos;s just the perception that it&apos;s the first bubble to burst,&apos; says Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. &apos;The next correction, when it happens, will probably be a bit bigger than the last, so I think it will be a shock.&apos; A frothy stock market is not China&apos;s only problem. In fact, some economists believe it is just one symptom of a much broader issue: with a cheap currency, a vast trade surplus and low interest rates, they argue that China&apos;s long-running growth spurt is unsustainable. &apos;It&apos;s clearly the case that the Chinese economy is overheating at the moment, and this is resulting not only in accelerating wage inflation, and China exporting inflation, but also in these bubbles; you have ample liquidity sloshing around,&apos; says Diana Choyleva, a director at Lombard Street Research. She fears that the government has waited too long to act, and will have to clamp down hard to bring the stock market, and wider inflation, under control. In the worst case scenario, a slowdown in Chinese growth from its current stunning pace could coincide with a sharper-than-expected downturn in the US, as the housing market crash takes its toll. Lombard Street Research is forecasting that the US economy will actually shrink in the second quarter of this year. Even a US recession may not be as disastrous for China, and the rest of the global economy, as it might have been a decade ago, however - there is growing evidence of a &apos;decoupling&apos;, with Europe, Japan and many emerging economies continuing to grow strongly despite the US slowdown. Europe is now almost as big an export market for China as the US, and the eurozone is booming. Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, who has just returned from a fact-finding trip to China, says even if a slowdown is on the way, it will only be a blip - albeit potentially a painful one. &apos;The trend is up, but there will be incredible volatility along the way,&apos; he says. And there would be some advantages for the rest of the world in a slowdown: not only is China a huge low-cost exporter, it is also the world&apos;s largest consumer of many raw materials such as cement and steel, forcing up commodity prices. A slowdown could help to make commodities cheaper for consumers elsewhere.&apos; Not everyone is so sanguine, however. Choyleva points out that because of its sheer size, China&apos;s double-digit growth rate will be challenging to maintain. It is already the world&apos;s largest producer of many agricultural products and consumer goods, from cereals to colour televisions, and eventually it will run out of other countries&apos; market share to gobble up. &apos;When it reaches that stage, it only grows with world demand,&apos; she says. &apos;To continue to grow at this high rate, it will have to move up the value chain - and to do that, it will have to move to a fully-fledged market economy.&apos; But without the rampant growth China has achieved over the last decade, Beijing will struggle to resolve social pressures. Chinese politicians may not face the discipline of elections, but they still need to manage tensions between rich and poor, urban and rural. President Hu Jintao conceded in a speech earlier this year that the Chinese economy needs to create 25 million jobs a year to keep pace with the sheer size of the population - and that means rapid growth. It will also have to mean more balanced growth. So far, China&apos;s extraordinary expansion has been based on an unprecedented investment boom, and a flood of cheap exports that has brought down inflation across the world. Bank of England governor Mervyn King acknowledged this &apos;China effect&apos; at his quarterly inflation report briefing last week when he said: &apos;We have benefited in terms of our standard of living from being able to import cheap manufactured goods.&apos; As China develops further, however, it will need to make the transition to a more home-grown, consumer-led pattern of growth. Already, its middle class numbers 200 million on some estimates. For countries such as the UK, which exports few &apos;investment goods&apos; such as machine tools, but has a strong competitive advantage in areas such as financial services, an expanding consumer sector in China could be a huge opportunity. Beijing also has to find its place in a global economy where the centre of gravity is shifting rapidly. The sheer size of its trade surplus with America has fuelled an outbreak of bitter protectionist rhetoric on Capitol Hill. Chinese policymakers will be in Washington this week, for the second meeting of the US-China strategic economic dialogue set up by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in an attempt to smooth relations; but with the more protectionist-minded Democrats in control of Congress, punitive anti-China measures can&apos;t be ruled out. Beijing&apos;s announcement last week that it was widening the bands within which the yuan is allowed to float was a pre-emptive attempt to satisfy US demands for more currency flexibility. The risk of a protectionist backlash from the US as China&apos;s economic power multiplies is one of many reasons to be concerned - but Lyons argues that even if the irrational exuberance in Shanghai comes to an abrupt end, China&apos;s economic miracle is far from over: &apos;This is a 40-year boom. It&apos;s a golden era for the global economy. This is like the opening-up of America and western Europe happening in a lifetime.

It had been puttering about on &apos;fuel low&apos; for a day or so, throbbing and crackling into sudden shocking too-loud tumultuous life for a few seconds before settling back to the usual damp sploshing squeaking sounds, which told me, pointlessly enough, that a fat whale in a distant padded cave was continuing to get friendly, pointlessly enough, with a well-soaped beach ball. Puttering fitfully and threatening to stop working completely, ever since Lufthansa and Aeroflot had taken my exciting new and extremely heavy head-cold on a drum-busting tour of the depressurised zones so quickly that my fast-popping ears doubtless sounded to fellow passengers as if I&apos;d forgotten to turn off some internal iPod possessed of futuristic technical genius yet childishly limited musical imagination, like Belgian rock. I began hitting my ears, a day after landing and nothing having happened to quell the whale. Leaning one way and then the other, the better to let my brains slide out, then whacking the side of my head with the heel of one hand while dangling the other arm to swing low and judder in reflex jerks, occasionally letting out a cry of frustration: think pretty much the exact opposite of the demeanour you&apos;d like to see adopted by someone near you who is about to defuse a thermonuclear device or marry your daughter. The seventh frustrated thwack broke, I think, my ear. Everything went very quiet indeed. I didn&apos;t mind, particularly. My ears have never held too much fascination. Try looking at them too closely, in the mirror, at their weird, otherworldly oafish transplantedness and you begin to wonder if you are part of a secret experiment, or, terrifyingly, a student on drugs. And then there&apos;s the annoying way they wilfully adapt the hearing of certain phrases. &apos;This is your last chance&apos; comes out, for instance, as &apos;this is your eighth-last chance and even then you&apos;ll be fine if you smile sweetly.&apos; And, &apos;Because I just don&apos;t fancy you, that&apos;s why&apos; always comes out as the perennially mystifying &apos;Uncle Mildred&apos;s on a frenzied keelhaul, you krop.&apos; Most commonly of all, the phrase, &apos;I&apos;m the kind of person who likes ...&apos;, when said by the kind of person who seeks to atone for a lack of personality by giving constant definitions of themselves as somehow different, even though the things then mentioned will be screamingly obvious in their generally perceived desirability - thus, &apos;I&apos;m the kind of person who likes music/sunshine/having a good time&apos; - translates, helpfully, into the simple &apos;I&apos;m the kind of person you&apos;re not going to like.&apos; So: bad things, sometimes, ears, and I can just mend mine again if I want to, a squirt with hot water from one of those flower-spray things, nozzle on jet-blast, has always worked for me, even if its wider application has proved a little problematic, leading once to a surprisingly long-lived falling out with a couple who had neglected to mention their child&apos;s freakishly low pain threshold. I&apos;m not that worried about the ear. What I am worried about is having caught clumsy. I overbalance. I tip, at the strangest times. I grasp at inappropriate moments and parts of anatomy. For a day or two now, at the worst, I have found myself reeling like a drunk grown all bow-legged and soft-boiled after getting himself gutshot with a lady&apos;s Derringer in the corridor of a Shanghai brothel. Grabbing and clutching, stiff-armed, bouncing. I look not as if I have a temporary case of inner-ear imbalance but as if I am, simply, clumsy. And that is quite, quite inexcusable. I&apos;ve never understood clumsy. Never got it. I have grown besotted by the most alluring of scented women, dainty of wrist and generous of eye-contact and promises, only for them to get up and go to powder something and manage somehow to sweep three glasses with their coat to the floor, tread on their own feet, bounce disastrously between hard men and soft furnishings, and pinball their way back with an attempt at a lovable giggle, to find me gone. And now I am in serious danger of understanding, a little, and forgiving. And it just won&apos;t do. I will stop, soon, I promise. Try to stop these new days of finding tolerance, and thoughtfulness, and non-judgmental forgiveness, everywhere I look. I will just clean out my ears, and listen a bit harder for the sound of my old prejudices. euan.ferguson@observer.co.uk", "tags": ["Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-19T23:41:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/21/fashion.spain", "sentences": ["Her apprenticeship will continue at offices in London, Paris and Shanghai."], "title": "Fashion billionaire grooms daughter with job sorting shirts", "article": "As the daughter of the eighth richest man in the world, Marta Ortega could be forgiven for thinking she might get a leg up the career ladder.

Amancio Ortega, the 71-year-old tsar of Inditex, parent company of Zara, is reported to be grooming Marta, his youngest daughter, to lead the international chain he founded in 1974. Her first stop is to be an anonymous employee in one of 445 Bershka stores, which target teens and young adults, before moving on to the six other Inditex brands, a company spokesman confirmed yesterday. &quot;Everyone in the company has to pass through those same phases of training, no matter what position they hold,&quot; Raul Estradera told the Guardian, adding that Mr Ortega continued at the helm and that there was no guarantee his daughter would eventually take over. &quot;Remember, we are talking about a very, very young person, and nobody knows how things will be in the future,&quot; he said.

But in December she was named vice president of two Inditex holding companies, Gartler and Partler, which control 59% of Inditex stock, according to Capital business magazine. The role was symbolic, without executive duties, the Inditex spokesman said. The Spanish press reported that Ms Ortega was being groomed to take over because her father was planning retirement.

She was commissioned by the Scottish businessman John &quot;Jock&quot; Willis and built by Scott &amp; Lynton of Dumbarton. Contracted to build the ship for \u00a317 a tonne, a very low price even in those days, the firm went bankrupt. Still, the vessel was towed to Greenock for completion and then travelled on to London to be loaded with her first cargo. Her name comes from the old Scots for &quot;short nightshirt&quot; and is mentioned in the poem Tam O&apos;Shanter, by Robert Burns. The vessel was designed to become an important contender in the tea trade, racing rivals back to England to deliver the year&apos;s first cargo of tea. In 1870 she embarked on her maiden voyage to Shanghai, a route she would work for the next decade. She later carried wool from England to Australia, famously completing a record-breaking run of 72 days. Captain Dowman of Falmouth bought the ship in 1922, aiming to preserve it as part of a nautical academy. In 1938 his widow donated it to the Thames Nautical training school at Greenhithe in Kent, where she was maintained until 1952; at that point the Cutty Sark Preservation Society was formed under the leadership of Frank Carr, director of the National Maritime Museum, and the patronage of HRH the Duke of Edinburgh. She was installed in Greenwich, south-east London, in a stone dry-dock, and became a museum and tourist attraction. In the 1990s, evident structural problems forced a full renovation plan to be put in motion. Last September the project received \u00a313m from the national lottery.

Residents in Greenwich, south-east London, where the 19th century ship has been in dry dock since the 1950s, described hearing an explosion at around 4.45am. Firefighters arrived to find a &quot;substantial&quot; blaze had engulfed the timber and iron hulled ship, which has been undergoing a \u00a325m renovation. Police said they were examining whether arson was the cause of the fire and appealed for witnesses. Despite the apparent damage, experts overseeing the broad restoration project on the 138-year-old ship said an initial inspection indicated a section of its structure remained intact and it could perhaps be restored. &quot;Initial indications are that this is not an insurmountable problem,&quot; Ian Bell, the technical manager of the Cutty Sark Trust, told reporters after being allowed to inspect the vessel. He said parts were &quot;completely unaffected&quot; and his biggest fears were for the condition of the iron braces that held the ship together. &quot;There is some localised distortion, but not major distortion [of the metal],&quot; he said. &quot;It is not as bad as it could have been.&quot; More than half of the ship&apos;s structure, including the three 100-ft (33-metre) masts and 250 teak planks, had already been removed as part of the restoration work. Much of the damage was to a temporary wooden roof installed to provide cover for the 65 carpenters, shipwrights, fabricators and other conservationists currently working on the project. Initial inspections suggested the ship&apos;s distinctive bow and stern appeared to have survived the worst of the blaze. The figurehead, Nanny, was also safe in a temporary exhibition centre neighbouring the clipper. Police said they were treating the ship fire as suspicious - a routine procedure - and CCTV images were being examined. A night security guard had been interviewed by detectives, and officers were trying to trace a silver car seen near the scene.  At a press conference this afternoon, the Met&apos;s Superintendent Mark Mitchell said a joint investigation by the London Fire Brigade and the Forensic Science Service was under way. Dogs from the police arson investigation unit were taken on to the site this afternoon. Chris Livett, chairman of Cutty Sark Enterprises, said the ship was &quot;the heart of Greenwich&quot; and it would be &quot;unbelievable&quot; to think anyone would want to destroy it. He was unable to put a figure on how much the blaze would cost but Richard Doughty, the chief executive of the Cutty Sark Trust, said the delay would cost \u00a310,000 a day. The Cutty Sark was &quot;the Ferrari of her day because she was the epitome of speed under sail&quot; inspiring countless yachtsmen and -women, he said. &quot;This is a ship that helped to make the wealth of London. She travelled the world, she belongs to the world. She is the first ship anywhere that was conserved for the nation.&quot; &quot;One thing is certain: we will now redouble our efforts to save the world &apos;s most famous clipper ship. It has been rescued twice before, in 1922 and 1953; this will be third time lucky.&quot; Asked whether he thought the fire was suspicious, Mr Doughty replied: &quot;I find it hard to believe that anything we&apos;ve done could have set the ship alight. There isn&apos;t anything electrical at the heart of where the fire started. I can&apos;t think of anything there apart from wood and metal.&quot;  The culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, said she was &quot;horrified&quot; to learn of the fire and hoped the ship could be restored.  &quot;The Cutty Sark is an icon of our heritage and a world-famous landmark known by millions,&quot; said Ms Jowell, who is expected visit the scene later today. &quot;I very much hope the Cutty Sark can be restored, so it can take its place once again as one of London&apos;s - and the world&apos;s - great sights.&quot; Maureen Taylor, whose home adjoins the Cutty Sark site, said she was woken by a &quot;loud bang&quot;. &quot;As soon as I looked out of the window I saw flames, and they were high already,&quot; she said, adding that she then got her 11-year-old daughter and the family&apos;s dogs outside and across the road. &quot;There was ash everywhere in the sky,&quot; she said. The battle to bring the blaze under control was delayed for 45 minutes after fire crews found gas cylinders near the ship and were forced to evacuate nearby residents and make sure no other cylinders were onboard. While some water was directed on to the fire during this period, it was only a &quot;defensive&quot; response, with the &quot;aggressive&quot; firefighting delayed until the area was deemed safe, Ian Allchin, a London Fire Brigade spokesman, said. By 6.20am the fire was under control but had left the ship a smoking, blackened wreck, framed by the exposed spars of a temporary roof erected above it during the restoration project. The Cutty Sark has been closed to the public since November 2006 for a \u00a325m renovation and was due to reopen in 2009. The ship needed substantial repairs because sea salt had speeded up the corrosion of its iron framework. Nick Raynsford, MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, who visited the Cutty Sark last week, said the fire was a &quot;terrible blow&quot;. &quot;This is the most famous ship in the world and it draws millions of visitors. People from all over the world will be devastated by this news.&quot; The Cutty Sark left London on its first voyage on February 16 1870, sailing around the Cape of Good Hope to Shanghai three months later. But the ship made only eight voyages to China in the tea trade. The opening of the Suez canal, just after the Cutty Sark was built, quickly made tea clippers redundant as steamers benefited from a shorter sea route. The ship was the world&apos;s only surviving example of an &quot;extreme clipper&quot;, regarded as the ultimate development of a merchant sail vessel. Most of the original hull had survived since the ship was built. One of London&apos;s top tourist sites, the Cutty Sark has attracted 15 million visitors since it opened in 1957.", "tags": ["UK news", "Art", "Travel", "Culture", "Art and design", "Water transport", "Cutty Sark"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-21T15:01:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/22/dealingwiththedragon", "sentences": ["The meeting of the African Development Bank this month was held in the un-African city of Shanghai, and the PRC promised $20 billion in financing to participant nations to ensure it goes on getting what it wants from the continent."], "title": "Dealing with the dragon", "article": "Can the rest of the world deal with China? Deal both in the sense of inter-relate, and deal in the sense of cope. On both counts, the answer seems to be negative. That is dangerous. In the United States and Europe, China is approached through western eyes. In the US, domestic politics loom. As a Chinese commentator wrote this week, the main antagonist faced by both protagonists in the current Sino-US economic talks in Washington, Wu Yi and Henry Paulson, is not the other side across the table but Congress. Beijing&apos;s attempts to sugar the trade pill by widening the yuan fluctuation band on Friday is not going to do any good given how far it falls short of what Democrats in Congress want. It has been estimated that even a 25% upward hike in the currency would only produce a $20 billion fall in China&apos;s surplus with America - that is, less than a third of the surplus in the first quarter. But there is politics to be played, with presidential and congressional elections next year. Nobody would be so crude as to use the term, but the Yellow Peril is waiting to be pulled out of the closet, with right-wingers worried about the security aspects of the PLA&apos;s modernisation and everybody concerned about the horrific effects of China&apos;s environmental disaster, as well as the popular refusal to recognise how Chinese exports across the Pacific have kept down inflation and funded the federal deficit. On the other side of the Atlantic, Europeans seem ready to devote only a small amount of their time to the most important dynamic force in today&apos;s world. We are told that Gordon Brown is obsessed with the PRC, but who knows what British policy consists of? Margaret Beckett&apos;s recent visit to Beijing was notable for its vacuous nature, and, in public at least, the prime minister-to-be has demonstrated none of the realism or broad vision that Paulson has - even if domestic pressures hold the treasury secretary back. To take just one example, the way China has upset Brown&apos;s African debt plans might well induce a realisation that you have to factor the PRC in anything you do anywhere these days. Under Chirac and Schr\u00f6der, France and Germany went the kowtow route and got some juicy contracts, though neither was able to persuade Beijing to buy European high speed train technology - the bullet trains now going into service are described as &quot;home made&quot;. Merkel has sounded firmer on human rights. But she and Sarkozy are likely to be so focussed on domestic and European affairs that China may be assigned to the pending tray. In this climate, stereotypes about the PRC rule. As Walter Lippmann said, we would be lost without them. Ever since imperial days, China has been subject to an abiding set of myths: over the last two centuries, it has been seen alternately as a bastion of central power or as a nation about to fragment. Now, it is generally seen as a vast assembly shop with a repressive government to whose misdeeds little attention is paid. The case studies are celebrated - towns in a single province that make 40% of the world&apos;s ties or 30% of its socks. China has become the biggest manufacturer of steel, and makes more cars a year than the US. Etc, etc. In assessing China, the serious fault lines, which present the leadership with its real challenges, are largely neglected as drivers that are more immediately pressing for President Hu and Premier Wen than macro-economic issues. While the basic manufacturing foundation and the flood of cheap labour remains the key to the economy, China&apos;s role is changing. At home, the social tensions bred by growth grow steadily, and form the backdrop to the party congress this autumn to usher in Hu Jintao&apos;s second five-year term. Abroad, while cheap exports continue to flow out, the PRC&apos;s $3 billion investment in the private equity fund, Blackstone, this month, was the sign of things to come. The new state investment body will have hundreds of billions of dollars at its disposal for investments abroad, out of the $1 trillion foreign exchange reserves. Its emergence as a serious global investor will ensure a continuing flow of funds, but will also raise issues as the Chinese government buys into Western assets on the pattern of Lenovo&apos;s purchase of IBM&apos;s PC business. From Iran and Venezuela to West Africa and Indonesia, China is already not simply buying energy supplies wherever it can get them, but putting money into major oil and gas development projects. Chinese are working in mines in Africa, and buying into mineral resources in Australia. The meeting of the African Development Bank this month was held in the un-African city of Shanghai, and the PRC promised $20 billion in financing to participant nations to ensure it goes on getting what it wants from the continent. The signs of change are everywhere. Companies investing in China are being told they will only be welcome if they bring advanced technology with them. After last year&apos;s property boom, the stock exchanges are on an extraordinary roll, with millions of new individual trading accounts opened each month, and state-owned firms plunging their profits into share speculation. The central bank&apos;s attempts to use market mechanisms to control the bull run have no effect. What else can one expect in a country without a half-decent welfare, education or pensions system and negative interest rates? Want to pay for the children&apos;s schooling or for the old parents? Plunge into the market and chalk up double digit profits in a week or two. Some things do not change, of course. Much of China is still very poor. Despite repeated government vows to help the farmers, the rural world of the interior is still a long way behind the booming coastal development zones. Wealth disparities are greater than in the US or Europe. The Communist party remains intent on maintaining its monopoly grip on political power - if there is talk of &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;democratisation&quot; the aim is to make the CCP more efficient, not to open the windows to a gust of liberty. Prime minister Wen reckons that this stage in national development will last for the rest of this century - and he is counted as a relative liberal, who went to Tiananmen Square with his boss, the party leader, to meet the students in 1989. After years of nine and ten per cent growth, China feels a great confidence, rather like the US or UK in their imperial heydays. It will engage with the rest of the world, but very much on its own terms. Before she flew to Washington this week, the chief economic negotiator, Wu Yi, placed responsibility for the trade deficit squarely on the Americans, themselves. They had to do a better job of coming to terms with globalisation, she wrote. China will make some gestures - expect the Wu Yi visit to bring a shoal of orders for American goods. But, six decades after the victory of 1949, the last major Communist regime on earth has found its feet geopolitically and well as economically. It is not going to adapt to a world which it sees as being its oyster; so it is for the world to determine how it is going to deal with the heirs to the Middle Kingdom. One sees little sign of a coherent response, so the prospect must be that the PRC will go on having the best of both worlds, benefiting from engagement but still free to do as it likes, a great international force that operates on highly national lines.", "tags": ["China", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-22T15:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/may/22/highereducation.news", "sentences": ["They are consistently in the top 10 of the Shanghai Jaio Tong index of world-class universities, so their position is unassailable."], "title": "Some universities are better than others says Peter Knight", "article": "Last month Boris Johnson committed a cardinal sin. Instead of using the anodyne expression &quot;research-intensive&quot; or &quot;leading&quot; universities, he had the temerity to refer to &quot;top&quot; universities. His academic audience was horrified, not least because, terrible though it may seem, Boris was right. The UK has a few &quot;top&quot; universities. As I am now well into my dotage, I will risk an upgrade on his sin from cardinal to mortal and go further than even Boris dared. I will name the &quot;top&quot; universities. The first two candidates are indisputable. They are Oxford and Cambridge. These august institutions are at least three times older than any form of parliamentary democracy, and probably at least twice as old as the Anglican church, and if they ever get into serious financial difficulty they will sell something they have owned for centuries, probably Norfolk. They are consistently in the top 10 of the Shanghai Jaio Tong index of world-class universities, so their position is unassailable. They could teach that the earth is flat, that New Labour is leftwing socialism in disguise; they could suffer outrageous sexual scandals and they would still be safe as icons of excellence. They are national treasures and should be taken away from the Department for Education and Skills and given to the Department for Trade and Industry for their contribution to UK trade; on second thoughts, given the age of their buildings, perhaps English Heritage would be a better choice. Who&apos;s next in the &quot;top&quot; university stakes? I do not intend to rely on the outcome of the research assessment exercise, any so-called measures of teaching quality or even student satisfaction. &quot;Top&quot; or &quot;world-class&quot; ranking must come from a marketplace where competition is red in tooth and claw. In higher education, this is the recruitment of international students and the level of their fees. For undergraduate degrees such as history, English and law, the average fee for an international student is \u00a38,300. Almost all universities charge close to that figure. However, just a few have sufficient international standing to charge significantly more. Imperial College and the LSE are able to charge nearly 40% more for these courses. As they both recruit successfully, they must have a world-class reputation. Just below my arbitrary cut-off of 30% come Soas and UCL, perhaps surprisingly accompanied by St Andrews. For the more expensive degrees, such as physics, engineering etc, the average international fee is about \u00a310,000. The high rollers are, once again, Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial, but King&apos;s and UCL now join them. No real surprises in that group. In the competitive world of higher education, the market has spoken and only a very limited group of institutions can sustain their recruitment numbers despite high fees. Essentially, people are prepared to pay a premium for access to these top universities. The situation is not rational. After all, the terms at Oxbridge are so short (eight weeks or less) that it is scarcely worth an undergraduate unpacking their books before it is time to go home; if you looked at the cost per week of teaching at Oxbridge, it is double anywhere else. So what are the foreign students buying? That most elusive but pervasive of modern commodities: a brand name. The top universities are the academic equivalent of Gucci or Beckham, and should market themselves on that basis. Is this a bad thing for UK HE? No, it would do us all good to accept that there are a few top institutions. Their position does not detract from the excellence of the rest. Here&apos;s an idea. Let&apos;s give these top universities extra money to ensure they stay among the top universities in the world. Their success enhances the reputation of UK HE and allows the rest of us to cling to their academic coat-tails. And with that final radical thought, I have successfully added a heresy to my mortal sin.  \u00b7 Dr Peter Knight is the former vice-chancellor of UCE Birmingham", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "University of Oxford", "University of Cambridge", "Students", "University funding", "Research funding", "Access to university", "University guide"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-22T22:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/24/china.usnews", "sentences": ["The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has tripled in the last year.", "The Shanghai Composite Index slid by as much as 1.2% in morning trading and finished 0.54% lower."], "title": "Alan Greenspan's latest warning rattles markets, again", "article": "A stark warning from Alan Greenspan of a looming collapse in the Chinese stock market has sent shivers through the global markets.

According to the Financial Times, the Chinese government is increasingly concerned that small shareholders could see their life savings wiped out if the market falls sharply.

Photo: Adrian Bradshaw/EPA In China, British producer Paul Raphael explains, not just anyone can become a calligrapher. You must serve a long apprenticeship. It takes two years just to learn how to crush the ink properly, and students are not allowed to take up their pens until they have learned the &quot;art of the ink&quot;. Old masters go to the park in Beijing and Shanghai at 5am and create extraordinary art on the pavements. When the sun comes up, it just evaporates away.  In Cannes this week, Raphael announced he had recruited Anthony Minghella and Carolyn Choa to direct a documentary about calligraphy in China.

Mike Figgis and Phillip Noyce are among the other directors who have boarded the project. As the Cannes march\u00e9 draws to a close, Raphael&apos;s remarks about art on the pavement evaporating away take on an ironic resonance. Many of the films that have been announced over the past 10 days will never be made. Many of the films that have been made will never be seen. Many of the films that have been seen here will soon be forgotten. Over the last decade, there has been a subtle shift in the market. In the 80s and 90s, Cannes was clogged with muscular thrillers starring the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. Arthouse fare represented a relatively small part of the action. Now, that has changed. There have been dozens of sales companies here hawking movies from big-name auteurs. Buyers have been offered new pictures from Raoul Ruiz, Carlos Saura, Eric Rohmer and Michael Haneke. The problem is that there is an oversupply. The UK now has several new distributors ready to release the best arthouse fare. Even so, they can&apos;t buy everything. If a film isn&apos;t in Official Selection, it often slips under the buyers&apos; radars altogether. We may be in the era of the &quot;long tail&quot;, but it can safely be predicted that lots of little gems will remain undiscovered or will have a shelf-life hardly longer than the calligraphers&apos; art washed away at sunrise.", "tags": ["Cannes film festival", "Festivals", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-05-24T15:21:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/24/chinaslessonsfortheworldb", "sentences": ["At the same time, while the Wolfowitz scandal unfolded, China was playing host to the Africa Development Bank (ADB), which held its board meeting in Shanghai.", "The ADB meeting took place in the Pudong district, Shanghai&apos;s most remarkable development site.", "Shanghai&apos;s overall economy is currently growing at around 13% per year, thus doubling in size every five or six years.", "Many African governments at the Shanghai meeting declared their intention to act boldly, by investing in infrastructure, agricultural modernisation, public health, and education."], "title": "China's lessons for the World Bank", "article": "The China Daily recently ran a front-page story recounting how Paul Wolfowitz used threats and vulgarities to pressure senior World Bank staff. The newspaper noted that Wolfowitz sounded like a character out of the mafia television show The Sopranos. At the same time, while the Wolfowitz scandal unfolded, China was playing host to the Africa Development Bank (ADB), which held its board meeting in Shanghai. This is a vivid metaphor for today&apos;s world: while the World Bank is caught up in corruption and controversy, China skilfully raises its geopolitical profile in the developing world. China&apos;s rising power is, of course, based heavily on its remarkable economic success. The ADB meeting took place in the Pudong district, Shanghai&apos;s most remarkable development site. From largely unused land a generation ago, Pudong has become a booming centre of skyscrapers, luxury hotels, parks, industry, and vast stretches of apartment buildings. Shanghai&apos;s overall economy is currently growing at around 13% per year, thus doubling in size every five or six years. Everywhere there are startups, innovations, and young entrepreneurs hungry for profits. I had the chance to participate in high-level meetings between Chinese and African officials at the ADB meetings. The advice that the African leaders received from their Chinese counterparts was sound, and much more practical than what they typically get from the World Bank. Chinese officials stressed the crucial role of public investments, especially in agriculture and infrastructure, to lay the basis for private-sector-led growth. In a hungry and poor rural economy, as China was in the 1970s and as most of Africa is today, a key starting point is to raise farm productivity. Peasant farmers need the benefits of fertiliser, irrigation, and high-yield seeds, all of which were a core part of China&apos;s economic takeoff. Two other critical investments are also needed: roads and electricity, without which there cannot be a modern economy. Farmers might be able to increase their output, but it won&apos;t be able to reach the cities, and the cities won&apos;t be able to provide the countryside with inputs. The officials stressed how the government has taken pains to ensure that the power grid and transportation network reaches every village in China. Of course, the African leaders were most appreciative of the next message: China is prepared to help Africa in substantial ways in agriculture, roads, power, health, and education. And the African leaders already know that this is not an empty boast. All over Africa, China is financing and constructing basic infrastructure. During the meeting, the Chinese leaders emphasised their readiness to support agricultural research as well. They described new high-yield rice varieties, which they are prepared to share with their African counterparts. All of this illustrates what is wrong with the World Bank, even aside from Wolfowitz&apos;s failed leadership. Unlike the Chinese, the bank has too often forgotten the most basic lessons of development, preferring to lecture the poor and force them to privatise basic infrastructure, rather than to help the poor to invest in infrastructure and other crucial sectors. The bank&apos;s failures began in the early 1980s, when, under the ideological sway of President Ronald Reagan and prime minister Margaret Thatcher, it tried to get Africa and other poor regions to cut back or close down government investments and services. For 25 years, the bank tried to get governments out of agriculture, leaving impoverished peasants to fend for themselves. The result has been a disaster in Africa, with farm productivity stagnant for decades. The bank also pushed for privatisation of national health systems, water utilities, and road and power networks, and grossly underfinanced these critical sectors. This extreme free-market ideology, also called &quot;structural adjustment&quot;, went against the practical lessons of development successes in China and the rest of Asia. Practical development strategy recognises that public investments - in agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure - are necessary complements to private investments. The World Bank has instead wrongly seen such vital public investments as an enemy of private-sector development. Whenever the bank&apos;s extreme free-market ideology failed, it has blamed the poor for corruption, mismanagement, or lack of initiative. This was Wolfowitz&apos;s approach, too. Instead of focusing the bank&apos;s attention on helping the poorest countries to improve their infrastructure, he launched a crusade against corruption. Ironically, of course, his stance became untenable when his own misdeeds came to light. The bank can regain its relevance only if it becomes practical once again, by returning its focus to financing public investments in priority sectors, just as the Chinese leadership is prepared to do. The good news is that African governments are getting the message on how to spur economic growth, and are also getting crucial help from China and other partners that are less wedded to extreme free-market ideology than the World Bank. Many African governments at the Shanghai meeting declared their intention to act boldly, by investing in infrastructure, agricultural modernisation, public health, and education. The Wolfowitz debacle should be a wake-up call to the World Bank: it must no longer be controlled by ideology. If that happens, the bank can still do justice to the bold vision of a world of shared prosperity that prompted its creation after the second world war.

He&apos;s telling me about the evening he spent recently in the company of a donkey&apos;s giant genitals. No need. I&apos;ve already seen the evidence. It was a huge brown thing as long as your forearm and presented to him roasted on a bed of cucumber and decorative orchids. Then it was whisked away, delicately spiced and sliced, and served up in a creamy, bubbling soup. Finally Merton put it in his mouth. You&apos;ll be wanting to know - did he spit or swallow? The answer is that, after chewing for a few seconds, Merton ate the donkey penis, wincing only slightly. &apos;Mmm, that&apos;s good,&apos; he said politely. Then, less politely: &apos;When I say it&apos;s good, I&apos;ve no intention of ever eating it again in my life.&apos; Merton had been taken to a Beijing restaurant that specialises in penis cuisine. As you&apos;ll already know if you saw the first instalment of Paul Merton in China on Channel Five on Monday, he also sampled the testicles and forked penis of a snake and a sheep&apos;s penis that had &apos;the texture of knotted rope&apos;. It was the latter that beat him. &apos;The donkey was all right,&apos; he recalls. &apos;If you hadn&apos;t known what it was, and it was just slices on a plate, you could have mistaken it for lamb or beef. It was not a flavour I was familiar with but it was in that kind of area. But the sheep one was so intensely chewy, there was no taste in it and the texture was just horrible.&apos; He spat it out. It was, in the words of Merton in the programme, a case of &apos;too many cocks spoil the broth&apos;. Food is a recurring theme in the four-part travelogue documentary. For the record, he turned his nose up at the idea of eating cicada, scorpion, sheep penis and dog but was happy to swallow donkey penis, snake penis and an inventive nomadic Tibetan dish that involves cooking lamb in its own stomach without the use of any stove or oven (the trick is to include red hot stones as part of the stuffing and to sew the stomach up). All rather more daring than the dim sum we&apos;re eating at Shanghai Blues, one of Merton&apos;s favourite Chinese restaurants, in London&apos;s Holborn. If Merton, 50 this year, is now a relatively adventurous eater, this is a new departure. As we shall discover, he was not someone who grew up with a love of food. For six years, he lived on his own in depressing bedsits with almost no cooking facilities (he lived in one that only had a kettle). He was in his twenties before he learnt that people put their knife and fork side by side to signify that they have finished eating, and he had never been to a dinner party until he was married and in his thirties. Yet today he avoids too much gluten in his diet and believes in the power of &apos;superfood&apos; vegetables to fight disease. Meanwhile, back to China. The documentary - an entertaining attempt to make sense of a nation transforming itself from a third-world country to a superpower-in-waiting - contains a fascinating scene where Merton and his camera crew visit an area that specialises in restaurants serving dog meat. To film the sequence, Merton and his cameraman posed as holidaymakers. Diners, delighted and amazed to see European visitors to Dog Street, as the area is colloquially known, smiled and waved, merrily pointing to the food on their plates. &apos;They didn&apos;t know we were a Western film crew because we had a very small camera that looked like it might have been a home movie thing,&apos; explains Merton. If the restaurant-goers were pleased to see him, the Chinese government won&apos;t be. Merton&apos;s team had been refused permission to visit Dog Street and he went behind the back of the official minder who&apos;d been assigned to accompany him for his six-week trek across the country. &apos;They didn&apos;t want us to go there because they didn&apos;t want us to put over that old-fashioned idea of China. But it&apos;s not an old-fashioned idea, because dog is a famine cuisine - there&apos;s a saying that the only thing with four legs that the Chinese won&apos;t eat is a table.&apos; He is filmed discussing the issue with an obviously educated woman who speaks perfect English. &apos;And she did not know the phrase &quot;pet dog&quot;. In a culture where you haven&apos;t got much food why would you have an animal that you have to keep alive with the food you could be eating?&apos; This time around, once seated at his table, Merton&apos;s bravery deserted him. He refused a mouthful of fried &apos;brown dog&apos; - no one could tell him quite what breed he&apos;d been served up - when the dish arrived. Now that he&apos;s had time to think through his decision, I ask him why someone who can swallow donkey penis suddenly came over squeamish. A little earlier that day, he says, he&apos;d filmed a sequence about how women from China&apos;s newly emerging middle class spend their new-found wealth by pampering their (ludicrously pompadoured) poodles. Eating what was on his plate for dinner &apos;might have been a little bit easier if I hadn&apos;t been walking dogs that day&apos;. So he doesn&apos;t think eating such meat is inherently wrong, then? Not for a people in their circumstances, no: &apos;I&apos;m not a vegetarian so it&apos;d be hypocritical to go on as if dogs are in any way different to cows or sheep. A piece of meat is a piece of meat in many respects. I wasn&apos;t trying to impose my standards on them.&apos; So if a dog restaurant opened up tomorrow in Streatham? &apos;It wouldn&apos;t bother me that other people eat dog. It&apos;s up to them.&apos; Then another reason for his on-screen refusal begins to emerge. &apos;There&apos;s also the practical side,&apos; he says. &apos;If you start eating dog on TV you get very angry letters from people.&apos; So that was part of the calculation - that there may be a campaign against you if you&apos;re seen eating one of Lassie&apos;s friends? &apos;Well, maybe,&apos; he says, sounding unsure. He smiles. &apos;By talking about this I don&apos;t want to be targeted as the man who nearly ate dog. Nearly is the key thing.&apos; Big laugh. &apos;I know how people feel about it - some British people are completely potty about animals, they place them above human beings, so I really don&apos;t want to start tangling with people who ...&apos; he hunts for the right words, &apos;may not have my best health as their number-one priority. I think you know what I am saying.&apos; I do. It&apos;s time to move on. Merton, the son of a Tube train driver and an NHS nurse, grew up as Paul Martin (the name change came later, when he wanted to join Equity) in Robert Owen House, a low-rise block of council flats in Fulham. It was a church-going Catholic household: every Sunday there was a wafer at communion and a traditional roast afterwards. But much of the food served up by Merton&apos;s mother in the Fifties and Sixties was drab - and often from the freezer compartment of the fridge. There is no sense of Merton, now a multimillionaire of course, looking down his nose when he describes what his mother gave the family, but equally no attempt to romanticise a diet that appears pretty unappealing from this distance - and didn&apos;t do a great deal to excite him back then. &apos;The food wasn&apos;t adventurous,&apos; he says. This was food as fuel, not a source of pleasure. &apos;First of all, lunch was called dinner and dinner was called tea,&apos; he says. &apos;I remember fish fingers, rissoles - stuff that Bird&apos;s Eye started to sell in the late Fifties, all that instant food. Something out of a packet. I remember when the Vesta curry came out - my first awareness of it was sometime in the mid-Sixties. That seemed extremely exotic.&apos; Schoolfriends never came round for food - nor did any of his parents&apos; pals. &apos;Nobody ever came to our place to eat and we never went to anybody else&apos;s house to eat. You wouldn&apos;t think of doing it. People would have thought: &quot;Why would we come to you to eat? Are you saying we don&apos;t have good food at our house?&quot;&apos;. Such thinking may also be &apos;tied in with the fact that the food wasn&apos;t particularly good, so why would we invite people round to have potatoes, peas and meat pie when that&apos;s probably what they&apos;re having anyway?&apos; The sentiment has, to some extent, stuck with him all these years later. Does he ever throw dinner parties now? &apos;No, I don&apos;t. This goes back to a class thing.&apos; Instead, he&apos;ll invite friends round to his house for a game of snooker or to watch a film. The first dinner party he went to was &apos;probably when I hosted them, when I was married to Caroline [Quentin]. She is solidly middle class. I must have been 34 or 35.&apos; People will look at the quick-witted urbane performer on television and be amazed that he was such a late (and reluctant) arrival at the dinner-party scene. t middle class - though I&apos;m not sure I am - but equally the working-class stuff hasn&apos;t just disappeared. It&apos;s there in your background, how you are and how you relax. &apos;The class thing is interesting. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m no I went to a BBC dinner party a few years ago which was thrown by John Birt when he was BBC director general and he did this thing where, after each course, you get up and move along a place.&apos; There&apos;s something similar that sometimes happens at Oxbridge high table, I say. &apos;Oh, like passing the port to the left? All these rules that you don&apos;t know. Even simple things like, in the early days of going into restaurants, not knowing that the knife and fork together is a signal that says &quot;take away my plate&quot;.&apos; You didn&apos;t know that? &apos;No.&apos; You didn&apos;t do that at home? &apos;No. You just left them there. You saw the plate was empty. I&apos;d never heard of the notion that putting the two together to signify that you have finished.&apos; When Merton found out, he &apos;wasn&apos;t embarrassed about the fact that I didn&apos;t know but I thought, &quot;That sounds like a good idea&quot;.&apos; So at what stage did he discover the knife and fork trick? &apos;When I first started going into restaurants. I don&apos;t want to make myself sound like a complete ignoramus but I was probably in my twenties. Seriously. I know it probably seems really retarded but I never went into that world.&apos; Again, this gap in his knowledge is likely to surprise people, I suggest. &apos;I suppose so. It&apos;s one of those quirks. It&apos;s one of those things that working-class people don&apos;t necessarily know. It doesn&apos;t come into the area of manners, does it? We understand manners, we know that you don&apos;t sit with your elbows on the table, you don&apos;t spit, that&apos;s obvious. But you can be from a working-class background and not know the etiquette of putting your knife and fork together because nobody ever talks about it.&apos; The gap in knowledge is also likely to be another product of the fact that it is only since he has had money that Merton has allowed food to become a source of pleasure. He says: &apos;I can remember thinking when I was about 19 or 20 that food was a bit of a boring thing that you just had to do to keep going. And if you could&apos;ve taken a little tablet - as, you know, the astronauts will have one day - to fill you up, I would have gone for that method.&apos; By that time, Merton had a steady but uninspiring job as a civil servant. He&apos;d wanted to be a comedian since he was a child, and realised that his career, such as it was, at the Tooting employment office had left him wishing his life away. &apos;I know what it&apos;s like getting up on a Monday morning, walking in through the office door at five to nine, looking up at the clock and thinking: &quot;The next time I look at you with a sense of satisfaction it&apos;ll be five o&apos;clock on Friday.&quot;&apos; So he chucked his job in. He gave himself a five-year &apos;apprenticeship&apos; to make it in showbusiness. But the lack of money meant he had to move into a single rented room. It was 1982 - and Merton was to remain in bedsitland until just two years before he joined Have I Got News For You and achieved fame. &apos;I was in bedsits from early 1982 through to 1988, I think. A long time. At first, I was earning virtually no money. I was signing on, doing occasional gigs for maybe \u00a320 each. I did 15 or 20 gigs in that first year. &apos;In the first bedsit, I had no facilities at all. The only thing I had to cook with was an electric kettle. So I would make porridge by pouring hot water onto a bowl of oats. If you haven&apos;t got much money, porridge is one of the cheapest and best things you can eat because it keeps you going, gives you energy.&apos; If he was feeling a little less virtuous, Pot Noodles - still relatively new - were another food source. Or, &apos;I&apos;d go to the supermarket and buy a loaf of Mother&apos;s Pride bread, which I think was something like 25p at the time, and a pot of fish paste and eat that. Or a bit of Bovril, something with a bit of flavour to it.&apos; If you think this makes him sound miserable, you&apos;ve got it wrong, he says - and not merely because he managed to escape (and in some style: he has homes in Islington and Sussex). &apos;This isn&apos;t a hard-luck story and I don&apos;t want it to sound like one, because I was freeing myself up to write stuff and pursue a career in comedy.&apos; As a child, he&apos;d often retreat to his bedroom to listen to his records, &apos;so as to be in one room on my own wasn&apos;t a massive culture shock for me&apos;. The loneliness was &apos;kind of what I was used to - being sent to Coventry at school, not really having lots of friends. I know I won&apos;t have to, but I could go back to that environment again.&apos; Reading these words on paper, this sounds a little morose. But that is not at all the sense in which it was delivered. Though Merton does not, thank God, feel the need to pep up each turn of the conversation with a wisecrack, lunch with him is a jolly and enjoyable affair. It involves a lot of laughter - there&apos;s a little of Sid James in Merton&apos;s cackle. And he seems proud to have been a &apos;bedsit boy&apos;, a phrase he uses several times about himself. &apos;I think success and happiness in life is about contrast in many ways,&apos; he explains. His life has certainly dished up those contrasts. Four years ago, he had to deal with a very cruel blow. His second wife, Sarah, died in his arms. She&apos;d been suffering from breast cancer. They approached her illness together and with a belief in the healing effects of diet (albeit working alongside conventional drugs). A few months before Sarah died, he told an interviewer: &apos;We juice two kilograms of carrots every day - they are exceptionally good for the immune system and very versatile: carrot and apple is beautiful, carrot and pineapple is wonderful ... There are things you can do: diet, mental attitude, spiritual attitude, all these things are very important.&apos; Today, despite the loss of his wife, he sticks by that conviction. &apos;You get that terrible diagnosis, the prognosis. So what can you do? Well, a large percentage of cancers are caused by poor diet - it&apos;s not just smoking and asbestos and stress - so you look to do things that can boost the immune system as much as possible. Standard doctors don&apos;t know anything about nutrition, so some of them tend to pooh-pooh this sort of thing as faddy diets. But the truth of the matter is that if you&apos;re juicing a lot, OK it&apos;s not going to cure the cancer, but you feel great. And you want to help your body as much as possible. &apos;I&apos;m completely different to how I was when I was 19. Now I seek out purple sprouting broccoli&apos; - he utters the words as if they are obscure Latin labels in a medical textbook - &apos;it&apos;s fantastically good stuff. And it&apos;s tasty as well. You look at what the superfoods are - cauliflower, broccoli - these things have been shown to fight cancer, or at least to help your immune system build up an immunity to it. And we know that if we eat really good food we feel great. If we eat chips, we feel sluggish.&apos; Yet that new respect for food and his enjoyment of it cannot entirely rub out the effects of all those years that taught him that spending time in the kitchen was anything but a pleasure. He reflects on where he is today. &apos;I&apos;m not living in a bedsit, and I&apos;ve got more than 21p to spend on bread and fish-paste sandwiches, but I still don&apos;t cook at home. I&apos;ve got very little cooking equipment. But,&apos; he adds, &apos;there are hundreds of restaurants nearby.

The Chinese firm, which snatched the once-iconic manufacturer from under the nose of its rival, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, is expected to announce plans at a reopening ceremony at Longbridge on Tuesday. Nanjing has spent the past year and a half transporting production lines from Longbridge to China in preparation for a relaunch of some models, including the MG TF sports car and the 75 saloon. The bulk of production will be for the Chinese market. But while car parts are to be made in China, taking advantage of lower labour costs, some &apos;kits&apos; will be shipped to Longbridge for final assembly and sale into the UK and Europe.

The mobile phone giant&apos;s shares closed up 8.3p, or 5.5%, to 159.7p after it flagged up good progress in fast-growing emerging markets and posted overall results at the top end of market expectations. There was more support from vague market talk of bid interest from AT&amp;T, helping make Vodafone the day&apos;s top performer.   British Airways continued its ascent on Friday&apos;s news that a couple of directors and Goldman Sachs had all increased their stakes. That, along with speculation of bid interest in the airline, continued to buoy BA&apos;s shares today - they were up 21.5p, or 4.7%, to 482.5p.   This helped the FTSE 100 notch up a 36 point gain to 6606.5.   Plenty of analyst comment provided some of the bigger moves on the market. An upgrade from Deutsche Bank boosted Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier. It added 16p, or 2.4%, to 675.5p after Deutsche analysts raised their recommendation from &quot;hold&quot; to &quot;buy&quot;.   It was comment from UBS that sent BSkyB shares higher. They gained 20.5p, or 3.2%, to 660.5p after the investment bank said a survey it commissioned showed better than expected market opportunities in pay TV.   British American Tobacco added 47p, or 2.9%, to \u00a316.97 after a positive note from Dresdner Kleinwort, which cited &quot;strong potential&quot; for upgrades to 2008 earnings, cashflow and returns to shareholders.   &quot;We think consensus 2008 earnings estimates will edge up and consensus targets will also be raised further. At 1800p we have one of the highest price targets, and we do not see our target as stretching,&quot; said Dresdner&apos;s Charles Manso de Zuniga.   However, the FTSE 100&apos;s gains were somewhat capped by a fall for pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline. It was the FTSE 100&apos;s biggest faller, losing 28p, or 2.1%, to \u00a313.06 amid reports that doctors in the US were avoiding its diabetes drug Avandia after a study linked it to an increased risk of heart attack and death.   The negative sentiment spilled over to other drugs companies, with Shire down 8p at \u00a311.64, but AstraZeneca managed to shake off earlier losses by the close to be up 10p at \u00a327.03.   Royal Bank of Scotland was also on the top losers board after the bank&apos;s consortium trumped Barclays&apos; offer for ABN Amro with bid proposals valuing the Dutch bank at \u20ac71.1bn (\u00a348.1bn). RBS shares dropped 5p to 637.5p while Barclays climbed 13.5p to 733.5p.   Elsewhere in banking, Standard Chartered rose 45p, or 2.8%, to \u00a316.80 after it announced it would launch a private banking service for wealthy individuals with $1m and more in 10 new markets, including Shanghai and London, by the end of June.   In the food sector, Twinings and Ovaltine owner AB Foods was up 6.5p to 932p following the news it was buying Indian food company Patak&apos;s.   Meanwhile sugar group Tate &amp; Lyle was up 2.5p to 604.5p - bargain hunters moved in after its shares fell on last week&apos;s warning that its Splenda sweetener would manage only a lacklustre growth in profits.   The wet bank holiday weekend aroused some gloomy sentiment around some retailers. Next was down 7p at \u00a322.00, while Debenhams dipped 3.5p to 134p. But embattled SCS Upholstery managed to reverse its morning losses to end up 14.5p, or 5.2%, at 296p. After being hit by a low shopper turnout during the hot Easter weekend, the group had been pinning its hopes on better conditions over the May bank holidays.   Among the midcaps, plumbing specialist BSS Group fell back despite a 28% leap in pre-tax profits to \u00a347.3m in the year to March 31. The shares slipped 4.75p, or 1%, to 487p as traders cashed in on a 50% rise over the past 12 months.   Dairy Crest was the FTSE 250&apos;s biggest faller after it confirmed reports it was having to recall packs of Clover spread because of mould. The group said it was too early to quantify the financial impact of the recall but it expected the costs to be covered by insurance with an excess of around \u00a31m. Dairy Crest&apos;s shares were down 24p, or 3.4%, at 677p.   On Aim, software specialist Zoo Digital jumped almost 20% after the group unveiled a deal with toymaker Mattel to make a range of DVD games, including a High School Musical DVD board game. It did not reveal what the deal was worth but Zoo&apos;s shares rose by 5.5p to 37p.   Elsewhere on the junior stock market, TV company Shed Productions edged up 1p to 96p on the back of its half-year results. Roddy Davidson at Altium Securities flagged up Shed&apos;s positive outlook statement alongside the results.   &quot;These cap a fairly challenging first half during which the prime objective has been to replace the contribution from two large shows, Footballers&apos; Wives and Bad Girls, that were decommissioned last year,&quot; he said in a research note. &quot;A first pass analysis suggests that this objective has been largely achieved, with turnover ahead by 4% on a like for like basis.&quot;   Biofuels Corporation was headed in the other direction, down 4.5p, or 27.7%, at 11.75p after it said it was consulting Barclays about ways to restructure its debt. It warned shareholders that given debt was around \u00a3100m, any restructure would mean they would &quot;very likely see their shareholding significantly diluted&quot;. In addition, any restructuring could lead the company to seek a cancellation of its listing.   Britain&apos;s biggest maker of biodiesel suffered a big blow to its share price in March after it warned full-year figures would be well below expectations.

The HSBC Climate Partnership brings together the Climate Group, the Earthwatch Institute, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the WWF - four organisations seeking to address the global causes and effects of climate change. Over the next five years, the money will be used to fund a range of projects including schemes to protect the Yangtze river and the world&apos;s rainforests, as well as work to identify how the world&apos;s largest cities can adapt to climate change. Speaking at the launch of the partnership, the broadcaster Sir David Attenborough said HSBC had recognised the problem of climate change and responded in a &quot;spectacular way&quot;. He said climate change threatened vital eco-systems, warning that humans had &quot;no alternative&quot; but to try to stop global warming. &quot;The complexity of the problem is so great, the dimension of the problem is so great, that the only way we can do something about it is to join together,&quot; he said. HSBC&apos;s group chairman, Stephen Green, said the partnership was &quot;profoundly important&quot;. The bank has already committed to becoming carbon neutral, and Mr Green said it was working with clients in &quot;ungreen&quot; business sectors to help them become environmentally sound. He added that HSBC&apos;s 300,000 employees were behind the partnership, and many would benefit from taking part in volunteering projects with Earthwatch. The bank chose its four partners from 10 groups who had put forward proposals for what they would do with the funds, and its pledge represents the largest donation made to each of the charities involved. Those who receive money are expected to report on their progress throughout the five-year period. &quot;I don&apos;t want to get to the end of five years and find we have wasted the money and have nothing to show for it, but at the same time I don&apos;t expect to get to the end of the five years and say the work is finished,&quot; Mr Green said. The biggest beneficiaries of the donation are WWF and Earthwatch, who will each receive $35m to spend on projects. WWF will use its funding to focus on rivers, particularly the Yangtze, in China, to mitigate the impact of climate change on fresh water supplies and help communities adapt to the problem of water scarcity. It said the money would help it protect 25% of the world&apos;s fresh water and benefit 450 million people who depend on the Yangzte, Amazon, Ganges and Thames for their supplies. Earthwatch will focus on helping people research and understand climate change, and will also develop eight new climate change research projects in five forests around the world. &quot;With the help of our four partners we want to create a ripple effect, reaching millions,&quot; the organisation&apos;s executive director, Nigel Winser, said. The Smithsonian Institution, which will receive $8m from the fund, said it would use the cash to fund projects that would give a new perspective on how the world&apos;s forests work. It will examine how the composition of forests affects the way in which they store carbon, and establish how important rainforests are to the planet. The fourth partner, the Climate Group, works with businesses and city and state leaders to promote action on climate change.

Why? Because investors decided China is doing so well that a 6.5% sell-off in Shanghai shares was unlikely to derail the boom. The Times explains that the sell-off was triggered by a tripling of the tax on share deals. That move was prompted by the boom in day trading: an employment agency in Shanghai claims a tenth of maids have given up work because they can make more money playing the stock market.

Urban planners say Mr Mukesh&apos;s home is part of a global rush for tall buildings that has seen skyscrapers spring up in Dubai, Shanghai and Seoul.  In India, planning rules and a historic antipathy to unrestrained materialism has meant that this race to touch the sky has largely bypassed the cities, which are more notable for their shantytowns and dilapidated housing. But experts say the next wave of skyscraper proposals could come in India. &quot;Our wealthiest citizens used to hide their money,&quot; said Hafeez Contractor, a Mumbai-based architect. &quot;They would not drive their Mercedes, they lived in small apartments. Even Mr Ambani&apos;s father lived in a small block of flats. They were afraid of the taxman. But that attitude has gone; Mukesh has made his money, and good for him if he wants to flaunt it.&quot;  Mr Contractor said it is only a matter of time before Mumbai was littered with high-rises: &quot;We have to find homes for people, and in a small area that means building skyscrapers.&quot; While some idolise the riches and glamour of India&apos;s &quot;Jazz Age&quot;, others are uncomfortable with the &quot;new vulgarity&quot;. Only last week India&apos;s prime minister, Manmohan Singh, called on business leaders to &quot;eschew conspicuous consumption&quot; and &quot;be role models of moderation&quot;. Praful Bidwai, a newspaper columnist, said the divide between rich and poor was obscene. &quot;Mr Ambani is building an edifice to his own ego,&quot; he said. &quot;It will not go down well with the public.

Many newspapers around the world reported the event under headlines such as &quot;Vandal sets fire to Mao portrait&quot; - accepting the official Chinese version in which the arsonist, Gu Haiou, was simply a &quot;vandal&quot;. Most of these reports omitted to remind us of the historical resonance of Gu&apos;s action. For it recalls the three young men from Hunan province who in May 1989 as a political protest also &quot;vandalised&quot; Mao&apos;s portrait by hurling at it eggshells filled with ink. They were given savage prison sentences: the last of the three, Yu Dongyue, was only released last year, his mind broken by beatings and solitary confinement. Should we still debate what happened in Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3-4, 1989, or should we consign it to history? Eighteen years is a very long time, literally a lifetime for hundreds of millions of Chinese who were young or not even born then. In many ways (though not in one crucial one - which can be easily guessed) Chinese society has been transformed since then in the great unbroken economic surge launched by Deng Xiaoping three years after the Beijing massacre. The challenge for anyone writing about China is how to grasp its modernity without neglecting this past, and while reflecting the extent to which the country has moved on, to present a fair balance sheet of the winners and losers in the process. Both objectives are achieved in two excellent new books that I want to single out from a crop of new publications on China. First is Duncan Hewitt&apos;s Getting Rich First: Life in a Changing China, recently serialised on BBC Radio 4 - and I must declare an interest: we worked together reporting on China for the Guardian, and later were colleagues in Shanghai. Getting Rich First is a gripping account written from the inside and with a great deal of vivid detail. Hewitt introduces us to the new Chinese who are building another new China - the entrepreneurs and the migrant workers, the ambitious students and the young lovers, the real estate agents and restaurant owners, the performance artists and those who search for new faiths. Yet there is a sense of the old &quot;new China&quot; too. Visiting Shenzhen, Hewitt is taken by a trendy young designer, Mr Wu, to see one of the city&apos;s new housing compounds built for the emerging middle class (they tour it in a golf buggy). Later they stop off in the county town where Wu used to attend political meetings in the 1970s. The Hall of the People, where the peasants&apos; revolutionary congress once met is still there - but it has been hired out for a trade fair promoting household appliances. The title of the book - based on Deng Xiaoping&apos;s exhortation to the nation in the early 1980s when he started the first post-Mao economic reforms - is intentionally ambiguous. While some get rich first, others lag behind or may become worse off. Hewitt paints a grim picture of the state of rural health, which even the pro-reformers in Beijing admit has become a casualty of economic restructuring. By the late 1990s, normally cautious officials at international donor institutions in Beijing &quot;were describing China&apos;s rural health system as being in a state of collapse&quot;. He describes visiting a county hospital in southern Anhui with just one patient - the only one whose family could afford to pay for the treatment. Hewitt&apos;s final chapter makes no attempt to grab the high forecasting ground - neither a prediction that China will collapse nor that it will &quot;overtake the US&quot;. He invites us instead to take a walk along Shanghai&apos;s Huaihai Road and reflect on the contrast between the shopping malls and their Buick-owning clients, between the migrant workers who build them and the beggars who beg on their doorsteps. His conclusion is that this is a country &quot;rich in dynamism, rich in problems&quot; - not very sensational but nearer to the truth. There is a strong sense of historical continuity too in the other new book - Rob Gifford&apos;s China Road: A Journey into the Future of a Rising Power. Travelling the length of Route 312 from Shanghai to the border of Kazakhstan is not just a roadie exercise but a way of getting deep into the Chinese heartland. Gifford is constantly surprised, and surprises us too, by the variety of people and places he encounters. As always, people are more willing to talk when they are on the move. He picks up both critical comments - China needs multi-party democracy - and more positive assertions that life is better now - even dustmen have mobile phones, points out one fellow-traveller. But on his journey into the north-west he also encounters deep historical tensions between dominant Han Chinese and unhappy Tibetan and Uighur minorities. Gifford comes to a more pessimistic conclusion than Hewitt about the future: both books give us a feel for the real China to help us make up our own minds.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-02T10:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/02/ftse.marketforces", "sentences": ["The miners also increased on rising copper prices, which hit a two-week high on the back of falling inventories in Shanghai and on the London Metal Exchange."], "title": "Miners and pubs add to the feel-good factor", "article": "The FTSE 100 started the month of June on a good note, up 55.3 points at 6676.7 amid some takeover speculation and a good performance from miners and pub operator Punch Taverns.

It aims to make 3,000 MGs in its first year, ramping up to 15,000 in year three. There are no promises on jobs, but the 1,200 that Nanjing said it would create when its plans for the company were emerging in autumn 2005 looks optimistic. It is currently making handfuls of cars - three of which were paraded around Longbridge on Tuesday - with some 130 people working on a quarter of the 469-acre site. A sad state of affairs - but was it inevitable? Just over seven years ago, a venture capitalist little-known outside the City, named Jon Moulton, outlined a plan to save the Rover car company, which was being dumped by its German owner, BMW. His plan was to team up with Lotus, the Norfolk-based sports car maker, to produce aluminium-bodied MGs, aiming for production of 50,000 a year. He had plans to produce variants of its then-current MGF model and introduce saloons later, possibly stretching production to 100,000 cars a year. Spare capacity at Longbridge in the West Midlands would be used to assemble cars under contract. Politicians and unions dismissed Moulton as an asset-stripper intent on slashing the 9,000 workforce and instead backed the Phoenix consortium, which bought Rover for \u00a310, received a \u00a3500m dowry and ran it into the ground in five years, leaving 6,000 without work. Unions are still unwilling to say the unsayable: that Moulton might have been a better bet than a slow death by a thousand cuts under Phoenix. But they are also equivocal about Nanjing. On the one hand, some cars and some jobs are better than none, which is what the &apos;Dodo Consortium&apos;, as one person called it last week, left behind in 2005. On the other, as Dave Osborne, national officer for the industry at trade union Unite, says: &apos;What we are seeing at the moment is volume in the low thousands, employing 300 to 350 people. They had talked about 100,000 cars with 1,200 jobs. Even that is not where we were in 2005. At best, the Longbridge car-making facility will be a shadow of its former self. We will never be back to the days of employing 6,000 people.&apos; Unite is currently in negotiations with Nanjing to secure a recognition agreement at the plant. It is unlikely, however, that Osborne will have as much leverage as he and his union colleagues have had in the past. Unclear, too, is how Longbridge will fit in as an outpost of a Chinese manufacturer operating a global supply chain. Nanjing&apos;s plans for the UK are contingent on success in China, where it has made the majority of its investment - some \u00a3250m. Using some 5,000 containers, it has shipped production lines for the MGTF (the MGF&apos;s successor) and the Rover 25, 45 and 75 saloons back to its home country. It has moved the Powertrain operation - engines, transmission and gearboxes - to China as well, along with machinery for making the majority of the components. Nanjing&apos;s purpose-built MG plant started producing cars in March, and will build up to 200,000 a year. The plant will make 250,000 engines and 100,000 gearboxes. Last week the company confirmed that it is going ahead with &apos;phase two&apos; of its investment - building another plant in China. The first proposed model is the MG7, a derivative of the Rover 75, with plans for the MG5 (based on the 45) and MG3 (based on the 25) to be in production by the end of next year. The MG7 will be sold in its standard saloon and estate versions along with a long-wheelbase model for use as a chauffeur-driven limousine - something for which there is some demand in China. Chinese people buying these cars will not be choosing the original and famous &apos;Morris Garages&apos; marque named after one of the founders, William Morris. Instead, marketers have rebranded them &apos;Modern Gentleman&apos;, and launched them last month at the Shanghai auto show amid London buses, horse guards and so on. Some expect the Chinese government to force Nanjing and its rival, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation - the company that was pipped to the post for MG Rover - to come together. If not, there will be a competing Rover 75 variant, as SAIC also has rights to produce the car, having bought the intellectual property from MG Rover in 2004. Its version is called the Roewe 750. Workers in Longbridge must hope that these cars secure a decent share of the market in China (car ownership has doubled in three years), because if they don&apos;t sell there, there is not much of a future in the UK. With lower fixed and labour costs, most manufacturing - of engines, components and so on - will be done in China. Finished parts will then be shipped to the UK and assembled. Nanjing insists, however, that Longbridge will be more than a place where kits are simply bolted together. They point out that body panels are made at Longbridge - they even plan to export some back to China - and that some components (they will not say which) will be sourced in the West Midlands. As for UK sales, most observers are sceptical about the prospect of reintroducing models that were long in the tooth even before they stopped being made two years ago. Nanjing says that the chief competitor for the MGTF, Mazda&apos;s MX-5, is largely the same now as it was when it launched in the late Eighties. But Professor Garel Rhys, of Cardiff Business School, who has acted as an adviser to MG Rover in the past, says: &apos;It is going to be very difficult. Even before the collapse, sales of the MGTF were declining considerably. In fact, it was even worse than it appeared because many were being sold to the management of the company at discounts. The number being sold on the open market halved between 2002 and 2004.&apos; Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that in 2000 Rover sold 103,663 cars. In 2004, its last full year, it sold 76,794, and in 2005, the year of the collapse, it sold 29,101. If selling MGTFs is difficult, things will be even tougher in the ultra-competitive saloon, mid-size and compact markets that account for the rest of the range - and all those models, too, date from the Nineties. Price will be a key factor. Rhys says the MGTF must be cheaper than it was - between \u00a312,000 and \u00a314,000, compared with the pre-collapse \u00a316,000 to \u00a318,000. &apos;With lower fixed and variable costs they could reduce the prices and still give the impression that it is a high-value product, but it will be a difficult trick to carry off.&apos; After that, Nanjing will have to succeed where Phoenix failed and introduce new models. Phoenix had one on the drawing board - a medium-sized car, which it was developing along with SAIC. This, says Rhys, could form the basis of a credible replacement for the MG5. Then it will need to replace the small MG3 hatchback; a harder task in the most competitive bracket of all. It is also important for the company to build a reliable and high-quality dealer network as quickly as possible. MG Rover had some 400 dealers, which have now switched to other brands. Nanjing has asked for expressions of interest among former dealers, and says it has between 80 and 100. In some ways, Nanjing is having to act as if it were starting up a company from scratch. It talks of possibly making 50,000 cars, and selling MG7s and the other models here again. That&apos;s half as many as it initially planned. Perhaps it is already finding the task is harder than it thought.  Route to riches The Nanjing Automobile Corporation is the oldest motor manufacturer in China. It was founded in 1947 and began producing its first vehicles in 1958, initially light trucks. It is state-owned, employs 16,000 people and makes about 200,000 vehicles a year. In the 1960s and 1970s, Nanjing became the leading producer of trucks in China. But, like other Chinese firms, it also wanted to make cars. Established names such as General Motors, Volkswagen and Fiat were keen to sell into the Chinese market and happy to build plants there and make out-of-date models, taking advantage of China&apos;s low labour costs. But they were unwilling to part with the intellectual property or the production engineering behind the cars, signing only licensing deals with Chinese makers. Nanjing&apos;s partner was Fiat, whose cars it made and sold under the Soyat brand. In July 2005, Nanjing paid \u00a353m to administrator PricewaterhouseCoopers for MG Rover, getting at a stroke the manufacturing assets of the Longbridge firm along with most of its intellectual property. It opened up the processes of car design, development and manufacturing to China for the first time. It snatched Rover from under the nose of Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, which paid \u00a367m for some of its other intellectual property rights.", "tags": ["Business", "Life and style", "Automotive industry"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-02T23:09:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/johngittings", "sentences": ["He first reported from China during the Cultural Revolution, witnessed major events including the Beijing Massacre and the Hong Kong handover, and later opened The Guardian&apos;s first staff bureau on the Chinese mainland in Shanghai.", "China Herald, a well-informed blog by a veteran Shanghai-based journalist."], "title": "Full profile", "article": "John Gittings was for many years the Guardian&apos;s foreign leader-writer and China specialist, and is now researching the history of nuclear threats and nuclear proliferation.

Nicholas Ferguson, chairman of SVG Capital and nearest thing British private equity has to a kindly uncle, has put his finger on the issue that ought to be an embarrassment to the industry: the fact that so many of the multi-millionaires at the top of its tree pay little personal tax. It can&apos;t be right, he says, that highly paid executives pay less tax than a cleaning lady - a stance that reflects not only Ferguson&apos;s Scottish Presbyterian roots but plain common sense. The worst aspect of this is that the private equity partners secured their tax advantages by exploiting, legally, a rule designed to encourage entrepreneurs, their backers and their employees. Private equity executives sail a different boat. These money managers invest in established companies and act on behalf of clients, including pension funds and local authorities. Their rewards, even if fees for success, should be treated as income, not capital, and so be taxed at 40%. Private equity&apos;s standard defence of the beneficial arrangements is thin. It cries that the tax system for private companies must be coherent and that an anomaly or two is no reason to abandon the whole shooting-match. More quietly, it warns that reform would drive private equity offshore, so even less tax would be paid. Ferguson himself has skewered the second point: Guernsey already exists, he argues, and few have fled there. As for the first argument, the only change necessary would be a tweak to the rules to exclude carried-interest - private equity&apos;s term for performance fees. So why hasn&apos;t the Treasury done so already? That&apos;s the interesting sub-plot here because it appears that such a clarification was intended, and then abandoned, a few years ago. We must assume that Gordon Brown was simply too timid to introduce a measure that could be deemed to be anti-City. Now, thanks to Ferguson, we have had a glimpse of the truth: private equity couldn&apos;t believe its luck. The net result, surely, is that reform will arrive belatedly. A Treasury review of the tax reliefs enjoyed by private equity is under way and it would be amazing if relief on carried-interest survives. By then, however, any political capital for Brown will have disappeared. When even the gluttonous child says he&apos;s eaten enough, removing the bag of sweets is hardly radical stuff. Cracked China How tedious, another stock market rout in China. The damage in Shanghai yesterday was 8%, a little less than the tumble in February and a little more than last week&apos;s 6.5% fall that followed the Chinese authorities&apos; trebling of stamp duty on share purchases. It seems the outside world has grown used to the volatility. February&apos;s drama contributed to a global market wobble but last week&apos;s fall was widely ignored elsewhere, and so was yesterday&apos;s. The new consensus says Chinese stock markets may be a bubble but they are an irrelevant bubble. If shares have become the new chips of choice for local gamblers, so what? It would hardly derail the real Chinese economy, whose activity is barely reflected in the comparatively tiny stock market. Well, maybe, but Lombard Street Research offered a more sceptical take yesterday, arguing that China&apos;s stock market is a &quot;bigger con than investors realise&quot; and a smokescreen for the bad loans in the domestic banking system. The key figure is the estimate that bad loans at Chinese banks could be as high as $900bn (\u00a3445bn). That was the estimate offered a year ago by the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, which rapidly withdrew its report in the face of pressure from Chinese officialdom. Lombard Street suggests it may be no coincidence that Chinese banks started to raise capital almost from that moment. High-profile listings in Hong Kong of the giant banks were followed by a surge of fundraisings from the financial sector in Shanghai. Chinese savers in effect converted their bank deposits into bank shares. For Beijing, this was useful in that surplus cash was taken out of the economy. What it did not expect was mad speculation as the Chinese also borrowed to punt. &quot;Chinese households have ended up with a worthless asset, recapitalising the Chinese banking system,&quot; concludes Lombard Street. A major market slide would be a political danger, as has been widely argued. But if another consequence is that the Chinese revert to their old habit of sitting on their savings, that would also be serious. China&apos;s current account surplus is so large the global economy requires it to be put to work. One day soon, another fall in the Shanghai market will be harder to ignore. nils.pratley@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Private equity", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-05T09:24:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/08/thefiver.sport", "sentences": ["Former Boro striker Hamilton Ricard scored his first goal for Shanghai Shenhua to set his new club on their way to a 3-0 victory over South Korean Champions Seongnam in the East Asian Champions Cup in Jinan."], "title": "Dastardly Danes; and Gone Fishing", "article": "ZERO TOLERANCE FOR NOTORIOUS HOOLIGANS Ah, Denmark, a nation that for years has tried to cover up its evil Viking past by flooding football tournaments with fine players and flocks of fun-loving fans. But the dastardly Danes couldn&apos;t dupe savvy Uefa, whose gravy-slurping suits are somehow aware that Copenhagen is the Hell&apos;s Angel capital of Europe, the home of heavy metal troglodytes Slow Death Factory and Handlebar Moustache, and a place where hardly a year goes by without some savage goofer trying to saw the head off a stone mermaid. So it&apos;s little wonder that Europe&apos;s governing body today decided to impose a draconian punishment on the Danish Football Association (DBU) for what may superficially seem like a first, ultimately harmless offence, viz: allowing a beer-crazed fan to lurch on to the pitch and waft a flabby fist in the general direction of Herbert Fandel, the German referee of last Saturday&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifier between Denmark and Sweden. Make no mistake, the drunken bear-man who flailed at Fandel was no lone oaf, but the usually-hidden face of a people who, until Uefa&apos;s drastic intervention today, were plotting to maraud anew, storming stadiums across the continent and laying waste to Western civilisation as we call it. In fact, the DBU should consider itself lucky that Uefa only resolved to: a) record last Saturday&apos;s match, which was deadlocked at 3-3 when it was abandoned in the 89th minute, as a 3-0 victory for the visitors; b) fine the DBU 100,000 Swiss francs (around \u00a341,500); and c) order Denmark to host their next four home games at least 250km from Copenhagen (which, given the decrepit state of grounds in Esbjerg and Aalborg, effectively condemns them to playing their remaining home games abroad, or possibly in their godforsaken colony, Greenland). Never mind that Uefa didn&apos;t appear so resolute when, a mere three weeks ago, there was a pitch invasion at the Big Cup final in Athens, where the Greek authorities entrusted with their precious showpiece were at all times the very benchmark of vigilance and chivalry. And never mind that today&apos;s decision distorts Group F by a) basically awarding qualification to Sweden and b) negating the value of Norn Iron 1-0&apos;s valiant 0-0 draw in Copenhagen last October by sparing Spain the hassle of having to go there. Because the important thing is that Uefa has sent out a powerful message.

With his thick glasses, and quiet, self-effacing demeanour, Huang was one of the least understood of the &quot;fourth generation&quot; of political leaders, gathered around President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. He was seen to owe his position to membership of the &quot;Shanghai clique&quot;, built around former President Jiang Zemin, to whom he was very close, and who acted as his political patron. Rumours of his opposition to President Hu are unsubstantiated, but gained wide currency in the press in Hong Kong and abroad. He took no pronounced position on important policy issues, and was associated with no specific campaigns. His death will free up one space on the nine-strong politburo, in advance of the 17th Communist party congress to be held this autumn, when a raft of personnel changes are likely to be made. Many of these are expected to cement President Hu&apos;s hold on power, and clear the way for the new, fifth generation of leaders. Huang was a native of the wealthy coastal province, Zhejiang. Like many of China&apos;s current top leaders, he was a graduate of the elite Qinghua University in Beijing, majoring in electrical engineering. He joined the Communist party at the start of the cultural revolution in 1966, and then moved to Shanghai, then a centre for radicalism, and base of the Gang of Four - Mao&apos;s widow Jiang Qing and three of her close associates - the leftist leaders blamed for the cultural revolution and arrested following Mao&apos;s death in 1976. Huang spent the first two decades of his career in technical positions, working in the energy sector, and gravitating toward party positions within the factories he worked in before becoming a member of the Shanghai municipal party committee. This was a path to political power and influence followed by many others in Huang&apos;s generation. It was here that he caught the eye of the then Shanghai party secretary Jiang, himself also a technocrat, an outsider to Shanghai, who had cut his political teeth there. Huang&apos;s lack of profile belied his powerful positions. He was the lead person in the top echelons of the Communist party in charge of finance and banking, areas that are at the heart of China&apos;s current massive drive to modernise and develop. For more than a decade he was in charge, first as mayor from 1991 to 1994, then as party secretary from 1994 to 2002, of China&apos;s great commercial dynamo, the city of Shanghai, succeeding Zhu Rongji, who was, like him, to go on to central government. Unlike Zhu, however, whose pugnacious, direct manner won him plaudits and support at home and abroad, Huang was perceived as an unpopular figure. He received the lowest number of votes on his election on to the politburo in 2002. His initial bid for the Shanghai mayorship in 1987 was also scuppered because of the low support he received in the Shanghai municipal congress. Such elections are simply rubber stamping processes, restricted to party members, with set candidates, and the outcome already settled. That Huang was to receive so many votes against him was highly unusual for someone in his position, and a sign of his lack of grassroots support in the party. Huang&apos;s tenure in Shanghai was associated with the beginnings of a real estate scandal, which saw the eviction of thousands of residents from their homes, with little or no compensation, and which was to culminate in the eventual jailing of one of China&apos;s richest men, Zhou Zhengyi, in 2003 for illegally acquiring state bank loans, and stock market fraud. Scandals have continued with the removal, late last year, of Huang&apos;s successor as party secretary, Chen Lianyu, for corruption charges. Chen is still under house arrest. But Huang was blamed in some quarters for helping create the environment in which such massive corruption was able to flourish. In the past three years, rumours of Huang&apos;s ill health circulated regularly, and his public appearances became increasingly rare. The Communist party, however, never openly confirmed that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer, and indeed the official announcement of his death did not indicate any specific cause.

Griffith, a former welterweight and middleweight champion, knew what would happen if his private life collided with his boxing life. The most notorious clash came in March 1962, during the weigh-in before his third match against Benny Paret for the welterweight title. Paret directed a homosexual slur at Griffith, whose trainer, Gil Clancy, instructed him not to react. As usual, Griffith obeyed. The bout was televised and millions watched as Griffith recaptured the title after he sent Paret slithering down the ropes and onto the canvas for a 12th-round technical knockout. Paret died several days later. &apos;They could have stopped the fight at any time,&apos; said William Henderson, founding president of the Stonewall Veterans&apos; Association, a group made up of several participants in the 1969 uprising in Greenwich Village that started the modern gay-rights movement. &apos;It&apos;s not Emile&apos;s fault that they allowed it to go on too long. It was a grudge fight and he set a precedent there, about not calling someone, a gay person, a slur word. That should be monumental in gay history. &apos;Now when an athlete comes out,&apos; Henderson added, &apos;they&apos;re regarded as being a hero to the community.&apos; Simply by frequenting the clubs, Henderson said, &apos;Emile did that a long time ago. When are they going to declare him a hero?&apos; Griffith, 69, was due to ride in the parade of champions at the international boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York, yesterday, as he has done almost every year since he was inducted in 1990. On 24 June Griffith is committed to taking part in another parade - the Gay Pride march down Fifth Avenue. Before last week&apos;s interview with the New York Times, Griffith had never said unequivocally that he was gay. But last week at his home in Hempstead on Long Island, he said: &apos;Yes, I&apos;m gay. I give up. I give up trying to explain it.&apos; His concentration lapsed occasionally and his memory often failed - the effect of 112 professional fights over 20 years and a brutal mugging in 1992 - but he easily remembered the distinction between the boxing and gay subcultures and how he managed to navigate between them while he was in his prime. &apos;My fights came first,&apos; said Griffith. &apos;But when I had my free time, sometimes I&apos;d go to gay clubs.&apos; Aware that being seen carried the risk of being outed, he guarded his privacy as best he could. &apos;I was always worried,&apos; he said. &apos;I&apos;d never go alone. I&apos;d always go with my friends, they made sure no one would bother me.&apos; SPECIAL OLYMPICS Final preparation Special Olympics Great Britain chairman Lawrie McMenemy and former Olympic sprinter Darren Campbell are supporting the 159-strong SOGB team in Manchester this weekend for the team&apos;s last training session ahead of the World Summer Games in Shanghai.

SAILING Alinghi setback Only conjecture aided by the evidence of other incidences can assist in predicting whether the Swiss Alinghi team will defend the America&apos;s Cup successfully, or whether the Emirates Team New Zealand can recover the trophy it lost four years ago. On Friday, in light winds, Alinghi raced unofficially against Luna Rossa, the beaten finalist in the challenger selection series for the Louis Vuitton Cup and the result was as unexpected as the fact of a challenger helping the defender in the final stages of practice. After two aborted races, merely used as starting practice, Alinghi was trounced. Before the surprise defeat sail trimmer Simon Daubney had expressed quiet confidence. &apos;We haven&apos;t seen anything to make us otherwise, he said on Thursday. Whether he would be as confident now is not known.

The talks were limited to a single topic - prospects for stabilizing Iraq - and no agreements were reached. Still, the encounter was by all accounts civilized and businesslike. Both sides described it as &quot;positive&quot;. This meeting will only turn out to have been truly positive, however, if the two longtime enemies use it as a stepping-stone to more comprehensive talks. In order to have a chance to succeed, these talks would have to be direct and bilateral, since only the United States has the power to give Iran the security guarantees it would require as part of any future agreement. They would also have to be unconditional, with both sides encouraged to raise every point of disagreement. An ideal model for the two enemies to follow would be the process by which the United States and China rebuilt their relations in the 1970s. The first document to emerge from that process, the Shanghai Communique, was deceptively simple. In it, neither side made any commitment or concession. It was simply a list of each side&apos;s concerns and a pledge that both would negotiate seriously to resolve them. A comparable document would be a fine beginning for a new relationship between the United States and Iran. Call it the Isfahan Comunique. The two sides could meet in that splendid city, which was once one of the world&apos;s most cosmopolitan trading centers but is now torpid and decaying. Isfahan is an apt symbol of both Iran&apos;s historic riches and its present-day isolation. What might the two countries list as their concerns about each other? The US would certainly place Iran&apos;s nuclear program at the top of its list, closely followed by Iranian support for international terror. Iran would wish to address American actions aimed at destabilizing its regime. Each side believes the other is perpetuating violence in the Middle East. Beyond these and other areas of obvious disagreement, however, there are a remarkable number of areas in which the US and Iran might find common ground. These two countries are not fated to be enemies forever. In fact, they share many strategic goals and may even be seen as potential allies. Both desperately want to stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan. Both detest radical Sunni movements like al-Qaida and the Taliban. Both, for different reasons, seek to assure a steady supply of petroleum to Western markets. Iran&apos;s oil industry is in a parlous state and needs tens of billions of dollars in investment; the United States has huge reserves of capital and a voracious appetite for oil. American officials have been saying for years that they will not begin an open-ended dialogue with Iran because that would reward &quot;bad behavior.&quot; Countries that engage in &quot;bad behavior,&quot; however, are precisely the ones with which any nation should want to engage most urgently - especially when they have great influence and, as is the case with Iran today, pose growing threats to global security. Hectoring, denouncing, threatening and making shrill demands cannot be the basis of sound foreign policy. There is another, deeper reason why the US has found itself unable to negotiate with Iran for the last quarter-century. The American political class has never recovered from the shock of losing the Shah and the humiliation of the hostage crisis that followed. It blames the current Islamic regime for those offenses. Some in Washington seem more determined to take revenge on Iran than they are to build a new relationship with its government and people. It is far from certain that comprehensive negotiations between the United States and Iran would ultimately succeed. Not to try, however, would be a grand historical error. Simply making an offer of comprehensive talks might produce a mini-crisis within the Iranian regime, with hard-liners battling pragmatists over whether to accept it. Once talks began, the only way they could succeed would be by compromise, something neither side has been willing to accept so far. That, however, is the purpose of negotiations. Talking is not a reward for &quot;good behavior,&quot; but a search for solutions that can benefit all parties. By abandoning a quarter-century of bitter American antagonism toward China, President Richard Nixon showed an ability to conceive a re-arrangement of the global balance of power. His audacious gamble reshaped the course of history. The world is crying out for an American leader with comparable vision, one who can visualize a relationship between Iran and the United States different from the one that has existed since 1979.", "tags": ["Iran", "US news", "China", "Middle East and North Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-12T13:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jun/13/news", "sentences": ["But it seems the experience has not discouraged her, as she is to work with Wong again next year on The Lady from Shanghai, a drama set in 1930s China about a mysterious woman falling in love with a spy."], "title": "Weisz eschews Mummy for mother role in Lovely Bones", "article": "Rachel Weisz is to star in the high-profile adaptation of the Alice Sebold bestseller The Lovely Bones, to be directed by Peter Jackson. The English actor will portray the mother of the main character, Susie Salmon, a young girl who is murdered but continues to observe her family on Earth after her death. The teenager sees the devastation her death causes to her loved ones and how her killer covers his tracks and prepares to commit murder again. The Lovely Bones was a runaway bestseller when it came out in 2002. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Jackson and his writing partners, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, are currently expanding the part of the victim&apos;s mother for Weisz. The Oscar-winning actor became available for the role after declining to reprise her role as Evelyn Carnahan in the third instalment of the Mummy, the action-adventure franchise, says Variety.

Much of what goes on the courts may also bear little relationship to the greater world of tennis, although that can be said of most tournaments leading into the four grand slams. They are, after all, warm-ups, or at best dress-rehearsals for the opening night, and as such so many things can, and do, go wrong. Sometimes British players win. Not that there has been much Rule Britannia this year, with Andy Murray injured and Tim Henman in seemingly terminal decline. It has been left to the Serbian-born Bogdanovic to flag up the Union, and wonderfully well he played for so much of his tussle against Roddick, three times a winner here from 2003-05, and twice runner-up at Wimbledon. &quot;I did play a great match, but one loose game in the third set and it was over,&quot; said Bogdanovic. The 23-year-old British No3 received a huge ovation at the end of a match when he was two points short of winning at 5-5 in the second-set tie-break before going down 4-6, 7-6 , 6-4. It was just a pity that the crowd of around 7,000 sat on their hands for most of the 110 minutes; invariably this constitutes the atmosphere here. The Artois is a wonderfully successful tournament staged for those who know little about tennis. Roddick gave a huge shout after he had won the tie-break, winning a challenge at 5-5 when his inside-out forehand was called out, only for Hawk-Eye to confirm it had caught the line. The American went on to take the next point to clinch the set. Before that, the world No5 was becoming ever frustrated, and small wonder with Bogdanovic peppering the lines with both his forehand and his classic left-hander&apos;s rolling top-spin backhand, a shot Greg Rusedski could never master. The British player&apos;s range of shots, the paints in his palette, far outnumbered those of the American, but Roddick has power in abundance on the serve and forehand. And Bogdanovic served quite beautifully in the second and third sets, dropping just six points in total, including the tie-break. This, at least, must have pleased his coach Jimmy Connors, who during the second set tossed a white towel over the moving camera that tracks up and down the courts as the anxiety impinged on him as well. Ultimately the booming velocity of the Roddick serve took its toll, that and the American&apos;s hugely deeper well of experience. Last year Roddick began the year at the Australian Open and ended it at the Masters Cup in Shanghai; Bogdanovic started in Wrexham and finished in Shrewsbury. However, what is clearly paying off for him this year is his close work with Britain&apos;s Davis Cup coach, Peter Lundgren, formerly with Roger Federer. John Lloyd, Britain&apos;s Davis Cup captain, whose team will play Croatia on the Wimbledon grass in September for a place in the world group next year, was understandably impressed, having dropped Bogdanovic last year after two insipid displays. &quot;Alex was first class,&quot; said Lloyd. &quot;He had a lot to lose if he had played badly, but from the start he had a great attitude. He serve-volleyed early on and I liked the way he was always trying to push forward. &quot;I also liked the way he was talking at the changeovers, geeing himself up, and scoring little psychological points by making Roddick wait. The one major lesson he&apos;ll learn is that at this level one dodgy game can cost you a match, and he played a loose game at 3-3 in the third set which cost him dear. &quot;But I wouldn&apos;t have any doubts about picking him now. This whole week has been a big test and he&apos;s come through it with flying colours. It could be a big career breakthrough for him.&quot; Roddick said: &quot;If he can play that consistently, you&apos;ll have another top-50 player on your hands. I think it is a realistic goal for Alex.&quot; Oh, that little &quot;if&quot;.

Some &quot;wacky&quot; websites for Friday Certainly the most curious email subject line I&apos;ve had for a while: Degrading boob job website condemned. myfreeimplants.com is a swapshop with a difference - women post photos of their breasts and men donate money towards surgery.

The slightly cracked surroundings of the old theatre provide a neat counterpoint to this latest investigation into the dustier corners of human emotion, and that hidden, often-neglected place where yearning, nostalgia and lonesomeness mingle. (Be)Longing is like a road trip into the atriums of the heart, or a song whose first chords fill you with sweet despair. A sign outside a Shanghai guesthouse that announces &quot;a longing house; vacancies&quot; provides the starting point for two entwining journeys, mapping out territory that includes the vast landscapes of the American south-west, whose emptiness can never be filled, and a muffled heart beat. It takes in a practical demonstration of the difficulty of playing House of the Rising Sun on a guitar, and offers useful information - the weight of the heart is apparently around 10.2oz, about the weight of a small Starbucks latte. This is not a big, change-your-life sort of show, but the quiet power of Leslie Hill and Helen Paris&apos;s performance lies in its low-key directness, its quirky juxtapositions, and its understanding of the geography of loneliness and the myth of return. In one of the best sequences, Hill - dressed as a cowboy, her outfit&apos;s jauntiness disguising her fragility - returns to her home in the US, but is unable to enter the area because a missile test is taking place. The US government&apos;s offer of free popcorn is no solace when you have been kept out but, as Hill points out, all road trips are as much about what you are driving away from, as what you are driving towards. \u00b7 At Theatre Workshop, Edinburgh, August 20-25.

A Franz Ferdinand fan was just as likely to be 35 as 15. Pete Doherty was both troubled indie troubadour and all-the-medals tabloid star. Your dad could sport a Killers T-shirt, or blast Kanye West in the car, and nobody would think it strange. But within what seems like months, cracks have appeared in the all-ages-all-tastes pop firmament. These cracks have widened and joined, and now, for the first time in years, there&apos;s a discernable chasm. Suddenly, the generation gap is back. And look! The kids are on the other side, ignoring us, doing their own thing. The first portent was the Arctic Monkeys. Everyone loved them, but several of us felt pensionable when we went to their gigs. Then came My Chemical Romance and their doomy prog: no one over the age of 25 could get with that nonsense. And now, a brace of brand new artists have kicked down the grown-up barricades with a rallying cry of, Up yours, granddad! Enter Shikari, Hadouken!, the Horrors, Klaxons, even Jamie T - they have all emerged on the back of a teen scene following. And then there are the acts made up of teenagers, like the Enemy, Cajun Dancy Party, Alessi and Ice Kid, who I&apos;ve dutifully checked out. Smart-as-paint indie rock, twangly guitar pop, freed-up folk, locked-down grime. Each worthy of a slot in your playlist, and not one older than your gardening trousers. Such pop whelps don&apos;t truly connect with anyone born earlier than 1988. It&apos;s not their music - which is excellent - it&apos;s just that we can&apos;t get past the bouncers to see them play. These bands are selling out at underage clubs and, no matter how much youth-enhancing pomegranate super-food we knock back, our frown lines still testify that we&apos;re eligible to vote. Then there&apos;s that other creative explosion going on. Again, grown-ups can&apos;t get in; this time because we can&apos;t actually find the entrance. New technology has created a separate teenage universe that is incomprehensible to adults, even thirtysomething View fans in skinny jeans. Of course there are social networking sites, even if many of them have been co-opted by people my age looking for long lost loves. (Not me! Honest.) Instant messaging is teenage-driven, as was texting before it. And as for mobiles ... You thought they were for talking to people? They&apos;re for blasting tunes, filming fools, blue-toothing photos or tracks or videos. Next to this weird, wired world, forming a band seems the conservative option. What of the wild kids who run in gangs, wearing their ASBOs like medals, who don&apos;t contribute? Look at them, and the new generation gap comes as a relief. Such kids are best viewed from the safety of your own front room as you dial 999 because you&apos;ve spotted that their sweatshirts have - the horror! - an extra piece of material to keep the head warm. Those kids are scary, aren&apos;t they? Twenty years ago, someone would have given them a clip round the ear. Now, we&apos;re too frightened to look them in the eye. They&apos;re hanging round outside too much, or they&apos;re never out of their room; all their friends are virtual or they&apos;re having real-life sex; they&apos;re guzzling junk or they&apos;re not eating at all; they won&apos;t take their responsibilities seriously or they&apos;re bringing up a baby; they&apos;re making an unmusical racket or they only speak in grunts. The fact is that modern teenagers are doing just what we don&apos;t want them to. They&apos;re doing it all wrong. Aren&apos;t they? &apos;I don&apos;t think teenagers have changed much in the last 50 years. They were dancing, chancing and slashing each other&apos;s faces in the Fifties.&apos; I&apos;m talking to Sam Conniff, co-founder of Livity, which runs youth engagement projects in Lambeth, south London. &apos;What&apos;s changed is the context of teenagers&apos; lives, and that&apos;s been caused by adults.&apos; Livity has several strands to it, including a magazine, LIVE , written, designed and distributed by local teenagers, plus a recording studio and a film-making arm (responsible for Dubplate Drama on T4). My office is in the same complex as Livity, which means that often, when I go to work, I am surrounded by the type of 12-20-year-olds that are deemed to have fallen through the loop. They&apos;ve dropped out of education, they&apos;ve been banged up, they&apos;ve had kids, they&apos;ve been in gangs. Yet - and yes, I know this sounds a bit Pollyanna - honestly, they&apos;re great: helpful, eager, hilarious, noisy. After working in the silent seethe of adult offices, Livity is a treat. But then, despite the bewildering differences between teenage life today and a generation ago, most teenagers aren&apos;t so bad. Conniff divides them into three types. The majority are &apos;the same as they ever were,&apos; he says. &apos;You can find them in the field, or car park, or town centre with cider or 20/20 or alcopops. Ultimately, they&apos;re fine, they just want a car, a job, a partner, kids.&apos; Then, he says, there&apos;s the new type of teenager, the all-new, 2007 super whizz-kid, iPodding and instant messaging fit to bust. These, of course, tend to be middle class, as such technology costs money. And finally, there are the kids that Livity works with, who have been forced to grow up too fast. &apos;This is where I see the big difference in today&apos;s teenagers,&apos; says Conniff. &apos;Before, such kids were in the minority, and now there are far more and the numbers are increasing. And, on the whole, teenagers who lose their developmental years are much less likely to make well-adjusted adults.&apos; Much has been written about &apos;middle youth&apos;, the refusal of privileged people in their thirties and forties to relinquish their youth or compromise their desires. Why is Glastonbury so busy these days? Because us oldies refuse to leave! Such ridiculous sad git behaviour isn&apos;t a problem; what is, is teenagers being forced too early into the grown-up world. This can happen almost without anyone realising it. Even the most nicely brought up children may have to deal with their parents&apos; break-up, moving from mum&apos;s home to dad&apos;s place, sleeping in a different bed every few days, with all the attendant organisation. Many stay over at friend&apos;s houses, because their mum&apos;s got a new boyfriend, or their dad&apos;s away working. A few just move into hostels, taking responsibility for their own lives at a very young age. Callum McGeoch, who oversees LIVE magazine, thinks that the tougher cases, the roots of the less than desirable teenage activity so beloved of Daily Mail headline writers, are often just kids &apos;having to become adults before they&apos;re ready. They suddenly need to be men and the shorthand ways of becoming a man are to get a girl pregnant or get a gun or join a gang.&apos; McGeoch also tells me that the current correctly PC way to refer to teenagers is &apos;young adults&apos;. What a horrible, V-neck-over-tight-white-T-shirt-easy-mate title that is. You might as well call them elderly children. Or big kids, which is what they actually are. Anyhow, young adult, like middle youth and kidulthood, is an attempt to define this blurring of the divide between child and grown-up. Everyone&apos;s a teenager now. Adults are staying younger for longer, and kids are growing up earlier. This is a genuinely new development, something that wasn&apos;t happening a few years ago, and we don&apos;t quite know what the fall-out will be. There are plenty of people trying to find out, however. Andy Parfitt, head of Radio 1, has recently been appointed the BBC&apos;s Teen Tsar. &apos;I hate that title!&apos; he laughs, a genial man who, though young-looking for his age, is even further from his teenage years than I am. Anyway, as Teen Tsar, Andy has recently been in charge of a major piece of research into the current habits of teenagers - &apos;the most thorough the BBC has done&apos; - so that BBC&apos;s youth &apos;offer&apos;, whether online, on TV or on radio really satisfies its audience. To this end, over the past year, Parfitt and a team of producers have been spending a lot of time with teenagers across the UK, living with them, discovering what they&apos;re up to. What they found was that &apos;there are some universal truths&apos;, constants for teenagers that have existed for a long time and aren&apos;t likely to change. The first is regulation. Until you&apos;re 16, and often onwards, your life is subject to rules. You get up because you have to go to school, you move from class to class because you&apos;re told to, you stand up, sit down, talk, eat, learn, socialise according to a timetable devised by edifying adults. &apos;Your life is restricted, and dictated by bells,&apos; as Parfitt puts it. Grown-up life isn&apos;t like that (unless you&apos;re a teacher). Another constant of your teenage years, says Parfitt, is that, at some point during them, you will experience real, tumultuous change. Due to changes in diet, puberty is hitting kids earlier, but most still go through it during their teens. And what a change it is: flipping body and mind with the roar of sex and the call of possibility. It&apos;s like a personality transplant. &apos;It&apos;s about asking, Who am I? and especially, Who am I away from mum and dad?&apos; says Parfitt. Puberty forces you to start to search for your life apart from your family, to forge a new identity among your friends and the wider world. At the start of our teens, most of us are children. By the end, we&apos;re adults. Young adults, even. Aside from these universal teenager truths, today&apos;s youth face new challenges and excitements. The first of these is technology. &apos;Teenage life is very local,&apos; says Parfitt. &apos;You know, you don&apos;t get much further than the park and your mates&apos; houses. With new technology, suddenly you have access to global, especially American, content via the internet. You can play an online game with some other teenagers in Shanghai. You can have 120 close friends on your MSN. It&apos;s a completely new phenomenon.&apos; There&apos;s a coda to this vision of teched-up teenage life, however: like most of us, teenagers don&apos;t have access to the most cutting-edge technology, the fastest broadband, the most expensive multi-channel recording options, the coolest MP3-playing phone. Their equipment is hand-me-down, or doesn&apos;t work properly, and they don&apos;t have the money to get the up-to-date stuff. Far from Mission Impossible future-equipment, teenagers&apos; technology is higgledy-piggledy, inefficient, cranky. Though Parfitt reckons that there are very few with no access to broadband: even if they don&apos;t have it at home, they can use it at school or college. Which brings us, naturally, to MySpace. Currently, the site has 10 million users in the UK; officially you have to be 14 to join. I speak to Dom Cook, who started work at MySpace a year ago. &apos;Well, I was never off it, so I thought it seemed logical.&apos; The website&apos;s appeal isn&apos;t just the access to music it provides. It&apos;s MySpace&apos;s ability to let you express, via the personalisation of your page, what you like to think is your uniqueness. Teenagers are very big on that. In fact, Cook likens a personalised page to a teenager&apos;s bedroom. You can hear their favourite tracks, you can check their photos, meet their friends, read their diary - as much as they want to let you, anyway. Facebook, another social networking site, is also popular, though it&apos;s mostly older teenagers and college students that use it, to talk to their real-life friends. &apos;I&apos;m addicted to it,&apos; says Paul Testar, 16, who helped us with this issue of OMM. &apos;It&apos;s a very good way of avoiding revision. But you can often feel weird going on it, a bit stalker-ish when you&apos;re looking at your friends&apos; new photos. Everyone feels it, but they all deny it.&apos; What else? The kids at Livity tell me that email is &apos;long&apos;, meaning, too much effort. They use instant messaging such as MSN because you get a far quicker reply. Mobiles? Well, they&apos;re as essential to kids as they are for adults, though they&apos;re used differently. There&apos;s far more texting and, for older teenagers at least, ringtones are set at a pitch seemingly unable to be picked up by anyone whose ears are over 20 years old. They might like to play their music loud on their mobiles on the bus, but you rarely hear teenagers&apos; phones ring. Just the tiniest vibrate alerts them instantly that someone&apos;s on the line. Then there&apos;s Twitter, an utterly pointless way of passing your time: you simply tell random people, via their phones or computers, what you&apos;re doing right now, and they tell you. It&apos;s all &apos;going down the shops to buy a packet of biscuits&apos; excitement at Twitter. Such constant communication seems alien to older people, who just want everyone to shut up for a bit. But teenagers love it. And, of course, it stops them communicating with real people in real life, such as their parents. Once, sending kids to their room was a punishment. Now, hauling them out to have a chat at meal-times is the real reprimand. There&apos;s a very obvious constant, aside from the ones Andy Parfitt has mentioned, that dominates teenagers&apos; lives. Music. Music has always been part of young people&apos;s existence, but it used to be hard to find. A million years ago, when I were a lass, pop was an occasional soundtrack. You heard it when you hung about at the ice-rink or mooched through Clockhouse at C&amp;A. There was only one proper TV music show: Top of the Pops. There was radio, though that played Barry Manilow and made jokes about women running the country. Other than that, you could buy singles at Woolworth&apos;s, or you could naughtily kill music by making tapes of your friend&apos;s records or the Top 40 run-down. And that was it, really. Now, pop is everywhere: soundtracking golden goals, selling life insurance, enhancing your dining experience, jollying up your jogging. There are multitudinous music channels, and a boggling array of listening methods mostly involving the internet. What if you want to hear your current favourite teen band play live? Well, that&apos;s OK. Gig-going is not the adult activity that it appeared to be when I was young. Mind you, for an embarrassingly long time during my teenage years, I didn&apos;t realise you could go and see bands play live. I thought groups like Blondie or the Police only existed on record sleeves and the telly. The idea that you might be able to go and watch them play - be in the same room as them! - was inconceivable. (I was a simple child.) Thus, my first gig was Tears For Fears, at Manchester&apos;s Palace Theatre, at the grand old age of 17. An all-seater venue. The lights went down and me and my friend Sarah bum-rushed the orchestra pit. Move on, grandma. Talking to the teenagers who helped edit this issue of OMM, there&apos;s a significant proportion whose first live music experience was ... the Spice Girls. At the time, a childish fanbase was one of many given reasons to knock Posh and co; now, it&apos;s clear that the Spiceys&apos; welcome-all attitude meant that a generation grew up knowing that even the teeniest of pop bands played live and that an audience was expected. Wolfie McFarlane, now 14, was &apos;five or six&apos; when he saw Girl Power in action. Though he can&apos;t remember much about the event at all: &apos;Mel B in a sparkly dress. That&apos;s about it.&apos; Since then, Wolfie&apos;s seen Guns&apos;N&apos;Roses, Tenacious D, the Pogues and Bowling For Soup. All in the last year. All the teenagers we spoke to for this issue were happy to admit that their taste is diverse. They have an iPod shuffle attitude to pop. It doesn&apos;t bother this lot whether they&apos;re &apos;meant&apos; to like a track, or a band; whether such-and-such are cool or if a particular music was originally made for them. Such categories are irrelevant. It&apos;s only adults that analyse these things. Teenagers just act on instinct. Instinct, of course, only gets you so far. Another new teenage phenomenon that Andy Parfitt&apos;s team identified was the current generation&apos;s complete lack of clue when it comes to accessing what we might call real life. Who to talk to about getting on a photography course. How to fill in a form, or write a letter of application. Where to go to find contraceptive advice. It&apos;s as though teenager&apos;s lives are full of stuff to entertain them, but nothing constructive which helps them get anywhere. One of the concepts that the teenagers at Livity struggle with is the idea of persistence. That you might have to knock on a lot of doors; send hundreds of emails; make loads of phone-calls; deal with more rejection. Parfitt wonders if today&apos;s consumer experience has become so instant and efficient that the idea that reward may only come with effort is simply alien to young people. James Scroggs, VP of marketing at MTV, believes that part of the solution to these problems could be around school. &apos;They should bring workshops and experiences into the school system,&apos; he says. &apos;School shouldn&apos;t finish at 3pm. There should be enough interesting stuff going on after lessons so that kids don&apos;t want to leave campus until 7pm. They need to be engaged and equipped for life.&apos; He points out the way that teenagers seem to easily connect with a multitude of entertainment at the same time: the TV&apos;s on, they&apos;re using MSN, the mobile&apos;s going, they&apos;re loading up their iPod. &apos;They&apos;re not passive, they&apos;re active, and they expect the culture around them to be the same. Education should learn from that.&apos; This consumer vision, of course, doesn&apos;t show much of what teenagers can do themselves, other than get stuff via technology. I have a conversation with Christina Coker, who&apos;s the CEO of the organisation Youth Music, and with Richard Stilgoe, of funny Radio 4 song fame, who&apos;s Youth Music&apos;s chairman. Youth Music has one aim: to change kids across the UK from passive music consumers into music-makers. And oh, it&apos;s easy, in this post- Pop Idol era, to sneer at such a public-minded goal. Saturday night TV proves that there are plenty of young people out there making music like billy-oh, let down only by their lack of any talent whatsoever. Surely we shouldn&apos;t be encouraging any more? But, Stilgoe says, &apos;music is an elemental force, as essential to being human as laughter. Before we paid other people to do it for us, we were all making our own music, usually in a group. It&apos;s tribal.&apos; Now, only the truly deluded seem to bother. The rest of us are too frightened of humiliation. Coker points out that &apos;most teenagers want both to be extraordinary and to blend into a crowd. In a musical group they get to do both.&apos; Plus, they have the perfect, in-the-moment joy that comes from creating a fantastic sound (making music is one of the few times teenagers are told to make more noise, rather than less). The group aspect means that they learn to collaborate with other people on an equal level. And they get to perform, &apos;which is important,&apos; says Coker, &apos;because some teenagers have gone through their short lives without anyone ever giving them praise. Having an audience applaud their efforts is utterly transformative.&apos; And anyway, surely wanting to be a musician should be part of any teenager&apos;s growing up. Cormac McSherry, who&apos;s 13, spends all his free time practising his guitar. &apos;I played drums for three years, but then I heard &apos;Live Forever&apos; and I completely fell in love with it and tried for ages to learn it on the guitar. It was one of the hardest things I ever learnt,&apos; he says. &apos;I&apos;m always on the guitar because there&apos;s not much to do, other than play a bit of football and go into town with my mates. And it&apos;s gonna be my living so I have to practise.&apos; Quite right. It must be strange to be a teenager today, to look around and see what used to be your culture hi-jacked and held on to by adults. To have your lives sold back to you as expensive experiences, which you struggle to afford. Who under the age of 25 could find the money to buy a Starbucks coffee? Or regularly pay full whack for a CD? All the so-called essential equipment of youth - trainers, phones, TVs, iPods, computers - cost tens, hundreds of pounds. So it&apos;s heartening to see teenagers grab back some space, do their own thing, turn their noses up at what the adult world is offering. They&apos;ve been standing at the window of our consumerist delights for too long, unable to access anything, either through lack of funds or our unwillingness to show them how. We should be cheering the few who&apos;ve had the courage to walk away and create what they actually want, cheaply and cheerfully, and then punt it out to like-minded others. When I think about my teenage years, I often wonder how on earth I got through them: and mine were as calm as a mill-pond compared to the turmoil that kids go through today. All of the adults I spoke to have sympathy for teenagers, are trying to help them negotiate possibly the trickiest time of their lives. And all of the adults are inspired by them too, even the bolshiest, the most annoying. There&apos;s an energy and joy to hanging out with teenagers that you don&apos;t get from the cleverest adult, the cutest child. Yes, they&apos;re impetuous and don&apos;t think about consequences. They can be random, unpredictable. Their emotions shoot all over the shop. But at least they&apos;re entertaining. We should be interested in them. Because, though they might pretend otherwise, they do care what we think. \u00b7 OMM columnist Miranda Sawyer recently turned 40 Mind the generation gap by Wolfie McFarlane There&apos;s still a generation gap but it&apos;s a more of a two-way street than ever before and that&apos;s what&apos;s different today. I&apos;ll search out my own music but it&apos;s hard to not be influenced by what you grow up listening to. My granddad is taking me to a blues festival this summer, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if that awakens something new in me. Likewise, my parents sometimes use me as a way into new music. My Dad not long ago became a big Green Day fan, after I&apos;d briefly got into the band. Of course that was quite embarrassing. Some things never change. But there&apos;s nothing I listen to that my parents really hate. Still, the heavy dance music my sister tries to put on in the car doesn&apos;t go down well, and really heavy metal like Slipknot isn&apos;t their favourite. Luckily, they&apos;re not one of my favourites either.  Teen slang: know what we&apos;re saying by Jacob Schofield These days teenagers use so many random words that it&apos;s hard to keep track. I suppose the obscure meanings are to stop parents from working out what their kids are on about. &apos;Yo John, you see that cold guy standardly mercin&apos; down that [insert obscenity for appropriate affect]?&apos; Translation: &apos;Hello Jonathan, did you see that amazing man insulting that [insert appropriate translation of obsenity]?&apos; That &apos;s an example of how a certain &apos;social group&apos; (generally chavs/wannabe gangstas) talk, and if you think it sounds ridiculous , you&apos;re right - all slang does nowadays. There are so many slang words that trying to list them would be the most pointless thing I have ever done.  Then there&apos;s the fact that my Dad might read this and I really don&apos;t want him knowing what I&apos;m saying.  Teen cults: the top shop version by Maude Churchill T hanks to the high street chains, it&apos;s easier than ever to join any youth tribe which takes your fancy. An indie kid no longer faces the burden of finding the skinniest of skinny-fit jeans because, lo and behold, they&apos;re the only sort you can buy these days, whether boy or girl. (If you&apos;re not blessed with model&apos;s legs, then resign yourself to combats or bias-cut skirts.) Then as soon as you&apos;ve bought the look - the new rave T-shirt, or the chavs&apos; gold chains - deny that you&apos;re part of that scene. That&apos;s part of the catch-22. How dare a gang make me feel out of place where I come from in Leeds because I refuse to join in with their ridiculous scene, based on music, fashion and a silly haircut! But come the weekend, I&apos;ll be at it, too, heading out clubbing with my UV-painted face aglow.  Myspace: it&apos;s so over by Hannah Lederer Alton We&apos;re the MySpace generation, are we? The idea of making millions of new &apos;friends&apos; might be appealing but surely there are hundreds of other websites that serve the same purpose. Just don&apos;t call it cyber-stalking. OK, I do know plenty of boys who say they mainly use MySpace for checking out girls, but at least they&apos;re being honest. The real problem lies with those who aren&apos;t quite so straightforward. Of course the site&apos;s useful for tracking down new music, but how many of Cajun Dance Party&apos;s supposed fans really give a hoot? Call me a hardened cynic already, but those people who update their page every 20 seconds with the addition of the latest hip group are trying too hard to impress. MySpace is quite irritating. Me? I use Facebook...", "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-16T23:38:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/17/culture.features", "sentences": ["To meet his fans, from Moscow to Hong Kong, he travels incessantly, Shanghai, New Mexico, Cuba ... not with the zest of his salad days, but in a slightly dogged search for audiences."], "title": "Gore Vidal: The lion in winter", "article": "Gore Vidal says that when he meets strangers, &apos;I invent a new character for myself.&apos; At 81, his potential repertoire of new roles has become limited by age and infirmity, but he still contrives an impressive entrance, descending from the upper floor of his villa in the Hollywood Hills like a deus ex machina. The experience of visiting him at home on the leafy, exclusive slopes of LA&apos;s Mulholland Drive is theatrical, even gothic. Norberto, the major-domo, shows you into a cavernously gloomy living room cluttered with Roman busts, Regency mirrors and massive old oils. Upstairs, across creaking floorboards, there is the sound of an old man getting up. It is mid-morning, and the house is just stirring. A gangly teenage boy in trainers, wearing an iPod, flits down the staircase and disappears backstage. More anticipation. Noises off: scraps of conversation from the servants&apos; quarters followed by the sinister drone of a lift descending to the ground floor with a ker-chunk. Another pause. Then the teenage boy reappears, supporting his master, who shuffles forward with excruciating slowness to make his greeting. The extended hand with the quasi-papal ring is thin and old. He turns his head awkwardly, not meeting your gaze. Still, Gore Vidal is recognisably himself, though dramatically aged, with the waxy pallor and wispy white hair of the slippered pantaloon. Vidal&apos;s entrance is matched by his first line. When I murmur something about Terre Haute, a new play by Edmund White which dramatises a fictional encounter between the writer and the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, Gore Vidal merely growls, &apos;Edmund White will yet be feeling the wrath of my lawyers.&apos; Where once he might have revelled in going the distance with another writer, now he seems surprisingly hurt by the treacherous ways of the creative community. &apos;It&apos;s unethical and vicious to make it very clear that this old faggot writer is based on me, and that I&apos;m madly in love with Timothy McVeigh, who I never met.&apos; He adds, tetchily, that he doesn&apos;t want to be &apos;lumped together with Mailer and Capote. They both went for murderers, and I don&apos;t go for murderers.&apos; Indeed not. Gore Vidal is the author of 24 novels (including Myra Breckinridge), a number of Broadway hits (notably The Best Man and Visit to a Small Planet), several collections of essays and a brilliant memoir, Palimpsest, but his greatest work might just be his extraordinarily fascinating life, now in its 82nd year. This is not, perhaps, an observation that will bring much joy to its subject. Old age is never fun. It presents in an acute form the human predicament: everyone must become neglected, forgotten, or replaced. For a writer who has known decades of acclaim, the lengthening shadows of approaching oblivion cannot be comforting. Even this shady hillside villa, no longer the magnificent Italian clifftop palazzo in which Vidal held court for so many years, has a transitional air, with packing cases and displaced furniture. But Vidal still manages to hold his audience. He has seemed passionate and vigorous in ideas even as his frame has declined. In keeping with his lifelong sense of himself as a literary celebrity, he is managing his endgame with all the adroitness of a great performer. Among the mythological beasts of the American literary jungle, Gore Vidal is, in the strict sense, the most fabulous. Capote was an exotic butterfly, Vonnegut an affable crowd-pleaser, Heller simply hilarious, but Vidal - &apos;veni, vidi, vidal&apos; sang the headline - trumps all of them for plumage, precocity and wit. If Mailer was America&apos;s Byron, Vidal was the Republic&apos;s Wilde, the master of the quotable quote, from, &apos;Whenever a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies&apos; to &apos;Shit has its own integrity.&apos; Once upon a time, at the end of the Second World War, his generation was immortal. The world was safe once more for motherhood and apple pie, and their photographs stare out at us from the pages of Life like glazed specimens under a Victorian glass bell: Truman, Norman and Gore. They were the new boys and they were going to reinvent American letters. Capote is long gone now (&apos;Good career move&apos; was Vidal&apos;s brilliantly waspish comment), but Mailer is still standing (with two canes). When Vidal enquires solicitously after his adversary (&apos;How is Norman taking age?&apos;), there is still a frisson of competition. &apos;He&apos;s very deaf. He has two artificial hips. I have one artificial knee.&apos; A beat. &apos;We are both bionic in the end.&apos; He points to a recent photograph of himself with Mailer and Vonnegut: &apos;Everyone else is dead.&apos; It seems cruel to point out that Vonnegut has also just departed; and at such moments, Vidal seems oddly vulnerable. It is strange, and quite moving, to see a man renowned for his matinee looks, his Roman profile and commanding wit so reduced by time. Yet the passage of the years has revealed, finally, an inner sweetness that was formerly masked by witty disdain, perhaps insecurity. Stripped of his style and his bon mots, but not his rage, Vidal seems like a warrior without his armour. Perhaps he was doomed to such a reckoning. Sixty years ago, when Harry Truman was president, George VI was king and sterling traded at $4, Vidal woke up, in January 1948, to find himself famous. He had already published Williwaw, a novel inspired by his wartime service in the US Navy, in 1946. Nothing about that debut hinted at the sensation caused by The City and the Pillar, a pioneering homosexual novel that now reads like the shy, even awkward, young American male&apos;s struggle with complex feelings, replete with explanations of &apos;beards&apos; and &apos;trade&apos;. Throughout his work, in different disguises, Vidal has looked back to 1945-50 as a lost paradise. Today, he renews his recollection of that golden age: &apos;For the first time, the US was not involved in a war. The Depression was over. Suddenly, there were 13m of us who&apos;d served in the military and were home. There was a cultural burst that Americans had never known before: we became number one for things like ballet. We had dozens of first-rate poets, several not so bad novelists, wonderful music, Lenny Bernstein and Aaron Copland. It was a great moment, and it lasted for five years. Then the Korean War came, and we&apos;ve never stopped being at war since.&apos; The City and the Pillar, which was published in the same season as Mailer&apos;s The Naked and the Dead, also became an immediate bestseller, and blasted Vidal into an orbit of Anglo-American celebrity from which he has never fallen. Vidal says he has &apos;met everyone, but knows no one&apos;, a bleak summary that hardly does justice to the scale of his charm offensive in the postwar world. The catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Vidal&apos;s remarkable meetings is a mini-history of Anglo-American literature and politics, from EM Forster and Eleanor Roosevelt to Rupert Everett and Hillary Clinton. &apos;The best thing about being Anglophone,&apos; he observes, elegiacally, &apos;is that you have two countries.&apos; As a young man, he encountered Harold Acton, Samuel Barber, Cecil Beaton, Albert Camus, Chips Channon, James Dean, William Faulkner, Federico Fellini, Greta Garbo, Evelyn Waugh (whom he describes as &apos;a drunken social climber&apos;) and George Santayana. The enfant terrible of the transatlantic literary scene, he partied with Isherwood, slept with Kerouac, dined with Auden, travelled with Tennessee Williams (&apos;the Bird&apos;) and enjoyed a strange, platonic friendship with Anais Nin. The Man Who Knew Everyone was especially successful in postwar London. Vidal&apos;s English connection, a source of pride and gratification, and well-represented by the signed photographs surrounding him in Hollywood, included Princess Margaret, Kenneth Tynan, Alec Guinness and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in the Bois de Boulogne. It is a mark of his ease at this altitude, possibly as the perfect guest and also as a formidably entertaining wit, that he is emphatically neither a name dropper nor a snob. What people liked about Vidal, I suspect, was his exquisite manners, his contrarian mind and the exhilarating range of his gifts. The attraction was mutual: they were as much drawn to him as he to them. The City and the Pillar was both a succ\u00e8s fou and a dead end. We have hardly begun to talk about Vidal&apos;s beginnings as &apos;the Huck Finn of the younger novelists&apos; before he launches into a well-rehearsed assault on the tyranny of the New York Times, which he describes with relish as &apos;a bad newspaper&apos;. According to Vidal, the Times&apos;s chief fiction reviewer, Orville Prescott, went to his publisher and declared of his novel, &apos;This is a filthy and disgusting book about homosexuality. I will not only never review another book by Vidal, but I will never read one.&apos; This, says Vidal, stymied his upward mobility as a novelist throughout the Fifties: &apos;If you didn&apos;t get a daily review in the New York Times you didn&apos;t exist as a novelist. It meant that everybody else, Time, Newsweek and all the other papers, would follow suit. You were out.&apos; Vidal&apos;s first step in his creative rehabilitation was to leave New York and come out here, to the west, to work in television. His Mississippi neighbour William Faulkner told him &apos;not to fall into the trap F Scott Fitzgerald did. He thought you could make something out of a movie. You can&apos;t. Go, get the money, go home, write your books.&apos; And that is what Vidal did. By the late Fifties he had made such a name for himself as a screenwriter that he was hired to rescue the script of the biggest movie of the decade, Ben-Hur. He doesn&apos;t recall his screen work with pride. &apos;We did too much. Someone would ring up and say, &quot;We&apos;ve got a bar, a bedroom and a kind of ballroom. We&apos;ve got Paul Newman and Vinnie Donehue is going to direct. Can you think of a play?&quot; In three or four days you&apos;d write something to fit the sets and the cast.&apos; Hollywood was a means to an end; inadvertently, it also introduced him to Italy in 1959, the country that became his second home. In hindsight, Vidal seems to relish his outsider status, boasting that he was never part of a clique. At the time, he was severely up against it. For a while he was reduced to writing novels under the pseudonym of Edgar Box. Much of his subsequent career was shaped by the consequences of publishing The City and the Pillar, but he seems unrepentant. &apos;Fiction is what I do,&apos; he says bluntly. Speaking of his family&apos;s response to his dramatic emergence as a literary celebrity, he provides a vital clue to his staying power. &apos;My father was asked, &quot;How do you explain Gore&apos;s courage?&quot; &quot;Courage about what?&quot; replied my father. &quot;It&apos;s not courageous if you don&apos;t care what people think of you.&quot; He had my number. Of course, one does care, but which kind of people is the question.&apos; Spoken like an aristocrat. The grandson of a blind senator from Oklahoma, the legendary TP Gore, and the son of an aviation pioneer of the Amelia Earhart generation, Eugene Luther Gore Vidal was born on 3 October 1925 into a world of politics and southern money that is, for America, almost unimaginably patrician. As a boy, he was Ganymede to his grandfather&apos;s Zeus: a ward, a companion and a reader. It is hard to overestimate the significance in his young life of the constant reading aloud from American classics to an older man indifferent to the world&apos;s censure. &apos;My grandmother would say, &quot;If it&apos;s in the newspapers, it&apos;s just not true.&quot; That was our automatic take.&apos; This was just the start in the making of &apos;Gore&apos;. When, through a sequence of divorces and remarriages, &apos;Gene&apos; (as he was) became a cousin to Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, years before her marriage to John F Kennedy, he secured a ringside seat at the unfolding tragedy of Jackie and Jack. &apos;I was fond of Jackie, though not at the end,&apos; he says. &apos;And I liked Jack.&apos; Why no novel about them? &apos;I knew too much about him to write about it. I write these books of mine to find out things.&apos; Some of the most vivid pages of his autobiographical writing recall golden summers on Martha&apos;s Vineyard, but he has reached a point in his endgame where he will not repeat old tales. &apos;It is always a delicate matter,&apos; he summarises grandly, &apos;when a friend or acquaintance becomes president.&apos; There was another delicacy, closer to home. Vidal himself never made any secret of his political ambitions, and still says that, brought up by a politician grandfather in Washington DC, he &apos;wanted very much to be a politician&apos;, the first of many dualities in his life: a shy, rather aloof man subjecting himself to the madness of political crowds. On two occasions, indeed, he ran for public office, without success. In the momentous year of 1960 he ran for Congress on a Democrat ticket (&apos;You Get More With Gore&apos;) in upstate New York, polling &apos;20,000 votes ahead of Kennedy&apos;. And in 1982 he ran against Governor Gerry Brown in California. When he describes these adventures on the campaign trail you glimpse Vidal inventing another role for himself. He admits that &apos;what I like is the campaign. I was always curious to meet the people. That&apos;s the part the professional politicians usually hate, but it&apos;s what feeds me as a novelist.&apos; There&apos;s a break in the conversation while the boy with the iPod passes through on an errand. &apos;My French godson,&apos; says Vidal, without elaboration, and turns to Barack Obama&apos;s chances in the 2008 campaign: &apos;He&apos;s not experienced enough. There are about 30 corporations you have to live with. They give you the money to run for office. But what you&apos;ve been paid for you&apos;d better do...&apos; This seems to be veering towards his current obsession about what he has called &apos;the United States of Amnesia&apos;; we go back to the Sixties. During the Kennedy years Vidal was part of Camelot, the detached and acidulous commentator on the foibles of the new establishment to which he was related. Another duality: he has always wanted to be at once a player and a critic, in the thick of the action yet commentating from the sidelines. To him, Jackie and JFK &apos;were totally fiction. They have nothing to do with history.&apos; In the end, like any courtier, he was banished, after a falling out with Bobby Kennedy. While the American picture darkened through a decade of assassination, civil crisis and the war in Vietnam, and after his abortive attempt to get into Congress, Vidal headed to Europe with his partner Howard Auster. Now, after years of incubating the idea, he began to write a historical novel about the late Roman emperor Julian, the apostate. To everyone&apos;s surprise, Julian became a number-one bestseller in the summer of 1964, refuelling his trajectory through the Anglo-American literary jet set. The creative energy of Julian would eventually morph into Vidal&apos;s lifelong theme, his great political novels about America: Burr, Lincoln, 1876, Empire, Hollywood and The Golden Age. But there was always another, more playful, side. In 1966, possibly in reaction to the Roman voices of the historical fiction, he began to write his comic masterpiece, a variation on the themes of gender, sex and film culture, Myra Breckinridge, described by the poet Thom Gunn as &apos;a late 20th-century equivalent of Alice in Wonderland&apos;. Vidal seems pleased when I bring up Myra, though perhaps weary of analysing questions about bisexuality. Myra, he says briskly, was &apos;the only way I could explain this extraordinary voice I&apos;d been hearing for a year&apos;. He wrote it down very quickly. &apos;That&apos;s the secret of comic books. Just get it all together while you have the impetus to do it.&apos; The voices twittering in his head did not begin to make sense until he was almost done. &apos;I was almost at the end of Myra Breckinridge before I realised she&apos;d been a man.&apos; He retains an affection for Myra. &apos;The funny ones are the ones I most like doing,&apos; he remarks, alluding to the sequel, Myron, and Duluth, Kalki and The Smithsonian Institute. Still, it&apos;s probably for his historical fiction about America, &apos;the Republic&apos;, that he will be remembered, especially in Britain, where his work has always prospered. Christopher Hitchens, whom Vidal describes as his dauphin, says: &apos;Vidal decided early on to become a European cosmopolitan rather than an &quot;all-American&quot; writer like Norman. So he is almost Jamesian in his fascination with English social niceties.&apos; Today, the European cosmopolitan seems quite reduced. Now, looking back, without irony, he attributes his passion for a lost American radicalism to Senator Gore, his blind grandfather. &apos;I remember he always said, &quot;This whole country is based on only one thing: due process of law, involving Habeas Corpus.&quot; The only good thing England gave us was Magna Carta, which he regarded as sacred.&apos; Borrowing from England, Vidal also pursued the literary essay, some of which - for example, Pink Triangle and Yellow Star - are contemporary classics. Others, such as his critique of American imperialism, the military-industrial complex and the sinister crimes of George W Bush, are exhilarating, slightly mad polemics whose rhetorical indignation probably outweighs their clarity of thought. Vidal has always written partly out of rage. Since 2000, a combination of anger, disappointment and old age have fused into a highly entertaining, often illuminating series of explosions. The child of America&apos;s &apos;golden age&apos; might have expected to spend his declining years, like King Lear, &apos;taking on the mystery of things&apos;, but it was not to be. The millennium brought Vidal&apos;s charmed life to an abrupt end. From the 2000 election in which George W Bush &apos;stole&apos; the presidency from Vidal&apos;s kinsman Al Gore (&apos;Never been able to remember what relation I am to Albert Gore Jr, even though his father once explained it to me&apos;), to 9/11, to the war in Iraq, it was a terrible decade for &apos;the Republic&apos;, and Vidal feels it keenly. &apos;Never have so many things gone so wrong all at once,&apos; he laments. &apos;Saboteurs (and thieves) have been in charge of every part of government.&apos; Tennessee Williams once asked &apos;if any other living writer is going to keep at it as ferociously, unremittingly, as Vidal&apos;. Far from being silenced by these catastrophes, Vidal&apos;s literary energy was now invested in a doddery polemic in which the Bush family plotted to defraud the American people, in which the US military was implicated in 9/11 and the presidency was sold out to Exxon and Halliburton. What, I wonder, quailing slightly before the catalogue of conspiracy, would Jefferson and the Founding Fathers have said about Bush and the neocons? &apos;They would say,&apos; replies Vidal, delivering the sentence with magisterial finality, &apos;that the protocols for impeachment are meant to be used. Of course Cheney should be impeached, and then I would impeach the president. They are guilty of high crimes against the constitution of the United States. We have a bad government, just out of control. We have turned into a very ugly, totalitarian society.&apos; Vidal&apos;s outrage at the government has taken him into some strange byways, for example his correspondence (but not meeting) with Timothy McVeigh. Vidal, following the trial of the Oklahoma City bombers, noticed that McVeigh was &apos;a very bright, self-taught constitutional lawyer; so I wrote a piece and said I was impressed&apos;. One thing led to another and eventually the death-row prisoner and veteran writer enjoyed a long correspondence. &apos;To my delight,&apos; Vidal recalls, &apos;he was very funny about a lot of things,&apos; adding approvingly that McVeigh was &apos;a very history-minded kid&apos;. But Vidal&apos;s motivation came not from his obsession with the constitution, but from something new: compassion. He was exercised by the prospect of McVeigh&apos;s death by lethal injection. Movingly, he describes how, unable to visit McVeigh in his final hours, he had to track the execution on television. &apos;He was suffering like nobody&apos;s business,&apos; he says sadly. McVeigh&apos;s pain echoed a much darker, and closer, torment for Vidal - the slow death from cancer of his lifelong partner Howard Auster. A Jewish boy from the Bronx, Auster had met Vidal at the Everard baths in 1950. Auster was working in a drug store to put himself through NYU and had tried, unsuccessfully, to get into advertising. Vidal, alert to anti-semitism on Madison Avenue, advised him to change the &apos;r&apos; of his name to &apos;n&apos;. As Howard Austen, he became Vidal&apos;s companion, but not lover, for 53 years. &apos;It is very easy to sustain a relationship when sex plays no part,&apos; says Vidal, &apos;and impossible when it does.&apos; In his memoir Palimpsest, he wrote, &apos;This satisfies no one of course but there, as Henry James would say, it is.&apos; Nothing about his circumstances or demeanour in the Hollywood Hills encourages further investigation of this subject, but his curious sexuality is perhaps the defining enigma of this oddly private man. Of course Vidal is homosexual. But only in the most circumscribed, passionless way. Famously, he has written, &apos;There are no homosexual people, only homosexual acts.&apos; Throughout his career he has celebrated the kind of polymorphous eroticism expressed in Myra Breckinridge, but love? Sex? In Palimpsest he writes, &apos;I don&apos;t really know what other people mean by love.&apos; Now that Howard Auster has gone, an emotion he never knew how to explore seems cruelly defined by its absence from his life, and has left him utterly desolate. The novelist and critic Jay Parini, who knew both Vidal and his partner during their Ravello years, says that &apos;Howard was the ideal, complementary life-mate and companion. He was short, rather barrel-chested, with a marvellous outgoing personality. He was a man of immense bright spirits, full of jokes, always teasing Gore. He kept Gore&apos;s feet on the ground, and didn&apos;t let him get away with anything. But Howard loved Gore, worshipped him, indeed; and Gore was completely devoted to Howard. The relationship was unusual. I know Gore has been devastated by the loss.&apos; Vidal likes to quote Montaigne&apos;s &apos;How did the living die and what did they say and how did they look at the end?&apos;. Following Montaigne, he is passionately unsentimental though not, in his own way, immune to feelings. Speaking of his paradisal Italian retreat, La Rondinaia, he says, &apos;In the end, it was just a pain in the ass.&apos; Similarly, at Howard&apos;s death in 2003, from cancer, in the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, he could not weep. He says, &apos;The Wasp glacier had closed over my head.&apos; Now there could be no more self-inventions, just a desperate mask. Grief took him to unexpected places. &apos;The only time I went on stage, in the part of Dalton Trumbo, a blacklisted writer on Broadway, was right after Howard died. Before I knew it, I was standing out there in front of the audience. It was the best thing I ever did. If you want to drown your grief,&apos; he adds, tellingly, &apos;play on Broadway.&apos; The aching emptiness of bereavement still hangs over the house in the Hollywood Hills. Finally at a loss, Vidal seems unsure of his role. When his partner had required specialist treatment, &apos;it was an intelligent thing to live in California&apos;, but now &apos;as the American dictatorship gets going, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the right setting to say farewell to the Republic&apos;. In the past, Gore Vidal has been so many characters. Now he is himself, facing eternity. To meet his fans, from Moscow to Hong Kong, he travels incessantly, Shanghai, New Mexico, Cuba ... not with the zest of his salad days, but in a slightly dogged search for audiences. When he has the energy, he works sporadically on the latest volume in what he calls his narrative history of the USA (Burr etc), about the Mexican war of 1846-48. This, he says with grim relish, &apos;is where we turned brutally imperial. Never looked back.&apos; He&apos;s also making a film with Tim Robbins, starring himself, Mailer and the late Vonnegut. &apos;I think they got his contribution in time,&apos; he notes, coolly. The plot is a classic scene from the Vidal endgame, one last roar. &apos;Three old men who fought in World War Two, reflecting on the war in Iraq.&apos; A wintry smile. &apos;I think it should serve.&apos; It&apos;s time for Vidal&apos;s first whisky. Our conversation meanders into a gossipy discussion of Norman Mailer&apos;s latest novel, and I wonder what contemporary writers he looks at these days. &apos;I do a lot of reading of the dead,&apos; he says. &apos;I finally got around after 50 years to reading all of Aristotle. He&apos;s very good on republics, how they always come a cropper, and why. Required reading. Republics, once lost, don&apos;t easily come back.&apos;", "tags": ["Gore Vidal", "Books", "Culture", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-16T23:41:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jun/17/art", "sentences": ["Even stately London, demographically, culturally and gastronomically, is not the place it was in 1970, while every two years, Shanghai adds a city the size it was in 1949 to its vast footprint."], "title": "Three billion careful owners", "article": "Le Corbusier once described New York City as a &apos;magnificent catastrophe&apos;. It is an expression that equally fits Mexico City, Mumbai, Sao Paulo, Johannesburg, Los Angeles and Tokyo - cities rapidly evolving in unpredictable, dangerous but exciting ways. Growth is inevitable. Even stately London, demographically, culturally and gastronomically, is not the place it was in 1970, while every two years, Shanghai adds a city the size it was in 1949 to its vast footprint. The great thing about cities is not how awful they are, but how wonderfully well they work, considering that putting more than 20 million humans in close proximity to engage in serial acts of competitive individualism could not be considered a reasonable idea. If you put rats into claustrophobic circumstances, they become cannibalistic in no time at all. But humans find ingenious solutions: Maglev trains, underground car parks, Korean supermarkets, pizza delivery, cycle lanes, very tall buildings. A century ago, only about 10 per cent of the world&apos;s population lived in cities. By 2050 that figure is expected to rise to at least 75 per cent. In 1995, in his Reith lecture, the architect Richard Rogers asked if you could design an entire city. The answer would seem to be no. Global cities are governed by a scary dynamic which has a teeming, desperate underclass anxious for material progress and a rich hyperclass above them, anxious to maintain its privileged access to goods and services. The forces involved are way beyond the influence of architecture. As a result, the planet&apos;s celebrity architects get carried away with fantastical remedial proposals of dubious practicality: unworldly, techno-organic inventions, urban piazzas or ever higher risers. Still, the design of the ideal city has a history that goes back to Plato. He described the legendary Atlantis as a palace in a circle surrounded by a plain divided into 60,000 square living plots. The Roman architect Vitruvius organised his ideal city in response to the eight winds of classical mythology. Meanwhile, the British took refuge from the industrial hell that they had created by dreaming of bringing the country into the city. John Nash&apos;s Regent&apos;s Park remains the ultimate expression of rus in urbe, but the idea was also nicely democratised by Ebenezer Howard, who coined the term &apos;garden city&apos; in his book Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (1898). Yet you look at Mexico City or Mumbai today and one struggles to think how an architect&apos;s windy piazza or a planner&apos;s arboriculture might help. The fast-evolving global cities are not going to be inspired by Thomas More&apos;s Utopia. Their source would seem to be JG Ballard&apos;s dystopia, with technology and sociology running out of control. In her great book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) Jane Jacobs told us: &apos;But look at what we have built.&apos; We have built some magnificent catastrophes. \u00ad The Global Cities exhibition is in the Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London SE1 (020 7887 8888; www.tate.org.uk) from 20 June to 27 August", "tags": ["Art", "Life and style", "Culture", "Art and design"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-16T23:42:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/17/motoring.lifeandhealth", "sentences": ["&apos;I would work with Ricardo or whoever, build a plant in Shanghai and make them there,&apos; says the expert."], "title": "Ford stalls at dangerous  crossroad", "article": "If Ford is about to sell Jaguar and Land-Rover and if private equity is about to buy them - both not very big ifs, according to the well informed - then what will those two venerable British companies look like in five years&apos; time? For their 16,000 employees, it&apos;s a chilling question. For the unions that represent those workers it will leave a sour taste, too: only weeks ago Ford was saying it had no plans to sell. It will be made all the worse if acquisition is by a private equity firm of the kind unions have campaigned against and accused of self-enrichment built on asset-stripping. But it looks quite likely. According to one banker who hopes to act for a buyer when a sale is announced, major car companies such as Hyundai, Peugeot/Citroen, Renault/Nissan and Fiat have all looked at the pair and walked away. Cerberus, the private equity player buying Chrysler along with other firms including Blackstone and component maker Magna, is more interested, as are Russian and Chinese carmakers. So, what would a private equity takeover of one or both of these companies look like? And, in the long run, would it necessarily be a bad thing? After all, MG Rover was &apos;saved&apos; from asset-stripping Alchemy in 2000, only to be destroyed by a wayward team of businessmen without a business plan over the next five years. Might private equity do a classic &apos;strip and flip&apos; - slashing the workforce, closing plants and gearing up with debt before selling on in five years? Jon Moulton, head of buyout specialist Alchemy, who has been linked with the Jaguar sale, says: &apos;You would have to be totally ruthless here, and I don&apos;t think Ford would allow that. The asset-strip will never be capable of being done, it&apos;s fundamentally wrong with a company like this.&apos; Although he denies it, bankers say quietly that Moulton will be considering a bid. For now, however, he is content to list the problems. &apos;You have 16,000 expensive employees in the wrong country. You have a model range that is far from perfect. And it falls into that difficult niche - &quot;medium-sized car business&quot;.&apos; Jaguar has only recently introduced diesel engines and, with its 2.8, cannot match BMW, Audi or Mercedes in this hugely important market. Most important, from a buyout perspective, is the money. Moulton says: &apos;One thing I am sure about is that Land-Rover and Jaguar combined are consuming cash.&apos; Indeed, one City source says Jaguar lost between $800m and $1bn (\u00a3406m-\u00a3507m) last year. This will not put off bidders, who sniff a bargain in renowned brands that, experts say, have been poorly managed (Jaguar) or suffered from indifferent quality (Land-Rover), and who will be puzzling out how to shake them up. Question one will be: should they be bought together or split? One well-placed banker who advised Ford when it bought Land-Rover in 2000, says: &apos;Ford has spent five years integrating these companies so they are not easy to pull apart. Some of the vehicle architecture is the same, many of the components are, and they both use Halewood [the Merseyside plant that makes the Land-Rover Freelander and the Jaguar X-Type].&apos; If he is right, and the companies come together, a buyer would be getting four manufacturing plants (although Browns Lane in Coventry stopped making cars in 2005 and now has 500 employees turning out wood veneer only), along with two West Midland design and development centres at Gaydon and Whitely. The next question, bearing in mind private equity&apos;s record of doing property deals to realise value on &apos;underperforming&apos; balance sheet items, is which facility to sell. The main plants are Halewood, which employs 2,200; the Jaguar plant at Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands, which has 2,500 people making the large XJ, the XK sports car and the S-Type saloon; and Solihull, also in the West Midlands, employing 5,900 people to produce Range Rovers and Land-Rover Discoveries and Defenders. The plants are owned freehold. With combined sales dipping from 277,000 to 267,000 between 2004 and 2006 (Jaguar fell, Land-Rover rose); continuing exchange-rate pressure (the US is a key growth market); and high manufacturing costs, some experts expect one or more of these to be sold. The prime candidate is Solihull, set in 308 acres surrounded by an affluent residential district. Moulton says: &apos;If you were to sell it, you could expect to get \u00a360m to \u00a370m.&apos; There would be a lot of interest, says Anthony Glossop, chairman of St Modwen, which bought most of the Longbridge site from MG Rover: &apos;Solihull would be a dream development. It was built at the edge of a conurbation that has grown to surround it.&apos; As for valuation: &apos;If you got industrial-only use, \u00a360-\u00a370m is on the nose. But if you could persuade the local authority to build houses on it as well as industrial and commercial, it could go for three times that.&apos; Glossop says he would be very interested if a sale was announced, adding that Castle Bromwich, which spans 112 acres, could also be developed, though more likely as a purely industrial or commercial site. But there is then the question of whether selling one is just doing half the job. The banking adviser says: &apos;It is not just about realising the plant&apos;s value. You have to ask if the current configuration is right. The workforce is in the wrong place. It is too high-cost. It is not in the growth market [the US] or in a low-cost centre like China. You need to open a plant in the southern US and take advantage of state funds to regenerate some areas - one in China and leave one or two in the UK.&apos; Ford, which has its own plants at Dagenham and in Wales, and a long history of mass manufacturing in the UK, has not found it possible to do this. Private equity might be able to - if Ford were to sell to such a buyer. Closing plants is expensive, however. Moulton says: &apos;You would be looking at about \u00a350,000 a head - that&apos;s \u00a31bn for the UK workforce,&apos; although not all would be made redundant.&apos; And then there are pension costs. According to the latest figures from Ford, the combined pension fund deficit was just under \u00a3500m in 2005 (Land-Rover&apos;s was \u00a3193.5m, Jaguar&apos;s \u00a3298.2m). As KKR has found in its bid for Boots, pension fund trustees can demand extra payments - in the case of Boots, \u00a31bn - to ensure the integrity of the funds. The next question, then, is: how to minimise or avoid these costs? The extreme option is to do what Russian oligarch Nikolai Smolensky is said to have done at TVR, the formerly Blackpool-based sports car maker. Smolensky, who bought TVR in 2004 and failed to turn it around, said that he would build a new plant near Blackpool, but resigned just before the company was put into administration last December with \u00a330m debts. He bought the company back earlier this year minus its liabilities, and is reported to be looking to start production again in Italy. Moulton says: &apos;I think this is unlikely. You have to pay a very large number to buy it, then you have to bet on buying it out of insolvency, which you might not do - in which case you really have wasted an awful lot of money.&apos; But there are alternatives, according to other observers, such as not paying a huge amount at all. &apos;What you do is say to Ford: we will pay you so many billion as a headline price but are going to have to close x and y and lay off so many thousands and we want you to bear the cost,&apos; says a City banker. &apos;What will end up happening is Ford paying someone to take it off their hands while saying it has got a whacking great price. Because, don&apos;t forget, it is not making money.&apos; Whatever costs are saved and assets are stripped, however, private equity will want to sell on within, say, five years, and it will need a viable business to sell. The range of models will be key to this. Bailey says: &apos;Ford has spent a lot on developing models. The Land-Rover line-up is good, with the new Range Rover Sport and Discovery 3. The first thing a private equity player would do is scrap the Jaguar X-Type, which feels like a Mondeo because it shares so many parts with it.&apos; Much will then depend on how the new XF car - which breaks from Jaguar&apos;s fuddy-duddy &apos;heritage&apos; styling - does when it is launched next year, forming a replacement for the S-Type. An owner would have to ponder whether to restyle the Sixties-looking XJ or spend upwards of $500m on replacing the X-Type. More crucial, however, are engines, which are supplied centrally to Jaguar by Ford. One expert says: &apos;They have a 2.8, which does not get you far at the golf club, where people have their big Audis and Mercedes. They are missing out on the most important European market here.&apos; So a new owner must do a deal with Ford to keep supply going - raising the prospect of Ford retaining a stake in the businesses - while developing new engines, preferably diesel, with engineering companies such as Ricardo. &apos;I would work with Ricardo or whoever, build a plant in Shanghai and make them there,&apos; says the expert. &apos;Then you would have a real proposition to sell on in five years&apos; time.&apos;", "tags": ["Business", "Life and style", "Automotive industry"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-17T00:10:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/17/theobserver.observerbusiness3", "sentences": ["The operation, for customers with more than $1m to invest, will have outposts in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Delhi, Mumbai and Dubai, as well as an office in London&apos;s Jermyn Street and one in Jersey."], "title": "Standard to open bank for 'new rich'", "article": "Standard Chartered is this week launching a private bank aimed at the millions of newly rich in Asia and the Middle East.

He says he feels fine and somehow manages to fit in his &quot;day jobs&quot; in Britain - Bartlett professor of planning and regeneration at University College London, chairman of Blackpool&apos;s urban regeneration company, regular columnist in specialist magazines, prolific writing elsewhere, and with a rate of globetrotting that would make younger men tremble. &quot;Actually, I&apos;m sleeping very well,&quot; he volunteers in the splendid offices, near the Mall, of his beloved Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA), of which he is president and long-time activist. As the foremost geographer and planner of his generation, Hall feels compelled to write about every place he visits with a journalistic skill - a keen eye, attention to detail, bound in an immensely readable style - that eludes most academics. The fruits of his labours, closer to home, will be unveiled shortly in a new book, London Voices, London Lives - Tales from a Working Capital, to be published soon. Hall, who has written well over 30 books - including the masterly Cities in Civilisation (1998) - has charted the &quot;extraordinary changes&quot; in the capital over the last 50 years. The book&apos;s genesis lies in a project, undertaken with a team, that included 130 interviews for an Economic and Social Research Council-funded project. &quot;They were fascinating when transcribed,&quot; he says, &quot;but we only used a fraction of the material and, at the end of it, we said to ourselves: &apos;This is fascinating stuff. Shouldn&apos;t we make another book out of it?&apos;&quot; Fascinating because of ordinary lives? &quot;So ordinary, yes. It brings out the differences between one part of London and the other. We started out in Reading, because we thought this was a typical Thames Valley boom town. Then we jump over to Hounslow, which we call airport city, and is also a big area of Indian sub-continent settlement, mainly Gujurati from the 60s and 70s. Now many of them are saying: &apos;Oh, we don&apos;t like it here (now) because of the immigrants. We need to go to Surrey.&apos;&quot; But it is Gants Hill, near Essex, that Hall finds &quot;absolutely fascinating&quot;, as 1930s suburbia, which was very largely Jewish. &quot;They came out from Whitechapel and now they are being replaced by people from the Indian sub-continent who have come from Whitechapel.&quot; Born in Hampstead, north London, Hall went to live in Blackpool in 1940 when his father, a clerical officer in the pensions service, was dispersed to the seaside resort. Consequently, he is proud to call himself &quot;an honorary Blackpudlian&quot; and is deeply grateful for &quot;an extraordinarily good education&quot; in the town&apos;s grammar school. He is now repaying his debt to the town as chairman of its urban regeneration company. Part of his crusade to reinvent the resort involved a campaign to bring a super casino to the seafront in an attempt to kickstart wider regeneration. But earlier this year, to the surprise of almost everyone, an independent planning panel said the super-casino should go to Manchester. Uproar ensued. Hall says the latest intelligence indicates that the government will &quot;park&quot; the plan, and instead allow 16 smaller casinos to go ahead. Interviewing Hall is rather like attending a tutorial: endlessly informative, and amusing. His planning/ academic career took off with the publication of his book, London 2000, in 1963 while at Reading University as a young Fabian. &quot;It was really about planning London at a time when planning was at the top of the public agenda in a way I think it has never been since.&quot; He was invited by the government to join the South East Economic Planning Council. It was abolished in 1979 by Margaret Thatcher. &quot;I wrote afterwards that the greatest irony was she shut it down because she thought it was not making any contribution, and we had three big agendas in our last years: one, that you would never develop London Docklands without an urban development corporation; two, that London&apos;s third airport should be at Stansted; and three, that the first national transport priority should be the M25 orbital motorway. So she shut us down rapidly to implement all three!&quot; As the TCPA celebrates the 60th anniversary of the Town and Country Planning Act, Hall is no starry-eyed sentimentalist longing for a return to the interventionist politics of post-war Britain. He says: &quot;The act really assumed that the private sector wouldn&apos;t be very important any more, that most of the houses would be built by the public sector for the workers - a bit like a liberal communist country.&quot; Now the world has changed and Hall&apos;s view is that it should be possible for planners to determine where development takes place, with the private sector delivering housing and new settlements. &quot;We do know this is possible because we&apos;ve been doing it very successfully in new towns such as Milton Keynes, where you had a very strong, positive planning thrust.&quot; One of his regrets is that planning became such a pejorative term during the Thatcher governments that the discipline was ground down over 20 years to the extent that there is now a shortage of professionals. &quot;Training plummeted and the profession became beleaguered, overloaded and overworked,&quot; he says. His other regret is that the volume house builders have morphed into land speculation companies, holding back valuable, desperately-needed building land to boost balance sheets. His answer? &quot;You have to have strictly [time] limited planning consents and take it [land] off them and give it to someone else to develop. I really do.&quot; Curriculum vitae Age 75.

Michel Jarraud, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organisation in Geneva, doesn&apos;t see it that way. His colleagues involved in the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change don&apos;t see it that way. They do the best science they can. And then they offer politicians the best advice based on that science that they can agree on. Take for instance the question of whether a warmer world - and 11 of the warmest years ever recorded have all fallen in the last 12 - means a more dangerous one, more dangerous in terms of terrible hurricanes and horrible droughts. There is still a huge scientific debate about the hurricanes and tropical cyclones, he said, briefing journalists at a recent &quot;global platform&quot; on disaster reduction in Geneva. But those aren&apos;t the disasters, those are only hazards. Disasters happen when hazards overtake people in vulnerable places. &quot;More and more people are living in vulnerable areas. If you have people living in coastal areas that are vulnerable to a storm surge like the one that destroyed New Orleans; if you have people living in mountains where there can be avalanches; this is what we call vulnerability,&quot; he says. &quot;Vulnerability is increasing. The world population is increasing still, quite fast. At the same time more and more people live in vulnerable areas, many big cities are close to the ocean; if you have a tsunami, if you have storm surge, they are more vulnerable than people living inland.&quot; There is another factor: the warning systems. Meteorologists may see trouble coming. Someone still has to get the message to the people in harm&apos;s way. One of the worst disasters of all time was in 1970 in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan): a lethal combination of tropical cyclone and storm surge sent a huge wave of water inland. The official death toll was 300,000. Many people reckon that around 500,000 may have died. The government of the day realised that there had been no effective warning system, so they arranged with meteorologists to sound the alarm when danger threatened. &quot;That is good, but not good enough,&quot; said Mr Jarraud. &quot;Once the warnings are ready you need to get them to the people, so they put in place, through radio, through sirens, ways to tell the people. That was good but that was not good enough. Next step: when you get the warning, what do you do? People have to be trained, they have to know how to react, so they put in place this training and they said: if you get that message, you have to evacuate. Evacuate? In flat country? Where do I run, what do I do?&quot; So the government built shelters: big, ugly things on big concrete pillars, with nice wide stairways so nobody would get trampled in any panic. These shelters have radios, batteries, stores for food and medicine: each shelter has a doctor allocated to it. Villagers know which shelter they should go to; there is an army of volunteers involved in getting the message to the millions in the danger zone; communities stage regular training days. Prevention and warning, says Mr Jarraud, is all system: you have to consider all the elements in the chain. In 1991, more than 100,000 disappeared in a second calamitous storm surge in the region: the unofficial toll may have been much higher. Muhammad Saidur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Disaster Preparedness Centre, told me in a separate encounter that the danger was that 10 million people lived in the hazard zone, and they lived there because they were too poor to live anywhere else. The numbers at risk keep growing; shelters are costly and there may not be enough of them. The real danger is not the storm, or the steady rise in flooding, the really bad moment is when the wind drops. Storms take hours to build up into floods, but when the cyclone moves on, the flood cascades back into the ocean in minutes, in one terrifying whoosh, and with it go houses, cattle, tools, crops, trees, machinery, stores and people, never to be seen again. So 1991 was another appalling catastrophe, but, says Mr Jarraud, it takes time to get prevention systems working properly. There have been storm surges since 1991, but the dead were counted in thousands, or hundreds. &quot;You can argue that thousands is too many, but remember, from 300,000 to a few thousand is a success story. It&apos;s a learning process and we are learning from experience.&quot; The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been accused of political one-sidedness, issuing alarmist reports, or &quot;emotionalising&quot; science. It seems to me that there might not be an &quot;on the other hand&quot; to consider when you see a storm surge advancing on a crowded community in a low-lying landscape. Under such circumstances, it would also be pretty difficult to sound an alarm without being alarmist. It would be pretty difficult not to feel emotional about devastation and deaths counted in hundreds of thousands. Right now, more than half the world lives in cities. Almost half the world - 3 billion people - lives on a coastline. By 2030, an estimated 2 billion people will live in urban slums. Tokyo, Mumbai, Shanghai, Jakarta and Dhaka have potentially uncomfortable qualities: they are all cities that are growing fast, and are all simultaneously vulnerable to earthquake, cyclone, tsunami and storm surge. It might indeed be a political act to issue warnings about the increased potential for disasters that might arrive with climate change, but the consequences of not issuing warnings could be even more political, and of course more terrible. As a former president of Harvard once put it, in another context, if you think education is expensive, try ignorance. &quot;I don&apos;t think scientists are playing politics,&quot; says Mr Jarraud. &quot;Scientists in this process want to make sure that we understand better and better the climate system, that we can have better and better models, that we have better and better observation, and that at the end of the day, we can provide the politicians with the best possible prediction information. That is our role.&quot; \u00b7 Tim Radford attended the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction as a guest of the global journalism network Media 21 and the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction in Geneva", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-21T22:57:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/23/tvandradio.guide1", "sentences": ["Shanghai Noon(Tom Dey, 2000)  10.45pm, BBC1 Jackie Chan is near his riotous best in this slapstick martial arts pastiche of a western."], "title": "The week's best films: June 23-29", "article": "Saturday June 23 Tora!

Jason Flemyng plays the villain throwing a party to celebrate the demise of a rival (Liam Cunningham), but it&apos;s a heavyhanded affair.

Rod Steiger&apos;s emperor is an irritating mass of method trickery, outgunned by Christopher Plummer&apos;s cool Wellington, but all the august performances - including Virginia McKenna, Jack Hawkins, Orson Welles - are mere warm-up acts for the hour-long conflict. Fallen(Gregory Hoblit, 1997) 10pm, Five Intriguing blend of crime thriller and ghostly chiller, reminiscent of Alan Parker&apos;s Angel Heart. Denzel Washington stars as a Philadelphia cop on the trail of a serial killer: in the murk it&apos;s hard to see that supernatural elements are at work. A strong cast - Donald Sutherland, John Goodman and James Gandolfini - keep it interesting. Die Hard(John McTiernan, 1988) 11pm, ITV1 With DH4 in the offing, here&apos;s the original full-blast actioner, with Bruce Willis as indestructible New York cop McClane tackling a small army of terrorists in an LA tower block. Armed with an inexhaustible supply of one-liners, the hangdog hero wastes the baddies hunting him through corridors and lift-shafts. With great, comic-book thrills, scene-stealing Alan Rickman as chief villain Gruber and Bonnie Bedelia as Mrs Worried McClane, it&apos;s a classic of its kind. Bronco Billy(Clint Eastwood, 1980) 11.50pm, BBC2 One of those quirky, accomplished Eastwood projects that&apos;s therapy for his avenging-angel westerner and heavy-cop personas. His New Jersey shoe salesman realises a dream to ride off and become a real Rowdy Yates in a wild west circus. Clint&apos;s ex, Sondra Locke, plays a New York heiress tagging along in this easy-going comedy. Tuesday June 26 The Mexican(Gore Verbinski, 2001) 11.15pm, BBC1 Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts is an impressive A-list double header, but this isn&apos;t a huge success. He&apos;s a mafia bozo sent to collect an antique pistol - the Mexican - for Don Gene Hackman; she&apos;s Brad&apos;s put-upon girlfriend, kidnapped as insurance against him failing to do the job. The two share little screentime, and when they do it&apos;s uncomfortably shrill; her relationship with abductor James Gandolfini is much more fun. Wednesday June 27 Executive Decision(Stuart Baird, 1996) 9pm, Five We can wear the traditional Islamic terrorists led by the obligatory bad Brit (David Suchet), and even the tub of nerve gas about to wipe out Washington DC, but there&apos;s plenty more that&apos;s hard to swallow in this plane hijack adventure. Like a mid-air tunnel device allowing a US hit squad on board; like Steven Seagal for once not his invulnerable Under Siege self; and like Kurt Russell playing a cerebral type not much given to kicking ass. That said, it&apos;s a highly efficient thriller. The Cider House Rules(Lasse Hallstrom, 1999) 10.45pm, BBC1 The sensibilities and humanistic worldview of Hallstrom - director of the sublime My Life As A Dog - are a fine match for John Irving&apos;s big, difficult novel about a young man&apos;s search for his destiny. It stars Tobey Maguire as Homer Wells, the orphan taken in by a decent New England abortionist, Dr Larch (Michael Caine, in an Oscar-winning performance). An old-fashioned, gentle and moving drama. Psycho(Gus Van Sant, 1998) 1.05am, C4 Whatever possessed Van Sant to take on the thankless task of remaking Hitchcock&apos;s classic? Pure admiration, maybe, because aside from a few modern references, his 90s update is a scene-by-scene, word-by-word copy of the original: a slavish homage in which the only real horror is in watching game actors Anne Heche (as Marion Crane) and Vince Vaughn (as Norman Bates) failing miserably to live up to the iconic performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Even with the likes of Julianne Moore, Viggo &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; Mortensen and William H Macy attempting to add texture, it remains a slightly kooky, redundant exercise. Thursday June 28 Witness For The Prosecution(Billy Wilder, 1957) 1.20pm, C4 A witty, utterly captivating adaptation of Agatha Christie&apos;s devious courtroom drama. Around the slightly puzzled looking leading man, Tyrone Power, who is accused of murdering a wealthy widow, are some delicious, top-class acts: Charles Laughton, Elsa Lanchester, and Marlene Dietrich. Behold A Pale Horse(Fred Zinnemann, 1964) 3.15pm, Five Zinnemann&apos;s post-Spanish civil war drama, adapted from Emeric Pressburger&apos;s novel, Killing A Mouse On Sunday, has Gregory Peck as a guerrilla, still fighting the war 20 years on. One man against many, with his old foe, police chief Anthony Quinn, in his sights, he&apos;s a hero in the mould of High Noon&apos;s Will Kane. Friday June 29 Moulin Rouge(John Huston, 1952) 1.15pm, C4 The stunning opening 20 minutes is an exhilarating can-can show, after which this biopic of Toulouse-Lautrec starts running out of breath. Good performance by Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as the little artist, though, and an authentic picture of sleazy, showy 19th century Montmartre. With Colette Marchand, Zsa Zsa Gabor. Boys Don&apos;t Cry(Kimberley Peirce, 1999) 11.45pm, BBC2 The true-life story of Teena Brandon, a young Nebraskan girl who felt more comfortable as a man, so disguised herself and became Brandon Teena. She/he was subsequently raped and murdered in 1993. Oscar-winning Hilary Swank is stunning as Brandon; Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is deeply sympathetic as his girlfriend; Peter Saarsgard and Brendan Sexton III chilling as the killers. It&apos;s a shocking - if sadly unsurprising - tale of ignorance and loathing in small town America. The Legend(Corey Yuen, 1993) 12.35am, BBC1 Featuring an early appearance by Jet Li, in a Jackie Chan-ish blend of comedy and knockabout martial arts. It&apos;s a slightly surreal blend of period costume drama (the confrontation between the Red Lotus rebels and the corrupt Manchu dynasty), the romantic (to win the hand of beautiful Michelle Reis, Jet Li&apos;s legendary kung fu king Fong Sai-Yuk must defeat her mother in combat) and a lot of mystifying cross-dressing shenanigans that aren&apos;t as funny as they think.", "tags": ["Culture", "Television industry", "Media", "Television", "Television & radio"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-23T22:55:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jun/23/exhibition.art", "sentences": ["Over the past two decades, the Iraqi-born designer has constructed buildings in cities from Shanghai to Dubai, yet frustratingly, the flamboyant Hadid is better known in this country for her proposals."], "title": "Exhibitions preview: June 23-29", "article": "Inside Outside Edinburgh Chong Bin Park&apos;s sculptures grab your attention through a deceptive simplicity of construction and an all-pervading atmosphere of innocence.

It seems he&apos;s taken a unique response to archiving by chewing, tearing and twisting paper into elegant sculptures that are then littered among the garden tools on display. On the walls are animations of these sculptures come to life, creating a magical, after-dark impression of the gallery after closing time. Working with local children, Woolham&apos;s exhibition combines playful fantasy with a rigorous investigation of the museum&apos;s neglected spaces.Jessica Lack  \u00b7 Museum Of Garden History, SE1, to Aug 25 Choi Jeong-HwaWolverhampton It was a prone orange robot jittering in its death throes that first introduced the west to Korean artist Choi Jeong-Hwa&apos;s bleakly comic installations. His sculptures are bright, often garish everyday objects inflated to extreme proportions. Alluding to Disney, manga and comic book graphics, his sculptures are more than an ironic reference to escapist entertainment, questioning the value of art and our attitudes to disposable items.JL  \u00b7 Wolverhampton Art Gallery, Sat 23 to Sep 1 Paradise Is For The BlessedLondon Seven artists seek out mini utopias in our over-populated planet. Artists including Maria Benjamin, Toby Smith, Minou Norouzi and Tomoko Yoneda search for paradise among ruins from the scrubby banks of the River Lea to New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina. Yoneda finds beauty in landscapes once brutalised by war, while Norouzi&apos;s film is an intimate study of the destruction of wildlife in suburban LA. But it&apos;s Toby Smith&apos;s haunting images of a cornfield in Lincolnshire that best captures the curatorial brief.JL  \u00b7 Four Corners, E2, to Jul 21 Out Of This World And Unnatural SelectionLiverpool Fantasy illustration rarely gets recognised as a legitimate form of fine art. Yet, occasionally, an artist such as Josh Kirby is rightly recognised as an imaginative force. Here we see the originals of his illustrations for Terry Pratchett&apos;s Discworld series alongside a poster for Star Wars and book cover portraits of Alfred Hitchcock. The accompanying exhibition of jewellery and objects by Peter Chang also has a sci-fi feel. Wielding precious metals, mirrors, lacquer, acrylic, resin and PVC, Chang fashions hybrid ambiguities such as salt and pepper mills spouting tentacles and an amoebic blob of a brooch.RC  \u00b7 Walker Art Gallery, to Sep 30 Jen DeNikeSheffield Through a series of staged colour photographs and video fragments, Jen DeNike builds up a story of mock-patriotic rituals. The adolescent protagonists, caught with deadpan expressions, suggest scenarios of moral dilemmas. Two boys, dressed in jeans and white T-shirts, so as not to give away any uniform of conventionality or hint of subcultural rebelliousness, are posed in front of a white clapboard house on which the American flag has been pinned upside down. The upturned flag can be taken equally as a sign of revolt or as an SOS. In the video Flag Girls, six expressionless performers stand to attention, their nakedness wrapped in the flag. Throughout, there&apos;s a brooding claustrophobia, a suspense and sense of uncertainty, a suggestion of American nationhood perhaps being transfixed by almost terminal self-doubt.RC  \u00b7 Site Gallery, to Jul 21 Zaha HadidLondon Loud, vivacious and rarely seen without her spiky high heels, Zaha Hadid is that rare thing: a female architect in what is still a very macho environment. Over the past two decades, the Iraqi-born designer has constructed buildings in cities from Shanghai to Dubai, yet frustratingly, the flamboyant Hadid is better known in this country for her proposals. Although critically acclaimed, there seemed a time in the mid-90s when her brutally elegant constructions endlessly played runner-up to designs of a more moderate appeal. Fortunately, the rest of the world, and in particular Germany, were more radical in thinking, enabling her to realise some extraordinary creations, including the Science Centre in Wolfsburg, recently shortlisted for the RIBA Stirling Prize. This retrospective features Hadid&apos;s star attractions and includes her proposals for the Aquatic Centre for the 2012 Olympic Games.

You&apos;ve just got off the overnight &quot;red eye&quot; flight from New York. You&apos;re disoriented, all-in and grumpy. Then you enter the gleaming, state-of-the-art temple to air travel that is the new Heathrow Terminal 5, where you are targeted with a series of sleek digital advertising messages that perfectly tune into your state of mind and where you have come from. Welcome to the brave new world of airport advertising - a world that will be unveiled on March 27 next year when the new terminal opens. Much has been written about how Terminal 5 will act as a showcase for the UK and finally launch Heathrow onto the world stage alongside such fabulously futuristic airports as Shanghai, Hong Kong and Los Angeles. But the advertising opportunities it will offer will be a part of this too, with an estimated \u00a325m being invested into revolutionising plonky old airport posters and making the new terminal an unrivalled 21st-century media space. JCDecaux Airport, which has the advertising contract at all seven British Airport Authority (BAA) sites including Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh besides Heathrow, has worked closely alongside BAA and the terminal&apos;s architects to weave the advertising facilities into the new building&apos;s design. These include the construction of iconic high-profile sites, maximised positioning of all advertising messages and, crucially, the introduction of digital as never before. &quot;We have been able to build advertising into the fabric of the building because we have been involved right from the outset,&quot; says Julie France, managing director of JCDecaux Airport. &quot;This isn&apos;t about sticking a lightbox on a wall. Terminal 5 is all about &apos;less is more&apos;. It&apos;s about reducing the clutter, about having a limited number of very high profile sites so that the advertising will be massively visible.&quot; These sites will include spectaculars such as the so-named Global Gateways - giant 29m x 3.6m lightboxes and each one larger than four London Buses - that will dominate the check-in channels. But a key element is that almost 300 digital sites will be installed in the terminal, representing over half the airport&apos;s advertising estate and thereby blazing a trail in airport advertising internationally. &quot;Terminal 5 will have the largest deployment of digital screens out of any airport in the world. There is nothing else on this scale. It will make Heathrow a truly showcase airport destination,&quot; says France. The hope is that digital will bring new advertisers into the airport. Traditionally, airport advertising has been about long-term business-to-business or corporate branding campaigns, but digital will mean that short-term campaigns will be possible for the first time, appealing to a range of other advertisers from fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) to luxury items, perfumes and cosmetics. Prices will start at just \u00a320,000 for a two-week campaign. Digital&apos;s flexibility will also mean advertisers can target their messages by audience, location or a specific time during the day, and they will be able to change the creative executions to suit passengers&apos; different mindsets, as they move from check-in to boarding. Screens will even be able to target the arrival or departure of particular flights or run language-specific messages, and there will be a dedicated zone where advertisers can provide interactive brand experiences for passengers. &quot;We have been using ethnographic research, a type of research used to observe people in their natural habitats, to measure passengers&apos; different &apos;arousal levels&apos; and how these affect their ability and will to take in different messages,&quot; says France. It does hint of Big Brother but advertisers see air travellers as a very attractive target audience. Terminal 5 will carry all British Airways&apos; flights, and see an estimated 27m BA passengers pass through in year one alone. Heathrow&apos;s fliers are around 90% ABC1, with 45% ABs. As France suggests, &quot;Most media brands would die for that.&quot; The new sites will also help address the controversial environmental issues that Terminal 5 has come up against so much. BAA and JCDecaux Airport claim the terminal &quot;will herald the first large-scale use of new vinyl posters that are completely biodegradeable&quot;, reducing the use of traditional, environmentally-unfriendly paper and paste. So could all this be the future of airport advertising? Are we no longer going to see faded, blandly generic, ill-targeted posters for American Express or BP as we travel through the UK&apos;s main airports? Certainly Terminal 5 seems to be only the start of JCDecaux Airport&apos;s ambitious refurbishment plans. All 1,800 advertising sites across BAA&apos;s airports are to be upgraded, with the introduction of 700 digital locations across the network and further big plans for Heathrow East, the planned merger of Terminals 1 and 2. BAA director of media Duncan Tolson sums up: &quot;Terminal 5 will mark the start of a new generation of airport advertising. It will act as a blueprint for the future and we are looking forward to rolling it out across all BAA airports.&quot;", "tags": ["Advertising", "Media", "Heathrow Airports Authority", "Heathrow airport"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-25T15:18:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/25/16", "sentences": ["The company was &quot;aggressively&quot; hunting for cafe opportunities in eastern Europe with outlets planned for Belgrade, Vienna and Budapest, but is also looking at Shanghai and Bangalore."], "title": "Seminole promise rapid Hard Rock expansion", "article": "The Seminole indian tribe, new owners of the Hard Rock cafe, today promised a rapid expansion of the brand worldwide, including a new hotel in London, but said some outlets in Britain would be closed.

In it he compiled a modern, critical edition of the hundreds of &quot;fragments&quot; - or quotations in other Chinese texts - that testified to the existence of the text of the Shen Tzu, a work of political philosophy completed c275BC that had been lost in direct transmission for more than a thousand years. Paul traced every single fragment of quoted text, determined its authenticity, collating it with other versions of the same piece of text, and finally established a critical edition of the surviving fragments that was authoritative. Even greater than this accomplishment was his creation of a method of scholarship that could be used to establish modern critical editions of all ancient Chinese works, whether still extant or not. The importance of this work has also been recognised in China: when the Shanghai museum recently announced the imminent publication of an unearthed fragment of the Shen Tzu, brush-written on strips of bamboo from the period in which the original work was compiled, they cited Paul&apos;s book as the definitive reference. Paul belonged to four different countries, but China, the land of his birth, was the enduring strand in his life. His parents were Irish missionaries with the China Inland Mission, and he was born at Shunde (Xingtai), in Hebei province, north-eastern China. At the time of the Japanese invasion in 1937, he was attending an English school at Chefoo (present-day Yantai, in Shandong province), and living with his mother, two brothers and sister, while his father was away on missionary work in the interior. At first, the Japanese allowed the school to continue, but after Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the internment of Japanese-Americans in the US, conditions became more severe. They were eventually moved to Weixian internment camp (in Shandong), where they remained until liberated by American paratroopers in 1945. Paul always said they had had enough to eat and, as a child living with his family, he did not feel any particular hardship. When the war ended, his family returned to Northern Ireland, and he completed secondary school in Belfast. His higher education was as unconventional as much of his life. After spells at the Free University of Amsterdam, the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis (where he met and married Marcia Cole in 1952), the US army language school at Monterey, California, a stint as an interpreter in Japan, and a few years teaching in Taiwan, he still had no BA. None the less, the great German sinologist, Hellmut Wilhelm, accepted him at the University of Washington at Seattle in 1959. Awarded a BA the following year, he went on to write his PhD, the earliest version of his Shen Tzu Fragments. After a period of teaching at the University of Wisconsin (1963-70), Paul joined Professors DC Lau and AC Graham at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in London in 1970. Soas soon became the centre of classical Chinese learning in the western world; it was also an extraordinarily convivial place. Lau had a dry, ironic wit that some people found intimidating and Graham was oblivious of social norms, but Paul had a natural social grace that made the most awkward student or visitor feel comfortable. He also had an extraordinary breadth and depth of erudition; one subject of conversation thus led easily into another, and long hours were spent in the student bar and Chinese restaurants, discussing everything under the sun, but often returning to Chinese philosophy and how to understand particular lines of ancient texts. Paul was a true Chinese junzi, a term usually translated as &quot;gentleman&quot;; that is, he was graceful, kind, intellectually curious, good-hearted, a generous and loyal friend, and reluctant to conform to the petty demands of bureaucracy. To a younger colleague, he was a magnificent model, if not quite the mentor approved by institutions. His teaching was also blissfully free of convention. One of his former students, Vivienne Lo, has written: &quot;He had that quality that I imagine of the ideal, old-style English education: concerned for personal enrichment in the broadest sense, inspiring us to apply an intellectual vitality to whatever life would bring rather than training for vocation ... He was barely concerned with examinations, giving us broad hints about what would be on the paper, in favour of engaging us in lively conversation on whatever garden path the particular text we were reading would lead us up.&quot; Paul became interested in the potential of computers for producing editions of ancient Chinese texts early on. Before the problem of easily inputting Chinese characters using an alphabetic keyboard had been solved, he created a system that was, in some ways, more sophisticated than those now in use. These are based primarily on statistical tabulations of frequency, which aid the computer in generating a list of the most likely characters, from which the person typing must choose. Paul&apos;s system would also have incorporated sophisticated grammatical analysis. After his retirement in 1996, he continued living in London and worked on using the potential of computers to produce rigorous editions of excavated and other ancient Chinese texts in a visually transparent manner. He is survived by his wife, Marcia, daughter Aidan and sons Brian and Kevin. \u00b7 Paul Mulligan Thompson, sinologist, born February 10 1931; died June 12 2007", "tags": ["Education"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-27T22:56:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jun/29/business.chicago", "sentences": ["It has the diversity of hotels of Paris or Shanghai but with the logistical simplicity of Brussels or Lisbon."], "title": "Business traveller's diary", "article": "Flights: 6Miles flown: 10,266Destinations: London, Munich, ChicagoNights in a hotel: 10Nights on a dancefloor: 6Satisfaction rating: 4/10, rising to 8.9/10 on arrival in Chicago There comes a moment in every frequent traveller&apos;s year when tiredness, introspection and self-doubt sneak through one&apos;s usually powerful armour.

Unless you&apos;ve been to this seemingly innocuous part of the world, it&apos;s difficult to appreciate the viciousness of Chicago in February. The wind howls, blizzards are commonplace and the temperature is unbearably cold. Ten seconds outside can leave you shivering for a day. The courageous inhabitants cope with a smile but you can tell that, even if they were born in Illinois, they still can&apos;t really deal with the horrors of the winter. But this Jekyll-and-Hyde city comes alive in summertime. Despite the astonishingly narrow-minded immigration officers \u2013 this must be the most awkward place to enter the US \u2013 and a depressingly grey drive into the city, Chicago is as dynamic, vibrant and cool as the US gets when it&apos;s warm. Michigan Avenue becomes a wonderful hub \u2013 the self-styled &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot; \u2013 crammed full of high-end shops and rather beautiful people. Lake Michigan, with its rather splendid man-made beach, is the chill-out hangout of choice. A vast array of delicious, trendy restaurants are filled to capacity. And the city&apos;s dedication to all kinds of music provides everyone \u2013 however burnt out from the year&apos;s rigours \u2013 with the opportunity for uplift and rejuvenation. Chicago&apos;s real &quot;USP&quot; (&quot;unique selling point&quot; if you&apos;re not a business bod) though, especially if you&apos;re visiting for work, is that it&apos;s a wonderful agglomeration of the virtues of many different cities. It has the flourishing variety of business opportunities of Frankfurt and the social vibrancy of Madrid. It has the friendly, genuinely warm people of Mumbai and the efficiency and work-rate of Dusseldorf. It has the diversity of hotels of Paris or Shanghai but with the logistical simplicity of Brussels or Lisbon. And, the clincher for me, it has the all-day-all-night energy of New York and the quiet spots and greenery of London.  It is this variety, the chance to see so many cities in just one city, that revived me and restored my faith in the ridiculous life that we folk lead. My body relaxed by the Lake, my sociability was re-built by some dear friends and my mind re-stimulated by the challenge of new work. Maybe it isn&apos;t such a bad life after all \u2026 Here are my top tips for making the most out of America&apos;s midwestern summer paradise in your work and play time: \u00b7 Put your feet up at the W Lakeshore Hotel. Mirroring the city itself, it&apos;s pretty and damn funky but really works (wireless, good service, etc)\u00b7 Take your clients out for dinner at MK restaurant on North Franklin. Every concierge&apos;s favourite\u00b7 Make some friends at one of Chicago&apos;s many music venues. For those of you who find jazz dull, head to West Ontario. Sound Bar and Crescendo are strong options for a great boogie\u00b7 Put on your flip-flops and head to the Lake Michigan beach. Man-made beaches are generally wholly naff but, surprisingly, this works Enjoy your fortnight.

James Blake is America&apos;s No2 player but he has an English mother and it appeared to be the latter bloodline which sealed his fate as he tumbled out of the tournament at the hands of the determined Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero. Ferrero beat Blake, the Championships&apos; ninth seed, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6, thus suggesting that even being half-English at Wimbledon these days is enough to ensure that you do not make it to the first weekend. In reality, Blake&apos;s failure to beat Ferrero probably had more to do with his deficiencies on grass and his recent poor form than the fact that his grandfather was the village bobby in Banbury. Blake has never got past the third round at SW19 and was unlikely to do so in a season which has seen his tennis and his confidence take an ever more downward turn. Blake&apos;s 2007 may not be nearly as bad as the lows of 2004, when he broke his neck in a freakish collision with a net post during practice, contracted a neurological virus and had to cope with the death of his father, but it has yet to match the comeback he managed to conjure from those grim circumstances. In 2005 he reached the quarter-finals of the US Open and last year he matched that result and went on not just to qualify for the year-end Masters Cup in Shanghai in November but to reach the final there before losing to Roger Federer. He began this year by winning a tournament in Sydney but seems to have lost more and more self-belief with every passing defeat. The fear of falling - at least figuratively - seems to be causing him to do just that. Ferrero won the 2003 French Open and was runner-up at the US Open the same year, results which took him to No1 in the world, but he knows what it feels like to plummet from the heights and yesterday seemed to relish his role as underdog. &quot;He didn&apos;t have the same sort of pressure this time as he did back when he was in the top 10 in the world, No1 in the world,&quot; said Blake, sounding suspiciously like he envied Ferrero. &quot;He&apos;s playing a guy that&apos;s ranked higher than him and he&apos;s on what most people consider his least favorite surface, so he was able to swing freely and he did that.&quot; Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, one of the other seeds to fall yesterday, should have done a bit more unfettered hitting. The Chilean fifth seed has a game of explosive power but his American coach, Larry Stefanki, persuaded him to tame it in favour of a more circumspect approach. However, he got the balance between whimper and bang horribly wrong yesterday and lost 6-3, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 8-6 to Janko Tipsarevic in the third round. Ivan Ljubicic provided some good cheer for Great Britain, albeit by losing 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 in the third round to Paul-Henri Mathieu. Ljubicic is likely to feature when Croatia take on the Murray brothers and Tim Henman for promotion to the Davis Cup World Group and the sight of the World No12 being beaten on grass at Wimbledon, where the tie will be held, should have provided some comfort for the team - even if it took a Frenchman to do it. Blake&apos;s defeat leaves Andy Roddick as the only American man left in the singles. Roddick survived a noticeable wobble to defeat Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 6-4, 7-6, coming from 2-5 down and saving two set-points at 3-5 in the third set. Verdasco, who had twice beaten Roddick before, proved such an obdurate opponent that the American felt moved to shout an exhortation to his coach, Jimmy Connors, afterwards, hailing his own bravery. Roddick aside, American men&apos;s tennis is not perceived over in the US as being in good health but those who complain about having a two-time Wimbledon runner-up still in contention for the title should take a glance at the fortunes of their British cousins.", "tags": ["Sport", "Tennis", "Wimbledon", "Wimbledon 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-29T23:10:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jun/30/tennis.wimbledon5", "sentences": ["The Grand Slam Cup in Shanghai in November features the eight classiest acts in singles and doubles; family life could get interesting if Jamie bags an invite while Andy stays at home."], "title": "Wimbledon 2007: Murray snr at the double for Britain", "article": "Much has fallen on Jamie Murray&apos;s shoulders since the injury that put paid to his brother Andy&apos;s Wimbledon ambitions this year. The weight of family expectation has been added to over the course of the opening week of the All England Championships as home representation has dwindled until, yesterday afternoon, Jamie was the only remaining antidote to the Union Jack blues engulfing SW19. On Court 14, buried in the schedules, those who had paid a mint for their tickets were finally rewarded with a Murray, albeit not the one they craved. Beggars cannot be choosers, though, and the sun-lit evening appearance of Jamie drew the sort of curious audience not normally associated with a second-round men&apos;s doubles match involving two Israelis and a gangly bloke from Minnesota. Happily for the diehards the contest provided one of the highlights of the week. Murray and his American partner Eric Butorac, ranked 14th in the world as a pair, came roaring back from a set down to rattle their previously well-drilled opponents Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram and go on to win 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. As Murray&apos;s specialist doubles coach, Louis Cayer, used to be associated with the seventh-seeded Israeli pair and is now being hired by the Lawn Tennis Association at considerable expense it was a timely effort. At this rate Murray&apos;s profile will continue to rise. Brother Andy&apos;s wrist injury has left a void which Jamie is doing his best to fill and the male fan in the Union Jack headband clutching a pint of bitter was not the only one keen to check him out yesterday. Official statistics suggest that 57% of Wimbledon spectators are female. On days like yesterday it is hard to believe the real figure is not much higher. To Murray&apos;s credit he did not look unduly unconcerned that most of the crowd were playing the fame game by association. He is a practised tramline operator these days and has been clever enough to recognise that success in doubles is the perfect way to dodge potentially awkward filial comparisons. For two weeks of the year, however, there is no escape. Nor is there anyone more painfully acquainted than Jamie with the horrors of the British system which nearly resulted in him choosing an alternative career. The older - and more laid-back - of Judy Murray&apos;s two tennis-playing sons was famously packed off from the family home in Dunblane at the age of 12 to live and play under the LTA&apos;s supervision in Cambridge. During his ill-fated eight-month stay, he says, his forehand was wrecked by ill-advised coaches who strained his love of the game to breaking point. Who knows how grim the outlook would now be for British tennis had his mother not stamped her foot, resolved to sidestep the system and send her younger son to an academy in Barcelona instead? The latter also credits Jamie as one of the major reasons for his spectacular rise. &quot;He was cleverer than me, better at tennis, a better runner . . . he did most things better than me,&quot; he muttered recently. The balance of power has shifted somewhat lately but days like this offer partial redress. There is every chance, in fact, that Jamie will be entertaining the masses for at least as long as his brother. In company with the 26-year-old Butorac he has won three ATP titles this year and the pair are significantly younger than most of their peers. Murray senior will also be a key component of Britain&apos;s Davis Cup team against Croatia here at Wimbledon in September. His improvement over the last six months under the tutelage of Cayer has been significant and it may yet be that he, not Andy, is the first member of the family to claim a grand slam title. The Grand Slam Cup in Shanghai in November features the eight classiest acts in singles and doubles; family life could get interesting if Jamie bags an invite while Andy stays at home. It would be a mistake, even so, to get too carried away. There are those who disagree with the LTA&apos;s investment in doubles, suggesting that such funding should be diverted elsewhere. The Murray family predictably disagree and last night it was hard to dispute their logic.", "tags": ["Sport", "Tennis", "Wimbledon", "Wimbledon 2007", "Jamie Murray"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-29T23:10:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/30/comment.china", "sentences": ["Hong Kong today is as buoyant and confident as ever, comfortable in the knowledge that China&apos;s growth is sufficient to help sustain both itself and Shanghai, and aware too that the rule of law gives it priceless advantages."], "title": "Chris Patten: Hong Kong will not sleep", "article": "Several years ago, Samuel Finer, a distinguished professor of politics at Oxford, wrote a three-volume history of government. He set out to describe every form that has ever been. There was one short chapter on societies that were liberal but not democratic. The only example he could think of was Hong Kong. When I left Hong Kong 10 years ago, we were in the throes of introducing democracy. We were late in doing so. But what we set out to do was to give the citizens what they had been promised in the agreement on the city&apos;s handover to China, known as the Joint Declaration. It was also a development specifically allowed for in the Basic Law, Beijing&apos;s constitution for Hong Kong. Alas, this has not happened. Democratic development has been blocked by Beijing. It has also intervened twice in the judicial process in Hong Kong. But otherwise it is fair to say that Deng Xiaoping&apos;s principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; has been upheld. Hong Kong remains an open society living under the rule of law - within China. Fareed Zakaria, author of The Future of Freedom, warned a few years ago about the dangers of illiberal democracy - the way in which democracy could turn into authoritarianism. To hold governments to account, while safeguarding pluralism, you need more than an occasional election. You need independent courts, due process, freedom of speech, religion and association, an honest civil service and good policing. Hong Kong has all those. All that it lacks is the ability to choose its own government. That will ultimately come as the number of citizens demanding it continues to increase. They know the relationship between civil liberties and quality of life. They have the confidence to assert their citizenship in a way that is both forceful and moderate. This sense of citizenship is one of the things that has most clearly flourished in recent years. It has not been at the expense of Hong Kong&apos;s entrepreneurial energy. In 1997, at the time of the handover, Hong Kong, with 6.5 million inhabitants, accounted for 22% of China&apos;s gross domestic product. For five successive years, the departing colonial government had been able to cut taxes, increase spending, put more money into the reserves and build the new airport out of income. All that was the result of 35 years of continuous growth. That figure of 22% has fallen in the last 10 years, but it is because of economic growth in China, not failure in Hong Kong. Perhaps the best mark of its success is the way it has recovered from Sars and the Asian financial crash. Hong Kong today is as buoyant and confident as ever, comfortable in the knowledge that China&apos;s growth is sufficient to help sustain both itself and Shanghai, and aware too that the rule of law gives it priceless advantages. Many Chinese firms come to Hong Kong to sign contracts precisely because of the rule of law there. The quality of its outstanding civil service has been on public display in the last couple of years. The Doha trade discussions, held in Hong Kong, were superbly chaired and managed, and public order maintained with tact and skill by the police. The former public health chief, Margaret Chan, has recently become head of the World Health Organisation, a job she will do superbly. The professions have also lived up to their responsibilities, especially lawyers. The chief justice, Andrew Li, has been an exemplary leader of the independent judiciary, and barristers have been prominent in defending civil liberties and fighting for democracy. So where does Hong Kong go from here? That it will have a mature democracy sooner rather than later is beyond doubt. Beijing has to realise it is a moderate community and that the only thing likely to stoke up immoderation is the denial of democratic aspirations. As China experiments with greater accountability, a good place for it to release the brakes safely would be Hong Kong. No one who has spent any time in Hong Kong forgets it. It is one of the great exciting maritime cities: beautiful, cluttered, rumbustious. It brings together much of the best of China and of the west. The only downside is pollution, much of it blown in from the industrialisation of the Pearl River delta. That problem has to be tackled more vigorously, otherwise it will drive investors and jobs away. Overall, Hong Kong remains a very special place 10 years after its return to Chinese sovereignty. It used to be said that no one ever made any money out of betting against Hong Kong. That remains true today, and it will still be the case in 2017. It is not yet a democracy but it is a lot more free and open than some Asian cities that are allegedly ruled by the ballot box. \u00b7 \u00a9 Global Viewpoint, distributed by Tribune Media Services \u00b7 Lord Patten is the chancellor of Oxford University and was the last British governor of Hong Kong", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-29T23:11:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/01/features.sportmonthly", "sentences": ["We had grands prix in Malaysia, Shanghai, Turkey and Bahrain, in addition to Japan."], "title": "Eastern bias sends F1 in wrong direction", "article": "Around a decade ago, Bernie Ecclestone, the guy who runs Formula One, began to make ominous noises about the prospects for F1 in Europe, suggesting that the sport&apos;s future instead lay in the East. Now Bernie is no mug - you don&apos;t become as rich as he is without being very smart. Not least, he is perceptive at spotting new trends. He recognised the potential of TV broadcasting and its associated rights before virtually anyone else in Europe. And he was right about the growing importance of East Asia (though hardly the first to notice it). But Bernie always has an agenda, his own, and it is almost invariably about money, his own. When he suggested that F1 should move east, it was because he could see rich pickings. You may remember that when he gave a \u00a31m donation to the Labour Party in 1997, a government decision about a ban on tobacco advertising in sport happened to be imminent - and F1 was later exempted from it. Pure accident of timing, of course. Soon F1 was moving east. We had grands prix in Malaysia, Shanghai, Turkey and Bahrain, in addition to Japan. In the near future we are likely to have Singapore and New Delhi. To judge by the sparsely populated grandstands at many of these races, the incentive is certainly not the attendance figures. But in return for the privilege of holding a grand prix, these countries have paid exorbitant annual fees to Bernie&apos;s management company, as well as spending a fortune on building state-of-the-art facilities. There is no way that these operations are commercially viable. All the new circuits depend on a huge and continuing state subsidy. Governments have calculated that the global attention a grand prix attracts makes the outlay worthwhile. Bernie would love to persuade - or bully - European governments to do the same. He has been biting at the heels of Spa, in Belgium, and Imola, the Italian venue for the San Marino Grand Prix, and the latter appears to have disappeared off the calendar. As we head for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone next weekend, Bernie will no doubt remind us yet again of the desperate condition of the facilities and the need for a huge injection of cash. In May, he suggested for the first time that the British government should pay for improvements, mindful that it is difficult to imagine any private investor ever securing a commercial return. The underlying idea is this: the government should subsidise Bernie&apos;s company. Given his wealth and the riches that abound in F1, this solution should be resisted. If Bernie thinks - rightly - that Britain is the spiritual home of motorsport, alongside Italy, then this is something his company should take into account. Perhaps he should promote it - and also subsidise its future. To his credit, Ken Livingstone, attracted though he was to the idea of staging a British Grand Prix in London, drew back when he realised how much of London&apos;s money would need to be spent on Bernie&apos;s fees and making the capital race-ready. The Great Eastern Experiment seems to have encountered serious problems. The Singapore Grand Prix is scheduled to be held at night, a possibility being canvassed for the Malaysian and Australian races. One assumes that the reason is that the TV audiences in Europe in the middle of the night or early morning are too small to justify the fees being charged to broadcasters. Bernie may have dreamt that the future lay in the East, but the support-base remains firmly located in the home of the sport, Europe. It may be an exaggeration that the future of F1 will consist of well attended races in Europe, and fans there watching barely attended night races in the East on TV, but there could be more than a germ of truth in it. Not that it will worry Bernie, as long as the money keeps rolling in. After all, grand prix races are now almost devoid of overtaking and have, as a consequence, become boring, but while they continue to make loadsamoney for Bernie and Co, no one seems to mind. Is Silverstone&apos;s future safe? I think so. When Michael Schumacher was in his pomp, Germany was given two grands prix. Spain will have two races in future, such is the support for Fernando Alonso there. It is inconceivable that, with Lewis Hamilton now established as a new national hero, Britain will be deprived of its one grand prix a year. After all, it wouldn&apos;t make commercial sense. Second thoughts I was recently in a radio discussion about Lewis Hamilton when Luther Blissett, the black former Watford and England footballer, touchingly said that the younger man was his role model. Just what is it about Hamilton that appeals to so many? He is obviously a great driver, intelligent, articulate, presentable, enjoys a close and supportive relationship with his father, and is in a sport - Formula One - that has never before had a black driver, let alone a black superstar. In other words, he defies all the stereotypes held by white people about black men. Perhaps that is why so many people find him so intriguing and attractive.", "tags": ["Sport", "Formula one 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-30T23:06:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/01/fiction.society", "sentences": ["But on arrival in Nanjing, a city west of Shanghai famous for its plum blossom, they find that there are always opportunities for those willing to work hard."], "title": "Women on a new long march", "article": "Miss Chopsticks Xinran  Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a316.99, pp240  Beijing-born author and radio presenter Xinran has cornered the market in short cuts into understanding modern Chinese culture. Now based in London and married to literary agent Toby Eady, she returns regularly to China to collect stories about a social landscape which is changing so rapidly it&apos;s almost impossible even for an insider to keep up. Miss Chopsticks, a collection of true-life stories re-dressed as a novel, is a fascinating snapshot of the contemporary tension between rural and urban China. It follows the fates of three sisters, Three, Five and Six from the eastern province of Anhui. Their father is so disappointed at his inability to bear sons that he never names his daughters. Like many Chinese girls from the country, they are known only by their birth order. Collectively, he calls them &apos;chopsticks&apos;. They are disposable and snap easily, not strong, sturdy and capable of contributing to a family in the way a &apos;roofbeam&apos; (a male heir) would have been. But it is 2001, times are changing and Three, Five and Six, in their late teens and early twenties, are sent to the city with their uncle to earn some money. Their father doesn&apos;t necessarily believe that anything will come of this attempt: after all, Six is the only daughter who can read. But on arrival in Nanjing, a city west of Shanghai famous for its plum blossom, they find that there are always opportunities for those willing to work hard. Everyone from the country looking for work in Nanjing congregates around a willow tree near the bus station from early morning. Employers network furiously, firing questions. Three gets an unexpected chance to showcase her sole talent: arranging food on a plate. She gains a privileged position in a Chinese fast- food restaurant, a rival to the KFC next door. Five is obviously a worker bee: the owner of a health spa snaps her up as an assistant. Six meets an entrepreneur who asks her what she would like to do most in life: to work in a library, she replies. She gets a job in his Borders-style tea-room. Their wide-eyed fascination with the ways of the city is touching and often so extreme that it is almost unbelievable. None of them has ever travelled in a car before or seen a computer. They are steeped in country myths and fears: Five is horrified at the pornographic clothes city girls wear and is suspicious of those who wash too regularly (i.e. more than every few days). None of the sisters has any idea how to behave in the presence of men. In the city, attitudes are Western: men and women mingle freely. In the country, it is wrong to be seen out walking with a man who is not from your family. The girls are desperate not to &apos;lose face&apos; (the worst sin in China) but confused as to how to fit in with city ways. Xinran has been clever enough to base this fiction on women she has met over the past 10 years in Nanjing (&apos;the place I love best in China,&apos; she writes in the introduction). If a Western writer reported that no one in rural China had ever seen a car nor heard of &apos;yi-meier&apos; (email), you would be tempted to think they were exaggerating. Xinran&apos;s skill lies in investigating the universal human thoughts and emotions behind the girls&apos; naivety. The three characters are based on women who have been called &apos;chopsticks&apos; in real life: sent away by their families to try and make something of themselves. Xinran explains at length in the introduction and the afterword how she encountered these women and then attempted to keep in touch with them over several years to see what became of them. The novel ends promisingly, with the three sisters enjoying life in the city and showering money on their family on their occasional visits home to their village. Their father finally admits that they are almost as good as &apos;roofbeams&apos;. In real life, though, Xinran adds, the fairytale ending is not quite as perfect. The girl who inspired Five probably did well. Xinran last heard that she had been sent away by the spa company to study (strange, Xinran admits, as she could not read or write, but possibly promising). The model for Six, the intelligent girl from the teahouse, had started learning English and dreamt of going to university. The real-life Three, however, ends up back in her village, married off by her family to a disabled man, and soon the mother of two girls, terrified that she, too, would have the curse of no sons. So the book ends on a mixed note. There is optimism for the future. But there is also a fear some people will always regard chopsticks as having only one use. \u00b7  To order Miss Chopsticks for \u00a315.99 with free UK p&amp;p, go to observer.co.uk/bookshop or call 0870 836 0885", "tags": ["Books", "Fiction", "Culture", "Society", "Xinran"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-30T23:06:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/comment.music", "sentences": ["Satellite links will bring you music from Shanghai, Sydney, Johannesburg, London, Hamburg, Rio and Tokyo and everywhere we will see the misty-eyed warmth of the human spirit briefly &apos;engaged&apos; with the problems of rising sea levels, desertification, melting glaciers and the pH levels of the oceans."], "title": "Henry Porter: Rock to save planet, then change your lightbulbs", "article": "Next Saturday, more than 150 music acts will come together on the propitious date of 7/7/07 to take part in Live Earth: the Concert for a Climate in Crisis, which will occur over 24 hours on every continent and will reach about a third of the July estimate for world population of 6,602,224,175 people.

Satellite links will bring you music from Shanghai, Sydney, Johannesburg, London, Hamburg, Rio and Tokyo and everywhere we will see the misty-eyed warmth of the human spirit briefly &apos;engaged&apos; with the problems of rising sea levels, desertification, melting glaciers and the pH levels of the oceans. We will have the sense of creating a unified front just as we did during Live Aid and less universally during Live8. There is no part of me that resents the enjoyment that will be had, but let&apos;s not mistake it for political action and hard-headed political thinking. It is simple-minded to think that Madonna, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers or the Beastie Boys will achieve anything other than a slight rise in the carbon emission of those travelling to events or switching on their TVs to watch them. Certainly, lives were saved by Live Aid and its anthem &apos;Do They Know It&apos;s Christmas?&apos;. Bob Geldof and Bono have done a great deal to prod the West&apos;s conscience but what more was accomplished by the people who formed daisychains in druidical white prior to the Gleneagles summit and the Live8 concert in July 2005? The answers is probably not a lot. To Geldof&apos;s despair, debt relief and aid have fallen short of promises made two years ago. There&apos;s just so much that music and stadium politics can do. That&apos;s not to say that mass movements don&apos;t work, but how will people&apos;s consciences be affected by lectures from rock stars who use private jets? How many of those at Wembley have plans to escape our appalling summer by travelling on easyJet to the record temperatures being experienced in southern Europe? Whatever your views on manmade global warming, we must keep this clear: swaying with Sting will do nothing for rising sea levels. My absolute conviction about climate change dates from 3 February 2005 and the International Symposium on Stabilisation of Greenhouse Gases at the Met office in Exeter, when, in the final session, scientists got up to express surprise and horror at how quickly things appeared to be unfolding in their colleagues&apos; research. Global warming does not mean long, hot summers, but aberrant weather that defies previous patterns and long-range prediction. The evidence of abrupt changes seems to become more obvious every month. But this is going to take decades of concentration and the sort of co-operation between competing states that the world has never seen before. The people cannot wait for government. There is a requirement for each of us to change our habits in driving and flying and in energy consumption at home. This is where politics becomes personal, a question of self-control and, I suppose, morality. It is all rather pedestrian and dull, but what needs to happen next Saturday for Live Earth to mean anything at all is a bit of chat about practical measures. If Madonna sells 100,000 energy-efficient light bulbs and Sting endorses bicycles rather than Jaguar cars, all well and good. My passion for personal action stems from a deep gloom about the way government will tackle the problem if we fail to adapt voluntarily. Legislation will fall thick and fast, if I know Labour, and in nature, it will be bossy and intrusive. In many areas, climate change represents an opportunity for the people to lead government, but that is not the spirit of the times we live in. We are content to hand over to the government decisions of personal choice (see the smoking ban which starts in England today) because we have come to accept that each of us is somehow incapacitated and that the government knows best. If the government had pursued national carbon emission targets with the Jesuitical fervour of its plans to stamp out smoking in public places, we&apos;d be in a lot better shape. But as things stand, Britain will exceed the European targets for the years between 2008 and 2012 by about 25 million tons per annum. The point is that it is easier to police the individual than big business. The other reason for doubting the politics of Live Earth comes from James Panton, an Oxford don and a founder of the Manifesto Club, a new group of young libertarians dedicated to debate. Writing in the Chatham House journal about Live Earth, he says of the marriage between conventional politics and rock events: &apos;As the realm of serious political debate contracts, pop concerts become a model for how politicians communicate with the public. Attending a charity event, or even worse, watching it on television, becomes a way in which the citizenry is encouraged to become more politically engaged.&quot; Panton is a climate-change sceptic and objects to my miserablist views about not taking Ryanair. However, he makes a good point about the exchange that takes place at one of these big rock events. The people are reassured when politicians express what is an easy and glib solidarity, while the politicians gain credibility from an audience that they are otherwise unlikely to reach. The two interests coalesce around a simple moral message and everyone goes away happy. But there is nothing to keep either party up to the mark: no debate on the fundamentals, no scrutiny of outcomes. This is not politics in any real sense, but a rally of good intentions. Still, one must not be too harsh. Good intentions are better than nothing. They are better than apathy and ignorance. They are better than a refusal to accept the blindingly obvious which, after all, was President Bush&apos;s position until Al Gore set about getting his message across. Gore used his documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, to persuade first America, then the world, about the seriousness of the problem. He is one of the few politicians who has managed to step outside conventional politics and make a case which appealed directly to the public. And because of this, he has earned a rare legitimacy, which I certainly hope is transformed into the Democrat nomination next year. As the extraordinary events in East Germany 18 years ago showed, a mass movement with an unerring sense of purpose can do great things. Few now appreciate that as well as demonstrating against repression, a huge number of people on the streets of Leipzig, Dresden and Berlin in 1989 marched against the destruction of the environment by the communists. It requires more than listening to rock music to change the world, yet Live Earth is no bad thing and, in one way, it can be seen as huge affirmation of democratic civilisation, a sign that we accept responsibility for the planet&apos;s health. The trouble is that it takes more than listening to music on a Saturday afternoon. This problem needs personal action, commitment and deep understanding. henry.porter@observer.co.uk", "tags": ["Music", "Environment", "Climate change", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-30T23:12:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jul/01/escape.green6", "sentences": ["In the morning I caught the ferry from Osaka back to Shanghai."], "title": "The slow traveller", "article": "On my last morning in Tokyo I was determined to visit the world&apos;s biggest fish market, where 1,500 stalls flog the fruits of the world&apos;s oceans. Unfortunately in order to catch the tuna auction that is the highlight of the show you need to be there by 6am. I prepared for this exciting experience by staying up practically all night drinking heavily. This was perhaps ill advised. My friend Joe, who had insisted an hour and a half earlier that he was &apos;still up for it&apos;, failed to rouse at 5am when the alarm rudely rang. Bleary-eyed, I navigated the Tokyo metro alone, silently praising the fantastic efficiency and accessibility of the Japanese system. I emerged blinking into commercial bedlam. A seething sea of trucks, wagons, handcarts and weird motorised trolleys surged in and out of the vast warehouse complex. In the depths of the market a large building contained serried ranks of frozen tuna carcasses, lying in neat rows like icy torpedoes. A big fat auctioneer perched on a stool was calling the prices, his voice ululating, his arms flapping and his belly wobbling in synchrony as the value of each lot rose. Around him stood a gaggle of poker-faced bidders eyeing up the sashimi-to-be. Once sold, the frosty fish were dragged off for dismemberment and distribution by market workers armed with hooked metal spikes. I staggered through this chaos trying not to get in the way, slip on the wet floor, or get run over by a trolley or impaled on a tool of some description. In the end I took the safest option and stood with my back to the wall. Stallholders armed with huge samurai-type swords were performing the dissection task, artistically slicing away at the soft pink tuna flesh in almost loving fashion. One vendor was proudly displaying his rare wares, fat chunks of bloody, ragged-looking steak. Whale meat. Just what your average environmentalist wants to see before breakfast. By the time I left two hours later, I had seen a bewildering array of cold wet flesh and was distinctly sober. As a hangover cure it was extreme but effective.  That afternoon another super-sexy Shinkansen Bullet train whisked me to Kyoto, where the famous climate change protocol was agreed. I sought out a Spartan night of zen simplicity, staying in a traditional Japanese ryokan guesthouse. It looked like the previous occupant had stolen all the bedroom furniture from my austere tatami room. It was empty but for a low table and two small cushions. I sat and ate my kaiseki meal, which turned food presentation into an art form of intricately prepared and arranged delicacies. I was unsure whether to photograph it or eat it. So I did both. After dinner the maid produced my futon from the hidden wardrobe with an illusionist&apos;s flourish. I then lay on the floor drawing up mental plans to destroy all my obviously superfluous furniture at home.  In the morning I caught the ferry from Osaka back to Shanghai. On board I met James, a Californian who&apos;d been teaching English in Thailand. Deeply religious, he was sceptical about organised churches. &apos;I guess I&apos;m still searching,&apos; he said.  Being agnostic I engaged him in a lengthy philosophical debate on God, biblical prophecy and how likely it was that I would end up in the &apos;Lake of Fire&apos; for all eternity. Quite likely, according to James, who added: &apos;Don&apos;t get me wrong, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re rotten to the core.&apos; Gee thanks.

A special performance at the British Antarctic Survey Station in Antarctica will ensure all seven continents are included. There will be saturation coverage from TV, radio, the internet and at more than 6,000 parties in 119 countries. Critics have argued the 24-hour spectacular - featuring more than 150 acts including Madonna, Lily Allen, Genesis, Bon Jovi, Kanye West, Kelly Clarkson, Black Eyed Peas and Jack Johnson - will do more for the stars&apos; careers than raising awareness of climate change. But Gore will use it to urge people to sign a seven-point pledge calling on governments to agree, within two years, an international treaty that cuts global warming pollution by 90 per cent in developed countries and by more than half worldwide. It also asks people to cut their own pollution, make their homes, businesses, schools and transport more energy efficient, and plant new trees and preserve forests. With its rapid economic growth and soaring carbon emissions, China is regarded as a crucial target for this message. Kevin Wall, the executive producer of Live Earth, has succeeded where he did not two years ago as a co-organiser of Live8, the centrepiece of the Make Poverty History campaign. &apos;We&apos;re on Chinese TV with 800 million people, &apos; he told The Observer. &apos;People often think on a parochial basis, so it&apos;s vital to be there. We&apos;ve got to talk and make the whole world listen.&apos; Live Earth China, on the steps of the Oriental Pearl Tower in Shanghai, will feature popular national singers as well as Britain&apos;s Sarah Brightman, and be broadcast across the country by the Shanghai Media Group. Steve Howard, chief executive of The Climate Group, a London-based campaign organisation supporting Live Earth, said: &apos;The US and China are responsible for half the world&apos;s carbon emissions. Live Earth will get huge attention in both. The biggest issue on the planet ever requires the biggest media event ever.&apos; The seed was planted less than two years ago at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California, when Wall, a veteran concert producer, attended a slide show about global warming presented by Gore, as featured in the Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth &apos;Over the course of the 90 minutes my wife and I were very emotionally moved by the climate crisis,&apos; said Wall, 54, a father of three. &apos;We understood for the first time it was about us, our children and our children&apos;s children. This is not just a movie - it&apos;s happening.&apos; Wall met the former US vice-president and discussed taking the message to as many people as possible: &apos;After Live8 I said never again, but I got the call from Al Gore, the global rock star on this issue. What I can do on the day is deliver 2 billion pairs of eyeballs.&apos; On Saturday Gore will be at the Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City, where the Police, Smashing Pumpkins, Alicia Keys and others will perform. &apos;We don&apos;t want him getting on planes burning carbon,&apos; Wall acknowledged. Profits from Live Earth will go to Gore&apos;s Alliance for Climate Protection. But the entire event has been questioned by Bob Geldof, organiser of Live Aid and Live8. In May he said: &apos;I hope they&apos;re a success. But why is he [Gore] actually organising them? To make us aware of the greenhouse effect? Everybody&apos;s known about that for years. We are all fucking conscious of global warming.&apos; Sceptics have also pointed to the amount of electricity used to power the speakers and lights, and the fuel spent on ferrying musicians and their equipment to the venues by plane and lorry. Wall said: &apos;We are trying to minimise the carbon as much as possible. Most artists are coming from nearby areas. Madonna, for example, lives in London and will be performing at Wembley.&apos; He added: &apos;There are 3,000 concerts a year. We&apos;re doing 10, but touching 2 billion people about what I think is the biggest issue that&apos;s ever faced humanity.&apos; Steve Howard of the environmental charity Climate Group said: &apos;Dealing with climate change doesn&apos;t mean we have got to stop live performances or call for a moratorium on football matches. There are positive choices for people to make. If we get this right, in 10 to 15 years time every product will be a green product. &apos;Live Earth is a big step in the right direction.&apos; Howard added. &apos;Arnold Schwarzenegger put it well when he said in Washington DC: &quot;We need to make the environment cool and sexy.&quot;&apos; Organisers deny that Live Earth will be a one-off that could be soon forgotten.

Or did he simply lie low and teach in a Welsh school for a little extra money? Perhaps, as one school of thought has it, he joined a troupe of travelling players, or even enjoyed a prolonged holiday in Italy. Each of these rival theories has been proposed by historians and academics over the last decade alongside another serious proposition: that Shakespeare spent this time working for the English embassy in Spain. A new Spanish film has developed this solution to the biographical mystery and come up with a plotline that the producers argue is entirely feasible and will also shed fresh light on the playwright&apos;s creative process. William and Miguel, to be released in Britain later this year, stars Will Kemp, the British actor and former classical ballet talent, in the role of Shakespeare. The screenplay tells of the Bard&apos;s imagined encounter with Miguel de Cervantes, Spain&apos;s greatest literary hero and the creator of Don Quixote. Cervantes and Shakespeare were contemporaries and are believed to have died on the same date, 23 April, 1616, although the Spaniard was 16 years Shakespeare&apos;s senior. The film, which has been written and directed by a rising star of Spanish cinema, Ines Paris, suggests that these two extraordinary writers met and influenced each other before Shakespeare finally returned to England and began the most successful phase of his career in London. &apos;We did a lot of research during the screenwriting and there is very strong evidence that Shakespeare was well-versed in Cervantes&apos; work,&apos; said producer Antonio Sauro, who will be in Britain this week to talk about the film. Scholars have frequently noted the nautical references in Shakespeare&apos;s plays and poems and some say they are proof that he made at least one sea voyage. &apos;Going to Spain at that time was like going to New York or perhaps Shanghai now. It was the centre of things, so it would have made a lot of sense,&apos; said Sauro. &apos;Our story is something of a fiction based on facts, but it certainly could have happened.&apos; William and Miguel concentrates on a point in the late 1580s when both men had left their wives, and it brings an entirely invented element of romance to the story in the form of actress Elena Anaya, who plays their shared lover, Leonor. It was her spirited intervention, the screenplay has it, that brought the literary giants together and effectively changed their writing styles. Sauro explains that whatever happened in Spain, whether the two men ever met or not, something clearly did happen to their creativity. Cervantes, played by Juan Luis Galiardo, is shown to be suffering from writer&apos;s block when he meets first Leonor, then Shakespeare. &apos;Cervantes was very sad prior to this period. He was living as a tax collector and yet, after this, he writes his epic work of black humour, Don Quixote,&apos; said Sauro. &apos;For Shakespeare too, this time marks a change,&apos; Sauro believes. &apos;He was writing mainly comedies before this time and then he began to write more of his tragedies.&apos; Competing theories that Shakespeare spent his time working in schools in Lancashire or Wales, or with a troupe of theatrical players, are based largely on a network of textual references. The truth of his missing years may never be known, and perhaps in this case hard proof does not matter. As the tag line of William and Miguel has it, &apos;In art and love everything is possible.&apos; \u00b7 William and Miguel will be discussed at the International Screenwriters&apos; Festival (3-6 July at Cheltenham Film Studios).

A period of calm, with the management left to get on with the difficult job of competing with BSkyB, would seem to be in order. But that first impression is probably wrong. For a start, Virgin Media is nothing like a normal quoted company. Its shareholder register is dominated by US hedge funds and their imitators. Sir Richard Branson&apos;s presence, with 10.5%, hardly adds stability; he must constantly wonder whether Virgin Media, with its cack-handed customer service, is damaging the wider interests of his Virgin brand and Virgin Group. Confusion, naturally, has followed. The idea of bidding for ITV was a case of trying to run before walking. In the scrap with BSkyB over carriage charges for Sky One and Sky News, Virgin Media almost displayed a death wish: there may be a moment to pick that fight, but surely not when you&apos;re paying Uma Thurman millions to advertise a service that was supposed to include those channels. We don&apos;t know yet what strategy Carlyle has in mind, but don&apos;t be surprised if it is something like this: make peace with Sky, forget about ITV for now, concentrate on customer service, and allow the technological benefits of fibre optic cable to go to work over time. The last point is critical: as more content is piped into our homes, cable&apos;s advantage over old-fashioned copper wires ought to be a winner. But customers only notice if other tricks - like service - impress. Carlyle, one assumes, is willing to invest and wait. Maybe other private equity firms are too. An auction is in prospect, and Branson must be elated. He sold Virgin Mobile at a price, and at a time, that looks in retrospect to have been perfect. He received an illiquid currency - the stake in NTL, now Virgin Media - in exchange but now finds buyers at his door despite the company&apos;s plodding performance. Not for the first time, he has played a weak hand brilliantly. He also has the option of re-investing along with Carlyle, or whoever wins. This may be plan A. During the ITV saga, Branson gushed anti-Murdoch rhetoric. He will know that his chance of building a proper rival to Sky improves greatly in alliance with a powerhouse like Carlyle rather than hangers-on from the bad old days of NTL and Telewest. Till the buck stops When newspapers run stories about Brits rushing to New York to spend pounds that buy two dollars, then sterling is probably close to a peak. That&apos;s the old theory, but it hasn&apos;t worked out so easily this time. We glimpsed the $2 pound in April, and spotted Brits in Macy&apos;s, but now sterling is back at two. The continued strength can be explained. Interest rates here are 5.5%, and probably going to 5.75% on Thursday, and our under-supplied housing market looks reasonably robust. In the US, rates are 5.25% and the crisis in the sub-prime market is spreading. Savers in Japan or the Middle East will draw the simple moral that the Bank of England, not the Federal Reserve, is the central bank more free and more willing to fight inflation. So, settle back, $2 could be here for a while. Even talk of $2.10 doesn&apos;t sound ridiculous. But the world has not changed entirely. The British economy has not de-coupled from the US. A strong currency still helps to depress inflation and reduce the need for rate rises. And the greatest temptation in any interest rate cycle is still over-kill. So be patient, but be confident that the moment will arrive eventually - that once-a-decade opportunity to sell sterling with confidence. Strong herb Is traditional Chinese medicine hocus-pocus? More politely, can its efficacy be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the US food and drug administration? We may be about to find out. Hutchison Chi-Med, a London market minnow, yesterday announced positive clinical results for a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease derived from a Chinese herb. Cue lots of optimistic talk about novel medical mechanisms and a new reservoir of drugs. We might dismiss this as hype, except Chi-Med is the attempt by the great Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing to create a major pharmaceutical business in China. State-of-the-art facilities are in place near Shanghai. Li Ka-shing clearly thinks Chinese medicine has a future as an aid to western medicine, and it has rarely paid to bet against him. In fact, the odds to back him are currently excellent. Chi-Med&apos;s market value is just \u00a385m. The worst that could happen is that it goes to zero. The best?

The country&apos;s new wealth ensured that for any sea product for which there exists an appetite in Tokyo - and the Japanese are famously free-spirited in their attitude towards eating things as varied as toxic blowfish, whale bacon and barnacles - a Japanese buyer will pay a premium over all foreign competitors. And so the catch of the day inevitably ended up in Tokyo, and the rest of the world settled for leftovers. Last week, a front-page New York Times story addressed a growing sense of national crisis in Japan over declining availability of wild bluefin tuna, the trophy fish of the sushi bar and perhaps the country&apos;s most prized culinary delicacy. Faced with dwindling supply and rising prices, picky chefs have become forced to deal with lesser-quality big-eye or yellowfin tuna or the stigmatized ranched bluefin. The more farsighted among them, the New York Times reported, were already pondering the scenario of a post-tuna menu, and experimenting with red-meat substitutes including venison, horse, and whale. In reality, this was an obituary for the Japanese seafood premium, and the birth notice for what will shortly be recognized as China&apos;s seafood premium. The perennial Japanese fear about being usurped by their historical rivals to the west has taken a new angle: the Chinese will, quite literally, eat their lunch. The Chinese have not traditionally preferred their fish raw, but sushi bars catering to new luxury tastes have begun popping up in the country&apos;s commercial cities - ultimately pitting the two countries against each other in bidding wars on docks worldwide. &quot;The Chinese are going to pay more than what the Japanese can pay very soon. That means exporters will be looking into the China market, not Japan,&quot; Tom Asakawa, a fisheries-trade official at the US embassy in Tokyo, told me in late 2005. &quot;Five years from now, Japanese consumers will not be able to eat good-quality sashimi. You&apos;ll have to go to China to do that.&quot; It didn&apos;t take five years. Buyers at the early-morning tuna auctions at the Tsukiji market in downtown Tokyo - where each day millions of dollars in fish are swapped in just a few minutes with coded hand signals - are already packing up their purchases and putting them on planes to Shanghai hours later. (In many cases, those fish arrived by plane - from the Atlantic, Mediterranean, or South Pacific - the night before.) But some version of this transaction, diverting the daily catch from Japanese mouths, has been taking place for almost a decade: Atlantic bluefin caught off the New England coast being eaten in Boston or Mediterranean farmed tuna ending up in London. When the Japan&apos;s economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, the corporate expense accounts indirectly subsidizing top sushi bars contracted, at the same time as American and European diners started paying more for their meals. Much as environmentalists like to blame the Japanese government for the overfishing of worldwide bluefin stocks - a sense of sovereign entitlement for tuna led to an ecological recklessness - the country&apos;s consumers bear responsibility, too, for their declining access to top fish. High-quality fresh seafood was one of the few good import businesses into Japan. Diners there could savor either the delicate textures of raw fish or their country&apos;s quick shift from the periphery of the global economy to its center, noted monthly with a growing current account surplus built on a roaring export business in cars and electronics. The trade gap, it turned out, was not a one-way exchange of goods, but a quiet two-way flow of taste and ideas. There&apos;s a reason sushi bars surfaced in Los Angeles in the 1960s, in Amsterdam in the 1970s, in Hong Kong in the 1980s, in Moscow in the 1990s, and in Shanghai today. Demand for sushi has followed integration into the global economy, and in the postwar period those patterns of trade and foreign investment have had a particularly Japanese flavour. Sushi bars followed the Japanese corporate money, and local appetites followed Japanese tastes. Now China&apos;s growing trade surplus means that the world&apos;s dockside premium will likely be set by chefs in Shanghai. If Japanese diners want to avoid a permanent lunch of horse sushi, their best hope might be in a rising China - and that the twenty-first century&apos;s global tastemakers use their new mercantile reach to drive up prices for sea cucumber and pass on the raw tuna.", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-03T16:00:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/04/tennis.wimbledon4", "sentences": ["The event will move from its current home in Shanghai."], "title": "Tennis: Old Oxford pals bring tour final to Greenwich", "article": "The close relationship between the All England Club&apos;s chief executive, Ian Ritchie, and his former university pal Etienne de Villiers, the chairman of the ATP, played a significant part in the decision to bring the men&apos;s tour&apos;s end-of-season showpiece to London. The pair met at Trinity College, Oxford, and will now collaborate on the ATP&apos;s World Tour Final, previously the Masters Cup, which will be staged at the O2 Arena (Millennium Dome) from 2009 to 2012. The event will move from its current home in Shanghai. The arena&apos;s owner, Anschutz Entertainment Group, will co-promote the event with the ATP as it seeks to establish the Dome as a venue, but it is the involvement of the All England Club which is most intriguing.

Speaking from the comfort of the referees&apos; office, Morrissey suggested spectators should take their umbrellas down despite the deluge. &quot;Umbrellas and lightning don&apos;t always mix, so you might want to think about that,&quot; he suggested, to general incredulity. Negative attitude Police officers patrolling the grounds of the All England Club have spent a significant amount of time harassing photographers chronicling the increased security effort. The Met&apos;s officer in charge in SW19, Superintendent Peter Dobson, known as &quot;Dobbo&quot; to his colleagues, has told snappers this week that he approves of them photographing officers at work. But yesterday several were told to stop taking pictures of body searches being carried out. The ridiculous excuse offered by obstructive junior officers was that pictures &quot;might reveal details of our body-searching techniques&quot;. Bud switched off Bud Collins, doyen of the American tennis press corps and a familiar face to millions of television viewers in the US thanks to his 35 years covering Wimbledon for NBC, has been sacked by the American network. Collins, right, who is covering his 40th championships for the Boston Globe, was told shortly after arriving in the UK that his contract would not be renewed in 2008. The decision has caused dismay among Collins&apos; colleagues, not least because finals weekend will take place without the traditional post-match interviews with the winners and losers familiar to viewers in the US. Chilly reception The International Olympic Committee will today decide the venue for the 2014 winter Games amid deep unease that the campaign waged by the bidding cities signals a return to the bad old days. Senior figures in the movement have been deeply unhappy with the conduct of the race between the Russian resort Sochi, Pyeongchang in Korea and Salzburg in Austria. In the past gifts and inducements were offered to members in exchange for support but, since the Salt Lake City scandal, sponsorship has become the sweetener of choice. Samsung, the company chaired by the Korean IOC member Kun-Hee Lee, has signed a new deal with the IOC, the Russian energy giant Gazprom has opened talks with Lausanne, and Salzburg is tainted by a drugs scandal that has seen six Nordic skiers banned for life.

Organizers of the free show on Rio&apos;s Copacabana Beach said they were trying to get the order overturned in order to prevent Latin America from being left out of the event. Promoted by former US Vice President Al Gore, Live Earth concerts are scheduled for London, Tokyo, Johannesburg, Shanghai, Sydney, Hamburg and East Rutherford in the American state of New Jersey. A band of scientists will also perform in Antarctica, in order to bring the festival to seven continents. But South America may now be left out after Brazilian prosecutor Denise Tarin requested a suspension of the concert, saying there were not enough officers to police a crowd that could top 700,000. The shortage of resources has been blamed on a heavy security presence ahead of the Pan American games, due to be held in Rio later this month. The event is seen as a test for Brazil to prove it is capable of hosting major international sporting events. Thousands of officers are cracking down on the drug gangs that dominate many of Rio&apos;s slums. Last week, 1,300 police mounted a military-like invasion of a large shantytown called the Complexo de Alemao and killed 19 suspected criminals. &quot;It&apos;s too risky to hold a show for 700,000 people on the eve of the Pan American games and at a time when police are engaged in frequent battles in the Alemao,&quot; Tarin said in a statement released by her office. Concert organizers confirmed the show was suspended but said they would contest the order and expected to overturn it. Brazil&apos;s court system has many avenues for appeals and decisions are frequently changed within hours or days. &quot;We&apos;re negotiating, and expect to reverse the decision,&quot; said Vanessa Vascouto, a spokeswoman for the Rio event. Should the ruling be overturned, the prosecutor plans to appeal again. Tarin last year imposed restrictions on a free concert by the Rolling Stones on Copacabana Beach that drew one million people. At the time, she told the weekly magazine Veja that Copacabana is not appropriate for huge concerts because the setting makes it difficult for police to craft &quot;the slightest viable security plan&quot;. Rio&apos;s concert was set to include performances by Lenny Kravitz, Macy Gray, Pharrell Williams, MV Bill and Jorge Ben. The event was scheduled to be the only free concert for Live Earth.

The news sent RIM&apos;s shares up by 3.9% to $216.02 in early trading on the hi-tech Nasdaq stock market. In a conference call with analysts, RIM&apos;s joint chief executive Jim Balsillie said initial customers were likely to be staff at foreign multinationals operating in big cities such Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The BlackBerry will cost about \u00a3330. According to Canada&apos;s Globe and Mail newspaper, Ontario-based RIM already has 5,000 advance orders and intends to have BlackBerrys in Chinese shops by the end of August. In a short time, the device has attracted a devoted global following. In the three months to June, RIM&apos;s sales leapt 76% to $1.08bn (\u00a3537m) as the company added 1.2m subscribers, taking the total over the 9m mark. The BlackBerry faces a new threat this month with the launch of Apple&apos;s iPhone which boasts similar convenience and ease of access to the internet. But RIM&apos;s shares have barely been dented by the iPhone, with many commentators suggesting that Apple&apos;s product will largely appeal to gadget-friendly consumers and is unlikely to make rapid inroads into the BlackBerry&apos;s core business market. Analysts at Credit Suisse recently forecast that the number of BlackBerry subscribers will rise to 19m by 2009. RIM has made it clear that it sees huge potential in emerging markets including Latin America, and central and eastern Europe. The Chinese government has been slow to endorse the BlackBerry in part because of security issues. Some reports have suggested that the regime was concerned that the device&apos;s encryption technology would prevent state agents from eavesdropping on suspicious communications. Ontario&apos;s premier, Dalton McGuinty, intervened in November 2005 by showing the device personally to China&apos;s information industry minister, Wang Xudong, during a visit to east Asia. The BlackBerry will face a local rival, China&apos;s second largest mobile phone operator China Unicom markets a mobile email device cheekily called the RedBerry. RIM signed a deal with China&apos;s largest operator China Mobile, in which Vodafone has a small stake, three years ago and has since been waiting for government approval before it could launch.

Finding a way to include China and the US in a new agreement on global warming to replace the Kyoto protocol is one of the key international challenges inherited by Gordon Brown as prime minister. President George Bush pulled the US out of the Kyoto process, partly because it placed no requirements on China. Dr Lu said it was unfair to make comparisons between US and Chinese emissions, because China&apos;s population was much larger and the country relied on cheap energy to lift people from poverty. &quot;If you only visit Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, you see one China. But if you go to the countryside or just two hours&apos; drive from Tiananmen Square you see a totally different situation.&quot; He added: &quot;No matter what kind of commitment we are going to make to the international community, we believe climate change is a serious issue.

Now it&apos;s James Blunt&apos;s turn. But if scepticism, even cynicism, is a natural response whenever pop stars promise to change the world, there&apos;s no denying the sheer scale and intensity of Live Earth, their latest attempt. The 24-hour, seven-continent sequence of concerts, will already have begun in Sydney by the time you read this - and the organisers, spearheaded by Al Gore, hope it will reach 2 billion people via 120 television networks, internet and radio, making it the biggest media event in history. At Wembley later today, 80,000 people are expected to watch Madonna, Genesis, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snow Patrol, the Beastie Boys, Duran Duran, and Blunt, although last night rumours of an appearance by Paul McCartney remained just rumours. All this is hardly without its moral complexities. The Red Hot Chili Peppers will be flying in by private jet from Paris, the band&apos;s management confirmed, then leaving by private jet tonight for a gig in Denmark. The Beastie Boys must be in Montreux by tomorrow. Genesis are playing in Manchester tonight, as part of their Turn It On Again reunion tour. And an estimate calculated for the Guardian suggests that spectators travelling to the London and New Jersey concerts alone will generate approximately 5,600 tonnes of greenhouse gases between them - the equivalent of 7,270 people crossing the Atlantic by plane. You can, it seems, be part of the solution and part of the problem, at the same time. Even those watching online will find Live Earth&apos;s website is sponsored by the Chevrolet company, which manufactures SUVs. These caveats will count for little if the event achieves its twin goals: pressuring politicians to sign an international treaty pledging massively reduced emissions within two years and persuading individuals to make lifestyle changes, such as installing four energy-efficient light bulbs, or taking public transport to work once a week. &quot;The important thing was not to have no carbon footprint and no acts, but to have really great acts,&quot; insisted Steve Howard, a climate-change consultant who runs We&apos;re In This Together, a UK campaign linked to Live Earth. It was launched earlier this year and has already saved 36,000 tonnes of CO2, Mr Howard said. &quot;Does that save the planet? No, not in itself. But it&apos;s equivalent to 13,000 family cars being taken off the road.&quot; At the heart of the challenge facing Mr Gore and his organisation, Save Our Selves, is the nebulous concept of &quot;awareness&quot;. The worst-case scenario is that raising awareness about climate-change may not lead to action - and might even instil a sense of fatalism. It doesn&apos;t help that touring stars are among the worst individual greenhouse-gas offenders. Last year, Madonna&apos;s Confessions tour produced 440 tonnes of carbon dioxide in four months, said John Buckley, of the website Carbonfootprint.com, who also provided the estimates for Live Earth concertgoers. The rock group Arctic Monkeys said this week they had declined to take part in Live Earth, because it would be &quot;a bit hypocritical&quot;. &quot;Especially when we&apos;re using enough power for 10 houses just for [stage] lighting,&quot; said drummer Matt Helders. He added: &quot;There&apos;s more important people who can have an opinion. Why does it make us have an opinion because we&apos;re in a band?&quot; Risking charges of inconsistency, Bob Geldof, instigator of Live Aid and Live8, said in May that raising awareness was pointless. &quot;Everybody&apos;s known about that for years,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re all fucking conscious of global warming.&quot; Acutely aware of the need to minimise the event&apos;s own footprint, Live Earth organisers have promised to power all shows with renewable energy, and to offset flights taken by the 150 acts performing in London, New Jersey, Shanghai, Johannesburg, Tokyo, Hamburg, Sydney, and - after a last-minute threat of cancellation - Rio de Janeiro. (Scientists at a base in Antarctica will also perform by satellite, so the event covers all continents.) And Gayle Fine, a New York-based spokeswoman for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, said the band offsets all tour travel, while ground crews use biodiesel fuel where possible. Offsetting is controversial among some environmentalists, who argue it simply eliminates guilt. But Madonna, organisers noted, lives in London, and generally, bands had been assigned to perform in cities where they lived, or in the continents where they were touring. Nowhere are climate issues more pressing than China. But far from reaching the masses, fewer than 3,000 people were expected in Shanghai. Most have been invited by sponsors, and the event, headlined by Sarah Brightman, will be broadcast live by only one Shanghai channel. The concert will not raise money because the cost of erecting an outdoor stage will far exceed revenues. Even so, organisers hope to set an example: the start has been moved an hour earlier, so the audience will be able to catch public transport, and there will be recycling facilities. Shanghai seems to have been chosen in the belief that the climate-change message will make more of a mark on this cosmopolitan, educated city than elsewhere. But, said Michelle Zhang, an invitee, &quot;I don&apos;t think this Shanghai concert is so exciting, because they only have Sarah Brightman as an international star. At first we had very high expectations, We thought big stars like Jay-Z might be coming. I don&apos;t think young people like Sarah Brightman.&quot; Local media panned the event, saying the line-up would embarrass the nation, but Cindy Wang, the event&apos;s deputy general manager, said that missed the point. &quot;This is the biggest charity concert ever staged in China,&quot; she said. &quot;But it is not just a concert. It is a warning ... we want to warn Chinese, not expats. That is why we&apos;re not seeking foreign stars.&quot; There is another possible interpretation of today&apos;s global events - aside from the hope that they will make all the difference in the world. This is the possibility that it is all a prelude to the announcement of a presidential bid by Mr Gore, an idea he has been denying with less force recently. You might see that interpretation as the worst kind of cynicism. Then again, Live Earth&apos;s message is that we each should do whatever we can for the climate.

The problem is that, as Ma Jun, China&apos;s top environmental campaigner tells The Observer today, there are no independent courts, no free media and no system of political accountability, and China&apos;s companies have no sense of corporate responsibility. Unless the communist political system changes, the Chinese people, like the rest of us, can expect its economy to remain filthy.

Shanghai is one of the biggest engines of the speeding Chinese economic juggernaut. But it&apos;s clear in Shanghai that much of the burgeoning commercial success of the new China is based on counterfeit goods. Plus a mind-numbing array of what might be uncharitably described as &apos;plastic crap&apos;. We walked past the historic colonial architecture of the riverside Bund, opposite the futuristic, whimsical buildings of Pudong, all brash, surreal, space-age globes, probes and spires. All the while street vendors proffered us entirely useless products: irritating &apos;stones&apos; emitting screeching noises when thrown into the air; glowing red devil horns; stuffed mice on strings that scampered convincingly when tugged. We then suffered the indignity of being practically thrown out of a chemist&apos;s shop. Our heinous crime was laughing at and then jotting down in a notebook the different condom brands. I was particularly taken by the Romantic Love Rubbers, the Wonderlife, &apos;for happy hours by two&apos;, and the just plain scary-sounding Nanometer-Silver Cryptomorphic Condom. Clear favourite though was Jissbon, and then we were out on our ears. We caught the sleeper train to Xiamen, supposedly the cleanest city in China, and it didn&apos;t disappoint. It had breathable air, violent blue skies and more than an occasional glimpse of the sun. The journey didn&apos;t mean we&apos;d escaped the entrepreneurial culture of Shanghai, however. Even the train guards were in on the act. One appeared with a basket of &apos;indestructo-socks&apos; and a highly polished sales pitch. With a real &apos;I&apos;m robbing myself here, guvnor&apos; tone he gave a lively practical demonstration of the socks&apos; rugged resilience. He raked the hideous, shiny synthetic material with a wire brush, ran a lighter flame over it then held the ends of one sock and swung his whole bodyweight on it from the luggage rack above. The socks just screamed &apos;sweaty foot hell&apos; even if they would last forever, which they probably will - only to be unearthed by future archaeologists who&apos;ll marvel at the durability of early 21st-century Chinese sock technology.  Xiamen is famous for its live seafood, making a trip to a restaurant a grisly experience. You wield awesome power as you make arbitrary decisions on which beasts to devour. The waitress then goes into action with her net, the chef does his bit with the wok and it&apos;s bubbling aquarium to plate in literally seconds. Seafood doesn&apos;t come much fresher than this.  Adjacent to Xiamen sits the small island of Gulangyu. A former treaty port hang-out for foreign concessionaries, it&apos;s a gorgeous mix of grand, elegantly dilapidated Mediterranean-style villas and lush vegetation. Known as &apos;Piano Island&apos; it apparently has more keyboards per capita than anywhere else in the world.  As we disembarked the ferry we heard the gentle tinkling of distant ivories. It was a magical moment as we sucked in the sweet air, admired the beautiful buildings and listened to the mellifluous tones of the music. At least it was until we turned the next corner, heard the same tune being played and spotted the speakers secreted in the flower beds. A nearby sign on the harbour wall warned us that there was to be &apos;No tossing&apos;, of what exactly remained unclear. We left Gulangyu and China mulling this conundrum with piped piano muzak ringing in our ears. www.lowcarbontravel.com", "tags": ["Travel", "Shanghai holidays", "China holidays", "Green travel"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-07T23:15:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jul/08/china.pollution", "sentences": ["Among them, Panasonic Battery in Shanghai which is refitting its factory&apos;s water system."], "title": "The man making the world's worst polluter clean up its act", "article": "He is not as well known as Al Gore or David Attenborough but among green campaigners, no one has a bigger role in tackling climate change than Ma Jun. As China&apos;s economic growth races on at breakneck speed and with more dirty, coal-burning power plants coming on line each year, the world&apos;s most populous nation will soon overtake the US as the biggest greenhouse gas emitter. Ma, 39, has emerged as the powerful voice of a budding green movement that is forcing industry and China&apos;s tightly run state to be more accountable for the long-term consequences of their rush to get rich. He founded the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, which is among those leading the charge to clean up the air and rivers of China, a monumental task. Pollution is leaking beyond its borders. Sand storms caused by desertification blast across Korea and Japan all the way over the Pacific to America. And as the dump for 50 billion tonnes of effluent annually, the rivers&apos; toxic discharges threaten marine life hundreds of miles beyond China&apos;s seas. The country&apos;s environmental importance was apparent last month when George Bush said he would not sign up to ambitious new goals to prevent global warming unless China was involved. President Hu Jintao rejected binding targets, but said China would reduce emissions voluntarily and has unveiled its first plan to deal with climate change. There is even talk that after years of red politics and black capitalism China may yet turn green. Ma has cause for optimism. The ex-journalist switched to activism in 1997 after hearing Chinese hydro-engineers boast that the Yellow River was a model of water management, even though it was so over-dammed and exploited that it failed to reach the sea on more than 200 days each year. That inspired Ma to write an influential book warning of an impending crisis. There was not much an ordinary citizen could do then, when green campaigners were considered a threat to a government fixated with economic growth regardless of the environmental cost. But much has changed. Since 2003, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has done more than any leader to press the environmental case. Five years ago, there were fewer than 50 registered green NGOs in the country. Today there are almost 3,000. Ma&apos;s institute&apos;s online China Water Pollution Map - ipe.org.cn - names and shames the worst offending regions and companies. It is a symbol of a new kind of social activism in China: pragmatic rather than idealistic, and relying more on maps and data than votes and speeches to lobby for change. If polluting companies want their names removed from the map they have to accept an environmental audit from a third party and act on any problems. This has prompted a response by 30 companies, mostly multinationals. Six have already agreed to audits. Among them, Panasonic Battery in Shanghai which is refitting its factory&apos;s water system. &apos;It is not just because of us,&apos; said Ma. &apos;But it is really good. They sent a big delegation to our office to explain their actions and they have invited us to go and check their plant.&apos; Not everyone is as receptive. Ma says Pepsi, General Motors and five or six British firms are among those who have not responded. There are 80 multinationals among the 5,500 violators listed, but they face the fiercest criticism. Ma is unapologetic: &apos;Multinationals are more sensitive to public pressure because they have bigger brand names and they have made commitments to be environmentally sensitive. Chinese firms are not used to this kind of pressure yet.&apos; To make domestic firms feel the heat, he plans to target their overseas buyers and suppliers. &apos;Globalised manufacturing and procurement mean that a lot of high-polluting, heavy duty jobs are transferred to China,&apos; says Ma. &apos;We will ask major companies, such as Wal-Mart, Microsoft and IBM to put pressure on their Chinese suppliers.&apos; New laws have been implemented on environmental protection in China and the latest five-year plan includes ambitious targets to cut pollution by 10 per cent and improve energy efficiency by 20 per cent. But these fine-sounding directives run up against resistance by local authorities still focused on rapid development, and fear from companies that environmental concerns will drive them out of business. &apos;Managers from one big Chinese noodle company came here and told me, &quot;We are just a farmers&apos; company. Think how it will impact on us.&quot; But I tell them the rules are made by the government. Every firm should comply. It doesn&apos;t mean they can&apos;t compete.&apos; So how does it feel for the head of a small campaign to have executives from some of the world&apos;s biggest companies knocking at his door to explain themselves? &apos;It shows that China has bottlenecks. Environmental problems cannot be resolved here the way they are resolved in other countries. I heard that 80 per cent of the environmental problems in the US are solved in court. That can&apos;t happen here.&apos; These &apos;bottlenecks&apos; are the one-party state with no independent justice system, no political accountability and no free media. For decades, there was nothing to stop Communist cadres and factory bosses from pumping out poisons. However, the market economy has given consumers more choice, the media have greater freedom and businesses are gradually paying attention to corporate social responsibility. &apos;This is a lucky time for us because central government leaders have changed their mindset,&apos; Ma says. &apos;We have a vibrant economy. There is over-supply of goods. That means strong competition and more consumer power.&apos; His next project is an air quality map. There is still no comprehensive data for carbon emissions despite China&apos;s G8 promise of significant achievements in this area. Ma says China needs time to come to terms with climate change. His goal is to ensure China&apos;s natural heritage is not destroyed by economic growth. &apos;China is moving forward. Developing countries are not the real culprits. Rich countries must take responsibility.&apos;", "tags": ["Environment", "China", "Pollution", "Activism", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-07T23:31:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/08/musicnews.broadcasting", "sentences": ["The other major concerts were in Sydney, Tokyo, Johannesburg, Shanghai, Hamburg, New York and Rio."], "title": "Rockin' all over the world (but just watch your carbon footprint)", "article": "It was a once-in-a-lifetime event. Yes, another one. Its organisers said the biggest emergency in world history demanded the biggest performance in world history. Sceptics said it would generate more heat than light. Live Earth rocked around the globe yesterday, with 150 acts performing on all seven continents in a bid to create a &apos;tipping point&apos; in public consciousness and action against climate change. Al Gore, former US Vice-President turned environmental crusader, claimed one in three people on the planet was watching. The man who lost the US Presidency enjoyed a few minutes as de facto president of the world as he broadcast to 2 billion people from Washington: &apos;Not many years from now, our children and grandchildren will ask one of two questions, looking back at us in 2007. &apos;Either they will ask: &quot;What were they thinking, didn&apos;t they hear the scientists, see the evidence, didn&apos;t they care, or were they too busy?&quot; Or they will ask the second question, which I prefer. I want them to ask of us: &quot;How did they get their act together to successfully solve the climate crisis&quot;?&apos; Gore and his team were determined to muster enthusiasm for their one-world, 24-hour epic despite yawns of concert fatigue after Live Aid, Live8 and, just six days before, the Concert for Diana. Bob Geldof had complained: &apos;We are all fucking conscious of global warming.&apos; But his Live8 co-organiser, Richard Curtis, was at the London concert and, unlike those earlier spectaculars, Live Earth was reaching into China, now the biggest producer of carbon emissions . Live Earth had also been accused of hypocrisy by bands including Arctic Monkeys, The Who and Muse, who dubbed it &apos;private jets for climate change&apos;. Its total carbon footprint, including the artists and spectators&apos; travel and energy consumption, was likely to have been at least 31,500 tonnes, said John Buckley of Carbonfootprint.com - more than 3,000 times the average Briton&apos;s annual footprint. One viewer of BBC2&apos;s Newsnight complained online: &apos;Would you hold a hog roast to promote vegetarianism?&apos; Clearly aware of the backlash, the comedian Eddie Izzard, on stage at Wembley, admitted: &apos;A lot of stuff we tell you we have to do as well. We&apos;re probably more guilty than anyone with all this flying around and stuff.&apos; Ticket sales proved patchy at some of the host cities but Wembley shifted all 65,000 at \u00a355 a go. &apos;Hello Wembley!&apos; screamed radio DJ Chris Moyles, the show&apos;s opening host, against a backdrop of a world map made from the painted tops of oil barrels. &apos;It&apos;s a nice, easy, simple question, can you help save the Earth?&apos; A murmur from the crowd. Moyles said: &apos;We might be screwed if that&apos;s the response.&apos; There was always going to be tension between the light entertainment messenger and the deadly serious message of environmental chaos and catastrophe. Moyles acknowledged as much after asking people to send text messages in exchange for advice on reducing their carbon footprint. &apos;Serious stuff over!&apos; he said. &apos;Shall we get back to the show?&apos; The serious stuff was far from over, and at times it could be earnest. There was an emotive combination of music with footage of elephants, polar bears and coral reefs. Boris Becker tried to interest the audience in German recycling methods. Sets were punctuated by short films urging people to use energy-saving light bulbs. But the early acts, Genesis, Razorlight, Snow Patrol and Kasabian, raised spirits and suggested this would be more rock concert than wake for a dying planet. True lift-off came with Black Eyed Peas, while Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Metallica, Pussycat Dolls, Foo Fighters and the reformed fictional Spinal Tap built the momentum. Comic turns included Ricky Gervais and Chris Rock. In a symbolic gesture, Wembley switched off its non-essential lights for a minute&apos;s darkness. Then the main attraction, Madonna, who had written a song for the occasion, brought the show to a close with characteristic brio. The other major concerts were in Sydney, Tokyo, Johannesburg, Shanghai, Hamburg, New York and Rio. Can rock and roll save the world? was a question much asked yesterday.

By the time Borg was Federer&apos;s current age of 25 he had all but left the world stage, his star burned out. He had been arguably the most focused men&apos;s champion of all time, his unbending concentration driving opponents to the point of distraction. The similarities between him and Nadal are obvious, and there are many who wonder how long the young Spaniard will be able to sustain his extreme focus, to say nothing of his phenomenal energy. As John McEnroe said in Rome this year: &quot;Doesn&apos;t this guy ever have a bad day or a headache once in a while? His intensity and quality level are quite amazing.&quot; But will it come at a price? In his early days Nadal suffered a considerable number of injuries. Now for the most part he has steered clear of serious trouble, although after winning the French Open title last year, and then playing in his first Wimbledon final, his game fell away on the US hard-court circuit, leading up to year&apos;s fourth and final major at Flushing Meadows. Federer has entered his 180th week as the world No1, a position he has held since February 2004, just after he won his second grand slam event, the Australian Open. Since then he has captured a further nine, putting him level on the all-time list with Borg and Rod Laver. And since July 2005 one man, Nadal, has tracked him. The 21-year-old Spaniard is now in his 103rd consecutive week as the world No2, and it is remarkable to think that all his 13 matches against Federer, of which he has won eight, have been while the Swiss was in the top spot. The difference this year is that Nadal has put himself into a position to overtake Federer by the end of the year. Indeed there were those prepared to argue that if he had beaten the Swiss in the Wimbledon final he would already have been, de facto, the world No1. Nadal remains circumspect. &quot;I am a better player than last year. Maybe right now you cannot compare us because Roger has 11 grand slam titles and I have three. But I am young and improving every season.&quot; Nadal has already won top tournaments on hard courts but as yet has not broken through to challenge Federer at either the Australian or US Open. That may change in New York this year. The adjustments he has made for grass took him within a shot or two of victory over the world No1 in the fifth and final set, and such is his unquenchable desire that next month&apos;s US Open may see him achieve another major step forward. &quot;I have to improve. I can&apos;t stop,&quot; said Nadal. &quot;But sometimes when you are improving it is not always easy to win. I&apos;m trying to be the best player every year and now I have the chance to be the No1.&quot; Already this year, having won the French Open and three of the five Masters Series, he has edged ahead of Federer in points won to date. Ideally the final battle will come down to the end-of-season Masters Series Cup in Shanghai in November. Federer, despite winning the Australian Open and now Wimbledon, has not been quite the force of the past two years, and Nadal gets under his skin, as was obvious on Sunday. &quot;I have the highest respect for him,&quot; said the Swiss, who has faced him in four of the past six grand slam finals, two at Roland Garros and two at Wimbledon. Clearly Federer has a major advantage on hard courts, having won the Australian and US Opens three times. So Nadal&apos;s next big step forward is to challenge him in New York. It was a tournament Borg never came to terms with, even though he finished runner-up four times. If Nadal is to become the world No1 this year, or any other year, he must learn to love the madness that is the US Open.", "tags": ["Sport", "Tennis", "Wimbledon", "Wimbledon 2007", "Rafael Nadal"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-09T23:02:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/12/newsstory.sport11", "sentences": ["(a) July 20 Brighton (a) July 24 Portsmouth (a)  Barclays Asia Trophy July 27 Liverpool  or South China (a)  Barclays Asia Trophy Aug 3 Queens Park Rangers (a) Liverpool July 7 Wrexham (a) July 14 Crewe Alexandra (a) July 17 Werder Bremen (a) July 20 Auxerre (a) July 24 South China (a)  Barclays Asia Trophy July 27 Portsmouth or Fulham (a) Barclays Asia Trophy Aug 3 Shanghai Shenhua (a)  Rotterdam Tournament Aug 5 Feyenoord(a)  Rotterdam Tournament Manchester City July 14 Doncaster Rovers (a) July 18 Orgryte IS (a) July 21 Carlstad United (a) Aug 1 Shrewsbury Town (a) Manchester United July 17 Urawa Red Diamonds (a) July 20 FC Seoul (a) July 23 Shenzhen FC (a) July 27 Guangzhou Yiyao (a) Aug 1 Internazionale (h) Middlesbrough July 14 Schalke (a) July 17 Hertha Berlin (a) July 21 Burnley (a) July 24 Darlington (a) July 28 Hibernian (a) July 31 Carlisle (a) Aug 4 AZ Alkmaar (h) Newcastle United July 17 Hartlepool United (a) July 21 Carlisle United (a) July 26 Celtic (h) July 29 Juventus (h) Aug 1 Hull City (a) Aug 5 Sampdoria (h) Portsmouth July 14 Yeovil (a) July 17 Havant &amp; W.

But the death sentence carried out on Tuesday on the former head of China&apos;s State Food and Drug Administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, was particularly significant - and may be a sign that the autocrats in Beijing are being forced to realise the importance of public opinion. Unacceptable as capital punishment is, the latest execution may be a sign that China is becoming less uncaring for its people. Zheng was sentenced to death in May for having accepted bribes to authorise sub-standard and counterfeit medicine, including an antibiotic that is alleged to have killed 10 people. In such cases in the PRC, people are usually given a two-year reprieve during which they can repent and get a prison sentence instead of being killed. Zheng, the highest-ranking official to have been executed since 2000, was offered no such way out. As a lesser figure, his deputy was treated more leniently, with a death sentence suspended for two years. Five other associates got long prison terms. The case is an obvious warning to other officials on the take - some 3,000 cadres have been investigated for corruption this year. But the execution, and the prominence it was given in state and Communist Party media, was also a signal to citizens that the government is sensitive on the issue of medicine and food safety, , at a time when, as Isabel Hilton noted here earlier, a growing numbers of Chinese are organising themselves into pressure groups and action committees, learning how to take action and pressure officials to obey the law while a rising number of articles, writers and intellectuals are challenging the proposition that the party has a divine right to the monopoly of political power. On a practical, everyday level in areas such as food, regulation is extremely weak, and defective or plain dangerous products abound. The state watchdog estimates that 20% of food on sale falls short of health standards. Ingredients two years past their use-by date have been uncovered. Last month, 180 food factories were shut down after inspectors found they were using formaldehyde, industrial wax and illegal dyes in sweets, seafood products, cracker biscuits and pickles. A Beijing newspaper reported this month that half the bottled water sold in the capital was fake, with tap water being poured into re-used or look-alike bottles of well-known brands. Exports of fish treated with dangerous antibiotics, tainted wheat used in pet foods, toys coated with lead paint, defective truck tyres and toothpaste containing suspect chemicals have internationalised the issue, heightening the trade row between China the United States and the European Union. The latest scare involves exploding mobile telephone batteries. Democratic frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have joined the congressional drive to slap sanctions on China if it does not revalue its currency upwards. EU Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, says relations are at a crossroads. Though Beijing insisted today that 99% of food exports are safe, the image of &quot;dirty China&quot; cheating through its cheap currency and poisoning people and pets has an obvious populist appeal, distracting attention from internal US and EU problems. But it is at home that China has moved most, and most interestingly. Zheng&apos;s execution was swiftly followed by announcements that licences or certification had been removed from more than 100 pharmaceutical firms, and that 14 companies had been banned from exporting sub-standard food products, some of which were contaminated by bacteria or unsafe chemicals. Today, the agency Zheng once headed said it aimed to cut the number of small food producers - seen as the core of the problem - in half over the next two years. New drug regulations were promised for October. This all indicates that the authorities have been forced to take the food and drug safety issue seriously as one of a series of social problems that represent the greatest challenge to the regime. With organised political opposition suppressed and the economy powering ahead, the risk to the Communist Party comes from grassroots discontent with land grabs by officials (more than 100,000 a year), corruption, pollution - and now unsafe food and medicines. The food and drug issue follows official backtracking on a petrochemical plant scheme in the port city of Xiamen after protests by 20,000 people, and on the extension of Shanghai&apos;s Mag-lev train line through built-up areas. Protests at the one-child policy have been met today by an official estimate that it actually only applies to less than 40% of the population. As many as 80,000 demonstrations involving more than 100 people take place each year, according to official figures. When people feel freer to stage public expressions of discontent, the regime has a choice between repression on the 1989 model or bending with the wind to the extent of acknowledging the need to take note of public opinion. While the first can never be ruled out, the second seems to have gained a new element that is making the authorities take notice. Not democracy, for sure, but perhaps an advance towards greater accountability.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-13T11:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jul/14/familyandrelationships.family1", "sentences": ["One day Liu says she would like to travel south to see the fancier resorts of Zhouzhuang in Shanghai and Wu in Zhejiang province."], "title": "Domestic dispatches: Jonathan Watts on the Qus in Beijing", "article": "It is nearly vacation time for the Qu family but - as is their usual custom - they won&apos;t decide which of them will go and to where until a few days before they leave. What they do know is that they will travel to somewhere in Inner Mongolia - which is at least an eight-hour drive away - at some point during the month of August. &quot;It is always very spontaneous. We have no clear route yet. That is our way,&quot; says Qu Wansheng. &quot;I don&apos;t like to plan holidays too far in advance. That would make me feel old.&quot; The family are avid travellers, heading off at least twice a year to various parts of China. They usually drive in Qu&apos;s brother&apos;s Ford, often packing in a few other relatives or friends for company - and to share the expense of the petrol. &quot;Apart from safety, good company is the most important thing,&quot; says Qu. &quot;Travelling companions need to be people we get on well with. If they don&apos;t like stopping for photographs - as we do - then it would be no fun.&quot; The family&apos;s links to Inner Mongolia go back to the Cultural Revolution, when Qu&apos;s brother went there as part of a wave of students who headed into the countryside at Mao Zedong&apos;s prompting. When he was 21, Qu went there to work for a couple of months, teaching computer skills to local people. Now he likes to take his family there. They sometimes stay in ger (nomads&apos; tents). His wife, Liu Guifang, always packs some cakes and snacks for the journey, though most of the way she sleeps because she finds that is the best way to deal with her car sickness. Such vacations are a real treat, she says, because during her childhood they could only afford to visit her grandparent&apos;s home in the countryside near Beijing. The only drawback is that too many people hit the road at the same time during national holidays so there is a lot of traffic and it can be difficult to find accommodation. One day Liu says she would like to travel south to see the fancier resorts of Zhouzhuang in Shanghai and Wu in Zhejiang province. A western-style overseas holiday is almost too distant a prospect to be imaginable. &quot;I have never thought about travelling aboard. I don&apos;t dare to. But I would like to go to Europe so I can check if it is really the same as on TV.&quot; Beach holidays don&apos;t appeal at all. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t like to spend my vacation lying in the hot sun. That would make me feel very strange and nervous,&quot; says Liu. The big family debate this year is about whether Chen should travel with them or stay in Beijing to study. With university exams coming up next year, Qu thinks his daughter does not have time to go on holiday. When she hears her father say this, Chen jokingly pretends to cry, but she says she understands her parents&apos; concern. &quot;I could accept it if they left me behind. It would be a shame, but any sacrifice is worthwhile to pass the entrance exam. And I am sure they will treat me to a great trip after that.&quot; Perhaps influenced by all the Japanese animation she watches in her spare time, the 17-year-old says that her dream holiday would be a trip to Japan. &quot;I don&apos;t really know why but I feel good about that country.

The most irritating example here is entitled &quot;I Have Been Thinking About Snow&quot;, to which one wants to reply, &quot;What, you want a prize just for thinking about it?&quot; Writing about it is evidently too onerous a task, since the piece consists of fragments of precious chat interspersed with lines and lines of nothing but full stops - a bit like snowflakes, geddit? That off my chest, I am happy to report that most of the essays are rather good: a ferry trip that almost casually becomes a meditation on solitude and water, an essay that runs from index cards to a fascination with armlessness, an impressive set of &quot;Four Annotated Car Washes&quot; (&quot;Can I tell you how car washes work?&quot; Monson asks, and, delightfully, he goes on to do so). The author has a miniaturist, free-associative humour, which is what you want in an essayist. The best pieces are those done in old-fashioned joined-up prose, with the exception of a haunting index for an imaginary book - although, thinking of Nabokov and Borges, you may as well call it fiction. Difficult, this business of naming genres. Infinitely Demanding: Ethics of Commitment, Politics of Resistance, by Simon Critchley (Verso, \u00a317.99) Sick of the world&apos;s brutishness and stupidity, you prefer to cultivate your garden. Tempting, but for Critchley that counts as &quot;passive nihilism&quot;, which is not as bad as the active nihilism of smashing things and killing people (cf al-Qaeda), yet still to be disdained. Instead, the author weaves together a challenging idea of ethics out of Kant, Levinas and Lacan, and marries it to a conception of &quot;politics&quot; as action taken at a critical distance from the state, eg by the WTO protesters et al. Critchley is amusingly sardonic (lumping &quot;manipulating pyramids&quot; and &quot;writing pessimistic-sounding literary essays&quot; into the same category of passive nihilism; or imagining the Republican stereotype of liberals as &quot;relentlessly aborting fetuses&quot;), and makes some sly cracks at the expense of fellows such as Alain Badiou and Slavoj Zizek. I have no idea why the hideous term &quot;dissensus&quot; is preferred to &quot;dissent&quot;, except that it makes a more obvious contrast with &quot;consensus&quot;, which to my ear is not a good enough reason. But the book is in the main both lucid and thought-provoking, even worthy of being called &quot;creative nonfiction&quot;. Manifesto for Silence, by Stuart Sim (Edinburgh, \u00a315.99) Sick of the world&apos;s brutishness and stupidity, you prefer to become a Trappist monk. Tempting, and for Sim inspiring, since there is too much noise all around, and a meeting of two great Zen masters, as he recounts, would often culminate in silence. This curiously engaging book is a sort of cultural history of silence framed by a rant about modern noise pollution, which thankfully goes a bit further than blimpish moans about music in bars: Sim also considers 24-hour building works in Shanghai, &quot;acoustic weapons&quot; being developed by the Pentagon, and the fact that the din of industrial shipping is wrecking the lives of marine mammals. In between we consider the memoir-writing Trappist monk Thomas Merton and the silent services of Quakers; Cage&apos;s 4 &apos;33&quot; and modernist pure black or white canvases (the visual analogue of silence, Sim argues nicely); the plays of Beckett, and Tristram Shandy. It is a shame that Sim is deaf to some aspects of music: &quot;Silence is certainly not part of the rock lexicon,&quot; he announces irritably.

Each has his supporters, with many putting Yang, less well-known internationally, above his distinguished colleague. It is quite possible that had Yang not suffered from the colon cancer that curtailed his work and finally killed him, he would have increased his reputation. Yang&apos;s seven feature films, united by his particular visual style (deliberate pacing, long takes, fixed camera, few closeups, empty spaces, cityscapes) and subject matter (the impact of the changes of Taiwanese society on the middle classes) make up an impressive body of work. Born Te-Chang Yang in Shanghai, he moved to Taipei at the age of two with his family after the leaders of China&apos;s nationalist government were exiled to Taiwan. There he grew up watching films by the likes of Federico Fellini and Robert Bresson, dreaming of becoming a film-maker. Yet he studied electrical engineering at the University of Florida and worked in computer design in Seattle. But his experience in 1972 watching Werner Herzog&apos;s Aguirre, Wrath of God, &quot;turned me around&quot;, as he told Cineaste Magazine. &quot;It restored my sense of competence that I could become a film-maker. This is what I thought a film should be. Film school would never teach you to make those kinds of shots.&quot; He returned to Taiwan and wrote the screenplay for The Winter of 1905 (1981) and directed an episode in the four-part feature, In Our Time, (1982), the film that is considered the starting point of the Taiwanese new wave. Yang&apos;s segment, set in the 1960s, a simple tale of a young girl searching for love, heralded a new director of talent. Yang&apos;s first feature, That Day On the Beach (1983) awakened more interest in him. Told in flashbacks, moving on different narrative levels (a favourite device), it told of two women, former schoolfriends, reunited after a 13-year separation. Reminiscing was to be one of his prominent themes. Taipei Story (1984), Yang&apos;s collaboration with Hou Hsiao-hsien (they were born in the same year) as co-writer and leading player, has a couple discussing their pasts in an empty apartment, which gradually evolves into an Antonioniesque study of urban alienation. Yet, although he was considered the &quot;oriental Antonioni&quot;, Yang avoided the psychological identification with one particular character, taking a wider perspective in which the city and characters interact. The rather dreamlike The Terrorizors (1986) focuses on three couples, whose relationships are fluid. A Brighter Summer Day (1991) is an elliptical multi-character (there are 100 speaking parts) study of adolescents, set in Tapei in the early 1960s. Meticulously observed through mostly long and medium shots, it has sequences in semi-darkness that reveal the characters&apos; sense of estrangement but also reflects the fact that the Taiwanese suffered many power cuts during the period. Yang followed this dark film with two less well-received but effective satirical comedies, A Confucian Confusion (1995) and Mahjong (1996), before embarking on his most successful film, Yi Yi (A One and a Two, 2000), a cryptic and beautifully nuanced story of a middle-class family seen from different perspectives. At almost three hours long, it delicately shows characters integrating and interconnecting as a commentary on the pains and pleasures of relationships. Among the many awards the film garnered was the best director prize at Cannes. Sadly, it was to be his final film, though he planned to make The Wind, an animated feature with Jackie Chan budgeted at $25m, to be drawn by Yang, heading a team of animators. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2000, shortly after receiving the Cannes award but, when it spread to his liver and a lung, he moved to southern California to seek additional medical treatment. Yang, who had become an American citizen, died at his home in Beverly Hills, survived by his wife, the concert pianist Kaili Peng, and their son, Sean. \u00b7 Edward (Te-Chang) Yang, film director, born November 6 1947; died June 29 2007", "tags": ["Film"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-17T23:08:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/18/comment.money", "sentences": ["In New York, Shanghai and London, the cosmopolitan plutocracy outdo each other in displays of ritual vulgarity from the car showroom to the restaurant table.", "In Shanghai, more than 1.5 million people were displaced between 1991 and 1997 to make way for the skyscrapers and malls of the Chinese super-rich."], "title": "Tristram Hunt: Urban Britain is heading for Victorian levels of inequality", "article": "Today&apos;s super-rich are endowing a new generation of cities as divisive and ostentatious as themselves. In New York, Shanghai and London, the cosmopolitan plutocracy outdo each other in displays of ritual vulgarity from the car showroom to the restaurant table. But beneath the helipads, there lurks a growing cityscape of poverty and exploitation. Yesterday&apos;s Joseph Rowntree Foundation report on social segregation in Britain has highlighted the crisis, talking of poverty &quot;clustering&quot; and wealthy flight to the outskirts. With the personal wealth of the richest 1% now controlling 24% of the national share, it seems we are heading towards Victorian levels of inequality. So it is worth recalling how the most astute critic of urban geography regarded the effects of such extremities of wealth and poverty. Dividing his time between his Eccles mill, the warehouses of Princess Street and the underworld of 1840s Lancashire, Friedrich Engels was horrified by Manchester&apos;s social chasm. Industrial capitalism had divided one city into two warring nations of rich and poor. And this class conflict was embedded in the fabric of the streets. In his 1845 masterpiece, The Condition of the Working Class in England, Engels chronicled how the seemingly chaotic Manchester was, in fact, a carefully planned expression of middle-class power. He began in Deansgate, which, like today, was home to high-end shops and showy warehouses. Surrounding it were the &quot;unmixed working people&apos;s quarters&quot;, and beyond them the suburbs of the rich, &quot;the breezy heights of Cheetham Hill&quot;. What excited Engels was how &quot;the members of this money aristocracy can take the shortest road through the middle of all the labouring districts to their places of business, without ever seeing that they are in the midst of the grimy misery that lurks to the right and the left&quot;. The city was designed &quot;to conceal from the eyes of the wealthy&quot; the human cost of their riches: &quot;the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth&quot;. And they certainly weren&apos;t innocent &quot;in the matters of this sensitive method of construction&quot;. Such patterns have long been the case in developing and postcolonial nations. In Planet of Slums, his Engels-like polemic, Mike Davis showed how segregation and racial zoning has been used by authoritarian planners from Nairobi to Mumbai. In 1990s Lagos, the military dictatorship bulldozed the Maroko district to ensure high-income neighbourhoods were shielded from the poor. In Shanghai, more than 1.5 million people were displaced between 1991 and 1997 to make way for the skyscrapers and malls of the Chinese super-rich. In the west it is more subtle. In her new book World City, the geographer Doreen Massey explores Ken Livingstone&apos;s London as &quot;a heartland of that socio-political economic formation that goes by the name of neoliberalism&quot;. What strikes Massey, as it did Engels, is the expressive inequality of the city. &quot;London is the most unequal place in the country, and the effects of this wealth reverberate throughout the capital.&quot; The nature of modern prosperity requires the impoverishment of others. &quot;The sharpening of inequality has everywhere ... been primarily the result of the growth of a stratum of super-rich.&quot; Massey is right. Just as the Victorians spoke of &quot;outcast London&quot; or the &quot;dark continent&quot; of the East End, so today&apos;s extremities of need and greed exist autonomously side by side. Hidden from the sterile corporate village of Canary Wharf - with its speedy tube links and cocooned rail routes - are the crumbling estates of Bethnal Green. Around the corner from the millionaire terraces of Clapham Common is the sprawl of Lambeth. Driven by booming house prices and City excess, the geography of the capital is being steadily fractured. Where once professionals, students, working-class communities and migrants mixed - in places like Notting Hill, Camden or Kilburn - modern wealth extremities are closing neighbourhoods off. The gated community and dark-windowed 4x4 signify the new urban contours. And it isn&apos;t just London. In Engels&apos;s old city a decade-long renaissance has failed to trickle down to many in east Manchester. The jobs and businesses offered in culture, retail, education and media often fail to attract indigenous, working-class residents. In Liverpool there is frustration at how the city-centre Gold Zone regeneration has not spread north to the worst-off. But it is in London that the inequalities remain starkest. Once Livingstone decried the effects of global capitalism, but now he seeks to celebrate it with a canopy of hubristic City skyscrapers: the Gherkin, the Walkie-Talkie, the Shard. The capital&apos;s precious skyline is being consciously recrafted into an expression of corporate dominance. London&apos;s civic fabric made fit for our era of Russian oligarchs, non-domicile bankers and undocumented migrant labour. What always surprised Engels was &quot;the absurd freedom from anxiety with which the middle class dwells upon a soil that is honeycombed, and may any day collapse&quot;. He thought a revolution - &quot;in comparison with which the French Revolution will prove to have been child&apos;s play&quot; - was inevitable. As the Rowntree report depressingly shows, Engels was always stronger on his geography than futurology. \u00b7 Tristram Hunt is writing a new Penguin biography of Engels tristramhunt@btopenworld.com", "tags": ["Money", "Social exclusion", "Society", "UK news", "Poverty", "Manchester", "Greater Manchester"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-17T23:13:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/18/newsstory.everton", "sentences": ["Although the club has agreed to field teams at Peterborough on Saturday and Colchester on July 28, Mascherano&apos;s first game for his club since the Champions League final defeat in Athens on May 23 is likely to be August 3 when they face Shanghai Shenhua in Rotterdam."], "title": "Free agent Vogel on verge of joining Everton", "article": "Everton&apos;s manager, David Moyes, is close to completing his second signing of the summer with the Switzerland captain, Johann Vogel, poised to join the club.

This week he is sitting with eight others in the dock in Vienna accused of breach of trust and fraud in one of Austria&apos;s biggest corporate scandals. Wolfgang Fl\u00f6ttl, who has sold his art collection to cover his subsequent losses, is the son of the ex-head of Bawag, a former union-owned bank set up in 1922 for waiters and carpenters that lost \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a3940m) in currency speculation deals in the Caribbean. It was baled out from near-bankruptcy by the former government a year ago with a \u20ac900m underwriting loan. Now Austria&apos;s fifth largest bank, it was bought for \u20ac3.2bn late last year by US fund Cerberus. In stifling heat the court has heard from prosecutor Georg Krakow how &quot;everything has gone&quot; from the \u20ac1.4bn Bawag invested in &quot;forbidden speculations&quot; and &quot;disastrous clandestine deals&quot; run by a &quot;little clique&quot;. Krakow, armed with 70,000 pages of documents, is seeking up to 10 years in jail for the accused, including two ex-CEOs, Helmut Elsner and Johann Zwettler. Elsner, a 72-year-old who fled to his sumptuous villa on the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur when the scandal broke but was extradited in February despite heart surgery and pleads innocence, was said by his lawyer Wolfgang Schubert to be &quot;a loving family man who sits with his granddaughter on his lap and reads her stories&quot;.  Can&apos;t see judge Claudia Bandion-Ortner buying that old chestnut. Fl\u00f6ttl, meanwhile, had close personal and business links with Phillip Bennett, former chief of US commodity brokerage Refco which went broke just after Bawag lent it several hundred million dollars - via Fl\u00f6ttl who is said to have cost Bawag more than \u20ac1bn in bad loans.  But Fl\u00f6ttl, who fell out with Elsner at a meeting in London in late 2000, has been singing to the authorities, according to his lawyer, Herbert Eichenseder, who proclaimed his innocence and said he had supplied 70% of the evidence. The trial, clearly worthy of film treatment, will last until October - perhaps just around the time the case against another Austrian banker and hedge fund manager, Michael Berger, could begin. He was on the run for five years from the &quot;Feds&quot; (FBI) after failing to appear in a Manhattan court after pleading guilty to charges that he misled investors during the dot.com boom - to the tune of $575m.  Is there something about Viennese bankers? Maybe the smell of the ultra-strong local coffee made them lose their heads... The French keep the tube running This week&apos;s collapse of Metronet, the PPP consortium supposed to deliver a \u00a317bn modernisation of three-quarters of London Underground&apos;s network, will probably provoke a wry smile in Olivier Houssin, head of the security solutions and services division at Thales, the French electronics group that&apos;s also designing Britain&apos;s two new aircraft carriers. He&apos;s not a great fan of PPPs for strategic infrastructure projects, he made plain in a recent interview in Paris, showing a Ken Livingstone liking for public funding. Thales is a key supplier of Tube Lines, the successful consortium of Amey and Bechtel that is rebuilding the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines on time and under budget.  But it is not a consortium member - unlike the position at Metronet which gave lucrative contracts to its supplier shareholders.  &quot;Tube Lines works well and keeps its commitments,&quot; he said before the Metronet debacle. Houssin&apos;s division, which accounts for a quarter of Thales&apos;s business, or \u20ac3.2bn in sales last year, is growing faster than the defence and aerospace units: an expected &quot;mid- to high-single digit&quot; rate this year, he says. It has orders worth \u20ac1bn in London alone, including a recent \u00a3160m extension to a contract to provide new computerised signalling for the century-old Piccadilly line by 2014, and views this as a core strategic priority. The French group, run by Anglophile Denis Ranque, is 27% in state hands but keen to shake free - eventually. Meanwhile, and despite a recent lacklustre share performance, it is expanding its overseas interests in railway signalling, air traffic management, congestion management (charging), civil security, including at power stations and pipelines, airports and even pilot training. Houssin&apos;s favourite phrase is &quot;mission critical&quot; and he wants Thales to become a global leader. The division is already second in the world for rail signalling and involved in metro systems in Hong Kong, Dubai, Madrid, Beijing, Shanghai (now building its 11th line, 120km long), Turin and New York. In May it was chosen to supply a &quot;contactless&quot; fare collection system for the new Line 3 of Cairo&apos;s metro network, including 29 stations. Somehow, the French - who designed and built the Second Severn Crossing but are derided in certain neo-liberal Whitehall circles - do these things better than the Brits.

There are thudding presses that belt out body parts from flat sheets and a robot arm that trims the waste amid a fountain of sparks. But much of the assembly work is still done by hand. At the start of a line, the main body is lowered on to the chassis with the help of a crane that runs along an overhead track. The other parts, like the doors and front end, are then bolted on one at a time by workers in dungarees, until the finished model is driven off. Doors waiting to be fitted are stowed like toast in a rack. Men lovingly polish surfaces like butlers sprucing up the family silver. It feels very physical somehow. It is not exactly Vorsprung durch Technik. &quot;You can walk this plant and get a real sense of how a vehicle comes together,&quot; says Manganese Bronze&apos;s chief executive, John Russell, who joined the company this year from Harley-Davidson. The plant was once surrounded by car plants, as well as factories making a wide range of other stuff. These days much of the industry is gone from Coventry. Manganese Bronze is, by quirk of fate, the largest British auto manufacturer left. Even then, the statement needs qualification. The Chinese company Geely Automobile recently took a 23% stake as part of a deal to set up a joint venture in Shanghai. &quot;Britain&apos;s largest non-foreign-owned car company is this one here,&quot; says Russell, tapping his finger on the table. Can it still be called that? &quot;Predominantly British owned is what I just said,&quot; he says, laughing at his omission. He draws a horizontal line in the air. &quot;It&apos;s a long sentence with a lot of qualifying clauses.&quot; The same Coventry plant has been producing the black cab since the 1940s. It is one of the most recognisable symbols of London but is also on the streets of cities including Birmingham and Nottingham. This year, the plant will produce around 3,000 cabs and the company, which also owns dealerships and offers after-sale services, is expected to make around \u00a34m on turnover of \u00a3100m. The latest version, the TX4, was launched late last year. Each of the cabs is expected to travel more than 1m miles during a typical life of around 14 years. Geely deal The company has been through a period of restructuring, sold off a parts division and disposed of property to help clear debts, returning to profit in 2005 after five years in the red. But the deal with Geely signed in October promises to transform the business entirely, if it works. Through the joint venture, Manganese Bronze hopes to be producing 40,000 vehicles or more in Shanghai for markets around the world within a couple of years. The hope is that the inevitable reduction in costs - cabs are priced at between \u00a328,000 and \u00a332,000 - will enable the business to tap a huge latent demand. It hopes to get the price down to about \u00a315,000 in the export market. &quot;We are a small UK manufacturer sitting on a potential huge opportunity,&quot; Russell says. &quot;The joint venture is a perfect way of unlocking that potential. We do own an icon. It is an extraordinary visible symbol of Britain. You go anywhere in the world and at the very minimum there is a recognition of it and in most cases it is a very positive recognition associated with the best aspects of London and the UK. So we have this massive sort of opportunity sitting there and I don&apos;t think the company ever had the money or the management time to focus on exploiting that.&quot; He cites Mexico as an example. &quot;Mexico City has I think the biggest fleet of taxis in the world - 105,000 - and it is very uncontrolled. The standards are very poor - there is quite significant risk of being mugged or raped in the back of some of the worst. So we got into conversations and the whole thing was going fine until we failed on the commercial conversation. We couldn&apos;t get the vehicle to a low enough price to make it work and we&apos;ve got files full of these examples.&quot; Last year, Manganese sold only 92 vehicles overseas, mostly into the US and the Middle East. Russell, 57, is an unhurried and affable character who says he enjoys walking the factory and getting feedback. One of his first moves, when he started in March, was to shift the headquarters from Milton Keynes to Coventry so that he could be closer to the business. There is also a touch of the northern club circuit comic. He mentions a pink cab recently produced as a one-off. &quot;Everyone thought that, given my marketing background, it was probably my company vehicle,&quot; he says, with a knowing smile spreading across his face. &quot;It was actually for a guy in London who wanted to do gay weddings.&quot; He was hired primarily because of his experience of international markets. He spent nine years at Harley as the head of its European business and oversaw a sixfold increase in sales. He says he has always enjoyed &quot;things&quot; - he has a couple of BMWs, a powerboat and a couple of Harleys at home. Shanghai saloon Manganese Bronze owns 48% of the joint venture company, Shanghai LTI Automotive. The British company is injecting its intellectual property into the venture plus management and production skills. As well as taking 48% of the joint venture profits, the British company retains the rights to sell the Chinese-made taxis in markets outside Asia. The venture will also produce saloon cars and a limousine version of the taxi that Manganese plans to import to Britain. Production is slated to begin in mid-2008. Russell says there are no plans to close the Coventry plant, which employs 220. Instead, he reckons the deal will make the plant more efficient because it will be able to source cheaper materials and components. Investors are expressing confidence in the deal. The Manganese Bronze share price has gone from \u00a32 a year ago to over \u00a39. Geely produces 250,000 low-mid-market cars a year. &quot;The Chinese auto industry wants to do what Japan took 40 years and the Koreans have taken 20 years to do,&quot; says Russell. &quot;But they want to do it in 10. They want to achieve western-acceptable quality standards. We are appointing three people to the joint venture - most important is the quality officer of the whole project. It&apos;s quite a stretch if you look at what they do today. The issue is not about getting it done. The issue is how quickly do we get it done. If quality is not right, we&apos;ll just keep going back until we get it right. &quot;Could it go wrong? Yeah of course it could. Anything can. I mean Daimler Chrysler, Rover BMW, you know the list is endless. But I think we are starting out in as good a shape as it can be.&quot; Russell has enough experience of the pitfalls of the auto industry. His first job was at Unipart when it was in a &quot;chronic&quot; condition. He joined Peugeot in Coventry when it was on its knees. He joined Land Rover in the 1980s as part of a failed management buyout team. He ran marketing and joined the board and was still there when it was sold to BMW. He was also there for the fallout with the German owners. Does he feel regret about what has happened to the British car industry? &quot;All western car companies are in trouble to some degree,&quot; he says. &quot;You know the American industry is in a terrible state and I think it will reach a point of cataclysm fairly soon if they are not careful. Ford has got some tremendous challenges. They&apos;ve relied on SUV profits to sustain them and now that business has dropped away. A lot of European car manufacturers - you know, the Fiats and the Peugeots - have managed to survive through some degree of support whether directly governmental or whether it is just the desire of the nation to see them survive. &quot;Our industry has taken much more of a free-market approach, which I think has got to be the right thing. There is a point where occasionally transitional support is needed but you can&apos;t constantly prop up badly performing industries. So if you look at why the British-owned industry has failed you come back to fundamental management failings and investment failings.&quot; Without the Chinese deal, Russell says, Manganese would have had difficulty investing in new models and exploiting overseas demand, but things would be far from bleak. The business is relatively stable, with its only direct rival in the market, Metrocabs, drifting in and out of administration. &quot;The growth in economic activity, the deterioration of people&apos;s ability to use public transport or their own personal transport in a city has opened up huge opportunities for the taxi industry. At the end of the day we are the only purpose maker of taxis in the world and the taxi business is a growing business and that&apos;s not a bad strategic advantage.&quot; The CV Born Portsmouth, 1949 Education Havant Grammar School.

Wang Guoqing, a vice-minister with the cabinet&apos;s information office, said that mobile phones and the internet were making the job of censors almost impossible. &quot;It has been repeatedly proved that information blocking is like walking into a dead end,&quot; he said. Mr Wang chastised local governments for still believing information could be kept secret when, he said, they should see their roles as controlling and managing information rather than simply hiding embarrassing news. There is a growing realisation within the world&apos;s largest nation that China&apos;s massive online population wants to discuss issues that were taboo only a few years ago. A collection of websites across the country has started to debate endemic corruption of low-level officials, environmental degradation and product regulation. The situation is far more complex than the portrayals by many western observers suggest. This doesn&apos;t mean, however, that the Chinese authorities will accept these changes without a fight. Take the recent news that authorities in the town of Xiamen are planning to force local bloggers to register with real names. As Time.com&apos;s China blogs dryly noted: &quot;This, of course, has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that the internet [played] a huge role in the protests that roiled the city in early June when thousands of residents poured on to the streets to denounce a plan to build a chemical factory in a Xiamen suburb.&quot; It would be practically impossible to implement such rules, but this hasn&apos;t stopped local officials talking about it anyway. Gary Wang is founder of Tudou, China&apos;s equivalent of YouTube. He told me in Shanghai that government officials called virtually weekly to demand that one video or another be pulled. According to bureaucrats in the censorship department, &quot;red lines&quot; are routinely crossed. Despite 60 million clips viewed daily and 40 million users per month, Wang recognised that the authorities were fighting a battle they could never win, but were unlikely to give up any time soon. It was simply a price of doing business in the country. It&apos;s something I noticed myself in China, too. There is a profound disconnect between President Hu Jintao&apos;s calls in January for the internet to only &quot;spread more information that is in good taste&quot; and the reality on the ground. At internet cafes in both Beijing and Shanghai, I saw users accessing softcore pornography and western news sites that are allegedly blocked. The task of monitoring around 140 million net users is an impossibility - something more senior officials may be starting to realise. With the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games just over one year away, these issues are becoming more relevant than ever. Will the government care that the hordes of foreigners coming for the Olympics may be unable to access vital information online? Perhaps filtering will magically disappear for the two-week event or simply be drastically curtailed. Such &quot;unblocking procedures&quot; are a regular occurrence. For example, the long-banned English Wikipedia is supposedly now available, though last week it was still inaccessible. As one blogger told me, trying to impose logic on a system that was ultimately controlled by the whims of a faceless bureaucrat was pointless. The rise of China and its massive environmental challenges is already causing some in the west to claim that these problems will keep it from becoming a truly global super-power. This is probably wishful thinking. Controls over the internet (along with blocks on satellite television) may be signs of a nation that is struggling to define itself in the 21st century, but a weakened post-Iraq America suits the Chinese authorities just fine. After all, it was only recently that armchair economists predicted Japan would be the world&apos;s next major player. China doesn&apos;t want to make the same mistakes. Spend any time with bloggers, writers or journalists and you&apos;ll soon discover that Internet filtering is little more than a distraction, an issue to be circumvented.", "tags": ["China", "Internet", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-24T14:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jul/28/moneysupplement1", "sentences": ["There may be a clue in the name (Shanghai and Hong Kong being known for their high rises); on the other hand they may just have got rid of the ridiculous British prejudice against mass housing, tall housing and mixed social/private housing, spotting a lucrative market on the way."], "title": "Your shout: Letters", "article": "Banks giving identity thieves a helping hand Maurice Jay (Your shout, July 21) asked &quot;Why do banks help potential fraudsters&quot; by sending easily identifiable documents through the post?

Due to what I assume was a fault in the folding process it wouldn&apos;t take much effort to work out what was inside the envelope (especially since the outline of a card could be felt). I wasn&apos;t expecting a new card and wouldn&apos;t have missed it if it had been stolen. Banks are always telling us to take care of our debit and credit cards and feigning disbelief when we tell them that they have been used fraudulently. Why does Halifax feel the need to publicise what it is sending out - even if the wording should have been hidden? Anne Sempik, Nottingham I wonder why my bank statements contain my full name, address, account number AND (because we receive the state pension) my husband&apos;s and my national insurance numbers! An identity thief&apos;s dream! Please could you campaign to stop this ridiculous practice? Pam Harries, address supplied When small claims is just courting failure I have launched nine claims in the past 10 years and have obtained a judgment in my favour in all of them, but on only five occasions did I get my money back. The fact is that most defendants then ignore the judgment, and so you have to embark on further action though the court, paying additional fees every time. If you apply for a bailiff&apos;s warrant, they will visit the defendant, but have no power to enter their home or to take away tools of the trade. More often than not they just give up after a couple of visits. On one occasion, a man owing me a very large sum simply told the bailiffs that he was not the defendant; they accepted that and told me there was nothing more they could do. So, it really isn&apos;t as easy as you make out and the court staff don&apos;t help at all. A reform of the process is long overdue. Tony Bayliss, Wolverhampton Not such an expert view from our winner &quot;Friends of mine were [getting divorced]. He owned the house so no issue there&quot; - the &quot;expert opinion&quot; of a letter writer in Personal Effects, 21 July - and you gave her the \u00a325 prize! Was this, I wonder, one of those re-prints of letters to the Guardian from 100 years ago? Other expert contributors acknowledged the value of professional mediation and family lawyers. The token winner should give her \u00a325 to the wife who, it appears, may have walked away with next to nothing. Alan Piper, address supplied A number of your correspondents painted a positive picture of family mediation. My experience was somewhat different. My ex-husband refused to go through the courts and insisted we use family mediation. What he did not do was offer to contribute anything towards my costs (each session cost \u00a380 per person). He had a full-time job and a high-flying career. I had next to nothing. He dragged out the sessions for weeks and weeks until he knew I had no funds left and was so demoralised and exhausted that I was ready to agree to anything, just so it could all be over. None of the media stories you read praising mediation mention what happens when the partner who has the greater financial power decides to hold the other to ransom, in order to get what they want. If I ever got divorced again I would go straight to a divorce lawyer and remain deaf to the siren call of &quot;talking it over like adults&quot;. Name and address supplied High time we looked at tower block mortgages I was pleased to see your article on the difficulty of obtaining mortgages for tower block homes. More than five years ago, I found the perfect flat at the right price, a &quot;secondary&quot; sale in a council block, and wanted to make an offer. The agent gloomily told me I probably wouldn&apos;t be able to raise the money. I had two colleagues looking at similar purchases in different blocks (all in London&apos;s inner East End) and together we scoured the banks until finding the HSBC who cheerfully stumped up for all of us. I have since successfully recommended HSBC to five friends and acquaintances for tower block mortgages and continue to do so. There may be a clue in the name (Shanghai and Hong Kong being known for their high rises); on the other hand they may just have got rid of the ridiculous British prejudice against mass housing, tall housing and mixed social/private housing, spotting a lucrative market on the way. Amanda Reynolds, London Well, I am glad to have been proved correct after all these years! I am a structural engineer working in the London area, doing inspections for prospective purchasers. I have looked at a number of tower block flats and I always point out that the freeholder is likely to be the local authority. On that basis, any latent defects or underlying problems would be difficult to rectify. Although the discount looked attractive, it may not compensate for the hassle of having to deal with the same housing department that already had been responsible for not carrying out maintenance and repair. The reason why banks are reluctant to lend on such properties is because they know they have little control over the freeholder and as such may have difficulty on resale. I would never recommend a local authority as a freeholder.

NAC said the two companies shared a common vision &quot;to jointly build an automotive group that will become the largest world-class automotive group in China&quot;. It added that the group and the MG brand in particular saw cooperation with SAIC &quot;as a major step in securing and delivering its long-term expansion and development prospects&quot;.

SAIC was in negotiations with MG Rover before its collapse in 2005, but failure to reach a deal forced the UK company to call in the administrators. It then became locked in a competition with NAC to acquire the assets of MG Rover and its engine maker, Powertrain. In the end NAC emerged the winner with an offer thought to have been between \u00a350m and \u00a360m. Much of the production equipment at Longbridge was shipped to China but NAC has taken over part of the plant and has begun production of the MG TF sports car. The new operation employs a few hundred people compared with the 6,000 who worked at the Birmingham car plant before the MG Rover collapse. The UK company&apos;s assets were seen as a valuable acquisition for a Chinese car maker because it gave ownership to technology that could be developed to allow access to western markets.

She was born in Canada and grew up in Sheffield. After Cambridge, she went to the Far East and began her broadcasting career. Apart from fond recollections of watching movies with her family, she told The Observer Film Magazine how the claustrophobic Australian drama Lantana was so memorable because it was released at the same time she was at the centre of a court case involving a stalker. She now lives with her husband and two children in London. The first time my father took me to the movies  Death on the Nile (John Guillermin 1978)  The first time I went to the cinema was with my father. He was a huge fan of Peter Ustinov, so we went to see Death on the Nile at the Hampstead Ionic. The memory sticks in my mind as one of those father-daughter outings that really work. Funnily enough, when I&apos;ve seen that film since, at Christmas, I&apos;m instantly back at exactly that level of suspense as when I watched it with him.  My introduction to arthouse cinema  Fanny and Alexander (Ingmar Bergman 1982)  Fanny and Alexander blew me away. I was visiting my sister in her first year at university. It was my first foray into something dark. There were the most magical, chilling and terrifying images in the film: images that should have been wonderful for children were turned around and subverted. When I was 11, I was terrified about the world. My parents were travelling a lot and there seemed to be all these hijackings. Terrorism was very much on my mind, and I wonder whether that film played into my ultimate nightmare.  The one that reminds me of working in China  The Bodyguard (Mick Jackson 1992)  A friend and me took the slowboat from Shanghai to Hong Kong in 1993. It was bloody slow and was my most vivid experience of communist China. You got someone banging on your door telling you to get up and go to breakfast at 6am. The highlight was the film they showed each night. I&apos;m really embarrassed to say this, but one night it was The Bodyguard. I just sat there and cried and cried at what I thought was the most beautiful romance.  The one that helped me through our tense engagement  Meet the Parents (Jay Roach 2000)  Meet the Parents was an icebreaker for me. Jewish girl, Catholic boy, very tense engagement period. I remember switching it on when my parents were staying with us once, in the lead-up to getting married. Seeing my father laugh at a situation that was parallel to the one in our house, and catching my husband-to-be&apos;s eye, was an opportune moment. We were taken outside the tricky intimacy of what you always think of as a very specific problem until you suddenly realise that all over the world people are going through it. We&apos;re still happily married and my parents adore my spouse.  The one my son always wants to watch  The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming 1939)  I watched it at my grandmother&apos;s house every year as a kid and now I&apos;m just introducing my three-year-old, who has this thing about extreme weather. We just go over and over the whirlwind scene at the beginning. He doesn&apos;t really care about the munchkins, he just wants to see death and destruction in Kansas. And that is me as well. We sit there huddled up on the sofa rewinding and watching the tornado again and again.  The one that evokes a difficult period in my life  Lantana (Ray Lawrence 2001)  Lantana is connected to when I was going through a court case when I felt my life being intruded upon in a way I didn&apos;t like. I don&apos;t know whether Lantana is escapist or reflective. But my husband and I went to see this film about the oppressiveness of suburban Australia on a very hot Saturday afternoon. It was counter-intuitive. We went into this hot, stuffy cinema, and the film captured my mood. Maybe it was escapism that afternoon.

If you&apos;re looking for a hotel featuring glitter-ball camel sculptures, a golden prancing horse, or a lifesize falcon covered in red crystals, then you&apos;ll be spoilt for choice. If you want skyscraper living and 24-hour access to sushi, there are several options.  If however, you prefer your hotels a little less glitzy, and your suite unsupersized, it&apos;s not so obvious. Until recently, boutique chic didn&apos;t really exist here. Sure there are some great slick and understated hotels (the Park Hyatt and the Royal Mirage are good examples), but they&apos;re all large scale. This is a city after all which now boasts the world&apos;s tallest tower (the Burj Dubai) and is constantly seeking to make things bigger and better.  Less is most definitely not more in Dubai. Except at Fusion, a boutique B&amp;B in Jumeirah. This patch of Dubai, popular with wealthy expats and locals, is all palatial pads and sprawling mansions. As I walked past a gigantic Hummer parked outside the house and opened the opaque gates to Fusion, I was suddenly a little apprehensive. The villa had been recommended to me merely as a bargain option and glam was not part of the plan.  Tiki torches glowed in the garden, a gaggle of people in what were surely ironic logo T-shirts laughed on the lawn and my initial reaction was one of distress. I wasn&apos;t dressed for this. In a city that&apos;s bustling with all manner of bars, clubs and parties, the hipsters can be hard to find. They&apos;re more likely to be spotted at a private view or a product launch than down the pub. But if I&apos;d known that they tended to congregate at Fusion, I might have made more of an effort with my hair.  House-shares are a way of life here and when South African couple Stacey and Peter van Rijn opened their villa up to paying guests in October, they took the concept of renting out the spare bedroom to its logical conclusion. The villa attracts the city&apos;s small-but-burgeoning cluster of design junkies, media types and fashion groupies, some of whom make it their short-term base in Dubai and stay for a couple of months.  Designed by Stacey, an architect, its high ceilings, white walls and features are straight from the pages of Wallpaper. Initially I was a little nervous that I might mess up the elegantly-draped fabrics or do something dreadful to the decadent chaise longues, but the vibe here is more Ibiza house party than pristine design hotel and, fortunately, a bit of boho with one&apos;s chic is encouraged.  Breakfast happens on an imposing table for 20 in the main area, the scene of dinner parties that go on till late and help-yourself muesli the next morning.  During the cooler months, you can walk to the public beach from the house \u2013 the pool is too small to do more than pose or paddle - although if you hang around the house it&apos;s plausible that you may find yourself doing breakfast smoothies with a copywriter just in from Shanghai or hiding in the air con with a fashion buyer from Paris.  More like a weekend at a trendy friend&apos;s house than a conventional place to stay, a visit to Fusion feels like an invite to Dubai&apos;s backstage party - the only tricky part has been getting on the guest list. Word of mouth has kept the villa full of visiting friends of the city&apos;s creative types.  Fortunately, Fusion 2, a sister property a few streets away from the original, has now joined the scene. Similarly slick, with geometric black leather sofas, an impressive sound system and retro pool table in the public areas, Fusion 2 is every bit as chic as its big brother. There are only eight rooms here, as opposed to 14 in the other villa, but all have flat screen TVs and WiFi, flattering lighting and brilliant beds \u2013 the mattress is perched high on a silver concrete stage in the centre of the room.

A special team of inspectors was sent across the country to question local party bureaus, state-owned enterprises and banks.

Critically, Mr Chen had repeatedly failed to take heed of the policy changes emerging from the new leadership in Beijing, preferring the breakneck expansionary policies of his patron, Jiang Zemin, to the more measured approach being put forward by President Hu. The conflict came to a head last summer, when President Hu accused the Shanghai leader of promoting &quot;sectarianism&quot; and &quot;big Shanghai-ism&quot;. &quot;According to the law, it does not matter who you are, once you&apos;ve been handed to the law, you&apos;ll be held in detention.

Devised by the provincial government in Zhejiang, eastern China, the game - available free on the internet - allows players to hunt down and kill dishonest officials, eventually gaining entry to a corruption-free &quot;paradise&quot;. Such has been the game&apos;s instant popularity that it has been downloaded more than 100,000 times and the website hosting it has crashed. &quot;I feel a great sense of achievement when I punish lots of evil officials,&quot; one satisfied player told the English-language China Daily. As illustrated by today&apos;s announcement that 1,800 corrupt officials have been punished in the past month alone, this is an issue that the ruling Communist party takes seriously and is attempting to tackle. According to official figures released last year, more than 67,500 government officials in China had been punished for corruption since the beginning of 2003. For those caught, the punishment can be severe - the head of the party&apos;s central commission for discipline inspection yesterday told reporters that executing corrupt bureaucrats was perfectly legitimate given &quot;China&apos;s national condition&quot;. But the problem is a vast one. Since the country began opening up its economy to competition and profit in the 80s, corruption has mushroomed into perhaps the biggest single threat to the perceived legitimacy of the Communist party. Given that China&apos;s astonishing economic transformation has barely been matched by improvements in official governance and the accountability of officials, the crisis was, in many ways, inevitable. According to a 2005 report in China&apos;s official media, such was the laxness of controls in the still state-dominated banking system that 4,000 bureaucrats stole an estimated \u00a325bn in cash. If official dishonesty is rife in cities, it is practically unchecked in the countryside, where local party bosses - many miles away from any oversight - have always wielded great power. Anger over corruption, especially the seizure of land without compensation for sale to developers, has sparked a number of violent confrontations between rural people and officials in recent years. In December 2005, an unknown number of villagers in the southern province of Guangdong were shot dead by police. Corruption is felt especially keenly among country dwellers, who already feel they have missed out on China&apos;s economic boom - average incomes for the 700 million or so people living in rural areas remain around one third of those in the cities. The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, who presents himself as an ascetic, disciplined figure with little interest in the trappings of power, has put himself at the forefront of anti-corruption measures. &quot;We cannot slack off for one moment,&quot; he said in a speech last year to mark the 85th anniversary of the party&apos;s founding. There is particular pressure to achieve tangible results prior to the Communist party&apos;s congress in Beijing later this year - a hugely important five-yearly event at which China&apos;s rulers jostle for supremacy. The current anti-corruption drive extends to the highest areas of officialdom. Last week, Chen Liangyu, the former Communist party chief in the economic powerhouse of Shanghai, was formally handed to judicial authorities to be tried over a scandal in which hundreds of millions of pounds from pension funds were illegally invested in construction projects. He was the first member of the party&apos;s 24-strong elite politburo to be purged for more than a decade. Last month, Zheng Xiaoyu, the former head of China&apos;s food and drug safety watchdog, was executed for corruption. Others recently arrested include the country&apos;s top statistical officer and the organiser of the Shanghai Grand Prix. Experts, however, remain sceptical about how much can really be achieved - especially at the lower levels of officialdom - while the Communist party remains unelected and completely unaccountable.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-03T14:28:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/04/china", "sentences": ["The director of the state food and drug administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, was executed in June for economic crimes, and many are wondering if the same fate awaits the disgraced former Shanghai party chief, Chen Liangyu."], "title": "1,800 Chinese officials confess in corruption inquiry, party says", "article": "Nearly 1,800 officials have confessed to involvement in hundreds of acts of misconduct after a nationwide &quot;discipline&quot; campaign, a senior Chinese Communist party official said yesterday.

More than \u00a3366million has been thrown at players and with four weeks of business remaining, total outlay could pass \u00a3400m. For United, the league champions, and Chelsea, the FA Cup and Carling Cup holders, this afternoon&apos;s match is about bragging rights and little else. But Arsenal and Liverpool, the other members of the so-called Big Four, will be watching closely. Having finished 21 points behind United last campaign and having spent \u00a360m between them this summer, they know that a serious challenge for the title is expected. Otherwise they, the other Premier League clubs and their fans may have to start contemplating the title being dominated by a Big Two for the foreseeable future. As United manager Sir Alex Ferguson drily observed: &apos;They&apos;ve added a bit to their squad, particularly their attacking options, so one thing for sure is that Liverpool and Arsenal won&apos;t want to be 20 points behind us again. You expect a bit of improvement there, don&apos;t you?&apos; Arsenal last won the title in 2004, Liverpool in 1990. Arsene Wenger has said that he trusts a young squad headed by Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie and Kolo Toure and which has been strengthened after Thierry Henry&apos;s departure to Barcelona by \u00a317m of investment. Rafael Benitez&apos;s \u00a343m splurge dwarfs that sum and has created a first for the Anfield club. Not since the Premier League&apos;s inception in 1992 have Liverpool attracted a player who might have chosen any elite European club, including United and Chelsea. Whether \u00a326.5m for Fernando Torres represents value will soon be discovered. He scored 84 goals in 214 league appearances for Atletico Madrid, which does not suggest he is the prolific striker Liverpool need, although the 23-year-old Spain player did score his first goal for his new club in a 2-0 friendly win over Shanghai Shenhua in Rotterdam on Friday and may be about to move his performance on to the next level. Ferguson has recognised his ability. &apos;We know about Torres,&apos; said the United manager. &apos;His age is good and they have probably bought him at the right time. Liverpool have bought [Ryan] Babel as well, and he&apos;s quick and a strong lad.&apos; If Torres, Babel and Benitez&apos;s other headline signings, Andriy Voronin and Yossi Benayoun, fail, the psychological implications for Liverpool of yet another season without winning the title could be serious. Ferguson knows it. &apos;We experienced that for 26 years,&apos; he said. &apos;You think you&apos;re getting there and you get hit by something across the knuckles that knocks you back. It&apos;s a factor for all the teams who are trying to win the league. It&apos;s something you have to whittle away at - improve your team bit by bit and hopefully get there in the end.&apos; Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005, the FA Cup a year later but lost last season&apos;s Champions League final to Milan in Athens. That makes attempting to quantify their progress difficult. So, too, Arsenal, who have played in the Champions League and Carling Cup finals in the past two seasons but lost both. What is clearer is that, while Liverpool are second only to United&apos;s massive outlay of \u00a357m (once the \u00a310m for Carlos Tevez is factored in), Arsenal&apos;s spending sits in the same region as Chelsea. Although the west London club have had a relatively quiet summer, Wenger, whose money has gone on Henry&apos;s replacement, Eduardo Da Silva, and right-back Bakari Sagna, has spent only \u00a33.5m more than Mourinho. The Portuguese&apos;s only cash buy was \u00a313.5m for wide-man Florent Malouda. Yet Tal Ben Haim, Steve Sidwell and Claudio Pizarro are a shrewd trio to land for free. After last season&apos;s injury and form problems, the areas of central defence, midfield and striker were where Mourinho needed to strengthen. Especially because he will lose Didier Drogba, Michael Essien, John Obi Mikel and Salomon Kalou in January. &apos;Chelsea have brought in a lot of players, but they have the African Nations Cup to worry about,&apos; said Ferguson, who has no such problems. &apos;So that&apos;s why they&apos;ve done it.&apos; Brazil defender Alex is also incoming, and Mourinho could bring in at least one more money signing. Arsenal might feel unlucky not to have beaten Chelsea in the Carling Cup final last season, but Drogba&apos;s late winner summed up a softness that Wenger must hope will have been hardened by experience. &apos;That&apos;s football. You can play chess for 10 hours and still lose,&apos; is Ferguson&apos;s verdict on Arsenal&apos;s style. &apos;We don&apos;t attack to look pretty, we attack to win and get the goals that make you win. In that sense, we were good last year.&apos; Of his summer spending spree, about \u00a330m was for a 19- and 20-year-old who, Ferguson admitted, may not even become first-team regulars. &apos;With Nani and Anderson, we felt our buying was about the future,&apos; said the manager. &apos;We might as well spend it now to stop others. If we had waited a year, everybody would be after them. So there was a calculated risk there, but we think it is a good one.&apos; In other words, \u00a330m may seem a lot for potential, but if it also helps to crush United&apos;s rivals for a few seasons, that is good business. And while Torres cost \u00a326.5m, the Spain striker has not won a league title or the Champions League. Owen Hargreaves, another Ferguson purchase, has done both. &apos;He&apos;s the type with ingredients that will be useful to our team, particularly in Europe because he has great experience with Bayern behind him and that&apos;s very important,&apos; said Ferguson. What, then, of other clubs who may challenge for a top-four finish? &apos;Spurs have made some good improvements from last year. They bought Darren Bent, who will give them a lot of pace up front,&apos; said Ferguson of the club who finished fifth in the past two seasons. &apos;They will be creeping towards the top four this season.&apos; He also mentioned Everton, but there is no suggestion that they or Spurs have any chance of finishing in the top two. Last week, Steve McManaman said: &apos;I certainly think they&apos;ll be in the top four. Whether they can win it this year, who knows? They&apos;ve strengthened, but so have the teams that finished ahead, so it&apos;s going to be very difficult.&apos; He was talking about his former club Liverpool.

Liverpool needed only to beat Feyenoord - a once great club, but now cast adrift amid the flotsam and jetsam of the Dutch Eredivisie - to claim their first trophy of the new campaign but they stumbled horribly. Instead, the spoils went to Porto after the Merseyside club could not overturn Royston Drenthe&apos;s 44th-minute opener, with Pepe Reina avoiding further embarrassment by saving Luigi Bruins&apos; late penalty. Pre-season tournaments are a notoriously shaky barometer of a side&apos;s prospects but this was not the first time this pre-season that Liverpool had faltered with the finishing line in sight. They were beaten on penalties by Portsmouth in the final of the Barclays Asia Trophy last month and, given the pressing need for palpable success at Anfield, Ben\u00edtez can only hope his new-look side are not developing a potentially costly habit of choking on the big occasion. They were thwarted here by poor luck and even worse finishing, although there was a silver lining in a typically astute equaliser by Steven Gerrard and the performance of Dirk Kuyt. The 27-year-old deserved a goal for a display brimming with industry but, not for the first time, the net remained undisturbed. Ben\u00edtez can feel generally satisfied with his summer&apos;s work, although whether his already travel-weary side needed yet another foreign sortie is debatable. Liverpool had already toiled in Hong Kong and Switzerland this summer so a weekend spent broiling in The Tub - the nickname for Feyenoord&apos;s cauldron-like stadium - was not perhaps ideal preparation for a potentially draining campaign. And this was not an occasion when Liverpool could afford to stroll. Whereas Friday&apos;s knockabout against Shanghai Shenhua, the Chinese club, had been played at a funereal pace, there was an added zest and zip to last night&apos;s encounter, sparked largely by the ear-splitting din created by a near-capacity crowd. The Het Legioen had turned out not simply to salute their own side but also a returning colossus. Kuyt, who scored 71 goals over three richly rewarding years in this city before joining Liverpool for \u00a39m last summer, was greeted with a cacophonous roar before kick-off and his presence - together with that of Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Andriy Voronin - guaranteed a sense of occasion. For Kuyt this was a golden opportunity. The high-profile arrival of Fernando Torres has made him an endangered species at Anfield and he would have shifted uncomfortably in his seat last Friday when the Spaniard deftly opened his Liverpool account against Shanghai. But if Kuyt was feeling the pressure he did not show it. He took only seven minutes to send a venomous shot fizzing over the crossbar and moments later a typically marauding run was capped by a cute lay-off to Voronin, who embarrassingly missed his kick from six yards. A role-reversal in the 16th minute almost put Liverpool ahead. Voronin&apos;s through-ball to Kuyt was weighted to perfection and the Dutchman comfortably shrugged off the attention of his markers before barging into the area and pinging a firecracker shot off the woodwork. Liverpool&apos;s dominance was total, but it also bred complacency. They were given a warning in the 27th minute when Andwele Slory sprang their offside trap only to lose his footing at the crucial moment. Seconds before half-time Giovanni van Bronckhorst&apos;s pass set Slory speeding away from the dawdling John Arne Riise for a second time. His shot clattered against the right-hand post but the loose ball fell kindly to Drenthe, who drilled in from eight yards. Liverpool seemed stung by falling behind and they quickly began to turn the screw after the restart. Sherif Ekramy, the Feyenoord goalkeeper, was forced into an athletic flying save from Xabi Alonso&apos;s spiteful shot in the 56th minute and Voronin fluffed another promising opening after a spirited run by Ryan Babel, the substitute. Babel was not finished there. With 19 minutes remaining the youngster - booed at every turn on account of his Ajax background - careered forward again and slipped a pass to Gerrard, who finished adroitly under Ekramy. In the 86th minute Feyenoord were handed a golden chance to take the spoils when Alvaro Arbeloa handled Drenthe&apos;s cross in the area but Reina - well versed in saving penalties in crucial encounters - proved equal to Bruins&apos; spot-kick. The night ended on a sour night when Gerrard became involved in an ugly shoving match with Theo Lucius after the winger had been fouled just outside the penalty area. A melee ensued, with Alonso and Daniel Agger wading in for good measure, but the referee, Pieter Vink, rather generously opted to award nothing more than yellow cards to Alonso and Drenthe.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Liverpool", "Feyenoord"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-06T00:37:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/aug/06/seeyangsfilmatagalleryne", "sentences": ["His influences are unashamedly filmic - the work is packed with visual and thematic references, not just to the Shanghai cinema of the 1930&apos;s, but also the alienated languor of Antonioni, the passionate solipsism of the French Nouvelle Vague."], "title": "See Yang's film at a gallery near you", "article": "Not an uphill struggle ... still from Yang Fudong&apos;s Seven Intellectuals In a Bamboo Forest One of the best films I&apos;ve seen this year is also one of the longest: Yang Fudong&apos;s Seven Intellectuals In a Bamboo Forest runs for almost four hours - but it&apos;s not this which makes it unlikely to be seen any time soon in a cinema near you. Nor is it the ponderous title - hard to imagine the kids turning to each other, bright-eyed, on a Friday night: &quot;Hey! Let&apos;s go catch that intellectuals-in-the-forest movie... !&quot; Rather, it is the fact that the film has been designated a work of art, and as such, consigned to the more rarified climes of the gallery circuit. While excerpts have been screened at various museums and campuses around the world (Chicago, Dublin, London), the entire work, finally complete, premiered at the Venice Biennale, and it was there, over the course of a leisurely afternoon, that I viewed it in full. In Venice, the film was divided into five &quot;episodes&quot;, ranging in length from 29 to 65 minutes, each screening in its own mini-cinema, a series of small, specially constructed boxes. The Artigliere is a long, L-shaped space, a former boat factory, through which one walks - as at Ikea - in a single, designated direction, and the chambers showing Yang&apos;s film are positioned directly in the middle of this central pathway. It&apos;s as if the film is a sequence of gates through which one must pass. Most people wandered in, stayed a few minutes, then moved on. But for those prepared to submit to its unhurried rhythms, the rewards were great. Shot in 35mm black and white, its elegant compositions betraying his training as a painter, Yang&apos;s film exerts a power that&apos;s both symbolic and quietly erotic: a succession of fleeting encounters, confessional monologues, wordless tableaux; it&apos;s also more sexually forthright than any mainland work since Ye Lou&apos;s great Summer Palace. His influences are unashamedly filmic - the work is packed with visual and thematic references, not just to the Shanghai cinema of the 1930&apos;s, but also the alienated languor of Antonioni, the passionate solipsism of the French Nouvelle Vague. In an explanatory note, Yang points out that the film&apos;s inspiration was historical: it is based, he says, on &quot;the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove&quot;, a famous group of Chinese scholars and poets who in the mid-third century, in the midst of an especially turbulent transition between the Wei and Jin dynasties, fled the capital to assemble in the countryside. There, they devoted themselves solely to contemplation, setting aside their worldly concerns. Their action was, according to Yang, a manifestation of the Taoist notion of ch&apos;ing-t&apos;an, or &quot;pure conversation&quot;, which advocated freedom of expression and hedonism as a means of transcending the pettiness and corruption of court politics. Like many contemporary Chinese art, it seems conflicted: poised between modernity - celebrating the nation&apos;s adoption of free market values, the gradual lifting of political repression - and a yearning for the past, a barely-articulated hunger for the constancy of traditional values. As such, it represents the ambiguous position currently facing intellectuals in contemporary China, sidelined by the emerging capitalist economy. Ironically, it&apos;s a dilemma encapsulated in the film&apos;s own &quot;high art&quot; status. A work such as this has a limited audience at best - but its unusual length, coupled with its secondment to the art world, only highlights its self-selecting quality. A parable about redundancy and irrelevance, it risks becoming those things itself.

The mixture found at Interlaken Town, one supposes, is exactly the sort of thing that would appeal to an upwardly-mobile Chinese businessman keen to celebrate his largesse in a five-star hotel erected near the slopes of a tea plantation. After all, while property developers seem to have abandoned all things Chinese in favour of an eclectic, pick-and-mix exoticism that draws on a century of stereotypes about English manners, French romance and Swiss chocolate, most Chinese people over 30 can remember when it was all still fields. Tourism is a big deal in China, and while most observers - including the Chinese Foreign Ministry - are expressing concern about the damage that 10 million travellers can do to the Champs Elysees or the Coliseum, others are getting on with building, here in China, the sort of infrastructure that might draw in the crowds.That means a few Leaning Towers of Pisa, a Chateaux de Versailles and some Sphinxes of Giza thrown in for good measure. Traditional domestic tourist spots, such as Lijiang in the country&apos;s Southwest, are already under severe pressure, and even the cash-strapped local government admits that its narrow medieval roads and cluttered hillside buildings are unable to cope with the influx of several million people from the big cities during China&apos;s big holiday periods. Tourism, as well as being a big deal, is also a relatively new deal. The villas in the famous summer retreats of Lushan in Jiangxi Province, for example, were constructed for a small number of foreign imperialists unable to cope with the Shanghai heat, and are ill-suited for the tens of thousands of weary middle managers that now descend on them. Naturally, China has been forced to build new facilities from scratch. Take the pristine beaches of Sanya, on the semi-tropical island province of Hainan (optimistically dubbed &quot;China&apos;s Hawaii&quot; by enthusiastic local officials). In a shockingly narrow period of time, real estate moguls from the mainland have created what seems to be a grotesque reimagining of Blackpool&apos;s Golden Mile, as it might appear after centuries of cataclysmic global warming. Complete with Sphinxes. Luxury, of course, leads to unavoidable culture shock. In Xinhua in Jiangsu Province, a slightly unsettling model village celebrated as one of China&apos;s richest, sometimes the only thing that bemused residents can think of doing with their gold-plumbed marble baths is to keep their fish in them.", "tags": ["Travel"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-07T14:44:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/07/bookerprize2007.thebookerprize", "sentences": ["I&apos;ve been from Hay-on-Wye in Wales to Copenhagen to Shanghai to Hong Kong to Cape Town, Galle in Sri Lanka, Parati in Brazil."], "title": "A year at the top", "article": "It&apos;s been nearly a year since you won the Man Booker prize for fiction. What impact has winning the prize had so far?  It isn&apos;t easy to be a young writer, you have to convince others, convince yourself. So much attention has been paid to this book after the Man Booker, and I&apos;m grateful for that, but the greatest impact on my life is feeling I might be more eccentric in my work in the future, that I should play more. I feel (I hope this continues when I actually begin working), less uptight and rigid about the process. I was quite stern and mean-spirited while writing Inheritance of Loss, fearful of the risk I was taking. You mentioned in an interview shortly after winning the prize that you would like to have been in India - where &quot;they care for the Booker so much&quot;. Have you had a chance to go to India since you won the prize?  Yes, I was there quite soon after. Indians have always followed the Booker - an old link, I suppose, and the fact that the prize is often given to books particularly pertinent to us. On my book tour, I was constantly reminded of how precious books are in India. I grew up with that being an absolute tenet. India was quieter then, with a closed-door economic policy, the world arrived only through books, and they meant everything. I remember reading with an intensity that seems lost to me now. Rushdie writes of how we grew up kissing any book that fell on the floor as if they were sacred objects. Now, living in New York City with barely any space to put books, an overflowing desk, I sometimes put books in piles on the floor, and feel ... evil. Where else in the world has winning the prize taken you?  It really has been a lot of travel, albeit in cartoon form. It sometimes feels as if a joke is being played on me: the world at last, but moving too fast to see it. Yet, of course, it is the greatest luck to meet book people from around the world. I&apos;ve been from Hay-on-Wye in Wales to Copenhagen to Shanghai to Hong Kong to Cape Town, Galle in Sri Lanka, Parati in Brazil. I&apos;ll go to Europe again, hopping between countries, to Canada, to Indonesia ... In your acceptance speech you thanked your mother for her support and help with your writing. Have the dynamics altered since winning the prize?  No, I think they go too deep to be altered. I&apos;m responding to these questions from her house. We were talking of what she&apos;d recently written about Primo Levi and his translating Kafka, of the holocaust that was anticipated by Kafka, experienced by Levi. What this did to an intelligence (Levi&apos;s) writing about people on the other side of the world, writing about how one tribe fails another. Very different from other Europeans observing the colonial world at that time. When I walk into her home, it is almost as if another dimension opens up, a magic space in which I can work and think like nowhere else. It is the peace of it, the stillness of the light, the flavour of exile that seems essential to writing, the fact that everything seems to bend to the fact of it being a writer&apos;s home. It&apos;s the rhythm of a writing life that comes from 50 years of working, and from that older time of being a writer in India when you wrote for writing&apos;s sake alone, not for the cocktail samosas. You&apos;re the youngest female writer to win the prize. Do you feel as if you now need new literary aspirations to work towards? &quot;Youngest female&quot; makes me feel like a biological specimen! Well, I don&apos;t think younger, quicker, fatter, etc really matters. A good book can come from the location of youth or of old age, don&apos;t you think? I know a writing career goes up, goes down to its own rhythm - some are welcomed books, others despised books, but that&apos;s the public side. The important thing is the journey of thought, of experimentation. I feel very much at the beginning of that process. \u00b7 A full version of this interview can be found on the Man Booker prize&apos;s official site.", "tags": ["Booker prize 2007", "Awards and prizes", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Booker prize", "Kiran Desai"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-07T14:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/08/snooker.sport", "sentences": ["Steve Davis, 50 this month, overcame a dreadful blunder in the sixth frame to start his 30th professional season with a 5-4 win over Fergal O&apos;Brien to reach the last 16 of the Shanghai Masters."], "title": "Snooker: Painstaking Davis wins in Shanghai", "article": "Steve Davis, 50 this month, overcame a dreadful blunder in the sixth frame to start his 30th professional season with a 5-4 win over Fergal O&apos;Brien to reach the last 16 of the Shanghai Masters.

The freshwater marine mammal, which could grow to eight feet long and weigh up to a quarter of a tonne, is the first large vertebrate forced to extinction by human activity in 50 years, and only the fourth time an entire evolutionary line of mammals has vanished from the face of the Earth since the year 1500. Conservationists described the extinction as a &quot;shocking tragedy&quot; yesterday, caused not by active persecution but accidentally and carelessly through a combination of factors including unsustainable fishing and mass shipping.  In the 1950s, the Yangtze river and neighbouring watercourses had a population of thousands of freshwater dolphins, also known as Baiji, but their numbers have declined dramatically since China industrialised and transformed the Yangtze into a crowded artery of mass shipping, fishing and power generation. A survey in 1999 estimated the population of river dolphins was close to just 13 animals. Historically, the species had been revered and achieved nearly demi-god status among fishermen who recounted tales of dolphins being reincarnations of drowned princesses. But in Mao&apos;s Great Leap Forward, the overthrowing of idols saw their protection lifted and they were hunted for food and their skin. Sam Turvey, a conservation biologist at London Zoo, worked with Chinese government scientists to survey the entire 1,669km stretch of the Yangtze river downstream of the giant Three Gorges Dam to Shanghai, a region which has been the natural habitat for river dolphins.  The team scoured the river four times in two boats during the six-week survey, using high-powered binoculars to spot the dolphins. Sensitive hydrophones were towed behind to listen for their calls. The researchers hoped that if any dolphins were spotted, they could be taken to a reserve in an oxbow lake which was once part of the Yangtze in the hope of boosting their numbers. But at the end of the survey, they had neither seen nor heard any sign of the dolphins, according to their report in the journal Biology Letters. &quot;We passed through what were supposed to be Baiji hotspots and every day there was nothing. The hopes of each person on the survey died at different points; everyone had a moment of realisation that we weren&apos;t going to find anything,&quot; said Dr Turvey. Around half of all river dolphins were killed as a result of indiscriminate and often illegal fishing practices. Though banned for the past 30 years, some ships still drag long lines of unbaited hooks. &quot;They just drift through the water snagging everything. They slash and entangle and suffocate the dolphins,&quot; said Dr Turvey. Low employment in the 1980s and 1990s saw a rise in unskilled fishing. Dr Turvey said conservation organisations had been quick to call for action to protect the river dolphin, but many were too cautious to take meaningful action.  &quot;The loss of such a unique and charismatic species is a shocking tragedy. The Yangtze river dolphin was a remarkable mammal that separated from all other species over 20m years ago. This extinction represents the disappearance of a complete branch of the evolutionary tree of life,&quot; Dr Turvey added.

But for China, it is a coming-of-age party, a chance to reclaim a place for this ancient nation among the world&apos;s most advanced civilisations - as the country&apos;s economic and sporting power are pushed to the forefront of global consciousness like never before. Starting today, China is counting down to the biggest and most expensive Olympics in the history of the games. From the opening ceremony at -Beijing&apos;s already iconic new stadium on August 8 next year, these games will stretch more than 2,000km between the athletics, gymnastics and swimming in the national capital to the equestrian events in Hong Kong - and stretch across more venues than ever before too, with football stadiums in Shanghai and yachting courses in north Qingdao. As well as the spectacular \u00a3208m &quot;bird&apos;s nest&quot; main stadium, Beijing is spending between \u00a320bn and \u00a335bn to accelerate the development of vast swaths of this 3,000-year-old city. Ahead of schedule, workers are now putting the finishing touches to new roads, subway lines, airport terminals and hotels. Even before the first event starts, the scale of China&apos;s ambitions will be apparent in the longest and most controversial torch relay ever. A new motorway is being built to the Everest base camp to smooth the path of bearers scheduled to carry the flame up the world&apos;s highest peak from Nepal, and down the north face into Tibet. Plans to take the torch through Taiwan have also stirred up cold-war rivalries, but this is not the only politically sensitive issue. As the first Olympics in a communist state since Moscow in 1980, a battle looms over the message of the 2008 games. For the ruling party, it is the ultimate propaganda opportunity to show the government&apos;s success in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. For Tibetan independence activists, human rights campaigners, supporters of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, persecuted peasants and environmentalists, it is a chance to expose the dark side of the planet&apos;s biggest one-party state. But perhaps more than anything, it will show how China&apos;s market reforms, begun 30 years ago, have transformed the country into one of the great centres of globalisation; how movement - from the countryside to the city, and between the homeland and the rest of the world - has changed millions of lives. The Guardian spoke to those working and living closest to the games - the people of -Beijing - about their lives and how the games have touched them. Today, they will be organising, training, teaching, driving, testing, studying, protesting - all -preparing for a landmark year as the final countdown to 08/08/08 begins. \u00b7 Additional reporting throughout by Chen Shi", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-08T23:09:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/09/china.jonathanwatts15", "sentences": ["When Zhou celebrated his 38th birthday yesterday, it was at a special party for 10 &quot;Olympic families&quot;, who were selected from all over the country and treated to a tour to the games sites of Hong Kong, Qingdao and Shanghai."], "title": "G2 Special: Hello Beijing - Zhou Chenguang, PE teacher and Olympic evangelist", "article": "&quot;I don&apos;t have any religious or political convictions.

When Zhou celebrated his 38th birthday yesterday, it was at a special party for 10 &quot;Olympic families&quot;, who were selected from all over the country and treated to a tour to the games sites of Hong Kong, Qingdao and Shanghai. For Zhou, the 2008 event is about a great deal more than sport. &quot;I think there is some fate linking me and the Olympics. I think I was born for the Olympics,&quot; says the physical education instructor. &quot;I started to feel like this in 2001, when China won the right to host the games.&quot; It was July 13 and he was watching TV in bed when that announcement came. It changed his life. &quot;I literally jumped with joy. Then I went to Tiananmen Square. There must have been more than 100,000 people. It was a sea of humanity. It gave me the feeling that the Olympics can unite people&apos;s hearts.&quot; Ever since, he has made it his mission to spread the gospel of the games. Starting with the school where he works, Zhou has taken every opportunity to promote what he calls an Olympic education. &quot;I have the -Olympic spirit and I put it into practice. I hope I can use it to inspire people all over the country and the world.&quot; Spending so much of his pay that he has had arguments with his wife, Zhou designed and financed an Olympic garden in the school yard, which is now decorated with 108 posters -illustrating the history, ethos, events, medals, mascots, pins and other details of the games.  &quot;Every new student is taken here as their -primary introduction to the educational philosophy of our school. We don&apos;t see it as a contradiction to patriotism. If you love the world and love nature and the environment, then it helps us to love our country the right way,&quot; he says. &quot;We let students touch the images on the posters. Then they make duplicates with recycled material. We make our own equipment and medals.&quot; The school has also staged its own mini-Olympics with the original five events from ancient Greece. The discus and javelin were made from discarded cardboard, plastic bottles and tape. &quot;I believe that when the Olympics comes to China the main objective should be to bring goodness in a practical way. The environment is a worldwide concern. We want the Olympics to make our country greener and healthier. That is why we mixed physical education with caring for the environment.&quot; Such efforts have brought good publicity to the school, which has been -visited by several dignitaries, including Britain&apos;s Olympics minister Tessa Jowell. His next goal is to take part in the Olympic torch relay. &quot;Any part would be OK, but I would love to carry it in Taiwan. We are in a global -village. No matter where people come from, if they are kind and love peace then they are our friends. Taiwan is part of China. We still want to make friends with them.&quot; The Olympics, he says, is inspired by angels. He credits it with bringing harmony to his workplace and home. He says his wife now supports his work, despite her earlier doubts. &quot;Wherever the Olympics goes it brings only sunshine, -happiness and progress.&quot; But when the games starts next year, he does not expect to be able to get to any of the events. &quot;In recent years, I have devoted so much money and energy to Olympic education, I won&apos;t have anything left to buy tickets.

In the days before our interview, the pollution index hit its worst point this summer. At noon, the skies were dark with exhaust fumes, dust from building sites and factory emissions. The 200mg of particulate matter in every cubic metre of air was four times worse than the level considered safe in Europe and twice as bad as Beijing&apos;s own standard. The higher the level, the greater the risk of lung disease and the worse the impact on athletic performances. It is hard not to feel sorry for Yu. Beijing&apos;s pollution problems have built up over two decades and all 14 million residents are responsible. But he is the one carrying the can. Yet, official numbers suggest an improvement on the recent past. &quot;Since 2002, when Beijing gained the right to host the Olympics, the air quality has improved every year,&quot; says Yu. &quot;But we are a developing country. In the short term we cannot reach the standards of London, Paris or New York.&quot; He points out that the city is in the process of switching its 1,100 coal-burning power plants to gas, reducing emissions of sulphur and nitrogen dioxide from the five main electricity generators and cutting production at the biggest iron company by 4m tonnes. More than 2,000 old buses and 5,000 taxis are being upgraded or replaced with cleaner models. The subway line network has almost been doubled to 200km. But although environment spending has increased from 5.7bn yuan (\u00a3370m) in 1998 to 23bn yuan (\u00a31.5bn) last year, clean-up efforts have struggled to keep up with the mess made by a supercharged economy. Beijing&apos;s GDP has doubled since 2006, energy output has ramped up 30% and 2 million more people have been added to the population. &quot;I feel big pressure,&quot; Yu says. &quot;Foreign athletes and visitors from developed countries will feel a big gap in the environment between here and their countries. Our own government is not satisfied, nor are experts.&quot; Many building sites and polluting factories will be closed for the duration of the event and meteorologists are planning a barrage of rockets to induce rain to clean the roads, and the air. Yu acknowledges, however, that all this could come to naught if there is no wind in the run-up to the games - pollution quickly builds up and chokes the city if it is not blown away every few days. He is optimistic that levels of particulate matter can be kept below the city&apos;s standard of 100mg a cubic metre. &quot;I think God will help us. In August and July there is usually plenty of wind and rain in Beijing. With this and all our hard work in the coming year, plus the temporary measures during the games, we can keep the figure under 100 for the Olympics.&quot; Even if it goes higher, he says, visitors should not be worried. &quot;According to our statistics, if the figure is between 100 and 150 it only affects the health of the most sensitive group. I can&apos;t deny that there is a link between environment quality and sports performance. But if the figure is not that bad it won&apos;t have a big impact. People should remember that at the last Olympics, China came second in the medal table even though most of our athletes trained in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities with similar conditions. I hope the world&apos;s athletes will not be overly worried about air quality.&quot; Despite the pressure, he says he is glad the Olympics is putting more of a focus on the environment. &quot;I had no idea what my job would entail when I was assigned to environmental protection in 1974.

China wanted security, resources and markets, it said; Russia wanted to regain sway in its post-Soviet &quot;near abroad&quot;; and in the wake of the 2004-5 &quot;colour revolutions&quot; in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, central Asia regimes that relied on &quot;authoritarian, clan-based and crony systems&quot; simply wanted protection from corrosive western ideas of democracy, human rights and free markets. All shared a desire to suppress Islamist extremism and separatism in whatever form, be it Chechnya, Tibet or Taiwan, and hold on to power. This agenda has led one regional expert, David Wall of Chatham House, to describe the SCO as a &quot;club for autocrats and dictators&quot;. All the same, there are dictators and dictators - and Mr Putin&apos;s numerous recent clashes with western countries, ranging from the missile defence row, the Litvinenko poisoning, opposition to US Black Sea military bases, and Kosovo&apos;s thwarted independence to malfunctioning Estonian computers, mystery bombs in Georgia, and disputed sovereignty over the North Pole are making his partners nervous. &quot;As Moscow&apos;s relations with the west deteriorate, the Kremlin is doing its best to seek allies and is building up the SCO to counter-balance Nato. In propaganda terms, Peace Mission 2007 will be used to the full,&quot; said Pavel Felgenhauer in the Eurasia Daily Monitor. &quot;But are the other SCO nations ready to line up against Nato?&quot; No one in the SCO, least of all China with next year&apos;s Beijing Olympics and its trade and development goals potentially in the firing line, seriously wanted confrontation with the west, he argued. &quot;Putin will most likely be left to huff and puff alone.&quot; Mr Putin&apos;s testosterone-fuelled yah-boo politics, if continued by him or his successors, could yet have the very opposite result - a weakening of the Sino-Russian alliance he forged at the outset of his presidency and the stifling of the SCO.

The SCO is destined to play a vital role in ensuring international security.&quot; According to the independent Power &amp; Interest News Report, the SCO&apos;s increasing geostrategic clout rests on the converging interests of its two leading members. &quot;The overall aim of the alliance for Beijing and Moscow is curbing Washington&apos;s influence in central Asia in order to establish a joint sphere of influence there,&quot; PINR said. China wanted security, resources and markets, it said; Russia wanted to regain sway in its post-Soviet &quot;near abroad&quot;; and central Asian regimes that relied on &quot;authoritarian, clan-based and crony systems&quot; simply wanted protection from western ideas of democracy, human rights, and free markets in the wake of the 2004-5 &quot;colour revolutions&quot; in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. All shared a desire to suppress Islamist extremism and separatism in whatever form, be it in Chechnya, Tibet or Taiwan, and hold on to power. This agenda has led one regional expert, David Wall of Chatham House, to describe the SCO as a &quot;club for autocrats and dictators&quot;. All the same, there are dictators and dictators - and Mr Putin&apos;s numerous recent clashes with western countries, ranging from the missile defence row, the Litvinenko poisoning, opposition to US Black Sea military bases, and Kosovo&apos;s thwarted independence to malfunctioning Estonian computers, mystery bombs in Georgia, and disputed sovereignty over the north pole are making his partners nervous. &quot;As Moscow&apos;s relations with the west deteriorate, the Kremlin is doing its best to seek allies and is building up the SCO to counter-balance Nato. In propaganda terms, Peace Mission 2007 will be used to the full,&quot; said Pavel Felgenhauer in the Eurasia Daily Monitor. &quot;But are the other SCO nations ready to line up against Nato?&quot; No one in the SCO, least of all China with next year&apos;s Beijing Olympics and its trade and development goals potentially in the firing line, seriously wanted confrontation with the west, he argued. &quot;Putin will most likely be left to huff and puff alone.&quot; Mr Putin&apos;s testosterone-fuelled yah-boo politics, if continued by him or his successors, could yet have the very opposite result - a weakening of the Sino-Russian alliance he forged at the outset of his presidency and the stifling of the SCO.

After making such a promising start to the season - he reached two Masters Series semi-finals and a place in the top 10 and there was talk of his joining the elite group chasing Roger Federer - Murray can probably now kiss goodbye to making much impact on the US Open and he has only a slim chance of making the eight-man year-end Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. Although the Scot claims his troublesome wrist is now &quot;100%&quot;, related problems - reduction in power on the forehand drive, reduced court coverage and impaired confidence - have made him acknowledge that &quot;right now obviously it&apos;s not looking great&quot;. The hope was for two or three matches at New Haven to create enough momentum for a reasonably competitive US Open the week afterwards. The suspicion, therefore, is that Murray risked his straight-sets defeats by Fabio Fognini and Marcos Baghdatis because not to have done so after three months out would have damaged morale. Asked whether a decline in his movement had affected the way he constructed points, he said: &quot;That&apos;s just something that I&apos;ve got to get used to for the next month or so - and then hopefully be able to start playing well again.&quot; A month takes him uncomfortably close to the Davis Cup tie against Croatia at Wimbledon on September 21-23, leaving only the European indoor circuit during which to restore some optimism before the season&apos;s end. The British Davis Cup captain, John Lloyd, took the news philosophically. &quot;I once had an elbow injury which, like Andy, made the forehand the worst shot to hit,&quot; he said. &quot;I had to stop for six months because, even though the doctor said it was OK, it was psychologically difficult for me. It takes time to clear that hurdle. But Andy is such a great player and technically so good that, when he feels OK, he will play well again quite quickly. There&apos;s time for him to be ready for the Davis Cup but, if not - hey, these things happen.&quot; Murray&apos;s plight drew sympathy from the French player Richard Gasquet who was out for four months with an injured elbow and missed the 2005 year-end finals but recently reached the top 10. &quot;For Murray it&apos;s hard,&quot; he said. &quot;My first matches after injury were like his. I couldn&apos;t play. Mentally it was difficult, physically impossible. You have to fight every day when you practise and play matches.&quot; Did Murray imagine that in his current state it was difficult for his brother Jamie and his coach, Brad Gilbert, and others to watch him? &quot;I guess so,&quot; he said. &quot;After the start to the year I had, to be in this sort of position is not the easiest thing.&quot; Meanwhile Rafael Nadal, the No2 seed here, withdrew with a left forearm injury when trailing 4-1 in the second set against Argentina&apos;s Juan Monaco, having lost the first on the tie-break.

Earlier this month, Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near a US military base on the Pacific island of Guam, causing US aircraft to be scrambled to track them. The Pentagon said Russian aircraft had not come close enough to US ships for American planes to react.  In a reference to the US, Mr Putin said the halting of long-range bomber flights after the Soviet Union&apos;s collapse had affected Russia&apos;s security because other nations had continued such missions. Around 6,000 troops and hundred of armoured vehicles and fighter jets took part in military manoeuvres in the Urals, watched by Mr Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao. The two men took part in yesterday&apos;s regional summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation along with the leaders of a clutch of former Soviet central Asian republics. The meeting concluded with a thinly veiled warning to the US to keep away from the energy-rich and strategic region.

As well as its full members, Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, Iran, India, Pakistan and Mongolia have signed up as observers in recent years. The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, took advantage of the platform to call US missile defence plans that could include stationing missile interceptors in Europe a threat to central Asia. &quot;These intentions go beyond just one country,&quot; he said. &quot;They are of concern for much of the continent, Asia and SCO members.&quot; Moscow and Beijing have developed what they describe as a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; in the region. Washington supports plans for pipelines that would carry the region&apos;s oil and gas to the west and bypass Russia, while Moscow has pushed strongly to control the export flows.

Crisis over, hedge funds happy again, and normal service restored in stock markets? Don&apos;t count on it just yet. Alan Greenspan, the last chairman of the US Federal Reserve, was famously Delphic but the new boy, Ben Bernanke, completely baffled Wall Street yesterday. At first sight, the cut in the Fed&apos;s discount, or penalty, lending rate looked like a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card for hedge funds and banks who have eaten too many junk mortgages. The Dow Jones soared 300 points at the opening bell. Then the realisation dawned that the Fed&apos;s statement was warning that something worse than a soggy home loan may lie around the corner. &quot;Tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward ... the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably,&quot; said the Fed. The word &quot;appreciably&quot; was a killer. Translated out of central banker-speak, the statement means: there is a risk of the US heading towards recession. That is a complete turnaround in the Fed&apos;s thinking since last month. Then, the need to keep a lid on inflation was top of the agenda. Yesterday it was not mentioned; there were bigger worries. Greenspan would have cut the main interest rate. Bernanke did not, which seemed to be a deliberate effort to tell Wall Street to clear up its own mortgage mess. So Bernanke delivered weak medicine yesterday. Any Fed chairman had to do something because the money markets were close to freezing. Banks had in effect stopped lending to each other, and it had become almost impossible for anybody, even a credit-worthy borrower, to get a mortgage in the US. But a cut in the discount rate is merely a little lubrication for the system. It gives the banks confidence again, but it does not make those junk mortgages any less of a problem. Wall Street may plead for stronger remedies. Economists at Goldman Sachs also performed a giant U-turn in their world outlook yesterday. Instead of steady US interest rates for the rest of this year, they now forecast a cut from 5.25% to 4.5%. When will the first cut arrive? The next scheduled meeting for the Fed&apos;s policy committee is September 18. Bernanke would hate to be pushed into acting before then - it would look as if Wall Street was setting the agenda. But push-and-shove seems likely, even as soon as next week. Some stability has been restored to stock markets, but the currency markets are still wild. The problem is the Japanese yen, everybody&apos;s favourite currency for borrowing because Japanese interest rates are so low. Now, as speculative money is taken off the table, the yen is soaring and many will be on the wrong side of the bet. Then there&apos;s China. The Shanghai stock market is up 75% this year. Can it stay there if there is a risk of a economic downturn in the US, China&apos;s major export market? When Chinese stock markets wobbled in the spring, the effects were felt around the world.

It lasted three months and I stayed on for another 10 days to see Swaziland. The trip surpassed all my expectations - the list of optional activities was incredible. It included things like white-water rafting on the Zambezi and fishing for sharks on Namibia&apos;s Skeleton Coast. You all pitch in, sometimes camping under the stars, buying your food from local markets and cooking together. It&apos;s difficult to pick a highlight. Perhaps it was trekking to see wild gorillas in the Virunga Mountains of Uganda, or watching the sun set over the Serengeti, or being kept awake by the grunting hippos of Lake Naivasha. I&apos;d go back in a heartbeat.  \u00b7 A 90-day tour costs \u00a31,140 plus a local payment of \u00a3640 with Oasis Overland (oasisoverland.co.uk). Optional activities cost extra.

I started in Ecuador and worked my way to the bottom of Argentina via Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile. I then travelled back up to Rio de Janeiro. I was away for about six months and travelled independently. I started with a one-month Spanish course in Ecuador, during which I stayed in a hostel, but I&apos;d recommend staying with a local family, otherwise you end up speaking Spanish for four hours a day and English the rest of the time.  The highlight was trekking to Machu Picchu. You can&apos;t do this independently - you have to go through an accredited company. I paid about \u00a3375 for my trek, which is one of the more expensive options. You can do it for as little as \u00a3100, but people I spoke to who had gone on these trips complained about the hidden costs. I&apos;d love to go back and would happily live in Buenos Aires for a few years. The best piece of advice I can give is don&apos;t be afraid of the unknown. More often that not it turns out to be friendly. I booked a plane ticket and just went. The rest fell into place.  The cost of Jason&apos;s independently organised six-month trip, including airfare, was about \u00a33,500.

My husband was doing some work-related research in Australia. We wanted to hang the trip around that, but also wanted to expose the children to different cultures. The kids would say the highlight was the Galapagos. It was like stepping into a David Attenborough documentary with frigatebirds swooping over our heads to snatch up turtle eggs and sea lions playing with the children in the sea.  For me, though, the highlight was bush camping in the Northern Territory in Australia. We&apos;d never camped properly before, so it was a huge shock. We made friends with another travelling family, and we&apos;d all hike to the creek to wash and swim, and the kids would go charging off to search for cane toads that they could trade for ice creams with the locals.  We nearly didn&apos;t do it because of the hassle of organising camping gear, but it only took one phone call to a crazy fellow in a shed outside Darwin and we had a six-person tent with all the gear and a four-wheel drive within an hour.  We booked most of our South American accommodation in advance using websites such as Trip Advisor. Mostly we stayed in haciendas and cattle ranches, which might have been tricky to organise on the ground. In Australia the best places for families were the tourist parks which have caravan and camping sites as well as cabins.  The children were out of school for three and a half months, but it was a marvellous experience for them.  It was hard at times. We did seem to do a lot more shouting than at home, but we also did a lot more talking. We still have not opened our bank statements. The Australian leg can be done quite cheaply, but the costs mounted up in South America.

I found a panda programme in China through a company called i-to-i, spoke to one of the co-ordinators and paid my deposit there and then. My family were shocked, especially as I had never even flown on my own. My daughter told me to go for it. I was assigned to two pandas, Zing Zing and Chu Chu. Work started at 8am when we cleaned the pens and fed the animals. Then we shadowed the vets on their rounds. In the afternoon we did the same. It may sound boring, but no two days were the same.  The reserve was in the foothills of the Qinling Mountains about an hour from Xi&apos;an, and I and the two other volunteers were the only non-Chinese people in the area. The keepers were all eager to learn English; often their wives and children would come along for lessons, too.  I-to-i provided a house in Xi&apos;an where volunteers from different projects stayed. Although I was probably the oldest there I never felt out of place. In my spare time I visited museums and pagodas. Doing it on my own gave me a sense of achievement and made me more assertive.  \u00b7 Two-week panda conservation excursions with i-to-i (i-to-i.com) cost \u00a31,195 plus \u00a3300 for each additional week.

For most of the time I was the only volunteer, but for the last two weeks of my placement I was joined by two 18-year-old girls on their gap year.  I stayed with the headmaster of the school and his two daughters and felt completely accepted into their family. I am considering going back to do another project in India. I may also head to Romania. The best advice I could give is don&apos;t think about it, just do it. I didn&apos;t want to reach 75, look back and wish I&apos;d done more with my life.  \u00b7 Three-month stay with MondoChallenge (mondochallenge.org) costs \u00a31,200.

Additional information by Benji Lanyado Is volunteering worthwhile? Voluntary Service Overseas has cautioned those who are serious about gap year voluntary work to research carefully before they sign up. &quot;There are many good providers,&quot; says Judith Brodie, director of VSO UK, &quot;but we are concerned about the number of badly planned, spurious schemes that ultimately benefit no one apart from the travel companies that organise them.&quot; So how do you tell a good provider from a bad one? The VSO recommends that gappers ask the following: 1. Will I be given a defined role and purpose? 2. Will I meet face to face with my provider, attend a selection day to assess my suitability for the trip, and gain detailed information on the structure of my placement? 3. Why am I paying for the placement? Where is the money going? 4. Will the work I do be linked to community partnerships that have a lasting impact? How do the volunteers work in partnership with the local community, and does the organisation I am going with have established offices overseas that work in partnership with local people? 5. How will my work be monitored and evaluated so that others can build on what I have done?

Iraqi officials, including oil minister Hussein Shahristani, will attend the gatherings in Dubai in September to meet international oil executives. All the big players will be there, including BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron, as well as minnows such as Addax Petroleum, some of which have operations in Iraq. David Horgan, managing director of Petrel Resources, an Irish explorer with a presence in Iraq since 1999, said: &apos;All the oil companies have been salivating at the prospect of Iraq for years. There is a good chance of very large discoveries. Nowhere else in the world offers that.&apos; Horgan said that once the oil law was passed, oil executives would rush to sign exploration and production deals, despite Iraq&apos;s security situation. Under severe US pressure, the Iraqi administration is now expected to push through the oil law before the end of September. The majors have stayed away from Iraq, which has the world&apos;s third largest oil reserves, because there was no legal framework for investing in its energy sector. Unusually for the Middle East, the oil law will provide generous rates of return and production sharing agreements that allow companies that have had to write down their reserves, such as Shell, to book massive new reserves. Muhammad-Ali Zainy, from the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London, said: &apos;Why do international oil companies rush in to divide the loot at a time when Iraq is submerged in blood? Iraqis will not benefit from this.&apos; Iraq has discovered reserves of 115bn barrels, of which only 40bn barrels have been developed. There are large parts of the country that remain unexplored. Separately, Russia has lobbied successfully to set up an energy cartel which it hopes will rival Opec. At the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Summit in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, leaders of Central Asian countries, China and Russia last week agreed to create a &apos;unified energy market&apos; in the region that is home to some of the biggest producers of oil and gas. Iran&apos;s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made clear at the conference that Tehran was prepared to join the club, which would see the world&apos;s first, second and fourth largest gas producers form a powerful bloc, potentially ranged against Western interests. Christopher Langton, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: &apos;Russia is seeking to have an organisation tilt the competition in its favour.&apos; The move coincides with the apparent decline of US influence in the region, where both the Trans-Caspian pipeline project and the diversion of Turkmen gas via Russia to Europe have stalled.

We love long journeys but have been trying to avoid flying because of the environment. However, I would love to see Japan. We&apos;ve not ruled out cruising, but don&apos;t want to spend ages at sea. We like cities and walking, but Ruth has trouble with her knees if it&apos;s not flat. She&apos;d like to take a balloon ride. We&apos;ve already been to Australia, New Zealand, the US and South Africa, and would like to go for around a month. The budget: \u00a37,000 The solution:  Andy Brabin of Railbookers: &apos;I recommend a rail tour of the Mediterranean, a long trip that keeps their carbon footprint low and encompasses their love of cities. Starting from London, take the Eurostar to Paris, celebrating their anniversary in one of the world&apos;s most romantic cities. Then head south to explore the Cote d&apos;Azur and Monaco. Then head across the Pyrenees to vibrant Barcelona and Madrid, and spend a few days travelling through Spain and Portugal. This itinerary would take approximately 18 days and cost \u00a32900pp including first class rail travel and good quality hotels.&apos; Simon Lloyd of Why Don&apos;t You: &apos;We&apos;d suggest a 10-day Cox and Kings (020 7873 5000; www.coxandkings.co.uk) tour of Japan then a five-day extension to Beijing. You&apos;ll discover modern Tokyo and traditional Kyoto and take trips to the World Heritage site of Nikko, historic Nara, and enjoy an overnight stay in the Hakone National Park beside Mount Fuji. These side trips are by private coach, and walking is minimal. The Beijing tour includes the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square and the Great Wall of China. It would work out at about \u00a33,415pp, staying at a four-star-plus hotel such as the Shangri-La in Beijing, including flights.&apos; Claire Howard-Jones of Ebookers: What better view could there be from a hot air balloon than the glorious Nile and the ancient wonders of Egypt? Visit the Cairo Museum to marvel at the treasures of the ancient pharaohs and the jewel-encrusted mask of Tutankhamen. A trip to Cairo for two weeks in a five-star hotel would cost approximately \u00a34000.

Now our sons have grown up we want some &quot;us&quot; time and I&apos;ve saved annual leave for five years so that the whole of January is free. We love the outdoors, walking, old buildings and gardens plus stunning scenery, but don&apos;t want boats, shopping or lying on beaches. We&apos;re curious to see places such as Death Valley or Niagara Falls, or to do experiences such as the Orient Express.&apos; The budget: Around \u00a34,000, flexible. The solution:  Susan Griffith, author of Gap Years For Grown Ups: &apos;Niagara Falls are not at their best in winter and the landscapes of Death Valley are better seen in spring/summer, when the desert is in bloom. I would suggest a self-drive holiday around Southern California. Joshua Tree National Park is a more rewarding desert, with fascinating flora such as the &apos;jumping&apos; cholla cactus, hummingbirds, and weird eroded rock formations. Los Angeles has the 120-acre Huntington Gardens, and coastal Highway 1 between LA and San Francisco is enchanting on a bright winter&apos;s day.

With 16 period carriages, it features lounges, two restaurant carriages and double and twin-bedded en-suite cabins, all furnished in classic Rajput style, and travels through northwest India&apos;s most spectacular sights. I&apos;d suggest an 11-day itinerary including seven days on the train, plus two nights in Delhi either side, staying at the luxurious Imperial Hotel. The next departure is 7 January and costs from \u00a32,995pp.&apos;  Barry Moxley of Traveltime: &apos;It&apos;s a big first step for someone who&apos;s just conquered her fear of flying, but New Zealand is a trip of a lifetime, with stunning scenery and great weather in January.

I&apos;ve spent a year in India, Nepal and Tibet and a year backpacking through South America. For 20 years I&apos;ve practised a form of massage known as Chua Ka, claiming its heritage from Ghengis Khan&apos;s personal guard, so have a great interest in Mongolia and China. The Big Trip might be the Trans Mongolian/Siberian railway from Beijing to St Petersburg. We&apos;d quite like to see the solar eclipse which will be visible in Central Asia in August next year.&apos; The budget: \u00a33,000 each The solution:  Susan Griffith: &apos;Panoramic Journeys (01608 811183; www.panoramicjourneys.com) offers small group tours to Mongolia that coincide with festivals (Reindeer, Naadam rural games) and involve visiting nomadic families. Next summer they have a two-week itinerary to western Mongolia to include the solar eclipse on 1 August, from \u00a31,595, plus about \u00a3600 for a return flight to Ulaanbaatar on KLM and Mongolian Airways via Moscow. An extension to Beijing brings the cost to \u00a32,395. An alternative would be to volunteer. The New Choice Mongolian Volunteer Organisation in Ulaanbaatar (00 976 1131 4577; www.volunteer.org.mn) arranges short- and long-term placements for volunteers to teach English, renovate buildings, even work in marketing, from \u00a3250 including accommodation with host families.&apos; Barry Moxley from Traveltime: &apos;Explore Worldwide (0870 333 4001; www.explore.co.uk) has the perfect tour to see the eclipse, combined with the new high-altitude Qinghai-Tibet railway. Highlights include Beijing, Lhasa, the world&apos;s highest railway, Xining, Dunhuang&apos;s Buddist shrines and the eclipse in Hami. It leaves on 16 July for 21 nights, including two nights in a tented camp, for \u00a33,049pp including flights.&apos; Simon Lloyd: &apos;The best place to see the solar eclipse will be on the Hexi Corridor, part of the silk route from China to Europe. An eight-night trip operated by Explorers (01276 406877; www.explorers.co.uk/astro/) includes a tour of Shanghai and an internal flight to the desert oasis of Jiuquan. This costs from \u00a31,699pp, including flights and accommodation. There&apos;s an option of a six-night Tibet extension(\u00a3799pp) or a seven-night Yangtze cruise extension (\u00a3869pp).&apos; Andy Brabin: &apos;An InterRail trip around eastern Europe staying in luxury hotels would encompass different cultures and countries as well as beautiful scenery. Take the Eurostar from London to Berlin and then on to Poland to explore Warsaw and Krakow. Hop on the train to Budapest and relax in one of the thermal baths, before a cultural tour of Vienna and a stop-off in Zurich. A 17-night trip would cost around \u00a32900 per person.&apos; The hobby hunters &apos;We want to learn new activities in the sun&apos; Irene Nigol, 61, and husband Timo, 62, have both retired from careers in education. They live in London The brief: &apos;We fancy escaping for a week or so on a beginners&apos; ballroom or Latin dancing holiday in the sun,&apos; says Irene. &apos;We&apos;ve started classes and want to hasten our improvement. We are also gym enthusiasts and enjoy Pilates and yoga, but will give anything a go. We&apos;re quite outdoorsy and would like to do some snorkelling. Timo has just climbed his first Munro and we like walking. We&apos;re free to go anywhere any time from September, so it makes sense to travel off-peak to get value for money.&apos;  The budget: \u00a33,000 The solution:  Susan Griffith: &apos;Tango in Argentina or salsa in Cuba would fit the bill, with watersports or Spanish lessons thrown in. Buenos Aires is awash with the dance, and expert practitioners and amateurs perform in the streets and at milongas (tango dance halls). The website www.tangodata.com.ar lists 22 schools in the city. Caledonia Languages Abroad (01316 217721; www.caledonialanguages.co.uk) offers Spanish lessons and tango courses starting at \u00a3275 a week including B&amp;B. Low-season flights (October/November) to Buenos Aires cost about \u00a3550, so Irene and Timo could live like kings. Caledonia&apos;s holidays in Cuba could include salsa and Spanish classes in Santiago de Cuba, a walk in the Sierra Maestra mountains following Castro&apos;s revolutionary trail and relaxation and snorkelling time. Prices combining homestay accommodation and hotels would be on budget. They might also be attracted to the tango workshops in various countries run by TangoZen (www.tangozen.com).&apos; Adam Hanmer from Gapyearforgrownups.co.uk: &apos;Costa Rica fits the bill. On our &quot;Latin Dance and Spanish&quot; programme, you spend Monday to Thursday mornings learning Spanish at an academy in the capital, San Jose, followed by afternoons of Latin dance in an internationally renowned dance school, learning salsa, cha-cha-cha, cumbia, merengue and bolero with the best local talent and professional Costa Rican instructors. Friday, Saturday and Sundays are free to explore, go white-water rafting, take jungle canopy walks or volcano treks, and go snorkelling in the Pacific and Caribbean. It costs from \u00a3599 for two weeks, or \u00a31,049 for four. Flights from Heathrow would cost around \u00a3600 in low-season.&apos; Simon Lloyd: &apos;If Irene and Timo would like to indulge their sporty side, with lots of opportunities for yoga, Pilates, walking, snorkelling and working out in the Caribbean sunshine, the BodyHoliday at LeSport in St Lucia could be just the ticket.

I&apos;m not afraid to go alone as my partner is not in a position to retire with me and does not have the same longing to see places. He is very happy for me to go without him. I want to incorporate a trip around the world with volunteer work in India, Vietnam and South Africa. I want to make my budget last as long as possible.&apos; The budget: \u00a35,000 The solution:  Susan Griffith: &apos;For her chosen destinations, a round-the-world fare is probably not the most suitable. However, through long-haul flight specialist Travel Nation (www.travel-nation.co.uk) she could achieve her wish list for \u00a31,095: Manchester-Johannesburg on Emirates, Jo&apos;burg-Mumbai on South African Airways, Mumbai-Hanoi via Kuala Lumpur on Malaysia Airlines, a short hop to Bangkok and then home. Suggested agencies that match volunteers with grassroots projects in India include Delhi-based iVolunteer (www.ivolunteer.org.in) whose modest arrangement fee is \u00a3250 for up to six months, and living expenses in rural India should not exceed \u00a35 a day. For Vietnam, Bangkok-based Travel-to-Teach (www.travel-to-teach.org) arranges teaching placements plus accommodation costing from \u00a3420 for four weeks to \u00a3980 for 24 weeks. In Cape Town, volunteer placements working with children or animals can be arranged by Aviva (00 27 21 557 4312; www.aviva-sa.com) for about \u00a31,700 for 12 weeks. Sue&apos;s craving for adventure is bound to be appeased.&apos; Simon Lloyd:  &apos;By volunteering with the organisation Global Vision International (www.gvi.co.uk), Sue could join a street children programme in Goa (eight weeks from \u00a31,455, without flights) or volunteer on a Wildlife Research Expedition in South Africa; a five-week project costs around \u00a31,595. Then there are a number of I-to-I (www.i-to-i.com) projects in Vietnam, including community work at a charity cooking house in Ho Chi Minh City, which costs around \u00a31,245 for six weeks. I&apos;d recommend that Sue buys a round-the-world ticket for around \u00a31,200. In total, a 19-week volunteer trip with flights would cost about \u00a35,595 and Sue could stay on longer in these destinations to explore at leisure.&apos; Adam Hanmer: &apos;Volunteering in South Africa with one of our community projects is a brilliant way to see the way of life, with free time to explore. After that, she can spend one to two months getting to know India, doing teaching, child care or working in an orphanage, interspersed with visits to India&apos;s sights. Then she can join our Vietnam Experience programme, which combines sightseeing, volunteering and hill tribe and colonial culture. All this would be with the safety of a group and cost from \u00a34,799 including flights.&apos; The experts Susan Griffith is the author of Gap Years For Grown Ups, published by Crimson Publishing (www.crimsonpublishing.co.uk).

Above his head is a sign in Chinese characters. In translation, the sign reads: &apos;Mr Yang. The man who found the Terracotta Army&apos;. Mr Yang, a thin, weathered man in his seventies, was an accidental archaeologist. His smile suggests that he still can hardly believe his luck. Yang was a farmer on the grey plains outside Xian, the ancient capital of China. Legend had long had it that ghosts inhabited the dry soil on which he worked. One day, in March 1974, when digging for a well, Yang came face to face with one of these ghosts: a clay soldier that had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years. He and three other farmers had chanced upon the entrance to a huge vault, which was eventually discovered to contain more than 6,000 such figures and which provided an unprecedented insight into the genesis of the Chinese nation. The warriors were part of the vast burial site of the first Chinese Emperor Qin (pronounced &apos;Chin&apos;) Shihuang, who had united six warring states into one territory that he ruled for 11 years from 221 BC. Those years of the First Emperor are the subject of a landmark exhibition at the British Museum that opens next month. The exhibition will display 120 treasures from the Xian mausoleum site, including a dozen lifesize statues of warriors, as well as others of recently discovered acrobats, musicians and entertainers. The treasures arrived in London last week to be prepared for display in the museum&apos;s Reading Room. The loan of the figures - the largest number ever to have left Xian - has been discussed for several years. The final agreement was signed last July by Tony Blair in the Forbidden City on his trade mission to Beijing. The agreement had been brokered by Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum. Earlier this year, I went with a group led by MacGregor and the curator of the exhibition, Jane Portal, to visit the Xian site, where final decisions were being made about the exact figures to be dispatched. On the way there, I&apos;d wondered why such care was taken over which particular warriors might be sent. When I was first confronted by the pottery battalions at Xian, I quickly began to see the problem. Far from being a faceless identikit horde, each clay figure wears a unique expression. Though body parts were moulded and mass-produced to a number of different designs, the faces and finish of each warrior in the vast silent army are entirely singular. There are differences in age and rank; some smile, some look careworn; there are grimaces of concentration, looks of arrogance. The original figures were painted in bright blues and reds, but that colour has gone and a dusty clay now reinforces the idea of the soldiers having emerged from the grave into the flat morning light of the covered hangar, standing in readiness in columns divided by the banks of earth from which they came. There are four pits, each traversed by walkways. One shows the area as it was discovered, the warriors still interred in earth tunnels; another, smaller pit seems to represent a nerve centre: special troops, high command and charioteers; in the main pit, some figures are as they were found in 1974, fragments of heads and armour; many more - about 1,000 - have been painstakingly jigsawed together and restored to their original form. The effect is magical. The detail of hair braids, belt buckles and shoe treads survives intact. Hollow lifesize horses display an anatomical correctness that would satisfy Stubbs. Other sectors of Qin society have also subsequently been unearthed - pottery bureaucrats and moulded musicians, as well as exquisitely tooled bronze chariots and wagons, redolent of an imperial life of opulence and lightness, a contrast to the massed martial might of the warriors. Neil MacGregor spends all his working days surrounded by glories of ancient worlds, but he could not hide his awe at the scale and ambition of this place. &apos;I assumed they would be legions of identical soldiers, but when you realise that they all were given individual characters and that together they make up a whole newly created nation, it becomes something extraordinarily different. No culture ever individuated ordinary people in this way. The Egyptians might have been at pains to give faces to the pharaohs but the mass of people were just that, a mass. &apos;In Britain, we do not begin to show difference in common people until well into the Middle Ages and yet here is a monument that has taken great pains to express individual identity in ordinary soldiers, each one representing a different region or ethnicity, 2,200 years ago. It challenges our notion of China, about our stereotypes of the country as a single body of people. Here is evidence from the very beginning of the culture that they were deeply interested in individuals.&apos; The pit of warriors is only the beginning of what might be at Xian. After leaving the museum, we drove a mile to a hill in the shape of a flattened pyramid that stands out from the surrounding scrub farmland. The great, grassy mound is the tomb of Qin Shihuang. You can walk to the top and begin to see the scale of the original necropolis. You can also begin to imagine what lies beneath the mound itself. According to Chinese historian Sima Qian, writing a century after Qin&apos;s death, the tomb of the First Emperor was created as an underground microcosm of China. The rivers and seas of the new empire were made in mercury and flowed beneath a representative heaven. The emperor was laid at the centre of this subterranean fantasy in a bronze coffin surrounded by unknown treasures. Standing on the hill, you cannot help feeling there is a very Chinese pace to the excavation of this place. In any other country, the temptation to dig here would be hard to resist. The Chinese have no such plans. For a start, this is a tomb and issues of desecration arise. More importantly, archaeologists here believe they don&apos;t have the expertise to guarantee they could preserve all that might be uncovered; until they do, the official line is that it will be safer to leave the tomb undisturbed. Given the rate of change in China, it will be instructive to see if this policy is sustained. Tourist dollars are already boosting the Chinese economy; the idea that they may have the most significant archaeological site in the world unexcavated may prove harder to resist. It would be like discovering Camelot and not being curious to find the Round Table. There is a serenity to the place, but one which it hardly deserves. The tomb was commissioned by the Qin emperor at the height of his autocratic power. He had dreams of immortality; in the last years of his life - he died at 50 - he sought elixirs and ingested large quantities of mercury that exaggerated his megalomania. According to Sima Qian, 700,000 men were press-ganged to construct this mausoleum - a profound attempt to take the empire to the grave - and many were apparently buried alive within its confines to preserve its secrets. Some of these secrets will be on display in London. Unlike previous exhibitions, which have tended to focus on the warriors themselves, the British Museum has set itself the challenge of understanding more about the extraordinary man behind the army. This is a fashionable line of inquiry among Chinese scholars. Most of what is known of Qin Shihuang comes from accounts of his brutality from the succeeding Han empire, which, 20 years after his death, swept his successor from office and rewrote the empire&apos;s early history. Since Qin had sought to purge the state of Confucian scholars, it is suggested they sought revenge in their accounts of him. Some of the more extreme instances of Qin&apos;s mania for power - infamous stories of his ordering a mountain to be deforested and painted red as an act of retribution against the mountain god, say - might be viewed as products of this posthumous anti-propaganda. What is certain is that after the empire had been established through the efforts of his brutal army, Qin achieved an extraordinary amount in his brief decade of imperial rule. He unified the Chinese writing system, established a standard legal code and common weights and measures and oversaw the creation of a bureaucracy based on examined merit. He also conscripted hundreds of thousands of men in the construction of the defence system that became the Great Wall. Historians now speculate that this monumental task was part of a symbolic effort to unite the new empire against a common enemy rather than any strategic military project: the barbarians from across the mountains - who never came - were widely depicted as monstrous, dragon-toothed warriors. From the beginning, the wall was perhaps not there to defend the Chinese from the outside world but to unite them against it. Qin Shihuang also pursued this goal by controlling information. He was, by all surviving accounts, among the most dedicated of book burners. The traditional role of scholars had been to measure the nation&apos;s rulers against Confucian ideals. Qin was an early believer in Year Zero. Libraries were torched and scholars apparently buried alive. Ever since, as a result of these recorded horrors, the First Emperor has mostly been seen as a figure of revulsion for the Chinese. It was Mao who began to revise this historical view. Not surprisingly, he saw in the reign of Qin the revolutionary portents of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. &apos;Qin Shihuang buried 460 scholars alive; we have buried 46,000 scholars alive,&apos; he once announced. &apos;You [intellectuals] revile us for being Qin Shihuangs. You are wrong. We have surpassed Qin Shihuang a hundredfold.&apos; In 1973, the year before the tomb was discovered at Xian, Mao wrote a poem in praise of China&apos;s original demagogue: Please don&apos;t slander Emperor Qin Shihuang, Sir/ For the burning of the books should be thought through again./ Our ancestral dragon, though dead, lives on in spirit,/ While Confucius, though renowned, was really no one./ The Qin order has survived from age to age...&apos; Though not celebrating him in such terms, this reappraisal of Qin&apos;s reputation has continued in the decades since Mao&apos;s death. China&apos;s new confident nationalism has prompted a surge of interest in the Qin empire. The nation&apos;s foremost composer Tan Dun premiered his opera The First Emperor at the Met in New York last year with Placido Domingo singing the role. The opera depicted the contradictions of a man who used his brutal centralised power for the common good. This theme was also picked up by Zhang Yimou, China&apos;s best-known director, whose films Raise the Red Lantern and To Live had been banned in his home country. Far from exciting the attentions of Beijing&apos;s censors, however, Hero, his biopic of the First Emperor, was submitted by the authorities as China&apos;s nominee for best foreign film at the Academy Awards. In Yimou&apos;s reading, Qin was a sophisticated and inspired leader driven to acts of terror by a realisation of the need to bring to China the stability necessary to create a great civilisation. This seems to have played well with the current forces of order. Yimou&apos;s most recent films promote China&apos;s hosting of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the successful bid to stage the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. It is widely believed in Beijing that these two events will mark the full emergence of the new China on the world stage. Such cultural exchanges as the one agreed with the British Museum are part of the soft diplomacy of this strategy. It is a two-way process. While we were in China, Neil MacGregor opened a reciprocal exhibition in the Forbidden City of objects loaned from the British Museum, exploring the intellectual origins of the British empire, entitled Britain Meets the World. The exhibition played well to the current Chinese obsession with &apos;benign&apos; expansion. While we were in China, there was much talk of a recent official television series called The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, a history of the world&apos;s great trading empires since the 15th century. The programme that had apparently fascinated the Chinese most was devoted to how the British achieved industrialisation, and how it shared - and imposed - its culture in the world. The series ended, pointedly, with the rise and fall of the United States, the unspoken conclusion being that the economic superpower in waiting was Chinese. MacGregor has been fascinated to see at close quarters the Chinese beginning to open up to the world. It had initially been hard, he suggested, even to describe the concept of the British Museum to the Chinese, its role as a storehouse of global memory. &apos;It is,&apos; he told me, &apos;an alien concept for the Chinese to have a museum that houses the whole world. Their museums only have Chinese objects in them. Their universities only study Chinese history. They want that to change.&apos; And very quickly by Chinese standards. Young curators, for example, have been sent to the British Museum to learn from its example. In readiness for its envisaged new role in the world, China is suddenly extremely anxious to assimilate and engage with cultures beyond Qin&apos;s wall. You could see the arrival of the wonderful warriors in London this autumn as an advanced raiding party of this desire. (The last time they were loaned out was to Taiwan, where, having failed so far at traditional diplomacy, it was claimed China was now practising &apos;terracotta diplomacy&apos;.) Whatever the motivation for their presence here, however, they come very much in a spirit of accord and they are a spectacle not to be missed.  Building the terracotta army 5th-3rd century BC China&apos;s ruling Zhou dynasty&apos;s power crumbles and the empire fragments. Seven major states emerge. 361-338 BC Qin statesman Shang Yang transforms Qin into the most dominant state. 247 BC  A 13-year-old Qin Shihuang takes the throne of Qin. He rules under a regent until 238 BC, when he assumes full power. 246 BC Construction of Qin Shihuang&apos;s mausoleum containing the Terracotta Army begins. 230-221 BC  Qin armies conquer each of the six other Chinese states. After his final victory, Qin Shihuang becomes the First Emperor. 210-202 BC  Qin Shihuang dies and is buried in his mausoleum. His son Qin Er Shi&apos;s grip over the empire quickly weakens, and the Han dynasty takes control. 1974  The terracotta army is unearthed near Xian by farmers.  \u00b7 The First Emperor: China&apos;s Terracotta Army, British Museum, London WC1, 13 Sep-6 Apr 2008.

More dying.&apos;) I used to think it was fairly cynical and perhaps a little sad to be sent those Christmas cards you got from Indian restaurants where, in June, you&apos;d left your business card in a glass bowl beside the lunchtime till and the mints: cynical on their part, perhaps a little sad on mine, especially to have pushed my parent&apos;s card off the top of the telly to make way for it. But, compared with the savage screw-you caustic computerised greed dressed as affable acquaintanceship of this new net stuff - and, by the way, if there&apos;s any piece of information more convincing of the hoo-buttock bawheeney surrounding it all than the news that Jimmy Carr apparently has 6,712 digital &apos;friends&apos;, then I&apos;d dearly like to hear it - compared with all this, I will fall upon the coming December&apos;s missive from the (rather fine) Gulshan Tandoori as on a smuggled note from some long-lost adored brother. But I remember mostly, at the moment, getting the cold sore, because it is on my mind - not literally, that would be a truly new medical phenomenon, albeit a weirdly cohesive explanation for the continuing behaviour of the head of security for BAA. Cold sores are horrid things. And they divide us. Like jazz, but significantly less pleasing if equally throbby, a cold sore is something you either get or don&apos;t. Those of you out there who get them know. For the rest of you: this is what happens. At the age of 14, or similar, some poor future innocent victim will have been given a well-intentioned smidgeon of a kiss by an aged aunt. The herpes simplex virus passes into your system, forever and will do no damage whatsoever other than, two or three times a year, deciding out of sheer viral merriment to plip back down your nervous system, and for the next 11 days it will ruin your entire life. First, the tingle. You&apos;re in the middle of chatting, and you take a sip of something or lick chocolate off your lips and - aww, NO. It&apos;s not that it&apos;s sore. But it will, undoubtedly, make you less than fabulously attractive. And it&apos;s so undeserved. Those who don&apos;t get them think that you, you with the scabby raw-sore bleeding blister-lip, have quite obviously just spent a month in some cheap Shanghai whorehouse, snogging the floor and licking rats&apos; skanky bottoms. This is so far from fair it angers me. The best, best people get them. It is a little-known fact that Saint Gudrun the Fabulously Chaste eventually died in 1407 from a cold sore so large it ended up blocking the light from one whole early window in Rheims Cathedral. Not her fault. Not mine either. I will do what I can: buy Zovirax. I&apos;m not sure if it works other than by being so expensive that it feels like putting gold leaf on your lips, and thereby stops you for financial if for no other reasons from continually howking and jabbing away at the tingle and then the scab, and goodness I do hope you&apos;re well beyond your breakfast. This is what we do: all we can do. As for the rest of you, the blessedly unaffected, trust us. It is unsightly and a little unfortunate; it is not the tattooed devil-mark of Sir Crab McFilth. You can still kiss us. If you still want to kiss the kind of person stupid enough to realise only in the last sentence, rather gulp-suddenly, that, in the grand schemes of love, this is perhaps not quite the wisest column that has ever been committed to print.  euan.ferguson.co.uk", "tags": ["Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-19T22:51:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/19/tvpickoftheweek.television", "sentences": ["I spilt my cuppa because even as Fry got it wrong (Beijing), I got it right (Shanghai)."], "title": "Kathryn Flett: When Daddy is the Devil", "article": "What she watched: Forgiven C4 Enemies of reason C4 Stephen Fry: 50 not out BBC4 For the most part, my heart is consumed by quicksand whenever the word &apos;drama&apos; is hitched to &apos;child abuse&apos;. I feel as though I have watched every permutation on this miserable theme and then some, and it&apos;s rarely either edifying or insightful, especially in the context of a police procedural starring Robson Green. While we are all aware by now that paedophiles are drama&apos;s current modish bogeyman signifiers, the way serial killers used to be, or zombies and vampires before them, I&apos;m also not particularly keen on the idea of kids playing &apos;abused&apos; - I always find myself wondering why their parents want them to do it, and then asking myself how a director works with them to make it happen, as if life isn&apos;t weird enough for even the most sophisticated modern kids with screen-struck mums and a few years of Stagecoach under their belts. So obviously I wasn&apos;t much looking forward to Forgiven (C4), despite the estimable presence of Lucy Cohu - one of those rare actresses whose talent has either flowered, or maybe simply been recognised, in her mid-thirties, though obviously the fact that she&apos;s also a beauty who could pass for 30 won&apos;t have hindered her progress. Liz (Cohu) and Stephen (Derek Riddell) were a regular happily married (for 18 years) middle-class couple with a pair of daughters, the eldest of whom, Sophie, was 10. Aside from the fact that Stephen&apos;s job - never given a title, a context or an employer - involved monitoring internet child pornography, this was a wholly unremarkable family - until the night Sophie came downstairs in tears, hugged mummy and indicated that daddy had done something wrong and she wanted it to stop. Normally this would be the point where I&apos;d sigh, hit the pause button, look at my watch and stick the kettle on, but I hadn&apos;t counted on Cohu&apos;s response being quite such an astounding piece of acting. In the space of a couple of minutes she made the terrible and entirely convincing journey from the sort of slightly distracted &apos;there there, darling!&apos; mummy-by-numbers stuff that women apply daily to the soothing of grazed knees, temperatures and tiffs with playmates to the agonised, panic-stricken, enraged lioness response of a woman understanding that Daddy hadn&apos;t simply stepped out of line with an angry word or a smack but was in fact a wicked stranger who had betrayed his entire family. These scenes were brilliant and brutal and ensured I&apos;d go the distance, but I hadn&apos;t - being a woman - banked on Stephen&apos;s own journey being quite as compelling as Liz&apos;s. Riddell (an actor who might reasonably be described as underrated were it not for the fact that he works constantly, equally comfortable in police stations and period drawing rooms) had the wholly unenviable (but presumably deliciously professionally challenging) task of making us care about him, when instead of being banished from the storyline he became its focus. The clue is in the title: Stephen was forgiven, both by his wife and daughter and eventually himself, but only after he&apos;d worked through his dislocation, repressed anger, total denial and self-pity - a performance from Riddell every bit the equal of Cohu&apos;s, albeit cooler and less flashy. Being based on a true story and the testimonies of real people gave Forgiven a great deal of dramatic veracity, while the possibility of Stephen&apos;s redemption cast a long grey shadow over an issue usually dealt with on television in black and white: Liz loved Stephen, and she carried on loving him while also struggling to understand how he could destroy his family - and at the same time his daughter missed not her abuser, but her father. For most women, I suspect, the love would have died just as the rage surfaced, and indeed the possibility that the two could (can, do?) co-exist in some people&apos;s relationships is unfathomable to me. When, after prison and a residential rehabilitation, Stephen returned to his family, I didn&apos;t know whether to be delighted or appalled, in awe of Liz&apos;s generosity of spirit or depressed by her neediness. But then I have never been happily married for 18 years, which doubtless explains it. With performances of quite awesome range and intensity, Forgiven told a story that entirely challenged my preconceptions - not only about child abuse, but about love and marriage, which takes some doing. I would have liked to be able to say that Richard Dawkins challenged a few big, important preconceptions during his documentary Enemies of Reason (C4), but he didn&apos;t. Was the author of The God Delusion ever likely to take anything other than an unbendingly dismissive approach to what he described as &apos;superstition&apos; - namely everything from astrology to dowsing to spiritualism (which, as belief systems, are in point of fact about as closely allied as Judaism is with Islam, but no matter)? For Dawkins it&apos;s all just &apos;a multi-million-pound industry that impoverishes our culture... [and] profoundly undermines civilisation&apos;. I don&apos;t entirely disagree with Dawkins that &apos;science frees us up from suspicion and dogma&apos; but it rather depends how you define suspicion and dogma. I personally think the Prof&apos;s own patronisingly dismissive approach to anybody who expresses an interest in anything beyond what can be measured or understood empirically (&apos;unthinkingly indulging unscientific delusion&apos;) may verge on the dogmatic, but what do I know? Hell (not that it exists, obviously), I read Fritjof Capra&apos;s The Tao of Physics at a very impressionable age and still remain infinitely more excited and emotionally engaged - a terribly anti-intellectual state of affairs - by the ideas of an author who can dedicate a book to both Krishnamurti and Werner Heisenberg, rather than somebody who would choose one or the other. And hats off, too, to The Observer&apos;s own astrologer, Neil Spencer (pretty intellectual, as it happens, for someone who trades in &apos;a primitive belief system made into elaborate pseudo-science&apos;), who was, typically, generous enough not to say &apos;sod off, what&apos;s in it for me?&apos; when Dawkins came calling, given it was fairly obvious the Prof wasn&apos;t about to be converted. It&apos;s undeniably good telly watching spiritualist mediums floundering under the weight of an intellectual onslaught from Dawkins, but does it add anything to our understanding of the human condition? Well, probably about as much as Wife Swap does, really, given that this was, in its own way, just as formatted a documentary (and made by the some company, RDF). In my experience, pitting two diametrically opposed belief systems against each other doesn&apos;t tend to make you come down in favour of one, merely helping you to recognise that they&apos;re both as beautifully, beguilingly and fascinatingly flawed as each other. Finally, a word in the Dawkins shell-like for future TV appearances: intellectual arrogance is a terribly unattractive quality in a man, particularly one allegedly clever enough to know better. Professor Dawkins dismissed out of hand everybody he came into contact with but eventually came closest to giving the time of day to the sociologist Steve Fuller of Warwick University - Professor Steve Fuller, that is. Dawkins would do well to take lessons in how to deploy a formidable intellect while still ensuring everybody adores you from Stephen Fry - the People&apos;s Professor, if I may - whose half-century has been celebrated by a BBC4 love-in this weekend. In Stephen Fry: 50 Not Out, you could feel the love oozing from the screen as Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson, Richard Curtis, John Sessions, Ben Elton, Michael Parkinson... (on and on went the talking-head tsunami of brilliant and/or beloved Brits) acknowledged the national treasure status of a man whose enormous brain may in fact not be quite as big as his heart. In the career analysis of the world&apos;s greatest living Englishman, from the Footlights Revue to Kingdom, via Fry and Laurie, Blackadder, Wilde and QI, there were, however, a couple of regrettable omissions: no mention, for example, of Fry&apos;s narrative contribution to Pocoyo (CITV), an animated series about a little boy whose best friends include a pink ballet-dancing elephant, which is easily the best thing on TV at 6.30am. And no mention either of one of last week&apos;s most shocking moments, in which it was revealed that Fry may not, in fact, know everything in the world during the celebrity edition of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? in which, as Martine McCutcheon and Louis Walsh&apos;s phone-a-friend, Fry failed to answer the question (the city in which China held its first Formula One Grand Prix) correctly. I spilt my cuppa because even as Fry got it wrong (Beijing), I got it right (Shanghai). Apparently, he&apos;s a terrible singer and dancer and rubbish at cricket, too. Who woulda thunk it?  The pleasure of national treasure After Stephen Fry: 50 Not Out, a colon in a programme title may signify the presence of a National Treasure. In Robbie Coltrane: B-Road Britain (ITV1) the beloved entertainer drove around in a vintage Jag, dropping in on some off-the-beaten-track Britishness. There&apos;s been a lot of telly celebrating the coasts/views/mountains/architecture of our isle this summer, and, not having had a holiday, I&apos;d quite like to be on the sofa celebrating the coasts/views/mountains/architecture of just about anywhere else, frankly. Then I watch and melt: bloody gorgeous, Britain, innit? Like Fry, Coltrane has the ability to appear interested in everybody he meets. It rubs off. I didn&apos;t think I gave a monkey&apos;s about wing-walking in the vale of Evesham, stonemasonry in the Cotswolds, shoe-making in Northamptonshire or tiddly-winks in Cambridge, but what a leisurely treat it was in the company of a Treasure.

Stephen Fry: Guilty (BBC4). Photograph: Steve Forrest / Rex Features Abba, Howards&apos; Way, Wagner, hitting Hugh Laurie, darts, swearing, Delia Smith, gibberish, poetry, Led Zeppelin, Countdown, Farley&apos;s Rusks ... it&apos;s not a bad list is it? If you had to guess whose guilty pleasures these were, you&apos;d think about it for about three seconds, then you&apos;d guess right, even without the obvious Hugh Laurie clue. Because it&apos;s such a bloody good list, one whose compiler is clearly both very clever and very silly; someone who appreciates fine things and nonsense; who enjoys exultant joy and loud noise, but also quiet reflection. It&apos;s quite clearly someone who is Stephen Fry. There&apos;s a lot of him about at the moment, on account of it being his 50th birthday. Mostly what we&apos;re getting is other people telling us how brilliant and splendid Fry is, which for anyone else would be sickening hagiography, but for him it just seems right. There&apos;s something about Stephen Fry that makes it impossible not to like him. Sure, he&apos;s a smartarse, but he&apos;s not smug. He knows absolutely everything (except, as he miserably demonstrated when he was Martine McCutcheon&apos;s phone-a-friend on Celebrity Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, that China&apos;s first formula one took place in Shanghai and not Beijing). He knows how to act, and direct, write poems, and novels, and how to do jokes. But he also enjoys punching Hugh Laurie in the face. Plus he likes Howards&apos; Way and Abba. And whereas with famous clever people, you&apos;d know they were pretending to like Abba and Howards&apos; Way to make out how much like normal people they were, and to show how broad their interests were, with Fry you actually believe it. He probably jumps about on his bed with his hairbrush, singing Waterloo. Even the finishing touches seem to have been designed to make us like him more. If he was a chiselled hunk, we&apos;d obviously hate him. But he has a wonky nose. And manic depression! It&apos;s too perfect. Oh dear, this has definitely turned into sickening hagiography. Anyway, of all the Friary over the weekend, Stephen Fry: Guilty (Saturday, BBC4) was the best. It&apos;s basically him talking about his indulgences, his pleasures, so it&apos;s the opposite of Room 101. And that&apos;s something else about this man - he&apos;s nice about things, when with that brain he could be seriously nasty. It&apos;s not just a great list - Fry is pretty good at explaining it, too. Take swearing. &quot;The sort of twee person who thinks swearing is in any way a sign of a lack of education or of a lack of verbal interest is just fucking lunatic,&quot; he says. &quot;Or they say, &apos;It&apos;s not necessary.&apos; As if that should stop one doing it. Things not being necessary is what makes life interesting.&quot; How right is that? Absofuckinglutely right. But this has gone beyond sickening hagiography towards deranged hero worship. Enough. There was plenty of deranged hero worship in The Truth About Boy Bands (Saturday, ITV1), not from me, thankfully, but from screaming teenage girls. They&apos;re screaming at Take That mostly, but also at East 17, Boyzone, NSYNC etc. And they&apos;re not screaming because of what they sound like, they&apos;re screaming because they&apos;re cute. There were no Take Thatters, they&apos;re probably too busy trying to get rescreamed at. But former Take That manager Nigel Martin-Smith turned up, still bitching about being better than East 17. And Donny Osmond was there, looking both weirdly young and very slightly embalmed. When I went to Moscow I went to see Lenin in his tomb, and Donny looks a bit like that. He must have had something done, being, as he is, 86. Celebrity Big Brother&apos;s Jermaine Jackson, also here, looks like he&apos;s been done, too. Baby Spice narrated. Lovely. Jack Osbourne: Adrenaline Junkie (Saturday, ITV2) is back, but with a difference. He&apos;s already brought himself back from the brink, saved himself by doing a spot of abseiling. Now, unselfishly, he&apos;s doing the same for others: saving six young people who are in danger of going off the rails, or have already done so, by making them walk over a tightrope in New Zealand - literally trying to keep them on the straight and narrow. Basically, Jack is Jesus Christ now, which is very nice of him. But I&apos;m a bit bored of him.

Both Putin&apos;s statement and the SCO&apos;s war games were unprecedented. The Kremlin had stopped long-range nuclear bomber flights in 1992. &quot;Unfortunately not everybody followed suit,&quot; said Putin. &quot;This creates a strategic risk for Russia.&quot; It was as yet another unmistakable sign of the Kremlin&apos;s growing confidence. Since its establishment in 1996, at Beijing&apos;s behest, chiefly to settle border problems between China and its post-Soviet neighbours - Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan - the SCO had come a long way. Three years later it extended its membership to Uzbekistan even though it does not share common frontiers with China or Russia, the two countries at its core. The regional organisation expanded its mission to countering drug-smuggling and terrorism. This down-to-earth mission did not inhibit the SCO&apos;s co-leaders, China and Russia, from developing a conceptual doctrine to underscore the fledgling multi-national organisation. At its summit in August 1999 Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin expressed their belief in a multi-polar world - a concept at variance with the &quot;sole superpower&quot; status of the United States. In the diplomatic arena, Beijing and Moscow found their interests converging in central Asia. They shared the common aims of curbing Islamist extremism, maintaining and improving their commercial interests, and frustrating Washington&apos;s agenda to dominate the region which had been an integral part of the Soviet Union for three generations. In 2003, the SCO broadened its scope by including regional economic cooperation in its charter. This was shorthand for keeping American and other western oil corporations out of central Asia, an aim Russia and China shared. Then they raised the ante. At the SCO&apos;s annual summit in July 2005, they called on Washington to name the date of its withdrawal of soldiers and military hardware from its bases in Karshi-Khanabad in Uzbekistan and Manas in Kyrgyzstan which it had acquired on the eve of the Afghanistan War in October 2001. Soon after, Uzbekistan, miffed at Washington&apos;s criticism of its human rights violations, terminated the Pentagon&apos;s lease of its Karshi-Khanabad base. To widen its influence, in 2005, the SCO granted observer status not only to India and Pakistan (sharing frontiers with China), and Mongolia (adjoining both China and Russia) but also Iran since it shares fluvial border with Russia and Kazakhstan in the Caspian Sea. At the same time the SCO snubbed the Bush administration by rejecting its application for an observer status for the United States, ostensibly due to America&apos;s lack of common borders with China or Russia. Washington&apos;s argument that it enjoyed an observer status at the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) even though America does not abut any of its members fell on deaf ears at the SCO secretariat in Shanghai. The SCO&apos;s message to America was plain: &quot;stay out&quot;. Equally plain was the fact that the US was not prepared to share its belief in a multi-polar world order - reiterated in the final communique of the latest SCO summit in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek: &quot;Modern challenges and security threats can only be effectively countered through united efforts of the international community&quot;. To stress the growing convergence of SCO members&apos; interests, the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that the Pentagon&apos;s planned extension of its missile shield into Poland and the Czech Republic was &quot;a threat to more than one country&quot;, and that it would affect &quot;a large part of Asia and SCO members.&quot; His statement went down particularly well with Putin, fiercely opposed to the Pentagon&apos;s project as he is. Along with India and Pakistan, Iran has applied for full membership of the SCO. Once their applications are accepted, the expanded organisation will represent half of the world&apos;s population. Given this, it is hard to dispute the claim made by Ednan Karabayev, the Kyrgyz foreign minister, that &quot;The SCO is destined to play a vital role in ensuring international security.&quot; Thus, despite America&apos;s strong disapproval, a multi-polar global order is emerging - slowly but surely.", "tags": ["Russia", "US news", "George Bush", "China", "Iran", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-20T19:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/22/china", "sentences": ["The People&apos;s Bank of China increased the lending rate by 18 basis points (0.18 percentage points) to 7.2% arguing there was a need to &quot;reasonably control credit growth and to stabilise inflationary expectations&quot; but the move was also clearly designed to stall the continuing stampede into the red-hot Shanghai stock market.", "Raw materials such as tin and nickel have reached record levels this year while stocks traded on the Shanghai exchange have risen by 85% during 2007 and put on 30% of that in the second quarter of the year when markets were starting to crumble elsewhere.", "Over the same period the Shanghai composite index has gone up by more than a quarter, boosted by continuing optimism.", "The Shanghai composite index is up by 26% over the same period as local investors continue to flock to the market."], "title": "While the west takes a battering, China weathers the global storm", "article": "It was a potent symbol of a new world order yesterday when China raised interest rates for the fourth time this year in a desperate attempt to cool an overheated local economy. The move comes at a time when central bankers in the west are wondering whether they should be cutting the cost of borrowing to stave off a potential economic downturn caused by the current credit crisis. The People&apos;s Bank of China increased the lending rate by 18 basis points (0.18 percentage points) to 7.2% arguing there was a need to &quot;reasonably control credit growth and to stabilise inflationary expectations&quot; but the move was also clearly designed to stall the continuing stampede into the red-hot Shanghai stock market. The Chinese and some other Asian exchanges have been immune to the storms that have sent equity prices in New York and London into a downward spiral and the Far East economic boom has saved many western stocks from falling much faster and further than they would have done without it. Even so, some financial analysts are now beginning to question how long the world&apos;s most populous nation can continue to bail out Europe and America before it too gets dragged into the mire as it raises interest rates further or finds demand for its goods slowing down in the US. Previous stock market crashes have often started in Asia or seen the region pull down global asset prices. But the current strength of China and other developing economies has set a different tone. Metals demand Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments, points out that in the last sell-off in 1998 on the back of Russian bond defaults and the collapse of the LTCM hedge fund in America, the world economy was performing quite badly. &quot;Japan and Asia were in a recession and industrial production growth across the world was really rather weak. This time round the US is not doing so well, but China and emerging markets have been doing really rather well. The world economy has got this safety net, this cushion of Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern demand which is supporting activity for exporters in Europe and the US.&quot; China&apos;s growing industrial success has been built on providing everything from cut-price fridges and televisions to toys for western, particularly US, consumers. A big downturn in spending at malls in Chicago will immediately impact on factory production in Shenzhen. The China boom over the last few years has triggered a large increase in demand for raw materials sending the price of metals upwards and boosting the stock prices of companies such as miners and shipping firms. Raw materials such as tin and nickel have reached record levels this year while stocks traded on the Shanghai exchange have risen by 85% during 2007 and put on 30% of that in the second quarter of the year when markets were starting to crumble elsewhere. By contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of US stocks is up by 5% so far this year and the FTSE index of the leading 100 companies in London is down by almost 3% and the Nikkei in Japan by 7%. Those figures mask the true scale of the upheaval in recent weeks since banks and other lenders began to admit their exposure to defaults in America&apos;s high-risk &quot;sub-prime&quot; mortgage market. In the last six weeks the FTSE 100 has fallen by 9.4% while the wider market is down by a similar amount. Over the same period the Shanghai composite index has gone up by more than a quarter, boosted by continuing optimism. Optimism in China has helped stop further falls in London. Although the price of metals has fallen - copper has dropped from $7,910 (\u00a34,000) a tonne to $7,005 over the last fortnight and nickel has slipped from $31,100 per tonne to $26,000 over the same period, mining experts say the damage would have been much worse without China&apos;s huge commodity purchases. John Meyer, at Numis Securities, says the price of commodities is coming down from ultra-high levels. &quot;Whenever you get major uncertainty like that you see currently in the stock market, commodity prices and mining stocks tend to be heavily hit. There is no doubt commodities would have suffered much more if it had not been for China,&quot; he says. Big mining houses such as BHP Billiton have seen their share prices plunge by 20% since early June but Mr Meyer points out that the stock had risen by 20% before that on the back of ever-more optimistic forecasts about physical demand from countries such as China. Old gold Investors tend to flee from commodities and mining stocks on the assumption that demand will be hit by a stock market downturn that could be followed by a wider reduction in economic growth. Mining firms are also seen as risky because they are traditionally affected by the pronounced cyclical nature of the metals markets which have become more volatile in recent years because of large speculative buying. But yesterday Arjan Palthe, senior portfolio manager of the ABN Amro Funds, argued that any companies with continuing exposure to China and other developing countries could benefit from the current stock market turbulence. &quot;In China there is a boom in infrastructure and factory building. Considering the economic expansion there, this industry [supply] group is likely to continue providing excellent returns for a number of years,&quot; he says. Gold is one commodity that traditionally follows a less turbulent path because it is seen as a safe haven for investors along with cash and government bonds. Spot gold prices increased by $2 per troy ounce on Monday and Numis Securities has been recommending those mining houses close to the sector such as Peter Hambro, Randgold Resources and Celtic Resources. Karen Olney, chief European equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, argued in a research paper yesterday entitled Fear versus Fundamentals that investors should hold their nerve. &quot;We think equities are the right place to be, although it will be a volatile ride over the summer if terrifying headlines continue to fire-up investor worries,&quot; she said. The outcome of current global credit worries continues to be uncertain, but the fate of China is bound to have a big influence on the outlook for the world economy. Mr Milligan says that some of the confidence built into current optimistic assessments of the risk to the wider global economy is based on an assumption that, for the time being, China is not going to make any major policy mistakes. That situation could change if it was felt in a few weeks that the Chinese economy was overheating and Chinese authorities had to raise rates again, dampening demand for commodities and other goods, he says. &quot;The Chinese authorities have difficult balancing acts. It&apos;s not impossible despite all the action taken already that come the autumn the [Chinese] authorities feel they have to take more aggressive action to bring the economy to heel. We still have to keep a watchful eye on China.&quot; Winners and losers In volatile markets, defensive stocks often perform better than those considered most at risk from a downturn in the economy. Investors reason that consumers will continue to buy food, need medicines and smoke during times of economic troubles. Tesco, for example, has seen its shares fall in the past six weeks, but less than the overall market - its shares were down 4.4%. Tobacco and pharmaceuticals stocks have performed best in London. The pharmaceuticals sector of the FTSE-Allshare has slipped by 4.5% and tobacco is down by 5%, compared with a 9.5% slide in the overall index. Banks have lost 7.2% of their value as investors worry about their exposure to the credit crunch and mining stocks are down by 20%. The Shanghai composite index is up by 26% over the same period as local investors continue to flock to the market. It stands out against weaker markets in much of the rest of the world. Japan&apos;s Nikkei 225 average has fallen by 13% from its high for the year. The dollar has gained from investors unwinding so-called carry trades which led to their borrowing in yen where interest rates were low to buy higher-yielding currencies. The pound has slipped against the dollar to less than $2.  \u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday August 29 2007.

And by the Coppolas of modern animation, Aardman. Not content to slice and dice exotic foodstuffs for his adult viewers, Oliver has approached the award-winning Wallace &amp; Gromit animators to create a cartoon for pre-teens. Little J follows the adventures of ten-year-old Oliver as he seeks the secrets of becoming a great chef. He is helped by a depressed ham - a character that may fail to entice our sympathy; E.coli is bad enough, but surely meat with mental health issues needs to be put out of its misery.

Before we throw our hands up at yet more Oliver on the telly, repackaged and resold, however eccentrically - &quot;everything in moderation&quot;, Jamie, including yourself - we should consider whether a cartoon cook might not be such a bad idea. Food programming has snagged into an ever-deepening groove of chefs, celebs and amateur cooks endlessly challenging themselves, each other and anything else that crosses their kitchen counter. Unencumbered by the imagination found in other TV genres, today&apos;s food telly invites only one response. If you&apos;re interested in food, take the stealth approach: change what you watch. Some of the most brilliant and thought-provoking programmes that feature food go under a different banner. You could learn more about eating from one episode of Anthony Boudain&apos;s gonzo travel show No Reservations than from an entire series of Jamie boshing over Tuscan toms. Arena&apos;s award-winning documentary, The Burger and the King, was recently re-screened to commemorate Elvis Presley&apos;s death. Witty, moving and low-key, it uncovers Presley&apos;s life and times through his food. Early dinners of possums and deep fried squirrels in the depression-era South are followed by his army years and endless creamed beef (lard, chipped meat, evaporated milk), known in-house as SOS or &apos;s*** on a shingle&apos;. Eating, says his cook Mary Jenkins, was the only thing that gave Presley any joy. &quot;The input&apos;s gotta be as big as the output,&quot; was his line. There are intimations that his career and the death of his mother (who fed him his first and finest fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches) fuelled a craving that all the cheeseburgers and fried sarnies in the world failed to sate. Storyville&apos;s Children of the Chinese Circus goes behind the scenes at Shanghai&apos;s circus. Distressing scenes abound, but the hardest to stomach is one involving a tiny eight-year-old acrobat and his hunger. As he trains, sobbing and sweating, his trainers berate him for gaining weight - it happens every time he goes home for the weekend. His deaf mute parents are summoned and he is called in to sign communicate his teachers&apos; disgust with him. The hopes his family have for him take precedence over their natural urge to feed him. The teachers keep barking &quot;why do you need snacks? Why are so hungry?&quot;. There&apos;s only one response - because he&apos;s human and because he&apos;s eight. Much like these programmes, the Oliver/Aardman series is not primarily about food: their aim, first and foremost, is to make a comedy.

Not so easy to find, however, is a real newspaper. The International Herald Tribune or the Financial Times are sometimes available in the gift shops of the fanciest hotels, but the only English language paper for sale at newsstands around town is the China Daily. The Daily, it is safe to say, is not a real newspaper. It fairly reeks of Communist party control. Of course, many things in China are not real, from Nike shoes to Louis Vuitton bags to the pirated DVDs. As the recent spate of news stories shows, the more ominous fakes threaten the health and well-being of consumers throughout the world. Fake blood-sugar test strips, baby formula and cough medicines are just a few recent examples. Many commentators have attributed the wave of doctored, fake, and unsafe products to the cut throat capitalism that has come to characterize the new China. With profit margins razor thin, and incessant pressure to cut costs, firms are driven to cut corners on safety as well. The competitive race means that a few pennies saved by taking a shortcut can make the difference between profit and loss. But firms worldwide are subject to the competitive pressures of market capitalism. The causes of China&apos;s product safety problems are many, but at the top of the list is not market competition but state censorship of the media. Fake newspapers, it is safe to say, often enable fake products. The converse is also true: a free media is one of society&apos;s most important checks on corporate behavior. As long as the Chinese government is deciding what the news is or isn&apos;t, and how it will be discussed, we can expect the product quality problems - and other public health threats - to continue. China&apos;s Communist party has a long tradition of suppressing discussion of public health threats in the interests of fostering a more &quot;harmonious society.&quot; In recent years, threats arising from Sars, bird flu, tainted blood supplies, product safety and pig viruses have been handled in a similar way: denial and suppression, followed by the public punishment or even execution of a scapegoat, which is in turn followed by complaints that China is being picked on, which is in turn is followed by promises to do better. What is missing here is the recognition that a true &quot;harmonious society&quot; requires a free press to investigate and inform without interference from the state. It is safe to say that each of the public health threats of recent years would have been less serious and shorter lived had the media been free to investigate and inform. I have an academic interest in China&apos;s textile and apparel trade, so as the China product safety stories proliferated during the past few weeks I have taken some ribbing from a number of journalists and colleagues: &quot;Well, at the least the t-shirts are safe, right? Ha ha.&quot; Well, maybe not. On Monday the New Zealand, Australian, and US press reported that children&apos;s t-shirts imported from China into New Zealand had formaldehyde levels many times above the level considered safe. Luckily for consumers, the clothing could be made safe by simple washing. The real news, and the real threat, relates to the safety of the workers in China producing the clothing.

Once he wins a couple of matches he&apos;ll regain that winning feeling, but if he continues to hold back then he has no chance.&quot; Murray is drawn to play a qualifier after the final grand slam of the season gets under way here on Monday. The 20-year-old&apos;s comeback in Montreal and Cincinnati this month did not go well, as he lost two of his three matches and was patently still feeling ill at ease, so much so that it prompted his return to London for another scan. &quot;He went back to find out for sure what was going on and he was reassured. The doctor said he had to let it go, and after finally hearing it enough times it&apos;s sunk in. It seemed like he was holding back a lot, and you&apos;re only going to get more frustrated doing that.&quot; Listening to Gilbert, it was not difficult to sense his own frustration at Murray&apos;s previous unwillingness to test his wrist out to the full. &quot;If it was me I&apos;d rather give it a shot and get hurt, as opposed to waiting and you might hurt it anyway. It&apos;s certainly been a struggle.&quot; Wisely, perhaps, Murray decided to be more cautious, for as Gilbert also pointed out: &quot;I&apos;m not inside Andy&apos;s wrist.&quot; This particular type of injury has become much more prevalent over the last three or four years, with several players having to drop off the circuit for a year or more after surgery. Fortunately for Murray he has not needed an operation but until this week the demons of uncertainty plagued him. &quot;He seems to be finally turning the corner. He&apos;s letting it fly a lot more and trying to be himself. At some point you have to trust your body,&quot; said Gilbert. &quot;He&apos;s had two days of practice without feeling any pain at all, and he&apos;s finally feeling good out there. Now it&apos;s a matter of getting match fit. You lose the muscle memory. He needs to get into a tournament, to get that feeling back. It&apos;s been a bit of a downer and also a character builder. At his age you take things for granted and now maybe he&apos;ll appreciate things more.&quot; Prior to the wrist injury in Hamburg, Murray had experienced a successful start to the year on the Australian and US hardcourts, rising into the world top 10 for the first time. This progress was not without injury blips, including those to his hip, knee and back, but the wrist tendon problem which came out of the blue sidelined him for three months, causing him to miss the French Open and Wimbledon. When the year began it was Gilbert&apos;s stated aim for Murray to finish in the top eight and qualify for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. &quot;Things had been going pretty smoothly up until the injury. Now it&apos;s a matter of re-figuring things out along the way.&quot; Murray&apos;s brother Jamie and his partner Jordan Kerr crashed out in the semi-finals of the ATP tournament in New Haven yesterday, losing 6-2, 6-3 to the fourth seeds Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski, who did not face a break point on their serves during the match .", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "US Open Tennis 2007", "Andy Murray"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-24T23:04:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/aug/26/china.bars", "sentences": ["I felt the place to go was definitely Shanghai, and friends who lived there were saying the same thing.", "There are shopping malls, Gucci and Prada everywhere - and not just in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.", "Shanghai set out to take over from Hong Kong and I think it&apos;s done that.", "Shanghai and Beijing may be out in front, but I often play in Guangzhou and I have been all over the country.", "Shanghai Bon Bon2F Yunhai Tower, 1329 Huaihai Zhong Lu, by Hengshan Lu (00 86 21 133 2193 9299)While newer clubs such as Attica have encroached on the Shanghai clubbing market, it&apos;s still Bon Bon that attracts the biggest crowds of the trendy Shanghai youth.", "Hangzhou G-Plus169 Qing Chun Lu (00 86 571 8721 5152)Formerly known as SOS, this 2,500-capacity club has recently been taken over by Shanghai club giant G-Plus."], "title": "Paul Oakenfold on clubbing in China", "article": "For 20 years, I&apos;ve been travelling around the world as a DJ: Thailand, Columbia, Chile, India, Israel, Malaysia, Miami - you name it, I&apos;ve played there. Going to all these countries - and through the contacts you make there - you seem to build up an idea of what place is happening at a particular time. And right now, nowhere is more exciting than China. I&apos;ve been going to China every year now for more than a decade. I was there for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Everyone was in a state of high panic, thinking there was going to be drastic change overnight, with tanks and soldiers sweeping in from the outskirts of town. I was working, playing a set rounding off a party for 10,000 people in Kowloon Bay. There was an air of chaos and pandemonium, and then, just like the millennium bug, nothing happened. The morning dawned and things continued pretty much as they were.  But change did begin to come, slowly, at first, but now accelerating all the time. Every time I go, I can see, smell and feel the changes since my last visit.  By the late 1990s, I&apos;d kind of got over Hong Kong and was looking for more. I felt the place to go was definitely Shanghai, and friends who lived there were saying the same thing.  In those early days, you felt the hand of the military. If they said a show had to end at 2am, that&apos;s when it ended. Obviously there were bars and people were drinking, but you&apos;d come out and sense the military were just round the corner, always monitoring what was going on. A friend of mine, Mian Mian, wrote a book called Candy about the underground scene of that period, about how the creative work of artists, painters, singers, writers, was being monitored, and also about how people would stay out beyond the curfew and go back to people&apos;s houses to party. It was published in several countries, but banned in China.  Now though, it&apos;s almost gone the other way. The clubs go on until six or seven in the morning. There are shopping malls, Gucci and Prada everywhere - and not just in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. There&apos;s a chain of nightclubs called Babyface in 12 of the major cities. If you had a chain of 12 British clubs, it wouldn&apos;t be perceived as creditable - but it is out there, because the country&apos;s so vast, and Babyface is one of the most credible chain of clubs in the world. Every major DJ goes through there at some stage during their career.  Shanghai set out to take over from Hong Kong and I think it&apos;s done that. It&apos;s got the most amazing futuristic skyline which rivals and even betters Tokyo. When I&apos;m in town, I stay at the Grand Hyatt which starts on the 54th floor and goes up to the 87th floor of the Jin Mao tower. So sometimes you are sitting on the 60th floor, above the clouds, looking down at the Bund, the city region on the bank of the Huangpu river. Everywhere you look are futuristic buildings but it&apos;s also steeped in history, and there&apos;s so much going on. It feels like you&apos;re at this magical place at exactly the right time.  There is a definite Chinese pop sound developing, but I was shocked at how influenced it is by American music. Even the dress sense is very American and hip-hop influenced. Yet it doesn&apos;t seem to cross over into dance music, which remains very much the underground sound of what&apos;s going on. I&apos;m about to start working with a singer I met on my last trip: she&apos;ll get international exposure, and I&apos;ll have a song out in that market sung in Cantonese. Shanghai and Beijing may be out in front, but I often play in Guangzhou and I have been all over the country. I have used private planes, but usually I just take a domestic flight from Beijing. Often, if we&apos;re heading out to rural China, it&apos;s just me, my support DJ, my tour manager in one row, and no other Westerners on the plane. Playing in somewhere like Shenzhen, a big, polluted, overpopulated, industrial city, you can be the only Westerner in the club. You are a long way from home and you feel it.  I once did a gig on the Great Wall too. I like the idea of taking DJing out of the realms of the nightclub but that was a challenge. It was pouring with rain, we were on a wall in the middle of nowhere looking over into Mongolia. It didn&apos;t help that it was in the middle of the Sars virus scare. So where&apos;s next? To be honest, my main focus these days is scoring films, but I still love DJing and travelling and am always looking for ways to push the boundaries. So for the last three months, we&apos;ve been working on setting up a big event for next year. It&apos;s in Siberia. Where to paint the town red Tom Pattinson, editor of Time Out Beijing, picks the best places to party Beijing Coco Banana6 Gong Ti Xi Lu, Chaoyang district (00 86 10 8599 9999)The younger and smaller sister of Banana, one of Beijing&apos;s longest serving clubs, Coco Banana has taken up the reins as the capital&apos;s must-play destination for international DJs. This relatively intimate club holds only around 800 people and superstar DJ Tiesto helped the opening go off with a bang. LED screens and light panels on the floor ensure the dancefloor is filled - often with girls in hotpants - while the awesome sound system means the DJs stay on the decks all night.  Shanghai Bon Bon2F Yunhai Tower, 1329 Huaihai Zhong Lu, by Hengshan Lu (00 86 21 133 2193 9299)While newer clubs such as Attica have encroached on the Shanghai clubbing market, it&apos;s still Bon Bon that attracts the biggest crowds of the trendy Shanghai youth. UK dance brand Godskitchen holds the DJ residency and international DJs take to the booth every weekend to play some of the best music ranging from hip-hop to drum&apos;n&apos;bass to house, rather than the usual Chinese techno. With sleek, minimalist design, Bon Bon is one of the few clubs that put the music before the whisky and green tea sales.  Jinan Cinderella No.23 ClubEast Gate of Provincial Sports Centre, 124 Jingshi Lu (00 86 531 8290 6586).In what only a few years ago was the back of beyond for the club scene, Cinderella&apos;s has put Jinan on the clubbing map. The independent club that isn&apos;t owned by one of the huge nightclub chains such as Babyface has gone out on a limb by forgetting the commercial house and techno music, keeping to a strict policy of refreshing modern dance. Expect to find international DJs on occasion thrown in with the best DJs China has to offer. Expert bartenders and quality sound and light systems attract the young, rich and beautiful of Shandong Province. Hangzhou G-Plus169 Qing Chun Lu (00 86 571 8721 5152)Formerly known as SOS, this 2,500-capacity club has recently been taken over by Shanghai club giant G-Plus. Stylish and spacious, the management are among the best in the game, providing the perfect mix of big-name DJs with their own music policy. A favourite of Dubfire, Deep Dish and Paul Van Dyk as well as the stylish elite of Hangzhou. Guangzhou Yes2nd floor Liuhua Plaza, 132 Dong Feng Xi Lu (00 86 20 8136 6154).The biggest club in Guangzhou, if not China, has huge open spaces and tall ceilings that allow clubbers to move freely around without feeling crushed. A great sound system and a policy of booking some of the biggest names in the world mean this vast space is regularly packed. However, when no big-name DJs appear, the space can look cavernously empty.  \u00b7 Time Out Beijing is published monthly in English and is available from newsagents in China. \u00b7 Paul Oakenfold - The Authorised Biography is published by Bantam on 24 September.

Meal for two, including wine, from \u00a3150 From the moment we walk through the front door of the Dorchester hotel we accept that we are in a different world. The opulence, as we walk - saunter, possibly - through the central comfort zone of the extensive, ground-floor salon, so generously furnished with high-backed sofas and the widest armchairs you have ever seen, appears suddenly quite absurd. It also seems that those who are occupying these overplumped suites are, themselves, a touch unreal. However, even if one is a very rich visitor indeed, casually familiar with unfeasible flower arrangements and that which feels, underfoot, like a full three inches of the very finest Aubusson, it would take an extraordinary arrogance not to be somewhat impressed. At the very end of the room we turn left and descend into yet another unworldly place, that of Thirties Shanghai perhaps, for lunch at China Tang. Here, all is varnished wood, mirrored pillars, folding screens, fine linen and etched wine glasses. Lighting is spot on, and one sits on deeply comfortable brocade banquettes. Do not miss the gorgeous lavs, either, with their striking geometric floor tiles. And the bar here is one of the nicest in London, as is the highly competent young lady who mixes a pair of fine Martinis. As my friend Jason looks at the menu, I request the wine list. &apos;Perhaps an Alsatian,&apos; I suggest. &apos;And would that be with black beans, or ginger and garlic?&apos; Jason quips. I almost fall off my stool. Not because of his mildly tasteless joke, but from the shock of the prices. For a fleeting moment, having just returned from Paris, I think I am reading in euros. For example, of two Sancerres, one is \u00a380, the other an extraordinary \u00a3130! We don&apos;t have the Alsace in the end, but a very good Italian Chardonnay. For \u00a385. Before arriving at China Tang, I had decided we should eat familiar and favourite Chinese. In this respect, the extensive menu does not disappoint. Enthused, we chose one each of the following: &apos;classic&apos; roast pigeon (\u00a318); sweet and sour pork (\u00a314); &apos;classic&apos; steamed scallops in black bean (\u00a316 - for just the two scallops!); Singapore vermicelli (\u00a310); &apos;classic&apos; congee with pork meatball, liver, kidney and tripe (\u00a38); a 50/50 serving of barbecue cha sui pork and roast duck (\u00a316); finally, the not-so-familiar bean curds with minced chicken and salted fish in a clay pot (\u00a318). Well, let&apos;s just say we were very hungry. From the dim sum menu we chose irresistible Shanghai dumplings (\u00a34). And I&apos;m glad we did. My word, these are good: juicy, deeply flavoured, and the lightest of clinging paste enclosing their goodness. I could have eaten 10. Along with the dumplings, the star dishes are the pork, scallops and bean curd. We marvel at how they had managed the essential crunch of crisp coating to tender pork, in conjunction with its perfectly judged, piquant sauce. The very fresh scallops (that&apos;s just the two, remember), cooked in shell, are deliciously smeared with mulched beans as well as nibbed particles in the almost &apos;brewed&apos; tasting sauce beneath. But it is the bean curd dish that shows the kitchen at its most accomplished. Texture being as important in Chinese food as flavour, it is the contrast between the super-bland curds slipping across the tongue combined with the mildly fetid fish shreds, delicate dice of chicken and sloppy, almost winey sauce which makes every mouthful a savoury ambrosia. An extraordinary dish. On the roast and barbecued front, the pigeon and duck both have a good, rich flavour and supremely tender, almost fondant flesh, but they don&apos;t deliver the expected crispness of skin one so looks forward to. The pork is juicy and correct. Personally, I think the congee a touch over-processed, with the rice cooked until no trace of rice remains, but Jason likes it. Although congee&apos;s blandness is always soothing, the exciting bits were on the pedestrian side, and tough. The dish that truly disappoints, however, is the Singapore vermicelli. Bland, in this particular case, is most unwelcome. We also ask if they have any XO sauce - a deeply flavoured, oily dipping condiment made from pounded dried seafood (roe, particularly), chillies, garlic and soy. Now I know XO has never been cheap to make, or purchase. But to charge \u00a35 for one tablespoon seems a supplement too far. Absurdly, this would constitute one-third of the price of the simple set-lunch menu. It&apos;s a topsy-turvy kind of world in China Tang, but I like it and will return. I wonder if they would offer BYO next time? \u00b7 Simon Hopkinson&apos;s Week In Week Out is published next month by Quadrille.

Her earlier books, Falling Off Air, and Out of Mind, both featured journalist and single mother Robin Ballantyne. In The Pool of Unease, Robin Ballantyne investigates the murder of a British businessman in Beijing. The book also introduces private detective Song Ren, who is miserably staking out a brothel when he hears a blood-curdling scream, and goes to investigate...an inquiry which rapidly becomes entangled with Robin&apos;s. &quot;If you only looked at size of population, you&apos;d expect China and India to dominate any list like this, but in fact it is Japan which has taken crime fiction to its bosom. In China, politics adds a thick layer of complication. To write about crime in China - however fictional - is to advertise the fact that Chinese society is not an entirely harmonious and benign thing. Of course, China&apos;s leaders are a lot more tolerant than they once were when it comes to literature, but it&apos;s still sensitive, and crime fiction is a small but growing genre. The Beijing that I see around me, with its speed-of-light economic growth, its social dislocation, its constantly migrating population and its quagmire of corruption, is a verdant pasture for crime fiction. And its political claustrophobia is the perfect environment for a private eye who is an honourable man struggling against a system that threatens to overwhelm him.&quot; 1. Death of a Red Heroine by Qiu Xiaolong Qiu is a Chinese writer now living in America. His Detective Chen is an inspector in the Shanghai police force. When a female model worker is found dead, Detective Chen investigates, and the trail leads him onto dangerous political ground. The book has a gentle feel to it which makes the violence of murder even more shocking. It is a vivid description of present day Shanghai, and the satisfying ending is utterly believable. 2. Playing For Thrills by Wang Shuo Wang Shuo was one of the inventors of so-called hooligan literature. It tore into Chinese conventions by romanticising the lives of young people who had no interest in politics. Wang Shuo writes Chinese literature&apos;s version of punk, often described as gritty and sarcastic, and his work is frequently banned. Playing for Thrills has narrator Fang Yan trying to clear himself of a murder he may - or may not, he&apos;s not quite sure - have committed a decade earlier. 3. Crime De Sang by He Jiahong This should be available soon in English as Blood Crime. He Jiahong is a lawyer who teaches at one of China&apos;s most respected universities, and he has also spent time in the United States. His protagonist, Hong Jun, is a lawyer, too, and He&apos;s books are most notable for their beautifully observed descriptions of daily life. 4. Sacred Games by Vikram Chandra The Bombay underworld is brought to grimy life in this bestselling novel in which police detective Sartaj Singh investigates the suicide of crime boss Gaitonde. When it first appeared, Indian readers were excited that it had broken many taboos. The murky complexities of politics, religion and caste soak the bloody plot, and the Bombay described here rivals any Mafia-ridden Italian city. 5. Jack the Ladykiller by HRF Keating Keating is a British writer who has adopted India as his territory and is best-known for his Inspector Ghote mysteries. This unusual novel is written entirely in verse and is set in the British community in the Punjab in 1935. When a woman is murdered, Jack Steele, a young colonial police officer fresh out of school, must investigate and confront his own preconceptions. The novel, like most of the books on this list, uses the form of the criminal investigation to dissect social relations, in this case the nature of the colonial population and its relationship with the local population. I love novels in verse, and having tried my hand at writing verse, I find it always takes me in interesting directions. 6. Out by Natsuo Kirino As in Britain and the USA, the Japanese crime genre has female stars. Natsuo Kirino&apos;s dark and bloody Out is not a pleasant read, but it is a powerful one. A young mother who works a night shift making boxed lunches in the suburbs of Tokyo brutally strangles her deadbeat husband and then seeks the help of her co-workers to dispose of the body and cover up her crime. 7. All She Was Worth by Miyake Miyabe Another prizewinning Japanese woman writer paints another searing picture of Japanese society at its darkest. When a young woman applies for a credit card and it is denied because of a bankruptcy many years before, she and her fiance are shocked. Soon the woman has vanished, leaving her fiance to investigate a mystery which involves stolen identity and consumerism run wild. 8. Inspector Imanishi Investigates by Seicho Matsumoto Perhaps this is a little out of date - it is a police procedural that was published in the 60s - but it is a classic. It is a very different Japanese crime novel from the previous two, but more familiar, perhaps, to the reader of traditional British crime novel. Inspector Imanishi is a more conventional figure, middle-aged and middle class, who calmly attempts to bring order to a muddled world. His traditional domestic life forms much of the landscape of the book. When I read this book many years ago, I was delighted by the way in which it made the complexity of Japanese society accessible to a reader who had never set foot in Japan. It is the book that first made me think that the crime novel can travel, as a genre, so that a British reader can settle happily into an entirely foreign environment. 9. Murder At Mount Fuji by Shizuko Natsuki Japan&apos;s bestselling mystery writer, and another woman. This is a thoughtful and intelligent mystery, set in snow-covered Mount Fuji at new year. A visiting American student and a Japanese police detective attempt to unravel an intricate web of intrigue to uncover the truth concerning a family murder. 10. The Quiet American by Graham Greene When I visited Saigon several years ago, this book was photocopied and sold on stalls throughout the city. A mystery and so much more - this is a classic tale of a romantic triangle, violent politics and murder. Many of the books on this list have been written by Asians who have left Asia, at least for a while. Several of the books by non-Asian&apos;s, like this one and HRF Keating&apos;s take an expatriate community as their focus. As a writer who is not Asian but dares to write about Asia, I think it can be done. But there are few non-Asian writers who manage to make Asia, and one searing point in history, so utterly alive as Graham Greene.", "tags": ["Books", "Crime fiction", "Culture", "Best books"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-26T23:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/aug/27/womensfootball.sport", "sentences": ["Hope Powell&apos;s team are in the former Portuguese colony for an acclimatisation programme in the build-up to their finals campaign, which will get underway with a group game against Japan in Shanghai on September 11."], "title": "England fail to crack China", "article": "England&apos;s final warm-up match for the World Cup finals in China next month ended in a 1-0 defeat by the host nation at the Macau Olympic Stadium yesterday.

It was extremely hot and humid, so much so that the girls were absolutely drenched in sweat when they came off - they all looked as though they&apos;d had gallons of water poured over them.

Roger Federer, attempting to win his fourth successive US Open, and Rafael Nadal have been joined by Novak Djokovic, with one of this trio being viewed as the most likely to lift the men&apos;s title here a week next Sunday. Had all gone right for Murray, as it largely was doing during the first three months of the year, then the young Scot may well have been challenging this triumvirate in what he regards as his favourite tournament. By the time the clay-court season was under way in Monte Carlo both Murray and Djokovic, who is one week younger, were in the top 10. But because of his injury Murray has slipped back, whereas the Serb, who has won all his three matches against the British No1 to date, has reached the semi-finals of the French Open and Wimbledon, and this month won his second Masters series event of the year in Montreal, defeating Nadal in the semi-finals and Federer in the final. He has arrived big time. &quot;Every tennis player will tell you that you focus on your own career, but Novak has had a great run the last few months and played really, really well and deserves to be the No3 player in the world today, no question, &quot; said Murray. &quot;I haven&apos;t been looking at him and thinking &apos;that&apos;s me, I should have done that&apos; because I&apos;m not Djokovic. I don&apos;t play like him, we&apos;re different people and I just want to try and do it my own way. &quot;Before this injury I was, I think, No3 or No4 in the race - I was definitely in the top five - and it&apos;s been quite difficult. But hopefully at the end of this year I can finish strong and start next year the way I did this year,&quot; said Murray yesterday. His aim at the beginning of this year was to get into the top 10 - which he achieved - and then make it through to the end-of-season Masters Cup in Shanghai, reserved for the top-eight players. That will not now happen, unless something remarkable occurs here and in the remaining two months of the season. &quot;The rest of the year I just want to try and play without pressure and enjoy being back on the court because it&apos;s been a long time since I felt I&apos;ve been able to do that.&quot; Had he been 100% match fit and injury free, Murray would have looked at the US Open draw with relish, starting with his first-round match against the Uruguayan qualifier Pablo Cuevas. Understandably, not having won back-to-back matches since March Murray is altogether more circumspect, although working with the Italian sports psychologist Roberto Forzoni has helped free him of the anxieties that came with the wrist injury. The response of his coach, Brad Gilbert, was to get out and play, but Murray was clearly ill at ease when he made his comeback earlier this month in Montreal and then Cincinnati, losing two of his three matches and obviously not trusting the wrist. &quot;The psychologist tried to make me think positively and he has helped me a lot.&quot; A return home to London after losing in Cincinnati was also a huge fillip. &quot;It was great, the best thing I&apos;ve done since the injury. I got six or seven days of really, really good practice. I saw the sports psychologist, I spent time with my friends and it got me in a positive frame of mind because obviously Montreal and Cincinnati were quite difficult.&quot; More solid confidence-building practice at Flushing Meadows this week has further lifted his spirits. &quot;I still think about the wrist, but it&apos;s less and less. The more matches and the more practices I&apos;ve had where I&apos;ve come off the court and I&apos;ve been pain-free, the more it will go out of my mind, I&apos;m sure.&quot; It is impossible not to sense the residue of anxiety, although he almost instantly dismisses the doubts. &quot;This week there are no excuses; the wrist is definitely behind me and I just want to go out and play my tennis again.&quot; Last year he reached the last 16. &quot;I&apos;d love to do better this time.

But a new strategic alliance between the two countries is not likely, as it is China that poses the greatest strategic threat to Russia, although many in the Kremlin seem blind to this as they rattle sabres at America and the west. China, for instance, has territorial claims on parts of Russia&apos;s far east which are often noted in Chinese school geography textbooks. This is consistent with the Chinese strategic concept of &quot;vital space&quot;, which includes all spheres of a state&apos;s strategic activities, on land, at sea, under water, in the air, and in space. The dimensions of &quot;vital space&quot; are determined by a country&apos;s economic, scientific, technical, social, and military capabilities - in essence, its &quot;total power&quot;. According to Chinese theorists, the &quot;vital space&quot; of great powers extends far beyond a state&apos;s borders, whereas the &quot;vital space&quot; of weak countries is limited to strategic boundaries that do not always correspond to the borders of their national territory. Today, China has territorial claims against 11 of its 24 neighbours, including India, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, in addition to Russia. In China&apos;s relations with all of them, the potential use of military force was and remains an important factor. In September 2006, the Chinese People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) conducted an unprecedentedly large 10-day exercise, involving the Shenyang and Beijing military districts, the two most powerful of China&apos;s seven military districts. Shenyang abuts the Russian Armed Forces&apos; Far Eastern District, and the Beijing district shares a border with Russia&apos;s Siberian Military District. During the exercises, Shenyang units advanced 1,000 kilometres into the Beijing district, where they engaged in joint war games. To military observers, the Beijing/Shenyang exercises seemed to be practice for a possible offensive operation against Russia, because exercises on such a scale are undertaken only at the final stage of a multi-year programme to train troops to enact specific strategic and operational plans. The geography of the exercises, and the offensive nature of the tasks undertaken, leaves little doubt that Russia was cast in the role of &quot;potential adversary&quot;. Such a show of force is an ancient, traditional Chinese political technique. Paradoxically, these exercises were undertaken during a period when bilateral political and economic ties appeared on the surface to be at their highest point. Russia has an important place in Chinese geopolitical calculations, as a supplier of both modern weaponry and energy resources needed to continue its modernisation. Therefore, the Chinese are doing everything possible to strengthen their economic and political position in Russia, and to draw Russia into their sphere of influence. And China is succeeding, most importantly, by consistently reinforcing Putin&apos;s anti-American and anti-western agenda. While the Beijing/Shenyang exercise should have indicated to Russian leaders that China&apos;s intentions toward Russia may not always be benign, Russia&apos;s political and military leadership seem not to sense any threat; on the contrary, they continue to sell advanced weapons to the Chinese. Russia&apos;s current diplomatic tilt, indeed, is clearly against its own long-term national security interests. China will never be interested in Russia&apos;s economic and political modernisation, for it prefers Russia to remain a source of mineral and energy resources and a vast &quot;strategic rear&quot; in its looming challenge with the United States. Likewise, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which just concluded its annual meeting, is in China&apos;s eyes a tool of regional policy that helps strengthen China&apos;s influence and control over Central Asia&apos;s natural resources at the expense of Russia. No nation threatens China&apos;s land borders. China can solve its domestic problems, such as separatism, by itself. China is militarily self-sufficient and needs military cooperation under the SCO framework only in order to free its hands if any conflict should arise that affects its interests. In fact, conflict between Russia and China is possible precisely in Central Asia, given the clear differences in the two countries&apos; economic and political interests in that region. Aside from control of the region&apos;s energy supplies, water has become a potential source of conflict, given China&apos;s serious shortages. Yet, while the Chinese clearly understand these contingencies and are preparing themselves to deal with them diplomatically and militarily, the Kremlin remains myopically obsessed with the phantom threat of America. Thus, as the Kremlin dreams of re-establishing its domination over what Russians refer to as the &quot;near abroad&quot; (Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic countries, and the other post-Soviet states), China is increasingly looking at Russia as its own &quot;near abroad.&quot; Will the Kremlin finally wake up to this? Thirty-six years ago, Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong turned world politics upside down, as both America and China realised that it was the Soviet Union, and not each other, that posed the greater threat. Vladimir Putin needs his own &quot;Nixon moment&quot;. Alienating the west is a foolish strategy when the greatest long-term threat to Russia comes from the east.

Then it was lead-coated toys and catfish dosed with dangerous levels of antibiotics. Now it is mattresses and children&apos;s clothes treated with unsafe levels of chemicals. To the long-running saga of China stealing jobs from more developed economies, add the safety factor. As Hillary Clinton put it when addressing a trade union conference: &quot;I do not want to eat bad food from China or have my children having toys that are going to get them sick. So let&apos;s be tough on China going forward.&quot; Does Chelsea still play with lead-daubed Dora the Explorer dolls? As always, things are somewhat more complicated than they appear. The 20m toys recalled by the Mattel company this month were, indeed, made in China, but most are being called back because of a design fault (a magnet) written into the specification handed out by the American firm. Already, some voices are saying that - as with China&apos;s terrible environmental record - it is really all the result of the West and Japan having foisted industrialisation on China, as if Deng Xiaoping was secretly in the pay of foreign companies seeking cheap labour or Chinese entrepreneurs did not sign up wholesale for plants burning brown coal or spewing poisonous waste into rivers. In trade terms, the effect is small as yet, though it could become much more serious if the allegations of use of dangerous chemicals spread to textiles as a whole. But, while insisting that 99% of its exports are safe, China has reacted by appointing its main trouble shooter, Wu Yi, to head a committee to look into safety standards and food quality. Officials now say that 85% of food meets standards - which is worrying for those who consume the other 15%. Though it is the foreign alarm that catches the headlines, the effect is more serious at home where Chinese consumers have been subject to sub-standard and downright dangerous goods for years. In the latest case, reported in Shanghai recently, more than a tonne of dried seaweed was being soaked in vats of industrial dye and preservative containing sulphur dioxide to make it seem fresh. Other raids in the city discovered 13 tonnes of rice wine and five tonnes of vinegar containing ethyl alcohol and industrial salts. Like China&apos;s huge environmental crisis, the safety issue is the result of headlong manufacturing development without accompanying regulation. Both are systemic problems that go to the heart of how China works, and how governance does not function at a level the economy requires. Of course, global demand for Chinese products lies behind the unregulated boom. But it cannot be blamed, in itself, for what is coming to light. The heart of the matter lies in the People&apos;s Republic, not with consumers in the developed world. While big, modern manufacturing companies have emerged, like Bao Steel, Haier, and Lenovo, a major motor of Chinese growth remains the small and medium-sized enterprises which were given their head by Deng in the 1980s. Between them, they have as many workers as the entire US labour force. Most are, in effect, outside any kind of control except that of the local authorities, which may well have a personal or institutional interest in their activities in return for having granted land and been otherwise helpful. How likely are those local authorities to rein in the village and township enterprises, or impose environmental or safety standards that would cost them all money, particularly when the abolition of land taxes leaves local government short of cash? Equally, the major contractors with which American, European or Japanese brands deal generally sub-contract to a mass of small firms. The directors, sitting in Hong Kong or Shanghai or Guangzhou, proffer assurances that standards are being met, but have little control over the small plants in Zhejiang or in the sprawling hinterland of Guangdong. Quality control takes place when the goods arrive at the export destination, not when they leave China. With tight margins, the modus operandi is to fill as many containers as possible without asking questions. The system has worked like a charm in terms of growth. It has enabled China to by-pass the business procedures and standards of classical economics. With a tidal wave of liquidity flowing in from trade, the PRC has been able to follow its own path. Soon, the natural resources acquisitions of recent years will be followed by hundreds of billions of dollars aiming to buy foreign assets to fill China&apos;s technological and brand gaps. Since Deng Xiaoping lead the Communist Party into business after 1978 - although it is easy to forget how long it took him to vanquish the conservatives - the Chinese Communist party has had to maintain growth. That further diminishes its already circumscribed ability to influence the economy. Provincial governments may be told to pay more attention to environmental standards, but they are still marked on their ability to produce growth. Thus, Beijing decrees a slowdown in the steel sector and makes tax changes to deter exports, but output and exports go on increasing. The irony of a Leninist system with a weak centre is not that surprising, given China&apos;s history, particularly in the pre-Communist era. But the result is a line that leads directly from President Hu Jintao having to scrabble for support in the politburo standing committee, down to sub-contractors daubing lead paint on toys. Wu Yi will bang the table, and China will take counter-measures against allegedly unsafe imports - a list that already includes American soybeans, turbines, pacemakers and orange juice concentrate. But, so long as the peculiar hybrid Chinese politico-economic system continues, with the country posting such large trade surpluses, meaningful change may be impossible, if only because it would threaten the structure on which the regime rests. In the end, Beijing has to decide what kind of economy it wants, and how it moves to the second stage of global integration. What has happened since 1978 has been easy given the strength of the global economy in which China has evolved. The second term for Hu Jintao, starting in the autumn, may be the more difficult test.

The communist leadership finds it hard to mention, let alone emphasise, the country&apos;s problems. Officials&apos; preoccupation with commanding respect and not losing face leads them to focus almost exclusively on China&apos;s achievements. This is a strategy that risks backfiring, because it misunderstands the dynamics of international politics. Emphasising China&apos;s meteoric rise means less understanding in the rest of the world of the need to sustain rapid economic development in order to satisfy the expectations of its 1.3 billion inhabitants. The government knows that it has a political tiger by the tail, but refuses to acknowledge it, either inside China or outside. Trade tensions continue to mount. The US is deeply concerned, following the minimal results of its &quot;strategic economic dialogue&quot; with China in May, and Congress is threatening tough protectionist measures. The EU may not be far behind; much will depend on how China presents its case over the coming 18 months as the two sides negotiate a wide-ranging partnership cooperation agreement, which will determine the quality of bilateral relations for the next decade. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just visited Beijing, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy likely to follow soon. Both are surely aware that China&apos;s surging exports last year helped it surpass the US as Europe&apos;s largest foreign supplier. What they won&apos;t see, of course, are the desperately low living standards of China&apos;s teeming millions, especially the rural poor. Yet China is in no mood to plead poverty when dealing with the west. Its aim is to gain as much prestige as possible from the Olympic games in 2008 and the six-month World Expo in Shanghai during the spring and summer of 2010. It remains to be seen whether the two events will be capable of swinging world opinion in China&apos;s favour and keeping it there. Indeed, the government&apos;s suspicion of the international media is liable to spark friction when thousands of journalists arrive and inevitably widen their coverage beyond athletics to politics and human rights. For the time being, sentiment about China&apos;s future remains relentlessly upbeat. McKinsey consultants have even forecast that the upper middle-class will number 520 million by 2025 - the sort of projection that the communist mandarins welcome as a tribute to their strange hybrid of a market economy and rigid state control. Yet it is almost certainly the sort of forecast of which they should beware. The reality of life in today&apos;s China looks very different from the vantage point of a province far from the heady atmosphere of Beijing or Shanghai. For example, like much of the country, Gansu Province, at China&apos;s geographical centre, is grappling with structural and social problems that range from the daunting to the apparently insuperable. Average annual output per capita is about $900, and incomes among the peasants who make up most of its rural population of 26 million are less than $250. Gansu&apos;s challenges range from modernising its heavy industries to resisting desertification and the encroachment of the Gobi desert. While it has been making slow but steady progress, its future is clouded by worsening water shortages; though it straddles the Yellow river, the water table is dwindling fast. Back in Beijing, the chief preoccupation is to safeguard 11% GDP growth while assuaging western governments. By the end of this year, China&apos;s exports will be 24% higher than in 2006, at $1.2 trillion, and its trade surplus will have grown by 43%. But trade will probably not be the main worry for China&apos;s international relations. Trouble seems more likely to come from growing concern in the west over climate change. Political leaders in EU capitals and the US may be well aware of China&apos;s global economic importance, but the widespread public perception is that its factories are dirty and environmentally harmful. Rows over product safety and intellectual piracy could all too easily fuel calls for tough new trade limits. The answer is not for China to step up its public-relations effort. Instead, it should be revealing its weaknesses and vulnerabilities to gain western understanding. That really would be a cultural revolution.

Today a host of British actors and directors, young and not so young, famous and less familiar, will be hoping to tread a similar path to international acclaim. Following recent wins for Vera Drake and The Queen, four out of the 22 films competing for the festival&apos;s main award, the Golden Lion, have British directors. Alongside the relative newcomer Joe Wright, whose adaptation of Ian McEwan&apos;s Atonement opens the 64th annual festival, are three veterans of British cinema. Kenneth Branagh directs Michael Caine and Jude Law in a Harold Pinter-penned version of Anthony Shaffer&apos;s Sleuth, while Peter Greenaway is trying his luck with Nightwatching, which investigates Rembrandt&apos;s romantic and professional life and stars Martin Freeman, best known as Tim from The Office. Ken Loach offers It&apos;s A Free World, a look at migrant workers in the UK, a film not set for a cinema release and airing first on Channel 4. Alex Cox&apos;s low-budget comedy Searchers 2.0 is competing in the Orizzonti/Horizons section - which aims to provide an overview of new trends in cinema - as is Penny Woolcock&apos;s epic feature Exodus, which transplants the biblical story to the derelict Dreamland funfair in the English coastal town of Margate. Out of the main competition is up-and-coming British director Asif Kapadia with Far North. The English roll-call comes in contrast to this year&apos;s Cannes festival, which was almost a washout for UK talent. &quot;This year looks very, very impressive for British directors,&quot; said Nick James, editor of Sight and Sound magazine. &quot;After the amazing success we had last year with the Queen and Paul Greengrass&apos;s United 93 doing so well, this year was in danger of looking weaker. But I think it&apos;s one of the best Venice line-ups I have seen in the past few years in terms of how good it might be.&quot; Apart from the strong British presence, the other notable aspect of this year&apos;s Venice festival is that American directors have started to make films dissecting the Iraq war. Scarface and Mission: Impossible director Brian De Palma has made Redacted, a montage of stories about US soldiers fighting in the Iraq conflict. Paul Haggis, who won multiple Oscars for Crash in 2006, directs In the Valley of Elah, which stars Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon as a married couple who work with Charlize Theron&apos;s police detective to uncover the truth behind their son&apos;s disappearance following his return from a tour of duty in Iraq. Although Venice is smaller than Cannes, in recent years it has been a good indicator of who and what may go on to win Oscars. Last year Helen Mirren won best actress and went on to win the same gong at the Oscars. James said Venice is now actively looking to accept good films that were either rejected by Cannes or weren&apos;t quite ready in time. &quot;In recent years Venice has been lucky in picking great films that were rejected by Cannes, which went on to be very successful, like Brokeback Mountain and Good Night And Good Luck.&quot; One award that has already been announced is the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement, which has been given to the director Tim Burton.

The rise of the mobile phone fascinates him, and he is one of many sages predicting that it will soon become the most important way of using the internet.  &quot;The internet on mobile is really dramatic. First of all, it expands the potential user population by a factor of two instantly. Second, it forces us to rethink how we present our applications. The extra functionality of a mobile brings possibilities that even a laptop doesn&apos;t have.&quot;  There has been plenty of speculation about Google&apos;s plans to move into the mobile market, but Cerf refuses to confirm or deny whether there is really a Google phone in the offing.  &quot;I&apos;m actually interested in people thinking about the mobile as a controller for lots of other devices,&quot; he says. &quot;Most of the focus so far has been about how we access Google services on a device.&quot;  But while the future seems bright, Cerf suggests that there are still going to be plenty of problems along the way. One is that broadband providers in the US are lobbying for the right to give some web traffic preferential treatment in return for cash, while UK internet companies have started grumbling about the bandwidth used by peer-to-peer video systems such as the BBC iPlayer.  &quot;I&apos;m not confident,&quot; he says, with a look of concern. His vision of the net is based on it remaining entirely neutral and open - but that&apos;s not what everybody has in mind for the future. &quot;When you have incumbents that have enormous market power - or even potentially monopoly control - the temptation is overwhelming to take control of that capability and to inhibit competition. This is why I am of the opinion that you sometimes need regulation to ensure fair competition.&quot;  He is also concerned that there needs to be better coordination between governments if the net is going to remain viable: &quot;There are a variety of problems that the internet poses - public protection, law enforcement - and that does require international cooperation.&quot; Groups such as Interpol show the way forward, he says, but admits that things get trickier when governments treat the net as something to be feared and controlled.  Online censorship is a hot topic since the World Organisation for Human Rights announced it was suing Yahoo! on behalf of Chinese pro-democracy campaigners who were imprisoned after the Silicon Valley company handed their identities over to the government. As a net libertarian, it clearly pains Cerf to think about the relationship with the Chinese authorities, particularly the controversial decision by Google to launch a censored version of its index inside China. Chinese puzzle &quot;We debated it for a long time before finally deciding that it was in our business interests, and in the Chinese people&apos;s interest, to have some form of Google service there. I have this perhaps naive hope that the Chinese government will become more comfortable with it - there&apos;s a definitely softening among ordinary people. &quot;When I go to Beijing or Shanghai I hear normal people talking among themselves and criticising the government: that wouldn&apos;t have happened before.&quot;  But even if he remains optimistic, the grand old man of the net recognises that such a process could be very, very slow. &quot;It&apos;s like the Grand Canyon - it started off as a river on a plain, but eventually dug down until it was a mile deep.&quot; Suddenly a wry smile breaks out across his face. &quot;That process only took 235m years ...

But he is still surprised by what it has become. &quot;I have been astonished by the number of devices out there,&quot; he says. &quot;I never anticipated in 1973 that somebody would build an internet-enabled refrigerator, but the guy that takes the cake is the guy who invented an internet-enabled surfboard.&quot; Now he can operate as (in his words) an &quot;intellectual bumblebee&quot;, Cerf&apos;s latest interest is the mobile net. The rise of the mobile phone fascinates him, and he is one of many sages predicting that it will soon become the most important way of using the internet. &quot;The internet on mobile is really dramatic. First of all, it expands the potential user population by a factor of two instantly. Second, it forces us to rethink how we present our applications. The extra functionality of a mobile brings possibilities that even a laptop doesn&apos;t have.&quot; There has been plenty of speculation about Google&apos;s plans to move into the mobile market, but Cerf refuses to confirm or deny whether there is really a Google phone in the offing. &quot;I&apos;m actually interested in people thinking about the mobile as a controller for lots of other devices,&quot; he says. &quot;Most of the focus so far has been about how we access Google services on a device.&quot; But while the future seems bright, Cerf suggests that there are still going to be plenty of problems along the way. One is that broadband providers in the US are lobbying for the right to give some web traffic preferential treatment in return for cash, while UK internet companies have started grumbling about the bandwidth used by peer-to-peer video systems such as the BBC iPlayer. &quot;I&apos;m not confident,&quot; he says, with a look of concern. His vision of the net is based on it remaining entirely neutral and open - but that&apos;s not what everybody has in mind for the future. &quot;When you have incumbents that have enormous market power - or even potentially monopoly control - the temptation is overwhelming to take control of that capability and to inhibit competition. This is why I am of the opinion that you sometimes need regulation to ensure fair competition.&quot; He is also concerned that there needs to be better coordination between governments if the net is going to remain viable: &quot;There are a variety of problems that the internet poses - public protection, law enforcement - and that does require international cooperation.&quot; Groups such as Interpol show the way forward, he says, but admits that things get trickier when governments treat the net as something to be feared and controlled. Online censorship is a hot topic since the World Organisation for Human Rights announced it was suing Yahoo! on behalf of Chinese pro-democracy campaigners who were imprisoned after the Silicon Valley company handed their identities over to the government. As a net libertarian, it clearly pains Cerf to think about the relationship with the Chinese authorities, particularly the controversial decision by Google to launch a censored version of its index inside China. Chinese puzzle &quot;We debated it for a long time before finally deciding that it was in our business interests, and in the Chinese people&apos;s interest, to have some form of Google service there. I have this perhaps na\u00efve hope that the Chinese government will become more comfortable with it - there&apos;s a definitely softening among ordinary people. &quot;When I go to Beijing or Shanghai I hear normal people talking among themselves and criticising the government: that wouldn&apos;t have happened before.&quot; But even if he remains optimistic, the grand old man of the net recognises that such a process could be very, very slow. &quot;It&apos;s like the Grand Canyon - it started off as a river on a plain, but eventually dug down until it was a mile deep.&quot; Suddenly a wry smile breaks out across his face. &quot;That process only took 235m years ...

You ask about a teenager with no experience and you are quoted \u00a35m, maybe more. You can go abroad and buy an international who can go straight into the team for half that price&apos;. &quot;Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has expressed the same view, and Sven-Goran Eriksson said he inquired about four English players this summer but was quoted prices that were &quot;through the roof&quot;. So he got Martin Petrov, a winger with 66 caps who has played in the top divisions in Germany and Spain, for the same price Sunderland paid for Kieran Richardson. You can&apos;t argue with that.&quot; &quot;And I wouldn&apos;t,&quot; my friend said. &quot;But what I would ask is: why are British players so much more expensive? &quot;Could it be a question of supply and demand? Has the global clamour for British talent created a world shortage? Are we feeling the effects of the emerging Chinese and Indian leagues and their gargantuan appetites for the raw materials strip-mined from proud Albion&apos;s hillsides by our club academies? Is the price of Newcastle reject Michael Chopra, like that of scrap metal, being pushed ever upwards by the thrusting technocrats of Shanghai and Mumbai? &quot;A look at the situation abroad suggests not. British players in Serie A: nil. British players in La Liga: nil. British players in the Bundesliga: nil. British players in whatever the name of the French league is: nil. I think we can conclude that the demand for British players outside these islands is more or less nonexistent. &quot;And on these shores? Well, the fact that at least once a week somebody blames the demise of the national team on the number of foreigners playing in the Premier League suggests that nobody here much wants them either. &quot;Unless, of course, this absence is due to a shortage of British players. But a wander round the local park on a Sunday morning suggests not. No, there are tens of thousands of British footballers available for hire, all more than capable of sauntering about for 90 minutes, bellowing &quot;In the channels, Andy&quot;, &quot;Communication!&quot; and &quot;Tempo, lads, tempo&quot; while occasionally pointing at the spot where they think the pass ought to have been played. &quot;Are they then more talented than the foreign imports? Is that why they cost more? I hardly need go into that. &quot;We can also rule out an altruistic desire on the part of our clubs to preserve the British footballer from extinction in much the same way the World Wildlife Fund battles to save Leadbeater&apos;s possum and the monkey-eating eagle. I can therefore offer only one conclusion. It is this: You know that a large bag of nutritious fresh food bought from the local market will cost less than a load of junk from the corner shop, yet on occasion you go to the corner shop for your meal. Why? Because you can pop along in your slippers and be back in time for Football Focus. Ease and idleness overrides financial and nutritional sense.&quot; &quot;So what you are saying,&quot; I said, &quot;is that in spending \u00a313m on Kieron Dyer and Scott Parker, Alan Curbishley has effectively purchased a spicy Pot Noodle and one of those gooey individual cheesecakes with the strawberry topping that tastes vaguely of iron filings from the nearest Spar or Londis?&quot; &quot;Perhaps,&quot; my friend replied, &quot;though we shall have to let time be the judge of that.&quot; And with a wave of his hand he was gone.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-30T23:55:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/aug/31/heymusiciansleavethatfilm", "sentences": ["It&apos;s well-known that we journalists are filth who hate life and ourselves, and there&apos;s nothing we like better than when a Shanghai Surprise or Under The Cherry Moon falls into our lap for a critical mauling."], "title": "Hey, musicians, leave that film alone!", "article": "A movie kind of love ... David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth In the business they call &quot;show&quot;, a good-natured optimism prevails. Despite the patchy-at-best record of musicians trying their hand at acting, they still keep lining them up and casting them. This week alone, David Bowie looks set to appear in Dr Who as an alien, while the makers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer spin-off Ripper are lining up Peter Doherty to play a zombie, presumably after watching a Babyshambles gig. Bowie of course is no stranger to the dramatic arts. Last seen abusing Ricky Gervais in song, he made his bones with The Man Who Fell to Earth, although the undoubted pinnacle of his acting career was voicing a character for SpongeBob SquarePants. The 80s saw a telling performance from David Essex in Silver Dream Racer. Whatever our feelings on his performance, his stunt double certainly knew how to ride. Your musician often has difficulty grasping the concept less-is-more when it comes to acting, something illustrated by the tragic case of Kyle MacLachlan murdering little-known rocker Sting for overacting in Dune. And who can forget Jason Orange&apos;s performance in Lynda La Plante&apos;s critically panned Killer Net? Everyone apart from me, apparently. There are the successes, of course. Mark Wahlberg was a lousy rapper yet proves himself an increasingly impressive actor, and his Three Kings co-star Ice Cube has a series of strong performances under his belt. Indeed, rappers in general seem to make the transition better than rockers, with Mos Def, Tupac Shakur, Sticky Fingaz, Queen Latifah, Will Smith, LL Cool J and Ice T all putting in highly creditable performances. I&apos;ll be honest - I admire any musician willing to put their reputation on the line in the name of expanding their artistic horizons.

Ang Lee&apos;s censor-bating Lust, Caution. The deceptively mild-mannered Ang Lee is set to provoke a censorship row with his new feature, Lust, Caution (which received its world premiere in Venice yesterday). The Mandarin-language espionage thriller might best be described as a cross between Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Notorious and Nagisa Oshima&apos;s In the Realm Of the Senses. It&apos;s clearly the very graphic sex sequences that have earned the film its NC-17 rating in the US, where it will be released later this autumn. Generally, when mainstream directors receive NC-17 ratings, they promptly retreat. The label is regarded as a kiss of death for US releases, and most cinema chains refuse to show films branded with it. Lee, however, is reportedly insisting that his film is shown in its full 156-minute glory. It&apos;s a magnificent piece of filmmaking, albeit one that takes some time to click into gear. Other directors condense huge novels into tidy 90-minute features. Lee&apos;s method is to take short stories and slowly expand them into epics. This is what he did with Brokeback Mountain. It is a trick he has performed again with Lust, Caution, based on a short story by Eileen Chang. The richness of his approach lies, as ever, in his painstaking attention to detail and his ability to register the most subtle nuances of tone and expression. This, though, isn&apos;t what will sell the movie or provoke outraged comment. Nor will the extraordinarily prolonged and bloody scene in which the student protagonists kill a man for the first time. (They stab him, bludgeon him, throw him down the stairs, but still he refuses to die.) What are bound to cause controversy are the extraordinarily graphic sex sequences. The film tells the story of a young drama student, Wang Jiazhi (Tang Wei), drawn into a plot to assassinate the shadowy Mr Yee (Tony Leung), a collaborator with the Japanese in the Shanghai of the early 1940s. Mr Yee is a cold and brutal man. While his wife (Joan Chen) and her friends play Mah Jong and discuss their favourite restaurants, he oversees the torture and killing of resistance fighters. Wang is ordered to get close to Mr Yee in order to prise him out into the open. In the end, they begin a very violent, sado-masochistic affair. Their feelings for one another teeter between love and utter loathing. They instinctively distrust one another but can&apos;t hide their mutual fascination. At times, it is as if they hope that through their extreme and acrobatic sex together they can finally work out each others&apos; motives and true personality. This is as much a tale of amour-fou as it is a thriller. What is likely to make Lust, Caution difficult for the US censors to push under the carpet is its sheer artistry. This is palpably not an exploitation picture. The sex - which isn&apos;t shown until relatively late in the movie - is not gratuitous but is fundamental to the characterisation of the two leads. To cut it would be to undermine a core part of the storytelling. Thanks to Lee&apos;s reputation (topped by that directing Oscar for Brokeback Mountain), Lust, Caution now stands at least a chance of becoming one of the first NC-17 title to be taken seriously and contend for major awards. As a foreign language movie, it remains a tough sell. Nonetheless, you won&apos;t see many performances this year that are better than Tony Leung&apos;s chilling but melancholy turn as the mysterious Mr Yee.", "tags": ["Lust, Caution", "Film", "Culture", "Censorship"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-31T12:19:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/02/festivals.venicefilmfestival2007", "sentences": ["Actually, we had to - the sex in Lust, Caution doesn&apos;t happen for ages as Lee first meticulously re-creates Shanghai during the Japanese occupation of the Second World War and switches back several years to the colonial sophistication of Hong Kong for a Mata Hari-style story of spies and, eventually, sex.", "Three years later, the action relocates to war-torn Shanghai, and the Resistance urge her to rekindle her seduction."], "title": "Jason Solomons in Venice: Spies, lies, and enough sex to frighten the reindeer", "article": "Ang Lee&apos;s Brokeback Mountain took its first, foal-like steps at Venice two years ago, testing the waters for a gay cowboy movie, seeing whether the mainstream might accept such a thing. It galloped to the Golden Lion and had progressed to a canter by the time of the Oscars, where Lee won Best Director before being pipped to the post by Crash So Lee chose to unveil his latest on the Lido and the sumptuous Lust, Caution was hotly anticipated especially as US censors, apparently perturbed by some sexual content, had saddled it with a NC-17 certificate just moments before its premiere. Sexier than Heath and Jake rustling under canvas? We couldn&apos;t wait. Actually, we had to - the sex in Lust, Caution doesn&apos;t happen for ages as Lee first meticulously re-creates Shanghai during the Japanese occupation of the Second World War and switches back several years to the colonial sophistication of Hong Kong for a Mata Hari-style story of spies and, eventually, sex. Lee&apos;s new star Tang Wei is a revelation and a cert for Best Actress in her first film. She plays a young student who discovers a talent for acting after encouragement from an idealistic and handsome theatre director. After an ecstatic reception to a political play, he convinces the troupe they should put their thespian skills to a more subversive test - to kill a wealthy Hong Kong businessman (the magnificent Tony Leung, from In the Mood for Love) they&apos;re convinced is a spy. In a succession of charming scenes, the innocent Wei has to learn about sex (and lose her virginity) before she&apos;s ready to seduce Leung. But just as she&apos;s ignited his interest, the war intervenes. Three years later, the action relocates to war-torn Shanghai, and the Resistance urge her to rekindle her seduction. This is when the sex explodes and the boundaries blur as they fall for each other. It is steamy stuff, occasionally verging on the rough, though nothing too scandalous - Lee, after all, is a tasteful director. There&apos;s a delicious, complex shot of Wei smiling after their first encounter - is it the accomplishment of her first orgasm or the smirk of a dutiful secret agent who has captured her target? Shot by Mexico&apos;s Rodrigo Prieto, this is a beautiful cinematic experience, an old-fashioned, handsome picture that nods to the seductive power of movies - posters for Destry Rides Again here, a clip of Ingrid Bergman sobbing there - indeed, it&apos;s on the way to the pictures that Leung first instructs his chauffeur to bring Wei to the secret apartment that will become their sex nest. Lust, Caution is like a Ming vase, though, and while it&apos;s a wondrous object to behold, it somehow lacks a sense of passion. Perhaps I wanted more of the Lust and less of the Caution. Lee&apos;s film made an interesting companion to Joe Wright&apos;s Atonement which opened the festival and is also a tale of lust and love cut short by war and lies. I think it&apos;s a wonderful film and an extremely moving one. There&apos;s a lot of war out here. Brian De Palma&apos;s Redacted is a marked change from his Black Dahlia, which opened last year&apos;s festival. Set in Iraq among a troop of soldiers manning a checkpoint, it details a terrible (though fictional) episode of rape and murder perpetrated by two soldiers on a 15-year-old Muslim girl. But De Palma is more concerned with using various media to tell his story, showing events through a pretentious French documentary; a soldier&apos;s video diary; US security cameras; terrorist websites; TV news crews; an army wife&apos;s tearful blog; and several YouTube clips. He might have worked a few Hollywood film crews in there too, given how many studio-backed films now appear to be tackling the current war. As it is, the film isn&apos;t particularly well acted and relies on irritating improv (i.e. it feels scripted) while it also loses focus. Yes, this is a stupid war. Yes, there are lots of media outlets. And people are dying on both sides. Venice fave George Clooney nipped down from his Lake Como villa to present Michael Clayton, in which he plays a corporate lawyer who develops a conscience when he realises he&apos;s working for bad guys, people whose fertiliser has harmed crops and innocent farm folk. Though stylishly lit by Clooney&apos;s Good Night and Good Luck camerman Robert Elswit, it&apos;s poorly edited and tries too hard to be a Seventies-style conspiracy thriller - it even co-stars Sydney Pollack. Perhaps most disappointingly, George is slightly underpowered here, a bit too much Danny Ocean and not enough Erin Brockovich. It might soon be time to decide: does he want to act or be a politician? Jude Law so desperately wants to act that, having tried Alfie, he&apos;s given himself the juicy Michael Caine role in a self-produced remake of that 1972 two-hander Sleuth. Caine in turn takes the Larry Olivier role while Harold Pinter has given Anthony Schaffer&apos;s script a rejig. Kenneth Branagh directs - how could it fail? Let me count the ways. Although well received by the Italians, Sleuth was excruciating, like some dreadful school play in which the old English teacher (Caine) has a go and the golden head boy (Jude) embarrasses himself. A tasteless set, dated dialogue and flailing direction add to the misery. My favourite surprise so far has been Asif Kapadia&apos;s Far North. The young British director pits the unlikely Sean Bean and Michelle Yeoh alongside newcomer Michelle Krusiec in a bizarrelove triangle set among reindeer and ice floes in a stunningly photographed Arctic. Like his debut The Warrior, it&apos;s about survival, fate, the natural and the supernatural, a film not afraid to be bloody and brutal, showing animals killed as in old-school geography books rather than eco-sensitive modern wildlife docs. But it&apos;s the shock ending that set people talking over the first few days here. It&apos;s a coup that establishes Kapadia as one of our most interesting story-tellers - a quite amazing, horrifying moment but, of course, I can&apos;t mention it.

The fans love Murray here, and he loves them, but they were not about to stand for such petulance in adversity. It was an insignificant little incident, and Murray had genuinely been worried about injuring himself in such a situation, hence the swipe at the bin, but it was nevertheless symptomatic of the frustration that the youngster was experiencing. Lee played exceptionally well, barely making a mistake until the third set, yet had Murray&apos;s game been at the same level as the opening three months of the year, when he entered the top 10 for the first time, he might have won with something to spare. It was probably always too much to expect, given the amount of play he has missed since injuring his wrist in mid-May, including the French Open and Wimbledon, that he could emulate or better his run to the fourth round last year, but he was understandably disappointed. &quot;It&apos;s my favourite tournament, and this is where I feel I can play my best tennis,&quot; he said. However, he knew well enough that practice, no matter how assiduous, is no substitute for match play, and against Lee his timing frequently deserted him, albeit under considerable and sustained pressure. Too many missed lines with his forehand, too many backhands buried halfway up the net. He may have gained mental fortitude from having to cope with the wrist injury but undoubtedly it set his game a few steps back. And so it is time to move on, see the season out, and regroup for next year when the Australian Open will be of huge importance. Murray played some exceptional tennis in Melbourne this year and was two sets to one up under the floodlights in the Rod Laver Arena against Rafael Nadal, the world No2, in the fourth round before losing in five. That will be the benchmark next January. The target he and his coach, Brad Gilbert, had set this year was to qualify for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. &quot;I would definitely have been in with a shot if it hadn&apos;t have been for the injury, and that&apos;s pretty hard. The whole thing has been disappointing, and at my age harder to deal with. I tried to stay positive but it was difficult. Maybe the older you get the easier it is to cope because you have more experience and you&apos;re more mature. I&apos;m just happy I managed to get back here playing good tennis.&quot; Now Murray&apos;s principal focus will be Britain&apos;s Davis Cup world group play-off match at Wimbledon against Croatia this month, an occasion which will be emotionally charged because of Tim Henman retiring afterwards. &quot;I can&apos;t wait. Everyone is going to want to win for Tim. I&apos;m hoping the way I play will show him what his career meant to my development and me. He&apos;s been great to me since I came on the tour and beating Croatia would be a great way for him to finish. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want to have any excuse going into the tie because obviously I&apos;d like to play my best for him. It would be a great way for him to finish his career and I think we&apos;ve got a great chance of winning.&quot; After that Murray will play the two Masters Series events in Madrid and Paris, as well as two smaller tournaments in Moscow and St Petersburg, before preparing with Gilbert for next year when he will hope to be free of all injuries to make the sort of breakthrough that Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic, one week younger and already the world No3, has made. Murray believes his relationship with Gilbert, which began in July last year, is now much stronger. &quot;You learn a lot about someone when you are going through tough times,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve had a few long chats with Brad and I think the relationship is much stronger than it was before I had the injury.&quot; Murray has also assured himself that his physical fitness, very much the topic of conversation when he joined the ATP Tour, is no longer an issue. &quot;I wasn&apos;t particularly happy with my game but I was happy with the way my body felt and the way that I was fighting,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d worked hard on my strength during my time off, so there were no excuses for me being in bad shape. &quot;I&apos;m just going to work on my game a lot over the next few weeks or months and really try and improve the things that I wasn&apos;t doing well in this tournament. Obviously I would have liked to have done better but I just couldn&apos;t do it. My timing was just a little bit off.&quot; It was nothing compared with Maria Sharapova, the women&apos;s world No2 and the reigning champion, who went out in the third round against the 18-year-old Pole Agnieszka Radwanska and sprayed balls all over the Arthur Ashe stadium.

As for Venus and Serena, they moved closer to a sibling semi-final, with Venus pounding Serbia&apos;s Ana Ivanovic, the No5 seed, 6-4, 6-2 and Serena defeating the Wimbledon runner-up Marion Bartoli of France 6-3, 6-4.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "US Open Tennis 2007", "Andy Murray"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-02T23:32:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/sep/03/whatarebritainsugliesthotels", "sentences": ["And top of my fantasy list would be the Grand Hyatt at the top of SOM&apos;s Jin Mao tower in Shanghai, which gives you an incredible 87th floor view of the world&apos;s most dynamic city."], "title": "Which are Britain's ugliest hotels?", "article": "The Tower Bridge Hilton, London: to their credit, the chain has attempted to do something better here I&apos;ve named and shamed a few appallingly designed hotels today, but I could have listed plenty more.

If there is a smidgen of encouragement for Roddick it is that against both Isner, and Spain&apos;s Feliciano L\u00f3pez in the fourth round last night, the Swiss lost the opening set, something he has not done in consecutive matches in any slam since the 2002 US Open. Roddick needs to get in Federer&apos;s face from the opening minutes. Working under the guidance of Jimmy Connors, five times a US Open champion, the American gave a much improved performance in last year&apos;s final, and then had three match points against Federer during the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. He believed he was closing the gap, only to be blown away 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 in the semi-finals of this year&apos;s Australian Open. Roddick remains damaged goods in American eyes, a one-slam wonder whose title here in 2003 is deemed by most to be his last. He saved himself some energy in the fourth round when Tomas Berdych pulled out in the second set with breathing difficulties. &quot;I don&apos;t know if it will help being fresh against Roger. All I know is that it&apos;s better than being dead tired,&quot; said Roddick. &quot;I&apos;m excited, and the crowd will be electric. I expect a lot of myself, although I don&apos;t really think anybody else does.&quot;", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "US Open Tennis 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-04T23:01:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/05/travelwebsites.beijing", "sentences": ["Fresh satellite imagery for Beijing and Shanghai was added in August."], "title": "Blog by blog guide to \u2026 Beijing", "article": "Google Maps Mania Let&apos;s get our bearings.

What happens when a school really lets its pupils down: when the walls collapse sideways and the heavy tiled roof pancakes down in a couple of seconds? These questions are not hypothetical. On October 8 2005, some 10,000 schools in Pakistan were hit by a severe earthquake. Around 17,000 children died. In Aceh, Sumatra, the tsunami of December 26, 2004 destroyed 420 schools, killed 1,000 teachers and may have killed more than 70,000 children. Schools collapsed and children died when a severe earthquake shook Izmit in Turkey in 1999. Earthquakes don&apos;t kill, buildings do. Buildings can be constructed in ways that should withstand even quite severe shocks. But, according to Chandra Bhakuni, a young structural engineer now working in Britain who has just launched an online earthquake risk calculator, all too often they are not. He worked in Gujarat for three years after the earthquake of January 2001 in which 20,000 people died. Luckily, it was national republic day - a holiday for most - but even so 1,000 schoolchildren were reported dead. He got involved in the reconstruction projects: he looked at risk and hazard in places like Himachal Pradesh and the Andaman Islands, and, he tells me, the reason the children died in India was because the schools were irresponsibly designed and badly constructed. Schoolchildren probably died in Turkey, Iran and Pakistan for much the same reasons. None of these deaths was inevitable and it might not have cost very much more to have made the schools a lot safer when they were first built. The challenge of safety in public buildings isn&apos;t simple - the effects of earthquake are capricious, and the levels of loss vary according to the bedrock, the season and time of day - and systematic research into school safety is a relatively recent thing. But the topic has now gone planet-wide. Academics have launched a global coalition for school safety. The UN has an international strategy for disaster reduction and its secretariat has taken up the theme. Unesco offices in Bangkok and Djakarta have produced an educational game called Disaster Master. There are several challenges: one is to educate children about earthquakes and other natural hazards, and - through them - perhaps educate the parents. If kids know what to do during an earthquake then lives will be saved. If parents become aware that their children are at risk, maybe they will put pressure on the schools, and perhaps, too, they themselves will start to take disaster prevention seriously. The other big push is to make sure the school buildings can survive a severe shock. &quot;It&apos;s still a mish-mash,&quot; Chandra Bhakuni tells me. &quot;To add to the confusion, sometimes unintentional bad design and construction elements of a building actually help it withstand the damage. It is also important to recognise that, in an earthquake, not all the buildings fall, therefore not all of them will kill.&quot; He produces some hypothetical calculations to make his point. In any earthquake, anywhere, it is the worst five per cent of the buildings that collapse into rubble and cause more than 75% - maybe 95% - of the deaths. So the trick would be to start by identifying the most dangerous 5%, or perhaps at least the most vulnerable 20%. &quot;I personally believe that the first step should be to make the buildings safe so that the softer measures such as drills and education can be fully utilised. However, again, we don&apos;t know which buildings may fall and which may not.&quot; Earthquakes are only part of the story. There are natural hazards everywhere: from tropical storm, flood, wildfire, volcanic eruption, avalanche, mudslide, and so on. There are more potential victims than ever: a global population increase of more than 80 million people a year amplifies the chances that the next big disaster will be even worse than the previous one, simply because each year brings more potential victims. More and more people have moved into the cities, and many of these are at risk because they have crowded into shantytowns, on unstable hillsides or in the flood zones. Swiftly-growing cities like Tokyo, Mumbai, Shanghai, Jakarta and Dhaka are simultaneously vulnerable to earthquake, cyclone, tsunami and storm surge. So the dangers are growing, and they could multiply even further because it seems fairly clear that the frequency of some climate related natural hazards is increasing, thanks to global warming. Anyone worried about how to save lives, protect incomes and relieve poverty might think it a good idea to start with education. But that, of course, also means making sure that the schools are safe places for the kids even before the lessons begin. This is not simply a problem for the poorer regions of the planet: schoolchildren are also at risk from earthquakes in New Zealand, California and Japan; schools are as likely to catch fire in Greece or Portugal as they are in Nigeria. And Britons who were around in the sixties will remember with sadness that landslides are a hazard even in those countries that don&apos;t have mountains.

Li Jian, the driver, is getting impatient: we&apos;re going to be late. Mother has come out for a last goodbye. She is leaning against the doorframe, tears running down her face. She has devoted herself to me, her only son. In China, it&apos;s the son who continues the family line; the son who is showered with love; the son who matters most. And now she is about to lose her son and gain another daughter. Li Jian taps his watch. &quot;We have to go.&quot; It is 1995 and we have just celebrated Chinese New Year. I turn 28 in August. At the Hospital of the Perfumed Hills, Dr Yang shows me her collection of silicone breasts. I prod the largest one as if I were shopping for fruit. That&apos;s the one I want, but Dr Yang praises the elegance of the smallest one. No way! It is laughably flat, like a 15-year-old girl. But Dr Yang won&apos;t be swayed. They would bother you when you dance, she says. Before I&apos;m allowed anywhere near the scalpel, I must take a psychology test. If only 60% of your answers come up as &quot;feminine&quot;, you will not qualify for sex-reassignment surgery. If you hit 75%, you are encouraged to undergo &quot;re-masculinisation&quot; therapy - something I must avoid at all costs. Above 80% and surgery is recommended. I shoot for 80%. The result exceeds my expectations: 94%. The day after I have my first operation, I cup my hands around my new breasts, astonished. I can&apos;t believe that I have made the first step. I know there is a long way to go, but my childhood dream is finally becoming reality. I am six years old. I have just come home after watching a performance of The White-Haired Girl, one of communist China&apos;s first major ballets. I climb up onto my kang - my brick sleeping platform - peel off a pillowcase and make a headdress. Then I twirl round and round, pretending I am the white-haired heroine. Back in the real world I am a young boy again, living with my mother and my elder sister. We lodge with an old lady in a small Manchurian village about 100 kilometres from Shenyang. My parents are both Korean \u00e9migr\u00e9s. My mother and her sister fled Korea during the war, seeking refuge in northern China. It was there that she met my father, a handsome older officer in the People&apos;s Liberation Army of China. My sister Jin Xianglan was born in 1964 and I followed in 1967. Now, six years on, we are in the middle of the Cultural Revolution and my father works for the Regional War Office in Shenyang. The Red Guard denied my mother permission to live with him, so we see him only rarely. He is a &quot;red&quot;: in the army his nickname is Jin the Marxist-Leninist. My mother, however, is regularly accused of being a spy - in part because she is Korean and works as a Japanese translator, but also because when she first came to China she was given shelter by a known traitor. As a result, she must undergo interminable interrogations by the Red Guard every night. One day at school, five People&apos;s Liberation Army officers in full uniform appear and my name hisses through the loudspeaker. &quot;Jin Xing! Jin Xing is called to the director&apos;s office!&quot; The following day, the officers show up at our home. They introduce themselves to my parents, and explain that they have been impressed by my talent and would like to invite me to join the army&apos;s dance troupe. There were 13 of us boys, aged between nine and 17, and I was the youngest and smallest of the lot. At night we slept like spoons, seven boys in one bed and six in another. The official wake-up call was at 5.30am. Our blankets had to be tucked in with corners as sharp as blocks of tofu and our caps lined up perfectly on top. Then there was jogging, followed by an hour of indoor gymnastics. The gym was in a large auditorium, its ceiling supported by towering pillars. We were arranged into pairs and told to stand against a pillar, one on either side. The instruction came to stretch a leg up against the column until we were all doing the vertical splits. Then a series of pulleys were lowered from the ceiling next to each student and, to my horror, the teacher proceeded to attach them to our outstretched legs before giving the signal for the pulley to yank back upwards. Once at maximum stretch, our legs were bound to our pillar with rope and we were told to stand like that for 15 minutes before resuming the torture on the opposite leg. For two or three minutes you could hold it; it hurt, but it was bearable. After that, the ligaments started to rip and it was pure hell. I will never forget those screams as long as I live - like pigs being butchered! At 8am it was time for Russian ballet and Beijing Opera acrobatics. In the afternoons we had folk-dancing class, Beijing Opera class and, finally, drama class. I loved Russian ballet and excelled at folk dancing. But that was the girls&apos; speciality. As soon as the teacher left the room, I would scamper off to hang out with the girls, pirouetting on the other side of the curtain which divided our classes in two. Twice a year we boys went on manoeuvres. They were my worst nightmare. I was nine, I was small, I was skinny, and I felt like a little girl hiding inside a boy&apos;s body - don&apos;t count on me to defend the People&apos;s Republic! First there was the uniform: the waistband of the trousers came up to my neck and the jacket sleeves hung below my fingertips. Then there was the gun, which was taller than I was. We ended each session with hand grenades. Once the pin was out, we had 10 seconds to run for cover. I didn&apos;t have a lot of strength in my shoulders so I couldn&apos;t toss it very far, and I was terrified of dropping it too close to my feet and blowing myself up. By the age of 13 I was still much too short to perform any of the lead roles but the troupe&apos;s director, the great classical Chinese choreographer Mr Men Wenyan, took me under his wing. It was an honour to be singled out by Mr Men, yet I did not trust him. Although married, it was well known that he was gay. He would invite me to his place during the school&apos;s nap time - always while his wife was out at work and his children at school - on some pretext, such as wanting me to listen to some music. But I was smart and I found excuses. In spite of Mr Men&apos;s support, the directors of the troupe pushed me to join the scenic arts team. They just did not see me as a principal dancer: my physique was not manly enough. Luckily, as I grew older, my talent won through. After taking first prize in the national Students&apos; Cup I was promoted to senior officer and called to join the troupe which would perform in Paris at the French Communist Party&apos;s F\u00eate de l&apos;Humanit\u00e9. I am 17 and about to dance on an international stage! Rows of black suits fill the China Airlines plane. From where I sit, it looks like a funeral party. The entire delegation has been ordered to wear these badly cut, country-bumpkin suits. Amid the sea of black, I shine out in a superb three-piece suit in dazzling white, bought specially for the trip. At our hotel we are given two cans of Coca-Cola every day. I line them up, unopened, on my dresser, so I can take them back home. The sky is clearer in Paris, the air purer. The Parisians look happy. I stop at newsstands to look at magazines. I&apos;ve noticed some soft porn magazines and, while the others chat, I discreetly leaf through them. You can&apos;t find anything like that in China. I flick past the naked women and linger on the men. On my return to China, Mr Men invites me to choreograph a dance number with him and a teacher from the Beijing Dance Academy. At our hotel in Beijing, he sits on my bed and pats the space next to him. I dodge him as usual, but the next evening, I push open my door to find him waiting for me in the bedroom. He presses me against the wall. &quot;You are a very attractive boy, Jin Xing. Not only a talented dancer.&quot; He strokes my hand. I tell him he is my teacher, that I admire and respect him enormously but that this is not appropriate. To my great relief, we continue our rehearsals without problem. A few weeks later, Mr Men dangles in front of me the prospect of studying at the Dance Academy in Guangdong, where the Asian Cultural Council and the American Dance Festival are to run the first ever modern dance class in China. It will be taught by American instructors and the best student will be selected to continue their studies in the US. America! Cans of Coke multiply before my eyes. They appear dancing arabesques, fizzing over with the pressure of millions of trapped bubbles. But I am wary of Mr Men, who I know is trying to manipulate me into an affair. When I tell him that I will go to Guangdong, with or without his permission, a mask of fury grips his face. &quot;It&apos;s unthinkable for you to even consider leaving just when you will finally be of service to the army.&quot; But I am the PLA&apos;s star dancer. I won&apos;t be intimidated. &quot;Mr Men, my feelings towards you are those of a student towards his teacher. It is out of the question for me to sleep with you.&quot; He tips back his chair. &quot;I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. I am simply trying to protect your talent and your training.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t believe you. If you were concerned about my future, you would encourage me. I&apos;ll get there somehow.&quot; &quot;Not without my permission, you won&apos;t. I am the one who gives the orders, and if you persist in this vein you won&apos;t be dancing here any more either.&quot; His attack is strong - but I&apos;m ready. &quot;Mr Men, do you remember that evening in the hotel in Beijing, when you came to my room? Well, I taped our conversation. If you don&apos;t let me go, I will denounce you to the Director of Cultural Services.&quot; It&apos;s all bluff, of course. He chuckles with contempt. &quot;So you&apos;re threatening me, you little crook! You&apos;re a fool. I am the director of the troupe. Who do you think they&apos;ll believe, you or me?&quot; The next day I tell the Director of Cultural Services that I am tired of fending off Mr Men&apos;s advances and that I want to take the modern dance classes at the Guangdong Dance Academy but Mr Men won&apos;t allow me to go. The director wrings his hands and eventually agrees to my going, but for only a year. What comes as a great surprise in my first classes at Guangdong is that freedom of expression is not only allowed but encouraged by the American teachers. In traditional Chinese dance, emotions are codified and exaggerated - one &quot;plays&quot; anger, happiness or sadness. Anyway, military dance is essentially just propaganda; we personify valiant, warlike soldiers to inspire the troops. There can be no room for human sensibilities. It is a revelation to discover this, a whole new form. At the end of the school year I am chosen for the US fellowship. The only problem is that I don&apos;t have a passport. The army refuses my demobilisation and City Hall rejects my applications. My year in Guangdong is over and I&apos;ll have to go back to Shenyang and rejoin the army. I feel hopeless. Then the Academy calls. &quot;Your papers are ready.&quot; It&apos;s a miracle. By the end of the afternoon my American visa is glued into my brand-new passport. I am going to America! The Asian Cultural Council accommodation is on 15th Street near Seventh Avenue, halfway between Chelsea and Greenwich Village. It is a tiny studio apartment, right in the heart of Manhattan. A tall blonde, Eileen, comes to pick me up and take me to the bank. I need to apply for a bank account - this is a capitalist country, after all, unlike China where we regular mortals don&apos;t dream of having such things. When I pull out my chequebook at the supermarket I feel rich (even though I need Eileen&apos;s help to write my first cheque). And I&apos;m so excited by all the stuff they sell, especially the ice cream! Not knowing any English is no problem in my dance classes, but it does affect my social life. Little by little I start to recognise a few phrases, but I remain dumb as a carp. &quot;Would you like me to walk you back?&quot; John is balding, like Lenin, and he wears little wire-framed glasses. Not my type at all. He speaks fluent Chinese, however, and at the Chinese party to which we were both invited he doesn&apos;t leave my side all evening. Later, after a tour of the bars, he invites me to his place for a nightcap. I&apos;m not really attracted to him - I like big, tall, virile men - but I am curious. Western sexuality! It is the stuff of legends and I finally have the chance to experience it for myself. In China, I was entirely taken care of by either the army or the Dance Academy, and I never had to make any decisions. Here, I have to handle everything myself and there are endless choices to be made: this lover rather than that one; such and such a dance class; a dessert or a piece of fruit; one sexual orientation or another... All these options, all these limitless possibilities with their shimmering prospects - it&apos;s almost too much. I hold fast to my military discipline. Each morning I get up early to practise or go to classes. I audition with Martha Graham, Balanchine, Alvin Ailey, Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis. A dancer newly arrived from the People&apos;s Republic of China is a great curiosity. I know no one will hire me because they have been told by the President of the Asian Cultural Council that I have to return to China at the end of the year, but it does not stop me. I am going to take every last piece of knowledge and experience I can from my time here. I am at a rehearsal with the Nikolais/Louis Dance Company. I am very proud of my technique, but even when I perform the movements accurately, Murray Louis keeps criticising me. &quot;You are like a well-oiled machine; let the emotion through.&quot; I just don&apos;t seem to know how to be natural. One day, Murray Louis hands me a video tape. It&apos;s a video of his famous solo D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, or rather of Tremblement, its second movement. He choreographed and danced it himself at the age of 57, and the performance was a sensation in the United States. The tape begins to play. He stands alone on a bare stage, accompanied by a single Spanish guitar. His body barely moves; it seems to be animated only by one long, continuous shiver. It&apos;s extraordinary. Every afternoon, I rehearse and imitate the posture of a 57-year-old man. After a week, I present the solo to the class. All the students applaud. Murray Louis wipes his eyes. &quot;You know, internationally acclaimed dancers - the great Nureyev, for instance - have asked me for permission to perform it. But I&apos;ve always said no. To all of them I&apos;ve said that it isn&apos;t a dance, that it is the experience of a life. It&apos;s impossible to dance it under the age of 40. And you... how old are you?&quot; &quot;Twenty-one.&quot; &quot;Would you like to perform it on stage?&quot; All the New York critics are there on the night of the show. All I am aware of when my performance ends is the standing ovation which lasts longer than the four-minute solo. After that, every time I travel abroad I ask if I can perform Tremblement. For me, this solo is the epitome of the modern dance that I am only just beginning to understand. Springtime in New York. I count my remaining days. My return to China is planned for July 1 1989. I beg the Asian Cultural Council to let me stay, but it is out of the question. I can&apos;t remember who first tells me about Tian&apos;anmen Square but the news spreads through the ACC. Nobody knows exactly what&apos;s happening, only that the army has been sent in and the students have been shot down. The big news soon comes. &quot;There&apos;s a rumour that President Bush is offering Chinese students who were in the US before June 4 1989 the right to stay four more years. And then to get a green card.&quot; Most of us opt to stay, unable to refuse such a gift of fate. Without the Asian Cultural Council fellowship, my life becomes a patchwork of little jobs around which I barely manage to squeeze in my dance class and my practice. By turns I am a babysitter, handbag seller, packer at a Korean wholesale grocer, dishwasher, and waiter at a Chinese restaurant. After three months of this schedule, I quit the restaurant for a job at a leather-goods store in Greenwich Village, owned by a friend of my mother&apos;s. At least it&apos;s less tiring than waiting at tables. I begin the process of getting residency but I don&apos;t have the patience to jump through the hoops required. I want to be able to leave the States to tour and travel without worrying about my visa. To hell with the green card! In 1991 I choreograph the famous Chinese legend of Liang Shanpo and Zhu Yingtai for the American Dance Festival. I call my new work Half Dream. It tells the tragic tale of a young man, Liang Shanpo, who falls in love with his classmate Zhu Yingtai, a girl who has disguised herself as a boy. Half Dream evokes the surreal situation in which I find myself at this point in my life: midway between east and west, midway between man and woman. Over the following years I live, work and fall in love in Rome and Brussels, all the while secretly gathering information on sex-reassignment surgery. I don&apos;t go so far as dressing as a woman, but I do discreetly experiment with slightly feminine outfits. A pair of Jean Paul Gaultier cowboy boots with a stacked heel; a long, unisex-style coat. I let my hair grow long but I don&apos;t wear make-up. When I eventually revert to being a woman - and to me, it truly will be a reversion because in my heart and head I am already a woman - I will dress ultra-feminine. But for now I am still inhabiting a man&apos;s body. Finally, I am drawn back to Beijing. I was born in China, it is in China I must be reborn as a woman: I must go home. Back in Beijing I barely recognise my mother, her hair has turned so white in the past five years. &quot;Mum, don&apos;t you think it&apos;s weird that I have never had a girlfriend?&quot; I take her by surprise, but I need to deal with this. &quot;You have always been so devoted to your career. That&apos;s a good thing.&quot; &quot;Mum, please stop fooling yourself. Look at me.&quot; I take my long hair in my hands and fan it out over my shoulders. &quot;Don&apos;t you think I look like a woman?&quot; Her face doesn&apos;t betray a thing. &quot;Yes, especially with your hair long. We&apos;ve always said that, actually, since you were a little boy.&quot; &quot;Mum, it&apos;s because I am a woman. That&apos;s why. I was destined to be female.&quot; A shadow passes over her face. &quot;What are you talking about? You are a man.&quot; &quot;My body is a man&apos;s body, but in my head, in my soul, I am a woman. And I am going to become a woman.&quot; A frown cleaves her forehead and her hands clench between her knees. &quot;You can be gay. You wouldn&apos;t be the first one.&quot; &quot;Mum, I am not gay. I want to have a sex-change operation.&quot; &quot;But how?&quot; &quot;It&apos;s an operation that has been practised in the west for years.&quot; &quot;But it must be dangerous. You&apos;ll be risking your life, and what about your career? Could you still dance?&quot; &quot;Yes, of course.&quot; Dr Yang Peiying doesn&apos;t express any surprise when I explain the purpose of my visit, as though changing sex was the most ordinary thing in the world. In her office she asks me what I am hoping for. She has never performed sex-reassignment surgery, her only experience is with hermaphrodites, and yet I trust her immediately and entirely. I share my worries with her: my beard is very thick, my legs hairy. It is an ironic twist of fate that I have a lot of male hormones. But that doesn&apos;t bother her. &quot;Your chances are good. We can start the first operation whenever you are ready.&quot; My mother doesn&apos;t approve of my operation and neither does my friend, the pop singer Cheng Fangyuan, when I tell her. &quot;You are sick, Jin Xing. Do it later, maybe. But look, women are fascinated by you, and men are intrigued. If you become a woman, women won&apos;t want to be friends with you and guys won&apos;t be turned on by you any more. And as far as men, real men, go... Do you think they&apos;re going to want you? They want a natural woman, not... not...&quot; &quot;A fake one? Is that what you want to say?&quot; Cheng Fangyuan looks away, embarrassed. &quot;I don&apos;t care. I need to be true to myself, I need to feel at peace. I am ready to lose everything.&quot; Red lights flash across an electronic display unit. A throbbing pain grips my left leg, as if thousands of little needles are piercing the skin from my knee down to my foot. Under the sheet, it is so swollen that the ankle is bigger than my thigh. I have no sensation between my knee and my toes. The next day the swelling has still not subsided. The skin is so stretched it glistens with a purple sheen. A pinprick and the whole leg might explode. I don&apos;t even think about the 16-hour operation that has just taken place. Everything&apos;s fine on that front, the nurse tells me. Total success. Dr Yang arrives with a nurse. Her tired features light up when she sees me. &quot;Look at her,&quot; she says to the nurse. &quot;Her face has changed. She looks like a woman already. Don&apos;t you think? Congratulations!&quot; No need to congratulate me. I feel like neither woman nor man; I feel only excruciating pain. &quot;What about my leg?&quot; &quot;Your leg slipped off the iron stirrup and your calf was pressing against it for a while, which interrupted the flow of blood to the muscle.&quot; At the end of the day Dr Yang brings me the test results and the diagnosis. The nerves are dead from the calf down to the toes. That explains the lack of sensation. In cases like this it is difficult to regain the use of the leg. There are possible treatments, but at best I will limp till the end of my days. Sacrifice: the word comes to my mind like a bitter balm. It is such a transgression, this transformation from man to woman; why should I not expect to pay a price? For me it is a rebirth. I think of the way a woman&apos;s body is torn apart during labour, but it is my self - my true nature - that I am bringing forth into the world. It is a beautiful August day. I watch the magnificent landscape through the window of the car that takes me back to Beijing, my cane on my lap. I have managed to withstand the physical pain, but the psychological pain that society will inflict on me concerns me now. My friends are split into two camps: those who support me completely, and those who are critical. Their reactions are quite normal, of course; it would be strange if some people didn&apos;t disapprove, but I have not done anything illegal, even according to our stringently communist law-makers. The only people whom I believe are entitled to make demands are my parents, and they support me fully. When my father came back from Shenyang to inform me that he had managed to have my identity changed and all my documents were officially registered in a woman&apos;s name, he said to me, &quot;Be happy. Live your life.&quot; My father, Mr Conservative! I let my cane drop to the floor of the car. I swear to myself that I will get back on stage and show them all what I am capable of. I am still skinny and pale. I have straggly hairs on my face, I dress in long skirts and I wear very little make-up. I still don&apos;t know what kind of woman I want to be. I need to find out. My career is also uncertain. As far as the PLA is concerned, I left the army without authorisation, so they don&apos;t owe me anything. I will have to make my own way. I put together a modern dance show with my students and call it Half Dream, after the dance I created in America. It is the first major performance of modern dance in the People&apos;s Republic. It a huge success, and afterwards I am invited to choreograph some military shows in Manchuria. I land wearing a long overcoat and high-heeled boots, my hair hanging loose down my back. My old friends and teachers look at me sideways. Mr Men holds me tight in his arms. He invites me to sit down. &quot;You have no idea how much damage you did when you denounced me. I had to retire a year early without getting the promotion I was entitled to.&quot; My smile freezes on my lips. &quot;I asked you to let me go, but you refused.&quot; He sits up and hits the arm of his chair. &quot;Let&apos;s forget all that. I have too much affection for you. You are the best choreographer in China.&quot; &quot;You see,&quot; I say, &quot;I am not gay. I am a woman. If I hadn&apos;t gone to America, I would not be who I am today. You&apos;ve held a grudge against me, I know that. And I have hated you, too. But anger propels us forward in life.&quot; I hesitate for a moment. I might as well tell him the truth. &quot;You know that recording in the hotel room in Beijing, when you made a pass at me? I told you I would give the cassette to the Director? There never was any cassette. I was bluffing.&quot; The flash of anger in his eyes melts into admiration. &quot;Bastard!&quot; I am used to making myself up for the stage, but the business of wearing high heels, tight skirts and handbags requires a dexterity I had not, even with all my dance training, anticipated. I dress up too much and too well. I look like an Italian woman who shops in Las Vegas: make-up, miniskirts, pantyhose, long red nails and big rings. In China, that is way too far over the top! And yet somehow I need this staginess to convince myself and the world around me that I am a woman. It is almost like learning a part. First you have to collect the accessories, visualise the character, play it physically from the outside, and then, little by little, begin to inhabit her from the inside, more fully and honestly. To distract me during my long convalescence, I decide to establish a modern dance troupe, the Beijing Modern Dance Company, under the auspices of the Beijing Cultural Bureau. The rehearsals for our first show, Black And Red, are particularly exhausting, as I have decided to take on a dancing role, my first since the operation. I have to adapt the choreography to my diminished capabilities. &quot;Miss AC/DC plays Black And Red.&quot; Two weeks before the dress rehearsal this headline explodes on to the front page of the China Youth Daily and almost makes me suffocate with rage. I threaten to sue, and the next day the paper publishes an apology. But the journalist goes on the offensive again and this time he writes to the head of the Beijing Cultural Bureau to complain about a transsexual having the audacity to show herself on a Beijing stage. The director sends a delegation to the rehearsals to observe our work, and concludes that &quot;Jin Xing is a serious dancer and her company does quality work&quot;. But the battle is not yet won. Rumours abound that our show is anti-communist. In the offices of the Cultural Bureau, the clerk points to the headline in the China Youth Daily. &quot;Black and Red is a confusing title, don&apos;t you think? Couldn&apos;t it be an expression of antagonism between the Party and an opponent? Red, the Party; Black, the enemy of the people?&quot; Those civil servants are so literal I could cry. The show is a success, but a disgruntled dancer leads a mutiny against me. Faced with a lack of support from the Cultural Bureau, I resign. That is not the last of my career, however. In 2000 I produce a show called Shanghai Tango in Shanghai, and later I set up my own company, the Jin Xing Dance Theatre. My birthday is August 13. Years before, an astrologer told my mother I would have a child the year I turned 33 and, despite everything, she has continued to believe the prediction. Three days after my birthday, she calls to tell me that she has found a baby boy for me to adopt. We had talked about adoption a long time ago and this has been her plan all along. I can&apos;t describe it; I am overjoyed. His black hair is glued down with sweat and he gives off the musky smell of a young creature. His closed eyes are two tiny slits above the plump folds of his cheeks. His tiny fingers wrap around my index finger and a smile floats on his lips. His mother is a soldier in the People&apos;s Liberation Army. She is 21. His father is a married officer. She was hoping that the arrival of the baby would push him to divorce, but he changed his mind. My mother had been to visit a sick friend at the Beijing Naval Hospital the day the little boy was born, and the mother placed him in my mother&apos;s arms. &quot;Auntie, do you want him?&quot; asked the mother. &quot;Would you give him to me?&quot; &quot;Auntie, you are too old. How could you raise him?&quot; My mother is 63. She explains that he would not live with her, but with her daughter, who can&apos;t have children. Before Leo I was like a pretty kite that floated freely in the wind. Now Leo holds the kite strings with a firm hand. I come home to him every night and I don&apos;t party as I used to in Beijing. I produce Carl Orff&apos;s Carmina Burana with my dance company. Black and Red, Shanghai Tango and Carmina Burana are international productions, and we take them on tour both within Asia - to Korea, Hong Kong and Macau - and beyond, to Germany, France and Belgium. There are four of us in the family now. After Leo came Mimi. She was born in Shenyang, my hometown, also the product of a love affair that turned sour. My mother knew I wanted another child and, thank God, the single-child policy doesn&apos;t apply to adoptions. A year later, two friends of my mother&apos;s were talking about a student from Beijing University who was five months pregnant. The father was also a student. They could not keep the baby, and so Julian joined us. We call him Xiao Sir - Little Sir - because he is the youngest. Three children is a big responsibility. A single mother cannot quit her job, and it is a constant struggle to keep the dance company afloat - all my energy is devoted to the children and my work. In 2002 I buy a house in the former French Concession neighbourhood in the heart of Shanghai. It has a little garden. I have a pistachio-green Volkswagen Beetle which I drive to my studio at the Opera House each morning. One day I will put the Beetle into storage and then give it to Mimi as a present when she turns 18. Throughout my life, whenever I have wished very hard for something, my dream has come true. We all have the choice to get off one train and jump on to another heading for a more beautiful destination. By becoming a woman I have changed tracks. I had to do it. It was a difficult and treacherous journey, but that was the only way I could realise my childhood dream. And the arrival of the children has taken me to another platform.", "tags": ["Dance", "Culture", "Life and style", "Stage"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-07T23:04:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/08/china.jonathanwatts", "sentences": ["The highest-ranking official to fall from grace in the past year, Chen Liangyu - the former party chief of Shanghai - is to feel the wrath of China&apos;s justice system after accusations of keeping two mistresses and embezzling at least 3.5bn yuan (\u00a3230m)."], "title": "Concubine culture brings trouble for China's bosses", "article": "China&apos;s concubines have struck again. A corrupt senior official in Shaanxi province has been brought down by his 11 mistresses, according to reports in the state media yesterday. Pang Jiayu, the former deputy head of the provincial political advisory body, has been sacked and expelled from the Communist party after his former girlfriends exposed him, the People&apos;s Daily said. As at least the fourth cadre to lose his job in the past year as a result of accusations from &quot;second wives&quot;, Pang&apos;s case has prompted a flurry of reports in the domestic media about the resurgence of China&apos;s ancient concubine culture among corrupt officials. According to one recent survey, 90% of the senior officials convicted of serious corruption in the past five years kept mistresses. In many cases, they are accused of abusing their positions to make enough money to shower their lovers with gifts. It is hard to separate the salacious stories from political point scoring, but when a victim falls from grace, the accusations in the local media fly thick and fast. Mr Pang, 63, was the Communist party chief of Baoji city. His position gave him the power to decide the fate of his subordinates and the awarding of local development contracts. According to the People&apos;s Daily, he persuaded many of the most attractive and young wives of his employees to become his mistresses in return for &quot;big money projects&quot; for their husbands. Local media said Mr Pang earned the nickname &quot;mayor zipper&quot; in Baoji and city officials had a saying among themselves: &quot;No sacrifice [of one&apos;s wife], no gain.&quot; In one case, Mr Pang&apos;s wife and mistresses worked together on a water-diversion project that collapsed less than a year after the construction was finished, the paper said. His fate was sealed when several of his mistresses&apos; husbands were sentenced to death for bribery. The wives joined forces to denounce Pang, who would otherwise probably have escaped censure because of his political connections. With no independent judiciary, no free media and no electoral accountability, China is suffering a plague of corruption. The country&apos;s leaders have repeatedly warned that it is one of the biggest threats to the legitimacy of the Communist party. When cases do come to light, the punishment is swift and often deadly. The party&apos;s discipline inspection commission said in July that Mr Pang would be dealt with severely. &quot;Pang did not expect that he would be brought down by his own 11 mistresses,&quot; the People&apos;s Daily said in a report on its website. &quot;What awaits Pang Jiayu is severe punishment.&quot; In imperial times, a large number of concubines was a symbol of power. The practice is thought to have been stamped out after the Communists took power in 1949, although Mao had many lovers, according to his physician. But in recent years the keeping of mistresses and ernai - second wives - appears to have been making a comeback. This week, Duan Yihe, former Communist party boss of Jinan city in Shandong province, was executed for blowing up his mistress in collusion with a local police officer. Duan was said to have been driven to murder because his lover constantly asked him for money and would not leave him despite his repeated attempts to break up since 1999. The highest-ranking official to fall from grace in the past year, Chen Liangyu - the former party chief of Shanghai - is to feel the wrath of China&apos;s justice system after accusations of keeping two mistresses and embezzling at least 3.5bn yuan (\u00a3230m). Corruption and concubines go hand in hand, according to a report in the Beijing News this week, which found that 14 of the 16 most senior officials found guilty of gambling, illegal property deals and money laundering also had mistresses. This has become a target of black humour among the local media, internet community and even Chinese expatriates. According to a widely circulated report on the Rednet website, there are five motives for officials to keep a mistress: using their power to play with women, showing off, addiction to sex, perversion and a desire to have more children. Additional reporting by Chen Shi Mistress&apos;s story  &apos;I do it because I feel desperate and alone&apos; There are thought to be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of ernai - second wives - in China, but few have spoken out as publicly about their experiences as Azhen. The 24-year-old from Jiangsu province has a blog about her life as a concubine in Shenzhen, a city close to Hong Kong. For three years, she says, she has been the mistress of a man who is old enough to be her father. &quot;Society calls us ernai. It is not a job that any of us would choose to do when we were children. Some do it for money. Others for love. Many, like me, do it because they have suffered some cruelty and feel desperate and alone,&quot; she told the Guardian. Azhen says she was neglected as a child because her father abandoned her mother while she was still in the womb. In her first job at a factory, she was raped by one of the bosses. &quot;No woman wants to demean themselves, but there is no social safety net. I have suffered psychological wounds from my experiences. It has changed my views. I don&apos;t expect my life to be satisfying any more, it is enough if it is peaceful.&quot; She met her current patron while working as a cleaner in a sauna. Although reluctant to go into details about how much money he gives her and what kind of apartment he pays for, she says her life has improved. &quot;He comes to see me if he has time. If he is busy, he calls me. As long as he is nice to me, he doesn&apos;t need to seduce me with too much money because I am not a material woman.&quot; Additional reporting by Huang Lisha", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-07T23:10:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/09/money.china", "sentences": ["The Asian giants have emerged within the top 10 because the Chinese stock market has hit record highs, pushing up the valuations of firms listed on the Shanghai exchange."], "title": "Chinese bank knocks Citigroup off top spot", "article": "Three Chinese companies are today ranked as among the biggest in the world for the first time.

The country&apos;s rulers have always used force and shock to try to push through their agenda. The first emperor was on the job two millennia before Milton Friedman was born. The trouble is that, in the case she chooses, Naomi Klein firmly grasps the wrong end of the stick as to who did what in 1989, their motivations, and what followed. &quot;In China in 1989, it was the shock of the Tiananmen Square massacre and the subsequent arrest of tens of thousands that freed the hand of the Communist party to convert much of the country into a sprawling export zone, staffed with workers too terrified to demand their rights,&quot; she writes. Later, she explains that &quot;in the three years immediately following the bloodbath, China was cracked open for foreign investment, with special export zones constructed throughout the country&quot;. But China&apos;s economic revolution long pre-dated the Beijing massacre, starting in 1978. Special economic zones (SEZs) began in 1979, followed by economically opened coastal areas and cities being established. In 1984, Guangdong was declared a comprehensive reform experiment zone. Shanghai was allowed to attract foreign investment; and the vitally important town and village enterprises system was launched to raise the pace of development outside the big cities. Imagine, for a moment, that Klein was right in seeing the massacre as an application of Shock Doctrine in the face of discontent bred by inflation, corruption and lack of democracy. Who, exactly, put the shock strategy into practice? What she tells us is that, while some reformers appeared ready to gamble on democracy, &quot;more powerful elements in the party were not willing to take the risk. The verdict came down: the state would protect its economic &apos;reform&apos; programme by crushing the demonstrators.&quot; The decision to send in the troops was not taken by the Politburo, as Klein writes. According to the record in the Tiananmen Papers, its standing committee was split equally. The verdict came from gatherings of party elders (plus Prime Minister Li Peng). What they wanted was to end the demonstrations (which spread well beyond Beijing) and protect Communist party power. Pursuit of the economic change Klein cites does not enter their discussions. Indeed, the majority were conservatives opposed to reform - some refused to visit SEZs as a matter of principle. To paint them as men (and one woman) using extremes of shock to advance policies they opposed is akin to depicting Klein as a Bushite. Far from bringing an immediate unfurling of market measures, as Klein states, the massacre was followed by the ascent of economic conservatives. Li Peng insisted that &quot;reform and opening up&quot; should not be taken as the guiding principle. Always a weathervane, the new party chief, Jiang Zemin, set the tone in depicting the massacre as a victory over forces seeking to &quot;subvert the socialist system, and turn China into a bourgeois republic and into an appendage of big western capitalist powers&quot;. One reformer was elected to the standing committee, but he was balanced by a conservative. It was not until 1992 (ie three years on from the massacre) that Deng staged his comeback, using economic policy to reassert his political primacy on a tour of southern China during which he spoke out for renewed moves to the market. That was when inward investment surged and China was cracked open for foreign investment. This was not the result of the massacre three years earlier, but the outcome of a long-running battle at the top of the power structure, in which economic policy became the proxy for personal struggles. In her pursuit of Friedmanism, Klein does not take account of the powerful nationalist element in Deng&apos;s decision to opt for the market, or the party-state relationship that underpins everything. The only Chinese source she cites is the new leftist Wang Hui, who is interesting, but has a particular line to strike - rather like writing about America and quoting only Michael Moore. Klein invokes the four cardinal principles proclaimed by Deng at the time; but these provided for China to &quot;keep to the socialist road and to uphold the people&apos;s democratic dictatorship, leadership by the Communist party, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought&quot;. Not very Friedmanesque. Deng had Shock form well before the Beijing massacre - the mass persecution after the Hundred Days of 1956 and the suppression of the Democracy Wall movement in 1979, for instance. Shocking as it was, the Beijing massacre fits into a pattern of political violence endemic in 20th century China. Mentioning only Tiananmen, Klein ignores the far bigger massacre of non-students in the suburbs of the capital on June 3-4 - which actually provides better evidence for her &quot;terrified&quot; workers line. She writes that, after June 1989, workers were &quot;too terrified to demand their rights&quot;. Had they done so previously? One may postulate that the main reason for the mass obedience of workers in China in the 1990s lies rather in the search for material advancement. The Beijing massacre was a major tragedy, shot through with misunderstanding and miscalculations. It simply does not fit the Klein thesis.

To others, he&apos;s the vindictive, attention-seeking blowhard who once wanted to electrocute fans; the blundering fool who got Chelsea in lots of debt before being flukily bailed out by Roman Abramovich. To Martin O&apos;Neill, he&apos;s a &quot;footballing cretin&quot;; and to the Fiver, he&apos;s Papa Smurf, Kuddly Ken or Bad Santa, depending on our mood. But if there&apos;s one thing that everyone can agree he is, it&apos;s this: the chairman of Nasty Leeds United. But not for much longer according to today&apos;s sensational news!  Or rather, according to weekend reports that we didn&apos;t get round to reading till today. Because the Mail on Sunday - having spotted The Country&apos;s Most Popular 85-Year-Old Club Owner Who Looks Like A Fat Uncle Albert dining out with The Country&apos;s Most Popular Former Club Owner Who Looks Suspiciously Like Fat Freddy Shepherd And, In Fact, Is None Other Than Fat Freddy Shepherd - excitedly declared that Bates is about to sell all his shares to the former Newcastle United laughing stock! &quot;This is inspired speculation,&quot; guffawed Bates today before rubbishing the report by insisting he had no plans to sell ... but that Fat Freddy may indeed take a stake in the club. &quot;Freddy is not about to swoop in a &apos;sensational deal&apos; for Leeds and I&apos;m not about to sell it either. Freddy is a good friend of mine and has been for years. I went up to see him, and we finished up having lunch. Inevitably the subject of football came out ... he would like to get back in and I would like an investor, so the two fit in.&quot; Of course it&apos;s never easy to know whether to believe Bates - but following up the above declaration by dubbing Fat Freddy a &quot;very wise man&quot; didn&apos;t exactly bolster his credibility.  So there you have it. Just two days after Nasty Leeds equalled their best league start since 1973 by notching up their fifth consecutive victory - a run that has whittled away their pre-season points deduction and ensconced them comfortably at the bottom of the table - the Elland Road faithful can start dreaming of a happy and stable future. Sorry, that should read: the Fiver can look forward to an eventful and amusing future at Elland Road. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL It&apos;s small wonder folk are complaining that the Fiver isn&apos;t as funny as it used to be when speculation that Steven Taylor wants to leave Newcastle for Tottenham or Liverpool is all we&apos;re given to work with. Continental clubs are on high alert now that Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen has let it be known that he&apos;s tired of being a Trotter and wants to wear a short-sleeved No1 shirt of a different team and not tuck it in to his shorts. Bad Boys Inc are checking out Arsenal Reserves striker Nicklas Bendtner&apos;s rap-sheet to see if he&apos;s badly behaved enough for them to sign.

The Football Association of Ireland is at the centre of yet another of its trademark shambles, this time over the family bereavement which has ruled Stephen Ireland out of Wednesday&apos;s trip to Prague. Ireland was told by FAI officials shortly after Saturday&apos;s 2-2 draw in Slovakia that his maternal grandmother, to whom he is particularly close, had died. It was not until he arrived home to Cheshire that he discovered it was in fact his paternal grandmother who had passed away. In the meantime, the FAI issued a statement that led to the wrong grandmother being named as deceased in several newspapers. &quot;I was up half the night [sorting it out],&quot; sniffed Ireland manager Stan &apos;Steve&apos; Staunton. &quot;We were given the wrong information. It&apos;s his grandmother, we send him our best wishes and that&apos;s the end of that.&quot;  Meanwhile in Paris, Barry Ferguson will line up for Scotland when they take on France after being banished to the naughty step for his side&apos;s win over Lithuania.

I now smile, rather than laugh out loud - which possibly is better as my laugh is too reminiscent of Boycie&apos;s from Only Fools and Horses&quot; - Joe Gough (and others). &quot;Re: Ray Le Maistre. I have been reading Fiver letters for years, pretty much since they were launched, but I often find these days that I give up at the top of some letters because I just can&apos;t be bothered having to wade through the almost never-ending and pointless attempts at making a point.

First of all, poor old Ray is quite wrong, oh yes. Secondly and most importantly, I noticed that Ray has got a fantastically anagrammable name. So, while Ray is shedding A Miserly Tear, attempting to Irately Smear all that we hold good and dear, I must say to Ray - Re Email Satyr - I do not agree: A Retrial Say Me.

Responding to speculation that Shepherd, ousted at Newcastle by Mike Ashley&apos;s buy-out this summer, was about to launch a takeover bid, Bates explained: &quot;Freddy and I had lunch last week in Newcastle. But he&apos;s not about to swoop in a &apos;sensational deal&apos; for Leeds and I&apos;m not about to sell it either. &quot;Freddy is a good friend of mine and has been for years,&quot; added the Leeds chairman. &quot;Suzannah [Bates&apos;s wife] and I went up to see him and we finished up having lunch. Inevitably, the subject of football came out and he&apos;s still a bit sore about what happened at Newcastle. He would like to get back in [to football] and I would like an investor, so the two fit in. &quot;It&apos;s early discussions, though, that&apos;s all, and Leeds United is not for sale. We&apos;ve agreed to keep in touch, that&apos;s it. Talks are not now at an advanced stage. Freddy is a wise old man - although he&apos;s younger than me - and he would be an ideal partner but I&apos;m here for the long haul.&quot; Although Shepherd, who sold his 28% stake in Newcastle for about \u00a337m, has the funds to purchase Leeds it is understood his potential interest is currently restricted to possibly making a smaller investment allied to boardroom involvement. Moreover it would not make any sense for Bates to sell Leeds before next summer at the earliest because, under a clause in the deal which removed the League One club from administration last month, a high percentage of any funds received through a takeover would be paid to the club&apos;s unsecured creditors. However, that agreement is understood to expire next August and thereafter any profits from a sale would be payable to Bates and his board. Declared insolvent in May, Leeds have cleared liabilities of more than \u00a335m during a summer spent largely in administration and are now effectively debt-free. This dictates that the club is likely to become a target for potential takeovers. Indeed, Bates said yesterday: &quot;Leeds is an attractive prospect. The hard work has now been done, all of the rubbish is out of the way and the club is back on track. The real league table shows we are two points clear at the top, or will be when we get our 15 points [deducted by the Football League for perceived abuses of the administration system, and the subject of an ongoing appeal] back. &quot;The club is in profit, the gates are back and we have average attendances higher than Middlesbrough, Wigan, Reading and Fulham,&quot; Bates said. &quot;After two years of hard work, and three months of absolute hell, we can talk about football. The ground is slowly being improved and the team is strong. Why would I want to sell?&quot; Those close to Bates believe that his immediate priorities are to regain ownership of Elland Road and the team&apos;s training ground at Thorp Arch near Wetherby. England&apos;s captain, Faye White, in what she says will be &quot;the biggest game of my life&quot;, is set to make her first international start for 16 months after cruciate ligament surgery when England face Japan in their opening Women&apos;s World Cup group match in Shanghai today. England&apos;s first match at the finals for 12 years takes place 24 hours after the opening game of the tournament - between the reigning champions, Germany, and Argentina, the other teams in England&apos;s group - ended in an embarrassingly easy 11-0 victory for the Germans.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Leeds United"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-10T23:36:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/11/newsstory.sport7", "sentences": ["The women&apos;s World Cup opened with a bang this evening in Shanghai - its slogan, &apos;Beautiful game, beautiful goals&apos; apt as Germany hammered a whopping 11 of them past a hapless Argentinian side in front of a crowd of 28,000."], "title": "Football: Anna Kessel takes in the opening game of the women's World Cup", "article": "The women&apos;s World Cup opened with a bang this evening in Shanghai - its slogan, &apos;Beautiful game, beautiful goals&apos; apt as Germany hammered a whopping 11 of them past a hapless Argentinian side in front of a crowd of 28,000. The evening had started well enough; a glittering opening ceremony with the obligatory rows of choreographed dancers in spangly costumes, and plenty of cryptic symbolism. In a hideous twist, Fifa president Joseph Sepp Blatter was led to the stage holding hands with two girls dressed in skimpy shorts - the very recommendation he had given for the promotion of the women&apos;s game back in January 2004. Needless to say, the ladies actually doing a job on the pitch saw sense and stuck with the longer versions. In his tournament opening speech Blatter unwittingly paraphrased Skinner and Baddiel&apos;s immortal line, &apos;football&apos;s coming home&apos; when in a controversial move he attributed the invention of the game to China, &apos;several millennia ago&apos;. Expect a flag campaign in The Sun tomorrow: Oi Blatter, NO! As with all opening ceremonies, music was central to the evening. There was the operatic number - an abstract muse on &apos;beauty and the pitch&apos;, and a lady in thigh high leather boots (you really wouldn&apos;t want a kick-about in those, love) promising to &apos;show the way to fly&apos; - difficult to say whether that was sport-related or not. The essential hum-along to the tournament has got to be megastar Weiwei&apos;s &apos;Power&apos; (formerly known as &apos;Honour&apos; when she first sang the hit for China&apos;s World Cup final back in 1999), the theme tune of the tournament and the artist most tipped to record the official Olympics song next year. Back to the match though and critics of the sport will rightly question how seriously the women&apos;s game can be taken when there clearly remains such a gulf in skill and scorelines between countries playing at the highest level. World rankings should of course be taken into consideration before anyone predicts a spate of one-sided scorelines in China: Germany are second in the world compared to Argentina who are ranked 29th. Sceptics may also wish to do a quick cross reference to the results of another World Cup taking place this week where Australia wiped the floor with Japan 91-3 to no one&apos;s great surprise. A high-scoring game like rugby may not be a precise comparison, but the similarities lie in the development of the sport: as in many countries rugby, like women&apos;s football, remains a relatively young game. In that vein it is no coincidence that three of women&apos;s football&apos;s top-ranking sides are also those who invested most in the sport over the longest period of time. Germany (2), Sweden (3) and Denmark (6) were all taken onboard by their football associations back in 1971. Still, questions have to be asked and following the game Germany&apos;s iconic striker - player of the match and hat-trick scorer - Birgit Prinz was unimpressed by the accusation that an 11-0 scoreline undermines the sport. &quot;That&apos;s something you&apos;ll have to ask Argentina about,&quot; she snapped. &quot;It&apos;s not Germany&apos;s fault. We tried our best to play the best football and we prepared well for this World Cup.&quot; England should measure up having progressed well since their impressive unbeaten World Cup qualifying campaign. Hope Powell&apos;s team have put in some fine international performances this year, including two draws against the world&apos;s top two sides USA and Germany back in January. Tuesday lunchtime they face Japan, ranked two places above them, in their first group game of the tournament.

That said, upon being asked if there was a chance that Crouchigol might start up front against the Russians after missing out on Teamengland&apos;s rampant victory against the 11 man-shaped training cones of Israel on Saturday through suspension, Second-Choice shared a fascinating insight with his audience. &quot;Crouch is a BIG player,&quot; he declared, prompting furious scribbling, frantic number-dialling and desperate shouts of &quot;Hold the back page!&quot; the length and breadth of Fleet Street. &quot;He scores goals and it&apos;s great to have that option,&quot; he continued breathlessly, prompting the Fiver to pick up a knife from the nearby buffet table and start slicing up its own left arm. &quot;This is coming to the nitty gritty, we can&apos;t afford any slip-ups and the players know that,&quot; beamed Second-Choice. Wise words, but now that they&apos;ve deluded themselves into thinking they&apos;re good again, it must be odds on that in a little over 24 hours, England&apos;s players will also be indulging in serious self harm. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;There&apos;s more chance of me flying Concorde to the moon blindfolded than there is of you taking Wales to the South African World Cup&quot; - Robbie Savage reiterates his unending support for his national team&apos;s manager John Toshack. ********************* WE ALL AGREE, SMITH IS BETTER THAN ROONEY Hello, and welcome to the Fiver&apos;s coverage of the Women&apos;s World Cup, with me, Mike Newell. Today&apos;s big game took place in Shanghai, as 22 women from SHOULD BE AT HOME MAKING MY TEA Japan and England played out the opening game in Group A of the WHERE&apos;S MY TEA? tournament. England looked to have claimed a win WHY IS MY SUPPER NOT ON THE TABLE? but an injury-time free-kick earned the Japanese a draw which HERE, HAVE YOU BEEN SPENDING SOME OF THE HOUSEKEEPING MONEY ON FRIPPERIES LIKE SANITARY PRODUC- [Fiver shows Newell the door] Sorry about that, readers, in retrospect that was a stupid appointment. Anyway, misogynist boneheads all over the country will today be reeling from the realisation that the England women&apos;s team is much, much better than their male counterparts. Consider the evidence: last summer the blokes went to the World Cup and stank the place out, the sum total of their star player&apos;s contribution being to march up and down an opponent&apos;s tig as though it were an officially designated path or bridleway. Compare and contrast: this afternoon the star of the women&apos;s team scored twice in their opening World Cup fixture, a dramatic 2-2 draw against Japan which was possibly the most entertaining match the Fiver has seen in the last decade or so. Hee hee, misogynist boneheads, hee hee! Therefore it&apos;s official: Kelly Smith - for it is she - is better than that hopeless galoot Rooney. Today&apos;s match panned out thus: England had fallen behind to an Aya Miyama free kick early in the second half, but with nine minutes to go Smith equalised, sidefooting home after executing the sort of Cruyff Turn which, er, Jordi Cruyff would be proud of. She then added a second two minutes later after a powerful run, but her efforts were in vain as Miyama equalised with the last act of a fantastic end-to-end thriller - a 30-yard free-kick which arrowed into the top corner of the net. England can count themselves unlucky, but for once during a major tournament we can honestly write this: ENGLAND GAVE A GOOD SHOW OF THEMSELVES. And to think the women aren&apos;t even semi-pro. The men should hang their heads in shame. They won&apos;t, but they should. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Mr Abi Clancy will pack up his good touch, hop into a big man&apos;s car and make for Human Rights FC as soon as the talking clock tells him it&apos;s January.

All three of the second days&apos; fixtures ended in draws to throw the race to reach the quarter-finals wide open. In Group A the world No1 women&apos;s team USA drew 2-2 with North Korea and Sweden drew 1-1 with Nigeria; in Group B, crucially, England&apos;s rollercoaster of a game against Japan finished 2-2. In the Hongkou Stadium, Shanghai, the excitement of the England game kept a 28,000-strong crowd gripped. Not that all of those who turned up were dedicated football fans. Banks of spectators dressed in identikit t-shirts, rumoured to have been rounded up and ordered to attend, watched in near silence until the momentum of the game captured their imagination. As England pulled back an equaliser with ten minutes to spare through Kelly Smith&apos;s inspired first goal, the crowd unleashed a veritable roar. Smith, celebrating at the corner flag kissing her boot, grinned, and won the hearts of several thousand previously unmoved fans. The power of football? Absolutely. Smith&apos;s second just minutes later - she shot with her left foot, took the rebound off the keeper and scored with her right - prompted her to pull off both boots and smother them in kisses. A result too for Umbro, who had issued her personalised boots ahead of the tournament and whose added exposure came much to the chagrin of tournament sponsors Adidas. Unsurprisingly the iconic Smith was named player of the patch, and there could be further awards on the way should England progress. Earlier in the week Fifa&apos;s joint player of the century, China&apos;s Sun Wen, said she thought Smith would finish as the outstanding player of the tournament. On Tuesday&apos;s performance even sceptics of women&apos;s football will surely have to concede Smith&apos;s irrefutable gift for the game. After England&apos;s fevered spell, it was crushing to concede the equaliser with just seconds of injury time to be played.

Travel was in Edith&apos;s blood. She was descended from a long line of Christian missionaries, who had worked in Africa and Asia throughout the 19th century; her parents were missionaries in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The family returned to Wales while she was still a child, and she was educated in Cardiff. But Edith wanted to continue the family tradition. A small and fearless woman, full of energy and fun, she answered an appeal from the Methodist Missionary Society, and in 1933, aged 26, went to work at the union hospital in Hankou, a city on the Yangtze river, in central China. The country was then in turmoil. Powerful warlords were rampant, and Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s nationalist government was battling the communist insurgency led by Mao Zedong. The fighting had left millions dead, and many more homeless and destitute. Travelling across a country on the verge of collapse was dangerous: even trains were regularly bombed. Edith learned to speak and write Mandarin; she even spoke with a southern Chinese accent. She also met her future husband, Cyril Hancock, a Methodist minister, and after marrying they went to work with isolated rural communities further up the Yangtze. By this time, China was at war with Japan, and Cyril and Edith witnessed the brutality of the invading army. They themselves were threatened at gunpoint. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor and declaration of war on Japan, the Hancocks and their baby daughter Marjorie were interned by the Japanese for three years in appalling conditions in Shanghai. The only occasion they had fresh food was when Edith was sent to hospital after the birth of her son Malcolm. There, Chinese nurses stitched fruit and a cake into the baby&apos;s shawl and Edith smuggled the supplies back into the camp. When the family was finally evacuated to England in 1945, Edith and Cyril each weighed less than 7st. Their plans to return to Hankou were frustrated by the civil war, and they moved to Bodmin, in Cornwall, where they worked with the Methodist church and became active in the local community. Edith never went back to China, but until her death she could still read and write Mandarin. Her adventurous spirit inspired us.

Although he lives in Jinhua - a remote community deep in the hills of Guizhou province - Hua has made his money by moving with the times. In the communist past, offering rudimentary treatment to the sick would have been enough for the village doctor to secure his status in Jinhua. But in the capitalist present, money determines social rank. This helps to explain why the village doctor recently padlocked his old clinic shut and opened a shop next door selling groceries alongside medicine. It was an easy move. The only medical equipment he owns is a stethoscope, some tweezers and a sterilising bowl. He can now sell tobacco while referring locals to hospital for lung diseases; flog crates of beer one day and painkillers the next. This shift from public service to market principles is entirely in keeping with the wider transformation of healthcare in China, which is now among the most market-driven in the world. Like the entire economy, the system has a lot more money than 20 years ago, but far more inequality. It is a source of embarrassment for the communist party and a cause of unrest in the provinces. In no other sector of society has the difference between urban rich and rural poor become so apparent. Compared to the commercial capital of Shanghai, Guizhou&apos;s 37 million people - most of who are peasants - can expect to live 13 years less, mothers have a 10 times greater risk of dying during childbirth, and infants are five times more likely to perish before the age of five. For those who survive, illness is as much a financial as a physical threat. Get sick in the countryside, where there has been no health insurance system for most of the last 20 years, and the entire family can be ruined for generations. Surveys suggest that health problems account for between a third and a half of all cases of destitution. The health ministry says three-quarters of the rural patients who declined to undergo recommended hospital treatment did so because they could not afford it. In Jianghua - where peasants are fortunate if they earn \u00a320 a month - officials say the rate is likely to be even higher. &quot;I guess about 50% of the 11,000 people in this district can afford to see a doctor and only 10% would be able to pay for surgery that cost more than 1,000 yuan [\u00a366],&quot; says Bai Xiuhau, the deputy director of the district government. &quot;Some people can&apos;t afford treatment. They borrow and pay for as much as they can. But if they run out of money before they are cured, then they just have to go home and die.&quot; A peasant saying has it that a pig must be taken to market every time an ambulance siren wails, a year&apos;s work is ruined as soon as you sleep in a hospital bed, and if you are struck with a serious disease, 10 years of savings go up in smoke. For Mo Wangfa, the cost of contracting spinal tuberculosis has been even higher. Since 1999, the farmer has spent more than 10,000 yuan on check-ups and treatment. With no support from the government and no insurance, he had to borrow most the money, much of it from loan sharks who charge 6% interest. What passes for family treasures now are his x-ray charts and medical reports, all of which cost far more than he could ever earn. He is still too sick to work his fields. &quot;Before the illness, I was doing reasonably well. I wasn&apos;t rich, but I wasn&apos;t poor. Now I have big debts,&quot; he says. &quot;I plan to ask my children to go the cities to find work so we can pay back the money.&quot; Aside from compassion, doctors have few incentives to reduce costs or pursue long-term public health goals. In some areas, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases are making a comeback because vaccination programmes are under-funded. Meanwhile, the privatisation of medicine is blamed for the rampant over-prescription of drugs, which has created new strains of TB and other diseases that are resistant to antibiotics. &quot;I prescribe penicillin more than any other drug,&quot; says Hua, who charges 2 yuan for each injection. &quot;I mostly recommend it for rheumatoid arthiritis. A lot of villagers suffer from that.&quot; Few physicians in the west would recommend penicillin for this ailment, but it is not unusual for village doctors to assume antibiotics are a panacea for everything. With two years training and no salary, Hua is at the bottom of a healthcare system that that must provide screening, education, and treatment for the biggest population on the planet. In the 1960s, the government raised an army of paramedics, who were given basic training in western disease control and traditional Taoist medicine. While opinions vary about the medical worth of these &quot;barefoot doctors&quot; - so called because some were so poor they walked from village to village without shoes - they are credited with having an important role in educating people in the basics of hygiene and infectious disease control. Partly as a result, the health of China&apos;s rural population was once one of the proudest boasts of the communist party. Government figures suggest life expectancy jumped from 35 to 65 years in the three decades after Mao Zedong took power in 1949. During the same period there were substantial declines in recorded cases of tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and schistosomiasis, as well as improvements in infant mortality. Most of these gains, however, have levelled off since 1978, when rural cooperatives - which organised health insurance - were abolished, and doctors and health authorities were encouraged to find private sources of income. In the past 25 years, the share of medical spending borne by individuals has jumped from 20% to 60%. Although government healthcare spending has risen steadily from 3.7 trillion yuan in 1998 to 7.5 trillion yuan in 2004, the funds have been disproportionately invested in cities and high-tech equipment. According to one study, the rural share of medical expenses dropped from 34\u00b73% to 22\u00b75% in the decade up to 2003. Yet more than half of China&apos;s 1.3 billion population live in the countryside. China&apos;s main health indices continue to be reasonably good given the country&apos;s stage of economic development and they are excellent compared to Russia, which saw life-expectancy fall by more than 10 years after the fall of the Soviet Union. In terms of the number of doctors and hospital beds, China scores well. But such gains mask huge gaps. Medical care in Shanghai is now on a par with that of the west. Doctors in the city are well trained, well paid and the high-end healthcare market has expanded to the point where a private &quot;five-star&quot; maternity clinic opened last year charging \u00a3660 a night for a suite with a karaoke bar. That is more than double the annual income of Huang Bin, the most qualified doctor in Dayin district, which covers Jinhua village. Typical of China&apos;s emphasis on hardware rather than software, the government recently constructed a new hospital in the district, but there are no funds for medical staff. Huang&apos;s only source of income is drugs sales. Even though he is under pressure to prescribe as much medication as possible, people in this district are so poor that he usually makes no more than a few hundred yuan a month. &quot;I&apos;m thinking of going back to farming or perhaps doing construction work in the city,&quot; he says. &quot;It may be a waste of my skills, but it can&apos;t be helped. It is very hard to make a living as a doctor in a place like this.&quot; Nationwide, drug sales now account for half of hospital incomes, which has led to suspicions of overprescribing. Half the babies born in China are delivered by caesarean section, partly because doctors make more money they way. And China is one of the few countries in the world with more doctors than nurses, despite research suggesting nurses provide more cost-efficient services. Public resentment is rising. According to the state-run media, 5,500 medical workers were injured last year in assaults causing more than 200m yuan of damage. Among the biggest disturbances was a riot by 2,000 protesters in Guangan, Sichuan province, last November that was sparked by rumours that a young boy was denied life-saving treatment because his guardians could not afford the \u00a350 treatment fee. Earlier this year, the government announced that it would deploy police and private guards in hospital wards. Security is not the only concern. The World Health Organisation has monitored the decline in access with alarm. In a comparison of health systems in 2000, China was ranked a miserable 144th out of 191 states. In terms of access to medical care, it was fourth from bottom - beating only Sierra Leone, Brazil, and Myanmar. The effect of these inequalities is increasingly apparent. An estimated one in ten of the 1\u00b73 billion population is thought to be a carrier of hepatitis B. Syphilis, rabies and drug resistant tuberculosis, all under control 20 years ago, are sharply on the rise again. New concerns - such as Sars, Bird Flu and HIV/Aids - have pushed the health issue high up the political agenda and beyond China&apos;s borders. WHO, the World Bank, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are now preaching socialist values - less market, more state intervention - to the communist government in Beijing. &quot;The heavy reliance on market forces during the past two decades has bought wild capitalism to China&apos;s health system. Hospitals operate in an unrestrained way,&quot; says Hana Brixi of the World Health Organisation. The central government is aware of the problem. A public thinktank last year issued a damning report on the current state of the system. A major shake-up is being planned. Since last year, the central government has boosted the share of spending on rural healthcare and introduced a medical insurance scheme for farmers. It is an improvement on nothing, but the effect has been limited. The scheme only covers inpatient care and works through reimbursement. This means poor peasants still struggle to find the initial fee for treatment. The diversity, inequality and scale of China ensure there will be no simple solution to the country&apos;s health challenges. But the reforms currently under consideration look likely to emphasise that it is the responsibility of the government - not just the market - to ensure universal access to essential healthcare. Explainer: China&apos;s causes for concern The barefoot doctors of Chairman Mao and some of the triumphs of Chinese traditional medicine - such as the discovery and use of artimisinin, which is now the developing world&apos;s best hope against malaria - may have done much for China&apos;s reputation in healthcare. Sars, on the other hand, did it significant damage. China&apos;s failure to share with the UK and the rest of the world the scale of viral infection and to take urgent action to confine it disturbed the public health community. The first case occurred in Guandong province in November 2002. In February 2003, the Chinese ministry of health reported there had been 300 cases, including 5 deaths. In March, the World Health Organisation declared that severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was a global threat and cases were identified in the UK, as in many other countries worldwide. Sars demonstrated more clearly than any other epidemic has done that disease is now a global problem. They can move around the world faster than ever before on aircraft. So there is concern here about the renewed spread of preventable diseases in China, such as tuberculosis, and particular anxiety about the apparently extravagant use of drugs. Here in the UK, various campaigns have urged doctors not to use antibiotics against viral colds and coughs - they only work against bacteria. But in China, as in much of the developing world, there is huge overuse of antibiotics, with the likely result that organisms will become resistant and the life-saving drugs will cease to work. When the resistant organisms are spread around the globe, they become a problem for us all. Multi- and extreme-drug resistant forms of tuberculosis have now been identified on every continent. China&apos;s healthcare problems have much to do with the arrival of the free market. At one end of the scale, it has doctors as skilled as anywhere in the world. At the other end, it has people dying because they cannot afford treatment.

Several posters seem to think that this is all an elaborate plot to get people to buy my book, so let me say upfront: it&apos;s true, I really did spend four years working on The Shock Doctrine in the hope that plenty of people would read it. And I&apos;m grateful that the Guardian&apos;s coverage is helping convince some of you that this might be a good idea. So our cover is blown: we like people to read things, and sometimes those things (books, newspapers) cost money; sometimes (as here) they are free. Does that put me in league with the sinister capitalists who buy up phone systems and beachfront properties in the aftermath of cataclysmic events? I really hope not. I want to clarify again what this book is and what it is not. It is not a history of all uses of shock and crisis to implement unpopular programmes. I know totalitarian communists and fascists have used these tactics, and I acknowledge this fully in the book. The difference is that these ideologies have been held accountable for their crimes. Contemporary capitalism has never faced this kind of accountability, and it&apos;s high time. Neither is the book a comprehensive study of how radical free market ideas spread everywhere at every stage in history (a concern raised by Madeleine Bunting in her thoughtful response). The task I gave myself for the book was to examine key junctures - Chile 1973, Britain 1983, China and Poland 1989, Russia 1993, East Asia 1998, the US 2002 - when the crusade for unfettered markets leapt forward. As there is already a whole existing literature on each of these moments, my book is also decidedly not a blow-by-blow history of these events (at nearly 600 pages, it&apos;s long enough). The point is to draw out the connections, document the use of shock, and retell the story with the violence and bloodshed left in, as a supplement as well as an antidote to the cleansed official story. And the point of reinserting the violence, shocks and crises that were so central to these chapters is not to claim that these tactics are new or unique to rightwingers, but to challenge the prevailing, and I believe dangerous myth that modern deregulated capitalism swept the globe peacefully. In my limited space here, I can&apos;t begin to address all the challenging points that have been raised, and I feel very well defended by Seumas Milne, Jeremy Scahill, Gary Younge, Greg Grandin, and many others, so I would risk getting repetitive here. I will also be responding to specific questions in a later post. In the meantime, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m going to have to focus on the debate that is the loudest: China. As I argued in an earlier post, Jonathan Fenby, who wrote on China, has had trouble understanding this part of my book, and now he appears to have had more trouble understanding my post. For the past three days, he has been demanding, in almost every forum on this microsite, with escalating levels of self-righteousness, that I break my &quot;silence&quot; in response to his response to me. &quot;Shall we count the hours?&quot; Fenby laments. There really was no need: I clearly explained in my last post that I would not be writing again until Friday, that being today. Here I am. By repeatedly quoting an isolated sentence, Fenby leaves readers with the false impression that I claim that economic reform began in China after the June 1989 massacres. In fact, in chapter nine of the book, I explore the processes of economic revolution in China starting in 1978. I describe Milton Friedman&apos;s 1980 visit to China to tutor hundreds of top-level civil servants, professors and party economists in the fundamentals of free market theory. And I detail how the Chinese government applied these lessons. In 1978, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) dominated leading sectors of the economy, and they offered a wide range of welfare and pension benefits to their workers, known as the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot;. The economic restructuring efforts of the early 1980s saw a significant percentage of SOEs beginning to operate on a profit-making basis - the logic went that &quot;smashing the iron rice bowl&quot; would increase labour productivity. Deng Xiaoping introduced measures that were distinctly unpopular in the late 1980s, particularly among workers in the cities - price controls were lifted, sending prices soaring, job security was eliminated, creating waves of unemployment, and deep inequalities were opening up between the winners and losers in the new China. By 1988, the Party faced a powerful backlash and was forced to reverse some of its price deregulation. That year, they called in Milton Friedman for advice once again. It&apos;s all there in the chapter - Fenby&apos;s implication that I argue that economic reforms only started after the massacres is simply untrue. He also cavalierly asks what&apos;s new about China&apos;s rulers using force to push through their agenda. &quot;The first emperor was on the job two millennia before Milton Friedman was born,&quot; he writes. He argues that &quot;the Beijing massacre fits into a pattern of political violence endemic in 20th century China.&quot; (Interestingly, almost identical arguments were used when Boris Yeltsin called in the tanks on Russia&apos;s parliament in 1993 - the Russians were apparently a pathologically violent, anti-democratic people, something to do with Czarism - just as Iraqis today are routinely pathologised as inherently hatred-prone, something to do with Islam and Ba&apos;athism ...) By ascribing violent impulses to China&apos;s rulers as a sort of cultural tendency, Fenby fails to recognise what was unique about the use of force in the 1980s. In that decade, state violence was clearly tied to radical capitalist economic reforms. In 1983, as Deng Xiaoping opened up the country to foreign investment and reduced protections for workers, he also ordered the creation of a new 400,000-strong People&apos;s Armed Police, a roving riot squad charged with quashing all signs of &quot;economic crimes&quot; (ie strikes). According to China historian Maurice Meisner, &quot;the People&apos;s Armed Police kept American helicopters and electric cattle prods in its arsenal&quot; (The Deng Xiaoping Era: An Inquiry in the Fate of Chinese Socialism, 1978-1994). The economic context was shifting rapidly: as anthropologist David Harvey observes in his indispensable book A Brief History of Neoliberalism, foreign trade accounted for only 7% of China&apos;s GNP in 1978 but by the early 1990s it had soared to 40% and it has stayed at that level ever since. And as Dale Wen observes in a publication of the International Forum on Globalization, &quot;In the early months of 1989, the annual inflation rate reached a record high of 25% (inflation was kept below 1-2% throughout the Maoist Era).&quot; To reduce the 1989 massacres and their impact to just another example of the use of force by Chinese rulers is to ignore the immediate historical context, in which staggering economic reforms were being bolstered by an intensified apparatus of force. Fenby maintains that the economic reform agenda of the 1980s was not directly served by the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. He asserts, as others have, that there was a lapse in neoliberal reforms following the June 1989 massacre until Deng Xiaoping made his Southern Tour in 1992, in which he touted the successes of free market capitalism. But Deng Xiaoping did not, in fact, wait three years to seize on the opportunity that the shock of the massacre presented. Just five days after the crackdown, he addressed the nation, making it clear that it wasn&apos;t communism he was protecting, but capitalism. After dismissing the protestors as &quot;a large quantity of the dregs of society&quot; Deng reaffirmed the party&apos;s commitment to economic shock therapy. &quot;In a word, this was a test, and we passed,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;Perhaps this bad thing will enable us to go ahead with reform and the open-door policy at a more steady, better, even a faster pace.&quot; Fenby counters that those reforms professed a loyalty to socialism - of course they did, they always do, and still do to this day, even as China leads the world in experiments in worker repression. For Wang Hui, the Chinese intellectual and Tiananmen veteran, the connections are obvious: &quot;The price reforms that had been called to a halt in the second half of 1988 just happened to begin to be fully implemented in September of 1989, three months after June Fourth, with the adjustments concentrated in the areas of price, exchange, and interest rates.&quot; I&apos;ll give Wang, writing in his book China&apos;s New Order, a little more space to close off: &quot;We can summarise the three-year administrative reorganisation that took place between 1988 and 1991 - and particularly the economic changes that came after 1989 - as follows: monetary policy became a prime means of control; there was a significant readjustment in the foreign currency exchange rate, moving toward a unified rate; exports were increased and foreign trade came to be managed by mechanisms of competition and the assumption of responsibility for profits of losses; the &apos;dual-track&apos; pricing system was reduced in scope; the Shanghai Pudong development zone was fully opened and the various regional development zones were all put on track.&quot; Finally, I want to stress again that all of this is covered in chapter nine of The Shock Doctrine, a special advance copy of which Jonathan Fenby was given to critique. I believe the facts above amply support my argument. I don&apos;t think, as Fenby does, that my analysis can be dismissed by an examination of the internecine power plays within the Communist party leadership in 1989. Suffice it to say that not everybody defines &quot;reformers&quot;, &quot;proponents of change&quot; and &quot;conservatives&quot; the same way. By many accounts the clashes within the leadership were more over who supported electoral democracy than who supported economic reform. It&apos;s obvious from the last 15 years that many who supported free market economic transformation survived the power shift. More references and links are available at shockdoctrine.com.

They know now that a win over Argentina by two clear goals in Chengdu on Monday will be enough to put them in the quarter-finals. It was true nail biting stuff - and that was even before the England v Germany game kicked off. In the earlier game in Group A, Argentina surprised everyone and held Japan to a draw for 90 minutes. before Japan once again scored in injury time to bag the three points. That left England knowing they really need something against the Germans, who had mauled Argentina 11-0 in the opening match of the tournament. Few gave them a chance, but England were heroic throughout. Hope Powell&apos;s starting line-up featured two surprise changes from the 2-2 draw with Japan, with Rachel Yankey and Eniola Aluko making way for Arsenal defender Anita Asante and 20-year-old Everton midfielder Jill Scott. That pushed goalscoring midfielder Kelly Smith higher up the pitch and enabled England to pressurise the Germany defence time and again in the first half. In the Hongkou stadium a substantial population of German ex-pats made their presence felt with flags and banners as the rain poured down to cool the temperature to just 23 degrees in Shanghai. Good luck mascot Yolanda the Panda was even removed from the dugout roof to save her fur. Powell&apos;s side dazzled from the whistle, unperturbed by a poor record against the defending champions (England have lost every previous meeting bar a 0-0 draw in January this year). The team had confidence in bucket loads. I mean who attempts a backheel one-two against a team like Germany? Karen Carney and crowd-favorite Kelly Smith did, playing their cheeky exchange past the Germany midfield to the delight of the crowd. One of England&apos;s standout players, sweet-faced Chappers (Katie Chapman - mother of four-year-old Harvey) who looks as though she wouldn&apos;t hurt a fly, let rip with her tackles, refusing to be intimidated by Germany&apos;s strong midfield. Chapman will miss the next match against Argentina after picking up her second yellow card of the tournament, but her contribution this evening was immense. Rachel Brown proved that goalkeeping ain&apos;t just a man&apos;s game, as has been suggested during this tournament. She kept a clean sheet against a side that had put 11 past Argentina, pulling off a stunning save with her foot against Kerstin Garefrekes&apos; close range shot late in the game. As the clock ran down, Germany launched wave after wave of attack. Captain Faye White, in only her third game for England after a season-long injury kept her out, worked tirelessly putting in clearances and tackles to earn herself player of the match. England held on for an immense 0-0 draw, which left Powell pumping her fists in ecstatic glee - and fans in the stands doing the conga and singing &quot;bring on the Argies&quot; to the triumphant team.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-14T14:38:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/15/motorsports.sport2", "sentences": ["Chinese grand prix Shanghai October 7, 7am Ferrari won here last year against Renault, but this year with Ferrari and McLaren using the same Bridgestone tyres the scope for a significant performance advantage for one team is greatly reduced."], "title": "Formula one: James Allen's guide to the remaining races", "article": "Belgian grand prix Spa-Francorchamps Tomorrow, 1pm BST Of the four remaining venues only Spa-Francorchamps offers a clear advantage for one team. The Ferrari has a longer wheelbase than the McLaren, which means that it is more stable in the medium speed and fast corners, of which there are many at Spa. Just as the Ferrari was the quicker car in Turkey recently, so it will be at Spa. But this majestic track in the Ardennes forest usually sees some rain during the weekend and then it is all about the driver. Kimi Raikkonen is absolutely awesome around Spa and has won here twice. My money is on him. Japanese grand prix Fuji September 30, 5.30am This is effectively a new circuit so not a lot of data exists. This will help Lewis Hamilton as for once he won&apos;t be the only front runner learning the track. It is based on the old Fuji circuit, where James Hunt clinched his 1976 world title, and looks unremarkable, especially compared with the sensational Suzuka track which it has replaced as the host venue in Japan. There is nothing about it to suggest an advantage for either team. Rain is a strong possibility for this one, and both McLaren and Ferrari will get fresh engines for this race. Chinese grand prix Shanghai October 7, 7am Ferrari won here last year against Renault, but this year with Ferrari and McLaren using the same Bridgestone tyres the scope for a significant performance advantage for one team is greatly reduced. There are lots of long, tight corners here. McLaren is slightly better than the Ferrari at getting through tight corners and accelerating out of them so this track might possibly favour them, but it will be very close. Fernando Alonso has always shone here. He won in 2005 and finished second last year. Brazilian grand prix Interlagos October 21, 5pm Both McLaren and Ferrari have good records on an exciting, bumpy track. There are a few tight bends but there are also fast ones, so that evens itself out. Felipe Massa dominated last year - inspired on his home track - but the tyres had a lot to do with that. It&apos;s a special place for Alonso, too, as he clinched both of his world titles there, whereas Raikkonen has finished second there three times but never won.

The ill wind that has swept through the corridors of McLaren&apos;s sophisticated technology centre in Surrey could have blown Hamilton some good while helping to propel Fernando Alonso towards an early exit. It emerged on Friday that Alonso had been aware in March of the revelations that contributed towards McLaren&apos;s expulsion last week from the 2007 constructors&apos; championship and a record $100million (about \u00a350m) fine. McLaren were found by the FIA, the sport&apos;s governing body, to be in possession of confidential technical information belonging to Ferrari. Alonso is alleged to have suggested that he might reveal to the FIA information concerning the depth of McLaren&apos;s involvement if he was not granted the number one status the twice world champion feels is his due. Alonso&apos;s manager, Luis Garcia, denied the story yesterday. Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, says he called Alonso&apos;s bluff and informed the FIA as a sign of the team&apos;s good intent and honesty. Alonso reportedly apologised to Dennis without passing on information, but any such clash will not have improved a relationship that has been in decline since the Spaniard discovered Hamilton the novice could drive like a veteran. If Alonso is leaving, then, despite McLaren&apos;s attempts to provide parity, Hamilton will be in a better position, particularly if the team no longer have to think about scoring points for the constructors&apos; championship. That is an interesting but minor detail in an affair that has developed scandalous proportions from innocent beginnings that can be traced to the departure of Michael Schumacher from Ferrari in 2006. When the team&apos;s technical director, Ross Brawn, decided the moment was right to take a sabbatical at the end of last year, the reshuffle of the Italian team&apos;s technical department was not to the liking of Nigel Stepney, the former race technical manager at Ferrari. According to Stepney, his views were not well received. In May, the Briton&apos;s name was connected with alleged sabotage of Ferrari&apos;s race cars, a charge that remains the subject of an inquiry in Italy. While the accusation had curious and clumsy aspects, such as the addition of powder to the cars&apos; fuel tanks, there was a more serious ring to the extraordinary revelation a few months later that Ferrari&apos;s 780-page racing manual had been found in the home of Mike Coughlan, McLaren&apos;s chief designer. Ferrari had been alerted by a company in Surrey specialising in the transfer of documents from paper to an electronic format. The firm&apos;s proprietor had become suspicious when Coughlan&apos;s wife, Trudy, had presented the Ferrari manual for transfer. Stepney was the most obvious source of the leak, an accusation he denied in The Observer on 8 July. Subsequently, in an affidavit, Coughlan named Stepney as the source. McLaren insisted that Coughlan had behaved independently and very few members of staff were aware of his actions; certainly, no technical benefit had been incorporated in the 2007 McLaren, despite the presence of detailed information on Ferrari&apos;s car and its running. The FIA called McLaren to explain themselves in front of the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) in Paris on 26 July. When the WMSC noted that McLaren had been in possession of confidential information but none had been used for their benefit, Ferrari chief executive Jean Todt objected strongly and asked the Italian motor sport authority to take the matter to an appeal court. Before this took place, Dennis and Alonso had their lively discussion, Dennis&apos;s subsequent phone call alerting the governing body that further evidence was available. The FIA had no hesitation in cancelling the appeal court and reconvening the WMSC in Paris on Thursday. The day-long session revealed that during the first three races in March and April Alonso and McLaren test driver Pedro De La Rosa had been aware of information concerning the technical set-up of the 2007 Ferrari and its operation. This had been supplied by Coughlan from conversations with Stepney. An FIA statement said: &apos;The WMSC does not have evidence that any complete Ferrari design was copied and subsequently wholly incorporated into the McLaren car as a result of Coughlan passing confidential [information] from Stepney to McLaren. However, it is difficult to accept that the secret Ferrari information that was within Coughlan&apos;s knowledge never influenced his judgment in the performance of his duties. &apos;The WMSC believes that the nature of the information illicitly held by McLaren was information of a nature which, if used or in any way taken into account, could confer a significant sporting advantage upon McLaren.&apos; In summary, McLaren were not guilty of incorporating Ferrari&apos;s details in their car, the MP4/22. The stripping of McLaren&apos;s championship points and the imposition of the $100m fine was for the acquisition of a &apos;significant sporting advantage&apos;, an accusation that would scarcely seem to warrant such a draconian penalty. None the less, the revelation that members of the McLaren team were using sensitive information gleaned from text and email conversations with Stepney as early as March places Dennis in a difficult position. Dennis prides himself in the careful management of a company that, he maintains, has a reputation for credibility. Despite the installation of a firewall once the communication with Stepney had been discovered after the third race of the season in Bahrain, Dennis&apos;s early lack of knowledge of the conversations between his drivers, Coughlan and Stepney points to a worrying lapse in McLaren&apos;s management structure. Dennis claimed yesterday that the information covering matters such as the Ferrari&apos;s weight distribution, brake balance and the team&apos;s pit-stop tactics in Melbourne was not significant and had no relevance to McLaren. Ferrari would argue differently, saying the possession of such sensitive details is a big advantage for a rival, a point with which the WMSC agreed on Thursday. McLaren are unlikely either to appeal to the FIA or take the matter to a civil court. Dennis said that as long as McLaren&apos;s shareholders were comfortable with dealing with the fine, he wished to see the matter closed. Dennis said he had his best night&apos;s sleep in months after the court had reached its verdict on Thursday. &apos;I feel that I can now control things again and we can get on with the racing,&apos; he said yesterday. &apos;Everything in the FIA document [summarising the WMSC hearing] is true. It happened. But there is only one thing that I feel is not appropriate. This is a fine so disproportionate to the reality of the situation. So the decision I have is not whether to appeal their findings. It is: do I appeal the fine? Does McLaren take a financial hit in the interests of the sport? Once I have reached a decision I will make a recommendation to my shareholders and it is they who will decide. If we do not appeal this it will be because we want closure. &apos;Do you really think it&apos;s a great backdrop for Formula One and my company if we&apos;ve one-and-a-half to two years of legal aggravation with my management that is not there for that? They are there to focus on making race-winning cars and enter into commercial relationships with sponsors. I have had letters, emails and faxes that have streamed into me over the last 24 hours and every sponsor is committed to staying with this racing team and backing us to the hilt. So I don&apos;t want to drag them into it. I don&apos;t want to drag this thing out if I can get closure. &apos;I hope the other teams understand the financial penalty we will swallow in the interests of the sport. The important thing to us is the company&apos;s integrity and the firm belief of the world that we have never competed with a car that has anybody else&apos;s technology in it. We want to win fair and square and if the penalty for that is money - putting aside the [championship] points because it&apos;s about money in the end - then that&apos;s the penalty. If the perception of the media and the public is that McLaren did not cheat, we did everything we could to co-operate, then we probably will take the financial hit. There is not more than one other team in the pit lane who can take a $100m hit. At the end of the day, we can swallow it.&apos; Regardless of Dennis&apos;s wish for closure, the knock-on effect of the affair will continue to remind him of the most embarrassing phase in the 41-year history of the McLaren Formula One team. Apart from dealing with a disgruntled Alonso for the rest of this season, Dennis must think about how to replace him, even though Alonso&apos;s management insisted yesterday that the Spaniard would see out the second year of his contract in 2008. Nico Rosberg, who is having a strong second season with Williams, is the most likely choice, but McLaren could do worse than investigate the possibility of prising Jenson Button from Honda. Despite being saddled with one of the most uncompetitive cars in the field, Button has driven superbly and, significantly in the light of Alonso&apos;s behaviour, not uttered a word of complaint in public. Button and Hamilton would make a strong team, provided that McLaren&apos;s corporate partners could accept having two Englishmen driving. Whoever partners Hamilton will have to become part of a humbling process that will stick in Dennis&apos;s craw. Formula One hierarchy is determined by the number of constructors&apos; championship points scored each season. McLaren, Renault and Ferrari occupy the smart end of the pit lane, where they are each allocated three garages. Next year, thanks to having officially scored no points in 2007, McLaren will be at the bottom of the pit lane, attempting to squeeze their vast array of equipment into two small garages alongside Spyker and Super Aguri. It is a comedown similar to the owner of a Victorian detached property moving into a council flat. This will not be a hardship at modern tracks such as Shanghai and Malaysia, but at Interlagos in Brazil, McLaren will be in a narrow cul-de-sac next to the toilets at the end of the paddock. There will be other restrictions, such as the absence of travel concessions (20 free air tickets per race and 15 tonnes of subsidised freight, for which McLaren will now have to pay $26 per kilogramme) and a reduction in the number of paddock and pit-lane passes. Barring serious misfortune in the remaining four races, Ferrari are guaranteed victory in the 2007 constructors&apos; championship. Ferrari have stated their satisfaction that the truth has emerged at the WMSC hearing. While a number in the paddock at the Belgian Grand Prix in Spa share Ferrari&apos;s view that the McLaren drivers are fortunate to be allowed to remain in the championship, some observers question why Ferrari did not receive a reprimand for causing the problem. &apos;It&apos;s not as if McLaren stole the information,&apos; said Eddie Jordan, the former team owner. &apos;It was leaked by a Ferrari employee. If McLaren were blamed for Coughlan&apos;s actions because he is an employee, surely Ferrari should be made to take some responsibility for Stepney&apos;s actions and the effect they&apos;ve had on the sport. Ferrari need to take a good look at themselves. It&apos;s not the first time information has been leaked from this team.&apos; Dennis is not alone in wishing for closure. It says much about the significance of this affair and its handling by the FIA that a return to Spa after a two-year absence has largely been ignored. This afternoon, for at least an hour and a half, McLaren and Ferrari should be able to get on with what they do best on one of the world&apos;s great race tracks.", "tags": ["Sport"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-16T22:57:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/16/womensfootball.sport", "sentences": ["As the England team coach prepared to leave Hongkou Stadium, Shanghai, a crowd of fans gathered in its path.", "After England&apos;s men played Russia on Wednesday, Barwick had five hours&apos; sleep before flying to Shanghai."], "title": "Women's football: England's great White hope", "article": "As the England team coach prepared to leave Hongkou Stadium, Shanghai, a crowd of fans gathered in its path. Their faces painted red and white, they carried banners, England flags and drums to greet the heroes of the night. Against the odds, against a team that had put 11 goals past Argentina and not conceded one, England held the world champions, Germany, to a 0-0 draw on Friday and the mood was electric. Hope Powell&apos;s players pressed their noses to the glass to wave at the crowd, before speeding back through the city to the team hotel. England impressed in their opening group games to take two points against sides ranked higher than them in the world. Argentina remain the only obstacle to making the quarter-finals on Saturday; beat them by two clear goals and the team can book their passage to the knockout stages, where they will meet either North Korea or the US. Back at the team hotel, captain Faye White sat down with a grin and a celebratory chocolate ice-cream, as friends and family congratulated the evening&apos;s player of the match. In central defence, against one of the game&apos;s biggest stars, Germany&apos;s Birgit Prinz, White had pulled off a stunning performance. That it was only her third appearance in an England shirt, after her second long break in three years with a knee injury, made the evening all the more remarkable. Separated from the rest of the team as she underwent the recovery process, White could not have been sure of a return to the starting line-up. &apos;I was still trying to get over the anger and frustration of having to deal with a second major knee injury; there were question marks in my mind if I could recover a second time,&apos; she said. &apos;That game against Japan was my first start in nearly six months - and it was only the most important game in my life. Coming back into the team things had changed, the players had reached a new level and it was so much more competitive. It was overwhelming. I worried about being accepted; everyone&apos;s relationships had moved on.&apos; Last September, as White watched on crutches from the sidelines, England drew 1-1 with France to top their qualifying group and reach the World Cup finals for the first time in 12 years. When the whistle blew, White joined her team-mates on the pitch to celebrate, but she felt she had missed a vital episode in the team&apos;s development. &apos;I missed out on the elation they experienced on the pitch that day. And I want that feeling now, that&apos;s what I&apos;m striving for and that&apos;s what motivated me to recover from my injury.&apos; England had never taken a point off Germany before their 0-0 draw against a weakened team in January, but on Friday the unassailable confidence of their opponents provided extra fighting spirit. &apos;They had the attitude that they expected to walk our group, they expected to beat us, and that fired us up. We&apos;re delighted with the result, but it&apos;s only halfway. We want to get out of the group and it&apos;s only then that we&apos;ll be celebrating,&apos; said White. Joining the players in the hotel lobby, after his third England international of the week, was Brian Barwick, chief executive of the FA. After England&apos;s men played Russia on Wednesday, Barwick had five hours&apos; sleep before flying to Shanghai. &apos;We all need to get our breath back,&apos; said a delighted, but weary Barwick, a restorative glass of wine in his hand, as he was pressed on future plans for the women&apos;s game. &apos;This tournament is a significant shop window for the game and performances such as these are there to inspire. I&apos;m not here to be in the newspapers, I can do that anyway, I&apos;m here to support the team.&apos; Barwick, along with Sir Trevor Brooking, will fly to Chengdu for tomorrow&apos;s must-win game against Argentina. They should nail it. The confidence in the England camp is sky high. Every player walks around the hotel with a smile on their face, there are no rumours of dissent or dispute. England have been building towards this World Cup, steadily developing as a team, over the past four years, and their pace of progression seems perfectly suited to the timing tactics of a tournament. Nevertheless, Argentina will not prove an easy opponent to beat. Japan played a full 90 minutes against them on Friday before finally breaking through with a goal in added time. Coach Carlos Borello&apos;s team&apos;s 11-goal mauling earlier in the week was a misleading result, the team having capitulated after their keeper pushed an early shot into the back of her own net and Argentina have fared better. Last year they were crowned South American champions, beating Brazil to the title, in the World Cup qualifying competition. England can beat the Argentina defence, but they will need to improve their ratio of chances to goals scored if they are to secure a victory. Against Japan, Eniola Aluko looked uncomfortable in the role of lone striker and after skipping over the keeper she missed an open goal. Against Germany, Aluko was dropped and Kelly Smith pushed to the front, but here England struggled to create chances and there were too many speculative shots from distance. Outside the England players&apos; hotel rooms, the FA have created a corridor of inspiration: a walk that takes in dozens of signed flags sent from teams back home, messages of support from politicians, royals and footballers as well as ordinary fans. Every day the collection expands and transporting it for tomorrow&apos;s game in Chengdu will be a major operation.

Slowly he gained the support of the Conservatory of Music and permissions to perform have been more forthcoming.

The vision of an economy based on information seized the imaginations of the world&apos;s governments. For decades now, they have been creating policies to &quot;protect&quot; information \u2014 stronger copyright laws, international treaties on patents and trademarks, treaties to protect anti-copying technology. The thinking is simple: an information economy must be based on buying and selling information. Therefore, we need policies to make it harder to get access to information unless you&apos;ve paid for it.  That means that we have to make it harder for you to share information, even after you&apos;ve paid for it. Without the ability to fence off your information property, you can&apos;t have an information market to fuel the information economy. But this is a tragic case of misunderstanding a metaphor. Just as the industrial economy wasn&apos;t based on making it harder to get access to machines, the information economy won&apos;t be based on making it harder to get access to information. Indeed, the opposite seems to be true: the more IT we have, the easier it is to access any given piece of information \u2014 for better or for worse. It used to be that copy-prevention companies&apos; strategies went like this:  &quot;We&apos;ll make it easier to buy a copy of this data than to make an unauthorised copy of it. That way, only the uber-nerds and the cash-poor/time-rich classes will bother to copy instead of buy.&quot;  But every time a PC is connected to the internet and its owner is taught to use search tools like Google (or The Pirate Bay), a third option appears: you can just download a copy from the internet. Every techno-literate participant in the information economy can choose to access any data, without having to break the anti-copying technology, just by searching for the cracked copy on the public internet. If there&apos;s one thing we can be sure of, it&apos;s that an information economy will increase the technological literacy of its participants. As I write this, I am sitting in a hotel room in Shanghai, behind the Great Firewall of China. Theoretically, I can&apos;t access blogging services that carry negative accounts of Beijing&apos;s doings, like Wordpress, Blogspot and Livejournal, nor the image-sharing site Flickr, nor Wikipedia. The (theoretically) omnipotent bureaucrats of the local Minitrue have deployed their finest engineering talent to stop me.  Well, these cats may be able to order political prisoners executed and their organs harvested for Party members, but they&apos;ve totally failed to keep Chinese people (and big-nose tourists like me) off the world&apos;s internet.  The WTO is rattling its sabers at China today, demanding that they figure out how to stop Chinese people from looking at Bruce Willis movies without permission \u2014 but the Chinese government can&apos;t even figure out how to stop Chinese people from looking at seditious revolutionary tracts online. And, of course, as Paris Hilton, the Church of Scientology and the King of Thailand have discovered, taking a piece of information off the internet is like getting food colouring out of a swimming pool.  Good luck with that. To see the evidence of the real information economy, look to all the economic activity that the internet enables \u2014 not the stuff that it impedes. Look to all the commerce conducted by salarymen who can book their own flights with Expedia instead of playing blind man&apos;s bluff with a travel agent (&quot;Got any flights after 4PM to Frankfurt?&quot;). Look to all the garage crafters selling their goods on Etsy.com; the publishers selling obscure books through Amazon that no physical bookstore was willing to carry.  Look to all the salwar kameez tailors in India selling bespoke clothes to westerners via eBay, without intervention by a series of skimming intermediaries. Look to the internet-era musicians who use the net to pack venues all over the world by giving away their recordings on social services like MySpace.  Hell, look at my last barber, in Los Angeles: the man doesn&apos;t use a PC, but I found him by googling for &quot;barbers&quot; with my postcode. The information economy is driving his cost of customer acquisition to zero, and he doesn&apos;t even have to actively participate in it. Better access to more information is the hallmark of the information economy. The more IT we have, the more skill we have, the faster our networks get and the better our search tools get, the more economic activity the information economy generates.  Many of us sell information in the information economy \u2014 I sell my printed books by giving away electronic books, lawyers and architects and consultants are in the information business and they drum up trade with Google ads, and Google is nothing but an info-broker \u2014 but none of us rely on curtailing access to information.  Like a bottled water company, we compete with free by supplying a superior service, not by eliminating the competition. The world&apos;s governments might have bought into the old myth of the information economy, but not so much that they&apos;re willing to ban the PC and the internet. \u00b7 Cory Doctorow is an activist, science fiction author and co-editor of the blog Boing Boing.", "tags": ["Technology", "Internet", "Intellectual property"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-18T09:33:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/18/weather.china", "sentences": ["Shanghai and neighbouring regions are evacuating 200,000 people ahead of the landfall of &quot;super typhoon&quot; Wipha, which is forecast to lash the city tomorrow with the most powerful winds and rains seen in a decade.", "With the eye of the storm set to make landfall near Shanghai early tomorrow morning, the authorities have begun taking &quot;level one&quot; emergency measures - the highest state of alert.", "State media said a million people had already been relocated in Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu and the evacuation was still underway."], "title": "Shanghai evacuates 200,000 ahead of 'super typhoon'", "article": "Shanghai and neighbouring regions are evacuating 200,000 people ahead of the landfall of &quot;super typhoon&quot; Wipha, which is forecast to lash the city tomorrow with the most powerful winds and rains seen in a decade.

As it modernises its military forces, focusing on countering American high-tech capabilities (information networks, stealth aircraft, cruise missiles, and precision-guided bombs), China is expected (pdf) to turn into one of America&apos;s most powerful global competitors for military and strategic influence within a decade or even sooner. Russia did not fare worse. Aware of the scale of America&apos;s crises in Afghanistan and Iraq and weary of its encroachments into its zones of influence in central Asia, the Balkan region and in the wider international arena, assaults on its national security through rings of military bases, and an ever expanding Nato, Putin&apos;s Russia has been launching an unexpected counterattack against the US. Reviving the cold war climate, Putin has denounced the US&apos;s missile defence plans in Europe, scrapped an agreement with Nato on conventional armed forces, and grabbed a large part of the Arctic. Profiting from a stable oil production estimated at 530 million tons per year, and an annual gas production of 900 billion cubic meters, he is looking to reclaim the USSR&apos;s status as a global military power. Earlier this year, Putin signed a seven-year $200bn rearmament plan, which will purchase a completely revamped early-warning radar network, new generations of missiles, planes, and perhaps aircraft carriers to rebuild Russia&apos;s arsenal. Russian defence budgets have been soaring in the last few years, jumping by 23% to a post-Soviet high of $32.4bn. Last week, in a belligerent message of defiance to the US, Russian generals announced that they have tested the &quot;father of all bombs,&quot; which is claimed to be four times more powerful than the American Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb and to have &quot;no match in the world.&quot; Putin&apos;s Russia is a far cry from Yeltsin&apos;s. The Russian bear is back on its feet, shaking off the dust of the 1990s and rapidly moving to regain lost territory. Speaking at a recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting a bold Putin declared:  &quot;Russia favours strengthening the multipolar international system providing equal security and development potential for all countries. Any attempts to solve global and regional problems unilaterally have no future.&quot;  The truth is that America is no longer the dominant power or sole active player on the global scene today and can no longer do what it pleases as the neocons had envisaged a few years back. A Hegelian cunning of history seems to be at work here. The most unilateralist, most hubris filled of American administrations has propelled the world towards multipolarism. No one has done more to dissipate the neoconservative dream of American world supremacy and bury the New American Century Project than the neocons themselves. When he vacates the White House on January 2009, Bush will leave behind a world order that bears no resemblance to the one he sought to construct in 2001. For this reason and this reason alone the world is greatly indebted to him.

Fifa yesterday announced the rescheduling of two of today&apos;s matches - Brazil v Denmark and Norway v Ghana, due to be played in Hangzhou and Shanghai respectively - because of Typhoon Wipha, which is currently affecting the area around Shanghai and has caused two million people to be evacuated. But news of the latest decision to also postpone Canada v Australia in Chengdu and China v New Zealand in Tianjin - areas not expected to be affected by the typhoon - has shocked the teams involved, who were only notified at around 3pm local time today, just five hours ahead of kick-off, interrupting vital match preparations. With six out of the eight teams in Groups C and D still in the running to make the quarter-finals, tensions are running high. Fifa&apos;s initial decision to reschedule the first two matches prompted a stream of complaints from teams in both groups due to the unfair advantage of non-simultaneous match scheduling. Fifa regulations state that fixtures should be played simultaneously unless in the case of a &quot;force majeur&quot;, which Fifa considers Wipha to be. Fifa&apos;s head of media, Nicolas Maingot, said the governing body had been &quot;operating in exceptional circumstances&quot;. Maingot admitted he had received phone calls yesterday from &quot;most of the teams&quot; concerned about the waiving of the simultaneous stipulation. &quot;It is fair to say that the teams contacted us and asked to have all the games played at the same time but yesterday we were not in a position to make that decision. Following the latest information [today] we asked ourselves if we could not [now] play all the games simultaneously.&quot; But there are already suggestions that Fifa&apos;s late decision-making has been down to bad planning rather than the weather, as all four games could have been postponed at the same time yesterday. Instead chaos has ensued as legions of travelling fans will now miss their team&apos;s final group game due to travel arrangements - 60,000 were expected to attend the China v New Zealand game in Tianjin - and media covering the matches have also been thrown into disarray. In addition, there are whispers of foul play from some players, who have suggested that certain teams benefited from an unfair advantage by being informed of the changes earlier than others. In particular, China&apos;s players are rumoured to have been notified of this latest decision a full 24 hours earlier than the other teams involved. Australia&apos;s players say they were only notified at 7pm today, whereas New Zealand&apos;s players say they were told three hours before that. Fifa insists that all teams were made aware of the changes at around 3pm this afternoon, but that they could not be accountable for slight variations in timing from individual local organising committees.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-19T16:27:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/19/weather.china", "sentences": ["Shanghai and neighbouring regions yesterday evacuated 200,000 people ahead of the landfall of &quot;super typhoon&quot; Wipha, which was forecast to lash the city this morning with the most powerful winds and rains seen in a decade.", "With the eye of the storm set to make landfall near Shanghai early this morning, the authorities began taking &quot;level one&quot; emergency measures - the highest level of alert.", "Yesterday, state media said a million people had been relocated in Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu and the evacuation was still under way."], "title": "'Super typhoon' to hit Shanghai", "article": "Shanghai and neighbouring regions yesterday evacuated 200,000 people ahead of the landfall of &quot;super typhoon&quot; Wipha, which was forecast to lash the city this morning with the most powerful winds and rains seen in a decade.

Of course, a meal in uncomfortable surroundings is never going to be entirely fulfilling, but it goes much further than that. The formality or informality of the setting, the colour of the walls, the way our seat faces, even the way the light falls on our plate will all have an effect on our meal. At home we have a choice whether we eat in cosy clutter or spartan simplicity or somewhere between the two. We can make our own mind up whether to close the blinds or lower the lights. But in public spaces, be they restaurants or airports, art galleries or simply corner caffs, it is up to someone else to make those decisions for us. Anyone who designs a public eating space has to consider what is going to please the majority of users. This could, and often does, result in the bland and boring, yet more and more public spaces are becoming a pleasure to eat in. For this we have to thank the vision of the architects and those who back their flights of fancy. I have always wondered how those who are paid to consider the aesthetics of our public eating spaces eat and cook in their own homes. What are their kitchens like and how does their work relate to the home space? Once Richard Rogers had designed the River Caf\u00e9 with his trademarks of space and light, and Frank Gehry had woven his sensuous minimalism on New York&apos;s Cond\u00e9 Nast staff canteen, it opened up a world of opportunity for architects to get involved in eating spaces. We asked a host of famous architects where they felt good food and aesthetics meet. Daniel Libeskind gives us a glimpse of his Manhattan kitchen, Thomas Heatherwick shows off his outstanding new beachfront caf\u00e9 in Littlehampton and David Chipperfield welcomes us into his Galician villa.Nigel Slater Richard Rogers Lord Rogers of Riverside has previously worked alongside Norman Foster and Renzo Piano. In the last two years he has received the Pritzker and Stirling prizes. His previous projects include the Millennium Dome, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the National Assembly for Wales and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. He is married to the Michelin-starred Ruth Rogers of the River Caf\u00e9.  Being the son of an Italian mother is a problem because Italian mothers don&apos;t allow their males to cook. Especially in my generation. I have five boys who cook, and I&apos;m the only one that doesn&apos;t, I just eat. I&apos;m the one let-down of the family. I was born in Florence and, culturally, I am Italian. It&apos;s very much in my blood. I try to spend as much time in Italy as I can - about seven weeks in total each year. My mother was a really good cook, an Italian Triestine. Their kitchen in England was probably the first I ever designed. Young architects have to start somewhere and it&apos;s usually the kitchens that need modernising. At our house, close to Pienza, there&apos;s an amazing wood oven and outdoor grill. We have competitions for pizza-making with any friends or family who happen to be staying. Just the decoration part, as long as Ruthie supplies the ingredients. All the sons, wives and grandchildren come and visit. There&apos;s often 20 for lunch. I always work on holiday, early in the morning. I have various memories of looking out of my parents&apos; house when I was about four or five and seeing a chair and a table put out for the local accountant. I thought, that&apos;s the idea, doing your business in a cafe, first thing in the day. I haven&apos;t quite got there but I&apos;m pretty close to it. I probably eat, do business, or just come and taste things in the River Caf\u00e9 every day. It&apos;s an extension of the community that I&apos;m part of. The space outside even more so. I&apos;ve been very fortunate. It was nothing to start off with. When the opportunity came up, the partnership bought the warehouses and we thought what a good idea to have a little restaurant. There were tremendous planning restrictions so it started as a canteen with sandwiches and came up from that. Ruthie&apos;s experience is purely domestic, that&apos;s why it&apos;s always been a hands-on, chef-led kitchen; and I&apos;ve known Rose Gray [co-head chef at the River Caf\u00e9] since she was 18. I don&apos;t choose the menus but we discuss food a lot. When we were completing the Pompidou and there was no other work coming in, Renzo Piano, Ruthie and I thought of writing a book called Sex, Food and Architecture. So it was very important to us, even then. We would often talk about the relationship between food and architecture. Food has the advantage of being more immediate. But they are both about a better quality of life. France in the Seventies was leading the way with its markets and atmosphere. Things have moved on to Spain and Italy because they offer simpler food and ways of cooking it. Renzo is my closest friend. I&apos;ll see him in 10 days&apos; time for his 70th birthday, and a week later in Genoa. We do a lot of talking. I think Britain has changed radically in the last 20 years. It was very behind in terms of its food and now it&apos;s as good as anywhere, especially London. I&apos;m a chief adviser to the mayor and we are on the way to giving London the best public spaces of any city. The street is the heart of the public domain and it&apos;s very much anchored by restaurants, cafes and benches, which you enjoy on a sunny day. I&apos;m all for not having an urban sprawl. I like places you can walk to. Cities are for the meeting of people, that&apos;s what it should be about. A friendly environment. David Chipperfield David Chipperfield (CBE) went solo in 1984 after working for Richard Rogers and Norman Foster. Most of his work is in Germany, America and the Far East, but he has also designed a restaurant for Wagamama and the British Film Institute. Two new UK projects include art galleries in Wakefield and Margate.  People have different attitudes to cooking, and when you do a kitchen you have to design for the way they live. Now it is accepted that you spend a lot of time in the kitchen so you can give it as much attention as other rooms. It&apos;s no longer about being at the back of house. I like a kitchen in the middle of the house, whereas some people like to tuck them away. At the house in Spain it was fundamental that the kitchen was in the living space. I cook every night at 10 o&apos;clock for seven or eight weeks in the summer. Normally it&apos;s for about 20 and I do a pot of something using shells like crab or mussels. Galicia is famous for shells. I have about eight recipes that I use when cooking for large numbers. Many recipes started with Ruthie Rogers at the River Cafe and then got adapted for a large group of people. Galicia is famous in Spain for its fish and as the largest consumer of octopus in the world. In the old days we used to buy the fish straight off the boats. The fishermen give us things now and again but they&apos;re not really allowed to any more. It&apos;s all got to be taken to the market to be regulated. It&apos;s a very primitive part of the country and the weather is unpredictable, like a very warm Cornwall but without all the people. We invite lots - clients, and people from the office. Positioning kitchens in galleries and museums isn&apos;t really about cooking; it&apos;s about commercial criteria and whether they want the restaurants to be accessed independently to operate beyond the hours of the museum. In Germany there&apos;s an anxiety that the restaurant shouldn&apos;t be the first thing you see, whereas in England there&apos;s this commercial fear that if you don&apos;t see the restaurant you won&apos;t know it&apos;s there. You have to create an atmosphere in restaurants with a bit of complexity. The Ivy is a good example but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily have done it that way. I designed a Wagamama on Lexington Street in Soho for Alan Yau - I&apos;m a big fan of his, I like Busaba Eathai. Most people tend to stick to four or five restaurants and I&apos;m loyal to Jeremy King and Alan Yau. I also did a Nobu in Miami, Circus in Soho, and the restaurant in the Bryant Park Hotel in New York. I&apos;m doing a museum in Anchorage, Alaska. We were fishing once and a guy caught a salmon, grilled it there and then, but covered it in barbecue sauce and ruined it. In America they have a tendency to smother things. I do a lot of travelling and if I&apos;m in St Louis or Barcelona it&apos;s inevitable you end up going to dinner with a client. I&apos;ve become slightly jaded because when you go to lots of nice restaurants you get spoilt and you can&apos;t savour it in the same way. I don&apos;t think that the best food I ever tasted was in a restaurant. Will Alsop Will Alsop (OBE) is the founder of SMC Alsop. In 2000 he won the Stirling Prize for the Peckham Library. He has practices in Beijing, London, Shanghai and Singapore.  Architects don&apos;t build many buildings. When you have a commission you&apos;re going to have a relationship with that client for up to five years, so you&apos;ve got to be able to sit at a table together. I&apos;m obsessed with tables in one way or another. There are things that you&apos;d say and do around a table that you wouldn&apos;t do if it wasn&apos;t there: it&apos;s the function that interests me. I&apos;ve been thinking about a table with a sculpted surface so you can actually serve the food straight on to the table. Then you&apos;d have a slit down the middle where you can fit the waste sack and wipe food over it. I have designed it, but it would be extremely expensive to make. Many ideas stick in the back of my mind and when the time is right they&apos;ll come out. Maybe in a better form. I don&apos;t deal with names but many of my buildings are given them, which is fine. A new housing project in Manchester is called Chips because it looks like three chips on top of each other. It&apos;s in three chips because it&apos;s a nine-storey building and if you do it as a slab it just looks like a nine-storey slab. I often get accused of being too fun but what&apos;s wrong with that? There&apos;s no intellectual basis for trying to dismiss something as being merely fun. The converse of fun is boredom, misery or sadness. Will that make the world a better place? I don&apos;t think so, but there&apos;s a lot of it about. I like unlikely combinations and the element of surprise is vastly underrated in architecture. People like to turn a corner and go, What on earths that? What I like about Baltic is walking through a pair of curtains into a very mysterious dark space which opens up into a very light space. It&apos;s not over-designed and at the same time not austerely minimal, which would get on my nerves. I&apos;m austerely maximal. It was a genuine discovery for me when I was doing the Palestra building opposite. Ill usually order borscht, and they do very good liver. Its a winter cuisine really because in the Baltic they have a long winter. Magical summers, but they are short. I&apos;m a die-hard smoker. In Toronto, where I work regularly, smoking has been banned for a lot longer than here. Each year it gets more and more draconian. When I first went there you were only allowed to smoke on what they called the patio. Then they decided even if the patio has a protective roof over it of less than 4.5 metres, which is quite high, you&apos;re still not allowed to smoke there either. So, the enlightened restaurants raise their roofs if they can, but that&apos;s not always possible. In Manchester there&apos;s a bar called Dukes 92 and they&apos;ve got a huge patio with awnings and heaters which could probably seat 500 people. Now that&apos;s a response to the smoking ban. \u00b7 Baltic Restaurant, 74 Blackfriars Road, London SE1; 020 7928 1111; www.balticrestaurant.co.uk Amanda Levete Amanda Levete worked for Richard Rogers and Will Alsop in the Eighties. In 1989 she became one half of Future Systems whose most notable projects include Selfridges, Birmingham, and the NatWest Media Centre at Lord&apos;s Cricket Ground, which won the Stirling Prize in 1999. An architect can get a lot of work done in a restaurant. I bring my team from the office here if we have something to celebrate, or I bring a client, or I just come with my boyfriend. Eating is all about communication and exchanging ideas. There&apos;s a big blurring in my life between work and pleasure. It all merges into one and the restaurant is the venue for that. When I started working for Richard Rogers, the River Caf\u00e9 was like our canteen. At first I&apos;d take my mum there for a cheap bowl of soup but within months it had completely taken off. As it became more successful they&apos;d do special deals for those who worked there and then you&apos;d have to eat at slightly odd times. I&apos;ve got all Ruth&apos;s cookbooks and use them a lot. Richard&apos;s a lovely man. In most of the restaurants I frequent, there&apos;s a design/work connection. The director of Scott&apos;s, Mark Hix asked us to do a number of pieces: the crustacean holder, the champagne trolley and buckets, and the washbasins. With product design there&apos;s always a specific function: it&apos;s very exact. Other issues are its sculptural presence and ergonomic function. With a trolley, it has to be something that you can manipulate easily between tables and not take up too much room. Originally, Jeremy King commissioned us to do the trolley for the Ivy and the buckets for Le Caprice. With design you can explore the geometries and push the aesthetic in a way that you&apos;re not always able to with a building, because of the technical and functional constraints. Also, the return on your investment is four months. A building takes a long, painful, but rewarding, four years. The ground floor of Selfridges has got an oyster bar, a patisserie and a deli counter, and it has very much become the place to meet. Eating in a shop is very different from eating in a restaurant. You don&apos;t want to dwell. It was really important for us to provide a space in which you could feel equally comfortable with a small group or by yourself. Therefore we designed these petals that mean you can sit alone, or opposite one another. The ethos of the food hall was that it had a market feel. There aren&apos;t shelves. Everything is casually laid out, and low-slung, like a Moroccan market. The design is totally open and fluid. I&apos;m doing a private house in Dublin where the couple entertain on quite a large scale. We&apos;re doing all the furniture and cutlery so it&apos;s almost like a restaurant: it&apos;s about creating a quality and a presence that&apos;s comfortable but at the same time architecturally exciting. I&apos;ve always wanted to design a restaurant and you bet I&apos;d do the interior. For me I don&apos;t understand how you can separate the inside from the outside. Once we did a proposal with restaurateur Alan Yau for Battersea Power Station before it was sold. Alan had this great idea to cross a nightclub with a restaurant and brothel. It was going to be a 24-hour operation where you could rent booths by the hour. It was a wild brief and that extracted a wild proposal from us. I have favourite dishes at Scott&apos;s. The stone-bass ceviche served with deep-fried plantain, the Dover sole and the sea bream. There used to be a cod&apos;s tongue starter, and I should ask Mark why they took it off. I don&apos;t feel guilty about eating anything. I love dark chocolate, but prefer to have a starter and a main, and then a chocolate truffle with a coffee. I never get sick of eating out but I&apos;m not adventurous. I like to be introduced to places but I&apos;ll naturally go to ones I know. \u00b7 Scott&apos;s, 20 Mount Street, London W1; 020 7495 7309; www.scotts-restaurant.com Terry Farrell Sir Terry Farrell has had his own practice for over 40 years. His London projects include Embankment Place, the MI6 headquarters, and the Greenwich Peninsula masterplan, currently under way. In 2004 he was made the &apos;design champion&apos; for Edinburgh to advise on future development of the city.  Nicknames for buildings is a new thing and a lot are connected to food: the &apos;gherkin&apos;, the &apos;cheese-grater&apos;. A pair of tall buildings in Chicago which have circular balconies going around were very quickly called the &apos;corncobs&apos;. The only nicknames buildings used to have were derogatory ones. You could have easily called the gherkin the &apos;cruise missile&apos;. I believe a lot of architects invent the names at the time of design because an association with a smaller, familiar object makes it instantly cuddly and loveable. When I did Embankment Place it could never be given a simple name because it&apos;s a more complex kind of building. Whereas today, buildings look more like one-liners: they can be technologically much more sophisticated but there&apos;s a slight dumbing-down of the language. As design champion for Edinburgh, I&apos;ve had catered dinners in our apartment on York Place with MSPs, council leaders and other senior people. I do like to approve the menu in advance but not as much as my secretaries. They get terribly excited and worked-up about these things. And there&apos;s all sorts of protocol these days. Are they vegetarian? Any nut allergies? Once upon a time you were grateful for whatever you were given. Delikatesn is a tiny corner place down some stairs in New Town and, if it weren&apos;t for the menu they left us, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever have found it. It&apos;s like a home from home because I live next to a great Portuguese deli in London. My home is above the office in an old furniture factory on Lisson Grove, NW1. I once had a party for 150 people and the Spanish restaurant across the road brought in big pans of paella. It&apos;s called Don Pepe&apos;s but we call it the canteen. I subsidise a happy hour for the staff there on Friday nights. I like local businesses. Particularly in my area, which always needs a bit of support. In the course of an architectural career there are kitchens of all kinds. The conference centre in Edinburgh I designed takes 1,000 people, so the kitchen&apos;s right next to the dining area for a fast turnaround. I once did an extension to Rules restaurant in Covent Garden. I think it&apos;s the oldest restaurant in London. We almost doubled its size by extending into next door, matching the old building so it was seamless. I&apos;m involved in putting a restaurant in the library of the Royal Institution where they hold the Christmas science lectures. I&apos;ve argued that we should have carpets, tablecloths and curtains but, from the managerial side, this means stains on the floor, food smells in the curtains and tablecloths you have to clean. One of the recent revolutions of restaurant taste is the rise of what would be caf\u00e9 style. Hard surfaces and sharp acoustics have become upmarket. That would never have been good taste even 10 years ago. \u00b7 Delikatesn, 1a York Place, Edinburgh EH1; 0131 556 1133; www.delikatesn.com Rafael Vi\u00f1oly Rafael Vi\u00f1oly was born in Uruguay, educated in Argentina and emigrated to New York in 1978.

I don&apos;t know any of the fashionable restaurants. I don&apos;t need overly complicated experiences. I have a short temper for stupidity and I have an enormous counter-reaction to pomposity. My business is conducted in one place, Mezzogiorno, in the office or wherever the client wants to take me. It&apos;s like ballet: I know ballet is a wonderful thing to see but I&apos;m not cultivated enough for it, like I&apos;m not cultivated enough for food. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve missed something. Mezzogiorno is three blocks from the office. It is the most unremarkable place but it has this warmth and sense of purpose. It has a good Italian cook, early-Eighties decor, drawings and sculptures from Florence, and an atmosphere created by incredible, sympathetic owners. They know what I eat and suggest things. I&apos;m not fussy. We have an extremely good young Brazilian cook at home in downtown New York. My wife, Diana, helped her through one of the best cooking schools in New York. When we travel we take food on the plane prepared by her. She surprises us every night. You don&apos;t need to choose; you just sit down and there is something prepared. It&apos;s very Japanese in a way. There are some restaurants in Japan I&apos;ve been lucky enough to go to that are not even advertised - just a kitchen and six chairs. And you get no choice: you eat whatever the guy gives you. It is a completely different every time and costs more than the Hotel Bel-Air. I&apos;m doing a huge hotel in Las Vegas, with 14 restaurants. It is interesting that people in this industry, with an eye on the consumer, build with the idea that in six months&apos; time they will change again. I don&apos;t think that is a good thing - why change if it&apos;s working? But they change it simply to regenerate the image. It&apos;s very dangerous territory. In order to achieve excellence, things ought not to be on a seasonal cycle. You couldn&apos;t write Shakespeare on that basis. \u00b7 Mezzogiorno, 195 Spring Street, New York, NY 10012; (212) 334 2112; www.mezzogiorno.com Thomas Heatherwick Thomas Heatherwick is a designer, self-taught architect, artist and all-round visionary whose eclectic body of work includes the Rolling Bridge in London&apos;s Paddington Basin, the UK&apos;s tallest public sculpture, Manchester&apos;s &apos;B of the Bang&apos;, and the dramatic East Beach Cafe in Littlehampton. I&apos;m interested in things being particular to their location. For something to be sustainable, it has to be specific to its location, because the idea is to have a building that will never need to be recycled. The East Beach Cafe isn&apos;t a council project, and there&apos;s no additional funding. It&apos;s essentially funded by a Mr Whippy machine and we had an enormous responsibility to make that achievable. I met the owner Jane Wood at a party. She told me about her dream of having a beach caf\u00e9 and was very open to what it might be. We both agreed we didn&apos;t want anything that would hook on to sea cliches like sails or yachts. The site is closer to the sea than the buildings around it, so it didn&apos;t need to be caught in the tyranny of being &apos;in-keeping&apos;, so no polite reworking of Regency buildings. We asked ourselves: what is the character of the sea? We decided it&apos;s all the bits and bobs you find among the rocks and pebbles on the beach. The building didn&apos;t need to be pretty, but to be tough to cope with kids, sand and seagulls&apos; poo. There were practical constraints, like the site has a long promenade that we couldn&apos;t build on, and a high-pressure sewage line at the back, which meant it had to be long and thin. We didn&apos;t want windows at the back because it was a car park and so we played on the feel of being in a cave. We put diagonals going through to give it a stepped profile. Our work is mainly buildings now and it&apos;s progressed from Konstam [a restaurant in London&apos;s King&apos;s Cross] last year, which was just the interior, to this, a whole building. We&apos;re now working on a restaurant in Hong Kong. A restaurant is only as good as its food and its service. The design is third on the list. I admire chefs. They have to be brilliant all the time. That is terrifying for me because I am a slow thinker. As a designer of buildings you need time to immerse yourself. A chef has to produce his best work every day. I get my best ideas through discussion. I&apos;m trying to make a way we can all ricochet thoughts off each other; in the new studio there is a long, open kitchen and dining area. Meetings will take place virtually in the kitchen. The main reason is to have as many different groups bumping into each other as possible. In the studio there is a big group of architects but also people with diverse backgrounds like theatre design. I&apos;ve been interested in designing buildings since I was tiny. Buildings are fascinating because they need so many different forms of expertise. \u00b7 East Beach Cafe, Littlehampton, West Sussex; 01903 731903; www.eastbeachcafe.co.uk", "tags": ["Architecture", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-22T23:03:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/23/sport.comment2", "sentences": ["Tang Meng, commentating on Shanghai TV for China&apos;s first game, could not resist a dig when he said it, &apos;can never be as watchable or good as the men&apos;s game because women can never be as strong or fast as men&apos;."], "title": "Football: China drag their ancient game out of the dark ages", "article": "It seems absurd to be watching women&apos;s football in an escort bar surrounded by girls in minuscule hotpants and diamante heels, but in China women and football are still seen as a rebellious combination. It is near impossible to find female fans passionate about the women&apos;s game, except, it seems, in an escort bar. As the China team seal a victory to send them through to the quarter-finals of the World Cup, the girls go crazy screaming at the screen. In a country where traditional gender values dominate, it is no coincidence that the marketing campaign for this tournament has attempted to feminise football with words such as &apos;beauty&apos; and &apos;charm&apos;. With the one child per family rule still in force, even liberal families would prefer their daughter to concentrate on education instead of frittering away her time playing with a ball. It is surprising, then, that China&apos;s history of women&apos;s football stretches further back than that of any Western country; there are frescoes of women playing as long ago as the Dong Han Dynasty (25-220AD), although the game was later banned until well into the 1920s. To an outsider, China would appear to have a healthy women&apos;s football infrastructure: the national team reached the World Cup final in 1999 and remain one of the world&apos;s top sides. China&apos;s greatest ever female footballer, Sun Wen, is a household name, and the women&apos;s team have pop songs about them. But delve deeper and you discover a grassroots structure not far off chaos. The China FA are unable to say how many girls currently play football - they estimate around 4,000 aged 14 and upwards, including the senior sides. This from a population of 1.3billion. Football does not feature in Chinese school curriculums - or playgrounds - and despite the popularity of foreign leagues such as the Premier League there is little enthusiasm for the domestic game. There is no women&apos;s league; instead the FA arrange tournaments between clubs, and the elite players struggle for approval from male TV pundits. Tang Meng, commentating on Shanghai TV for China&apos;s first game, could not resist a dig when he said it, &apos;can never be as watchable or good as the men&apos;s game because women can never be as strong or fast as men&apos;. There is also a feeling that many women who play football do so out of duty rather than passion. Even some of China&apos;s younger players, such as 22-year-old defender Zhang Ying and 19-year-old Weng Xinzhi, say they started playing at age 11 only after being selected by a local sports institute that recognised their athletic ability. There they learned the game from scratch, and from newspapers they learned how to be fans, adopting Manchester United and Arsenal respectively. Such football institutions have been widely criticised by Chinese and Western coaches, who see them as punitive organisations - the legacy of an outdated system. Keith Blunt, who coached the England U21 men&apos;s team before heading here to manage their Olympic men&apos;s team, has worked at almost every level in the game in China since 1999. Despite a huge improvement in pitches and stadiums, Blunt believes the instruction of the game is stuck in the dark ages. &apos;I&apos;m trying to change that &quot;do it because I tell you to&quot;, old-style Chinese education system,&apos; says Blunt. &apos;You can&apos;t produce thinking players if they&apos;re not taught to ask questions. I worked with the Tianjin ladies club, who do sessions that are unbelievably hard. They train three times a day, six days a week. That sort of intensity knocks the guts out of girls. I&apos;ve seen 14-year-old girls forced to do shuttle runs after playing competitive matches. I said, &quot;Are you trying to kill them off or make them dislike football?&quot; They&apos;ll lose their best performance to the training pitch, it&apos;s ridiculous.&apos; Karl Hawkins runs the Hong Kong branch of Coerver soccer schools. He describes girls being &apos;locked up&apos; and forced to train as professionals from the age of 12. &apos;As adults they grow up incomplete,&apos; says Hawkins. &apos;They should be allowed to stay with their families. But the FA stick with the system because they are working to further their political rankings. They only want to win medals, they have no passion for the game.&apos; Sun Wen, China&apos;s most celebrated female player and Fifa&apos;s footballer of the 20th century, sees changes on the horizon. She is excited about the appointment of the new China coach, Swede Marika Domanski-Lyfors, whose brave changes to training routines and player culture initially shocked the Chinese. &apos;If I would have been able to have my family visit me during tournaments I would have loved it,&apos; Sun says. &apos;It was hard being a player in my day, it was very strict. If your family did not live in the same city as the institution you would only see them once a year.&apos; It was, and is, such a battle for girls to play, that Sun is reluctant to reproach the system. &apos;One of my team-mates had to run away from home to play football,&apos; she says. &apos;If football is what you love, then you will do anything to play.&apos; Sun predicts China will defeat Norway in Wuhan this afternoon. Such an achievement would surely inspire a new generation of Chinese girls to master the game their ancestors played millennia ago.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-22T23:10:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/24/athletics.sport1", "sentences": ["It motivated me to run faster.&quot; Ohuruogu, who competes once more this season in Shanghai on Friday, earned $12,000 for finishing third at a competition which has an uncertain future."], "title": "Athletics: Rampaging Richards puts Ohuruogu in her place", "article": "It is 26 days since Christine Ohuruogu became the 400m world champion and she has not won a race since. Three times she has attempted to beat the American Sanya Richards and on each occasion she has ended up a tired spectator. Yesterday in Stuttgart, the Briton needed all of the power she finds in the latter part of the event just to secure third place at the World Athletics Final as Richards soared away to another triumph. The prospect of Ohuruogu and her British team-mate Nicola Sanders - let alone the rest of the world - running for the minor medals at next summer&apos;s Olympic Games appears the best that can be hoped for. Ohuruogu, 23, may be the world champion, but there is little doubt that Richards, 22, is the world&apos;s best 400m runner. The Briton could not disguise that yesterday as she said: &quot;I think she&apos;s way ahead of the field, but also I think she can be beaten one day and I hope that will be by me.&quot; Richards has run arguably just one bad 400m all summer, but it was the key one when she was fourth at the US championships and failed to qualify for the World Championships in Osaka. While Ohuruogu and Sanders, who was second in Japan, produced the performances of their lives that night, had Richards been in the race it would surely have been a different outcome. But whether it was Zurich, Brussels, the blue track of Berlin or the green surface of Stuttgart yesterday, neither of the Britons has been able to offer any sort of challenge to the World Athlete of 2006, who added another $30,000 (\u00a315,000) to the $500,000 she won for remaining unbeaten in the Golden League. Ohuruogu had a full view of Richards from lane four yesterday, one behind her, and even after 50m the gap was immense. Sanders edged ahead of her British team-mate as they reached the home turn and though Ohuruogu came through well it was never going to be enough to catch Richards who won in 49.27sec. The Jamaican Novlene Williams was second in 50.12 followed by Ohuruogu in 50.20, with Sanders fifth in 50.44. &quot;It is one of my trademarks,&quot; said Ohuruogu, talking about her finish after Sanders had moved in front of her. &quot;I saw her come past and it woke me up. It motivated me to run faster.&quot; Ohuruogu, who competes once more this season in Shanghai on Friday, earned $12,000 for finishing third at a competition which has an uncertain future. The World Athletics Final is in the second year of its three-year deal at this venue, but VfB Stuttgart, the Bundesliga champions, have plans to redevelop this Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, their home ground, as a football-only arena without a track. There are those who believe the event is one too many anyway - but Britain&apos;s Marilyn Okoro would not agree with that. Okoro produced the fifth-best 800m time ever by a British woman when she finished third in 1min 58.76sec behind Kenya&apos;s world champion Janeth Jepkosgei, who won in 1.57.87, with Mayte Mart\u00ednez, of Spain, second in 1.58.14. &quot;I have been waiting to do that all season,&quot; said Okoro. &quot;That was my world championships final.&quot; It was lucrative weekend for Mo Farah. After winning $12,000 for finishing third in the 3,000m on Saturday, he added $3,000 yesterday with seventh in the 5,000m in 13.41.61 as the Kenyan Soi Edwin Cheruiyot won in 13.38.16.

Or even a shark called Prince Albert II of Monaco, Lord Linley, Camilla du Borbone, Princess Serge of Yugoslavia, or Salah al Fayed - brother of Mohamed - since the prince was hosting the event in the aquarium down the road from his palace, they were all guests, and any one of them might well have had have had a spare \u00a3250,000 in pocket or evening bag to christen the new species. The Blue Auction, raising funds for marine conservation, conducted by Christie&apos;s in Monaco, was for the right to name new marine creatures recently discovered by Conservation International in Indonesia. The evening raised more than \u00a31m, but the top bid was for hemiscyllium cenrawasih, a new species of walking shark - which can swim but prefers crawling on its pectoral fins.

The Red Detachment of Women ballet is one of seven shows that will be put on during a trial of the silver, egg-shaped building designed by the French architect Paul Andreu. In keeping with the controversy that has surrounded the siting of such a futuristic structure so close to The Forbidden City, the Red Detachment was conceived in 1964 as a challenge to traditional notions of ballet. It is a propaganda tale of a young peasant girl who joins the People&apos;s Liberation Army after being rescued from slavery. The ballerinas wear military uniforms, clench their firsts, fight with swords and dance through cannon fire. During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, it was one of only eight shows that Jiang Qing - better known in the west as Madam Mao - allowed to be staged. The choice partially reflects the selected audience during the trial period. According to the domestic media, the organisers will invite communist party cadres, construction workers and people whose homes were demolished to make space for the theatre development. Three vast theatres are encased within the &quot;tear drop&quot; outer shell , which is made of titanium and glass, Built at a cost of 2.7 billion yuan (\u00a3180m), the building is surrounded by water and looks as if it has no entrance. With state-of-the-art equipment, its 2,416-seat opera house, 2,017-seat concert hall, and 1,040-seat theatre are expected to draw the world&apos;s best orchestras, operas and musicals, as well as domestic productions. Other shows during the trial period include Swan Lake by the National Ballet of China, Sister Jiang by the Shanghai Opera House, and The Peony Pavilion by the Imperial Granary, a Beijing-based theatre group.

As a musician playing in the pit on a Chinese tour of 42nd Street, it is obvious to me that there is a market here for Broadway musicals. On the closing night in Shanghai, the ticket scalpers were getting over three times the face value of tickets. The Sound of Music tour in 2004 was a slam-dunk success partly because the film of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical is the first American movie to have been dubbed into Chinese. It is a well-loved show and some Chinese learn English by singing songs from it. 42nd Street, a particularly simple but fun story about a young newbie to the music theatre biz who through luck and talent becomes a star, is also sold out every night. As in all shows, some of the jokes go totally unnoticed by the audience. Nobody is surprised that one such line is the question about Peggy Sawyer: &quot;Is she trying to get into the chorus line of the football line?&quot; (We think 280-pound sumo wrestlers in helmets and body armour.)

Predicting audience reaction to the script (which is translated simultaneously) is difficult. But everywhere one goes in China, the people are ravenous to try out their English on us foreigners. Any attempt to help them is considered a huge favour. All through the show, the tap-dance numbers with spectacular costumes get hugely enthusiastic applause. At the end, after the curtain comes down, the audience surges to the edge of the pit to listen to the band play its lengthy finale, which meets with a huge roar of approval. It&apos;s an emotionally invigorating moment - in America, the audience often heads for the exit while the musicians are playing the finale. Obviously a top-flight cast with brilliant dancing and fine singing and great swing-jazz music are appreciated in China.

It was on Lord Goldsmith&apos;s legal advice that the country went to war with Iraq in 2003, and it was he who announced that a major corruption investigation into the British arms firm BAE should be dropped. Neither of these issues were given any detailed attention in the official release yesterday from his latest employers. Today Lord Goldsmith will start his new career as a senior member of a big American law firm on a salary thought to be in the region of \u00a31m a year. Like other members of Mr Blair&apos;s inner circle, the former government law officer has taken no more than the statutory three months to find a new and potentially lucrative job, and the firm that recruited him - Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP - made no secret that his experience in government was highly valued. In a statement, Martin Frederic Evans, presiding partner of the firm, said: &quot;His unique experience and reputation as one of the UK&apos;s most prominent ... QCs, and as the top government law officer will be a distinctive asset to our international offering, both in Europe and globally.&quot; Mary Jo White, chair of Debevoise&apos;s litigation department, was even more effusive. &quot;We are honoured that Peter Goldsmith, one of the world&apos;s finest advocates and public servants, will join our global litigation practice,&quot; she said. As European chair of litigation, Lord Goldsmith will be part of a firm that prides itself on conflict resolution and anti-corruption investigations - it recently acted for a company in connection with a worldwide inquiry into possible corrupt payments to government officials. And despite his title, Lord Goldsmith&apos;s efforts will not be confined to Europe. He said yesterday he hoped to be involved in litigation, arbitration and investigations &quot;globally&quot; in the firm, which operates in the US, Latin America and Asia, as well as in Britain and the rest of Europe. The most controversial law officer of recent times, Lord Goldsmith resigned in June, just days before Mr Blair left office. He was required by public service rules to leave a three-month gap between leaving his government post and taking up any new job, but said yesterday he had had a range of offers. A highly successful commercial barrister and QC before he joined the government, he said he planned to qualify as a solicitor and become an equity partner in the firm, taking a share of profits. He refused to say exactly how much he would earn, except that it would be less than if he had gone back to the bar. The most experienced partners in leading US law firms operating in the City of London make \u00a31m a year or more. Lord Goldsmith said he was also attracted to the firm&apos;s public service ethos and its pro bono work. Its lawyers give their services free at Hackney Law Centre, in east London, and to charities. &quot;I would hope to do advocacy in English courts, advocacy in other courts and international arbitration,&quot; he said. &quot;I will be involved in all aspects of global practice, doing it from Europe. It is a really good opportunity for me to do what I want to do transatlantically, internationally, globally. I&apos;m very excited and delighted about this opportunity. This is a new challenge for me and I&apos;m looking forward to it.&quot; The appointment is quite a coup for the firm, which has offices in New York, Washington, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Moscow, Hong Kong and Shanghai. It currently ranks top in the American Lawyer magazine&apos;s A-list, based on a range of factors including revenue per partner. Which is all a far cry from the turbulent time he endured in government. Lord Goldsmith was at the centre of controversy through much of his six-year tenure as attorney general. He was widely criticised for giving a terse statement that it would be lawful for Britain to join the US in waging war on Iraq only 10 days after delivering a much more equivocal opinion. There was a furore when he insisted on playing a part in deciding whether to press charges in the cash-for-honours affair, and he was accused of political interference in halting the prosecution against BAE for alleged corruption in an arms deal.

Brazil went ahead through an own goal after 20 minutes, and Marta doubled the lead soon after. Cristiane and Marta added two more in the second half. Marta is now alone atop the tournament scorers&apos; chart with seven goals.

The Americans were bidding for a third World Cup to go with titles in 1991 and 1999. But the US was by far the second-best team and a loss in the semifinals is a repeat of 2003 when it went out to Germany 3-0 at the same stage. It was also the heaviest defeat for the American women in any World Cup match. &quot;The first goal was kind of a fluke goal, then Marta comes down on the second goal and then we go down on the red card,&quot; American striker Abby Wambach said. &quot;Things were not falling for us today.&quot; &quot;We could have come out stronger I think but today was Brazil&apos;s day,&quot; Wambach added. &quot;I&apos;m heartbroken.&quot; Brazil coach Jorge Barcellos summed up the victory. &quot;Tonight we played as a team, and we have not always done that,&quot; he said. &quot;We have the individual talent and this game was a complete team effort.&quot; Brazil took a 1-0 lead in the 20th minute. Formiga sent in a corner, which bounced just short of the goal. Attempting to head it behind, midfielder Leslie Osborne headed it into the net between goalkeeper Briana Scurry and Lori Chalupny. Seven minutes later, Brazil&apos;s creative striker Marta struck her first. She evaded six American players and cracked a left-footed shot from 15 yards that hugged the ground and beat Scurry diving to her left. She got her left hand on the ball but couldn&apos;t stop it. Brazil may have also deserved a penalty in the fifth minute when American defender Cat Whitehill escaped despite bringing down Cristiane in the area. Forced to push for the goal in the second half, the US left itself exposed at the back with Maycon, Daniela and Cristiane narrowly missing in the opening minutes. Cristiane finally broke through in the 56th to make it 3-0, left-footing a shot home in a one-on-one contest with Scurry. The Americans had only two shots on goal in the first half and top striker Wambach was never a factor. Kristine Lilly, playing in a record fifth World Cup, had the best US chance in the second half but her point-blank shot landed in the hands of keeper Andreia in the 63rd. After the third goal, Brazil slowed the play as the Americans kept pressing for a face-saving strike. Brazil last flurry came in the 79th when Marta showed off all her talent. Off the left wing, she faked around US defender Tina Ellertson, raced into the box, swerved around another and beat Scurry with a shot that drew a huge ovation from a crowd of 48,000. Scurry, the 36-year-old veteran who was coach Greg Ryan&apos;s surprise goalkeeping choice against Brazil, had a nervous first half. In the 7th minute she came out to catch a free kick, but it slipped through her fingers, although Brazil missed a chance go score early. Scurry, playing in her 164th game for the U.S., was picked ahead of Hope Solo, who started the first four games for the U.S. in the World Cup. She gave up two goals in the first match but was unbeaten for the following 300 minutes. Ryan said he picked Scurry because of her quick reflexes. She was in goal in a 2-0 win over Brazil in June in New York, and she also was the keeper in the Americans&apos; 2-1 victory over Brazil in the 2004 Olympic final. Badly outplayed in that match, Scurry was credited with bringing the Americans gold. Brazil&apos;s victory was only it second over the United States in 23 games.

They have not been shown. They have not been told. Today they may stand on Waterloo bridge, look east and see a city that has been familiar to them all their lives. Tomorrow they will see something completely different, thanks to their mayor, Ken Livingstone. On my estimate 20 towers each more than 300ft high are planned, or proposed, to rise within half a mile of the Thames in inner London, with another 20 situated at random further back. Towers will be visible from every open space and down every street. The horizontal skyline of the capital will be transformed into a series of point blocks set in piazzas, shrinking the scale of what has always been essentially a street-based, intimate urban landscape. Downstream of Waterloo bridge the view will be dominated by a 43-storey tower of flats opposite the Temple, approved over the summer, immediately behind the National Theatre on the South Bank. Dwarfing even the 440ft wheel of the London Eye, this building will thrust itself into every London vista from the Embankment and the Thames bridges to Trafalgar Square and St James&apos;s Park. I have yet to meet anyone aware of its coming. It is of no published architectural quality and serves no public or ceremonial purpose. It is just a block of flats. Beyond it will rise a visual wall of glass skyscrapers along the river&apos;s south bank, two at Blackfriars, another behind Tate Modern, a higher King&apos;s Reach tower at London Bridge and at Bermondsey the 1,000ft &quot;glass shard&quot;, taller even than the highest structure at Canary Wharf. Behind this wall on the curve of the river will be the new City of London. The box-like blocks of the 1980s will be overwhelmed by a forest of &quot;shape architecture&quot;, parodies of Norman Foster&apos;s Gherkin by designers eager to impress the ever pliable City planners. There will be the 1,000ft &quot;Helter-skelter&quot;, the &quot;Cheesegrater&quot;, the &quot;Pinnacle&quot; and the &quot;Walkie-Talkie&quot;. These children&apos;s toy pastiches will be accompanied by banal Mies van der Rohe copies such as the Heron Tower. There has been no public debate or consultation on any of this. There is no vision or declared ideal of how new and old should marry in the future city. It will just happen because no authority has the guts to set individual developments in any wider context. The view upstream from Waterloo bridge will be no less extraordinary. At Vauxhall, opposite Tate Britain, the 50 storeys of Vauxhall Tower are about to rise, luxury flats approved by John Prescott against the pleas of local council, residents and planners, and against his own inspector. Rumour has it that Prescott wanted to rile his officials to show he was boss. No evidence justifying Prescott&apos;s decision has ever been published. His tower will be joined in a cluster by three others of similar height. These are not communities but urban fortresses, worse than anything inflicted on London in the 60s or 70s. Back from the river will be other blocks, each dominating its neighbourhood without regard for sightlines or area conservation. Two towers will loom over Waterloo station, and another over Elephant and Castle. Two towers are to rise over Victoria station, at one point rumoured to be of 50 storeys, dwarfing Belgravia and Pimlico and crushing the view of the Palace of Westminster from Waterloo bridge. A 43-storey giant is planned at Paddington Basin, disregarding the zoning that has so far held that development to medium height. Towers are also proposed for Chelsea Harbour, Warwick Road (the &quot;Tesco Tower&quot;) and Islington. Tony Blair gave Livingstone power to overrule any local opposition to these structures, including from London boroughs. While the mayor may consult local opinion, like a good neo-Blairite he can give himself permission to disregard it. The effect will be to render the banks of the Thames a wall of glass. Richard Rogers, Livingstone&apos;s partisan adviser (with a mighty slab by the river at Battersea), professed to want a &quot;string of pearls&quot; along the water. Moscow&apos;s Yuri Luzhkov, no less ambitious a building mayor than Livingstone, has some respect for his city&apos;s style and heritage. Livingstone and Rogers are erecting merely a wall of profit. They have no truck with streets or diverse neighbourhoods, which lack the architectural prominence of towers. Such riverside enclaves as Hays Wharf, Borough Market and the Globe will become huddled oases, rendered out of place and thus easier for future generations to eliminate. None of this is planned. It is urban anarchy. Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, even capitalist New York, have published policies on high buildings, with bans, height limits and zoning regulations. There are no towers in Greenwich Village or SoHo, and none in the historic quarters of other European cities. The closest parallel to what is happening to London is Shanghai and various banana republics, to which the mayor&apos;s office bears more than a passing resemblance. London&apos;s old zoning was cursed by the way central government overruled it whenever it chose. Hence Macmillan was lobbied by Conrad Hilton and Royal Dutch Shell and allowed towers to intrude on Hyde Park and to dominate the South Bank. But at least there were rules. Today London is the only developed city in the world that has none. The mayor&apos;s published policy states that he will allow high buildings &quot;where appropriate&quot;, unspecified. The reality is that a private citizen must adhere to restrictions on his windows, basements or skylights, but a developer with a deep pocket and access to Livingstone can potentially build anything he likes. This is utterly corrupt. The response from architects grovelling for the fame of a tower in their CVs is that they are &quot;only obeying orders&quot; from clients, and that tall buildings are &quot;the future&quot;. Such cliches are code for money, and would never be used if similar anarchy were to be visited on these architects&apos; backyards. One of the many ironies of Livingstone&apos;s policy is that he and his lobbyists boast of London&apos;s commercial attraction as depending on just the conservation-based urban texture to which he is opposed. Livingstone&apos;s forebears at County Hall used his arguments to try to demolish Covent Garden and Soho, as he has demolished Bishopsgate. It is conservation, not skyscrapers, that holds the key to London&apos;s future economic vigour. The mayor sometimes claims, ludicrously, that his towers are about &quot;affordable housing&quot;. Angry at Islington rejecting a 40-storey monstrosity that he wants in City Road, he claims it is for &quot;London&apos;s poorest citizens&quot;. Apart from the bribe of a few cheap flats (which never stay affordable for long), these towers are never for the poor. They are extravagant constructions requiring astronomical rents because above 300ft a third of their volume must go on services. That is why office skyscrapers are so hard to let, and why backing for the Bermondsey shard has recently collapsed. Livingstone&apos;s towers answer to his curious edifice complex. They are for the rich and he knows it. He just cannot kick the habit, familiar to lapsed leftwingers, of loving those with money. I suspect that even the rich, when they see what he has done to their city, will hate him for it. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Society", "Communities", "UK news", "Local politics", "Politics", "London politics", "London elections 2008", "Ken Livingstone", "London"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-27T23:16:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/28/news1", "sentences": ["The film recounts the erotic journey of a novice spy in wartime Shanghai and won the Golden Lion at Venice earlier this month."], "title": "In brief: Ang Lee's Lust, Caution breaks records in far east", "article": "Ang Lee&apos;s highly charged period thriller Lust, Caution got off to a record-breaking start this week in the director&apos;s native Taiwan as well as Hong Kong.

And most remarkably, it is on Gerrard Street, the main drag of London&apos;s Chinatown. Nice waiters? Interesting menu? Well-prepared dishes? Nobody goes to Gerrard Street for that these days. They go there to be shouted at by aggressive staff with personality disorders, and to eat food that will make them wake up the next morning feeling like a cat has slept in their mouth. True, the service in Chinatown always left something to be desired. I remember, nearly 20 years ago, eating a meal on Gerrard Street where the food took so long to arrive the sizzling dishes had gone sizzleless before reaching us. The waiters were so contemptuous of us that they made the noise with their lips as they brought the food to the table. When we refused to pay the pre-added tip, cooks clutching machetes came out of the kitchen to make sure we left. Quickly. Oh, happy days. But this, like the pathologically angry waiters at Wong Kei, was part of the pantomime. Generally though, a thriving Chinese population here ensured the food would be good if not excellent. In the past 10 years, increased competition, causing a shortage of skilled chefs combined with an obsession with the bottom line, has resulted in a charge down market at such speed it&apos;s only a surprise the restaurateurs haven&apos;t all got nosebleeds. The waiters on Gerrard Street are, for the most part, still aggressive and rude, but the food no longer excuses it. All the good Chinese places in London are generally not in Chinatown: the Royal China Group, Hakkasan and Yauatcha, Shanghai Blues, Taiwan Village and Snazz Sichuan. My old favourite Yming and the new arrival Bar Shu may be only just across Shaftesbury Avenue in Soho but that location is a declaration of intent. It says: believe us, we are not like that shower over there. But then there&apos;s Haozhan, whose chef, Chee Loong Cheong, used to work at Hakkasan, and where the menu doesn&apos;t just tour the predictable Cantonese staples but flirts with the occasional Japanese or Thai flavour. It even looks different: instead of going for decor reminiscent of your auntie&apos;s in Penge, like all the others on the strip, this one is modern with lots of clean lines, the walls fitted with mirrors and jade-green panels. And, whisper it, the waiters smile. The kitchen has a particular talent for deep frying, to produce items that are crisp but greaseless. A starter of crispy quail with chilli and salt, a dish familiar to me from Hakkasan&apos;s sister restaurant Yautatcha but available here at two-thirds of the price, brought two whole birds in a light, crisp batter sprinkled with aromatics which managed not to overwhelm the gaminess of the birds. Curry soft-shell crab sounded distinctly worrying (which was why we ordered it) but happily wasn&apos;t, the delicate creatures gently battered and sprinkled with shards of a fiery spice mix. My companion and I were divided over the spare ribs with a coffee sauce, which is to say he thought them odd in a bad way and I thought them odd in a good way. Yes, there was a bitterness to the sweet glaze on the thick meaty ribs, but also a certain fragrance which reminded me of rosemary. My friend&apos;s uncertainty didn&apos;t trouble me. It meant I got to finish them. We agreed about the star dish, the silver cod with a dry XO sauce of minced prawns and chillies. The generous slabs of fish had first been sealed off, but so sensitively that as you cut through the outer skin, the huge flakes of pearly fish fell apart. The XO part of this plateful simply cut through the richness. I would come here for this dish alone. Some other things didn&apos;t startle, such as underpowered scallops with macadamia nuts and stir-fried vegetables including a surfeit of out-of-season asparagus. The latter also turned up in a dish of Szechuan vegetables, which was more notable for the strands of silky tofu. Haozhan makes its own tofu, and there&apos;s a whole list of dishes using it which we should have tried but didn&apos;t. Convinced the Haozhan cooks were gods of the deep-fat fryer, we ordered their deep-fried ice cream, not least because it sounded like the sort of thing which would earn an indulgent mother a parenting order if she served it up to her kids. I&apos;m not sure it isn&apos;t, the ice cream buried under a sugared donut-like shell. Perhaps it&apos;s best avoided in favour of their calming and light pumpkin cream. As to Haozhan, it may well be the only good reason to visit Gerrard Street right now. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk ", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants", "Restaurants", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-30T00:04:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/30/motorsports.formulaone20072", "sentences": ["Hamilton can wrap up the title in the penultimate race of the season in Shanghai."], "title": "Formula one: Hamilton overjoyed after winning Japan grand prix", "article": "Lewis Hamilton admitted he was &quot;ecstatic&quot; to win the Japanese grand prix but, despite opening up a 12-point championship lead, played down talk of becoming the first rookie formula one world champion. &quot;I think at the back of your mind, in the subconscious, you do think about it a little bit, but I think the key for me is just to focus on the next race and just make sure my preparations are right and take it as it comes,&quot; he said. &quot;I think after the next race then you really have to start thinking about it but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s something you should be doing because you can worry. &quot;I hope I finish the next race and do the best job I can.

I need a retirement from Lewis with a mechanical problem to have a chance to win. If the races are completely normal, it&apos;s over.&quot; Alonso, whose car was damaged in a collision with Toro Rosso&apos;s Sebastian Vettel, was in fifth place when he spun out of the Fuji Speedway circuit and crashed into a wall with 25 laps remaining. &quot;In the car I felt a little bit strange after the touch but I think the accident at the end was because of aquaplaning,&quot; added the Spaniard.

After qualifying on Saturday, when Hamilton narrowly beat Alonso to pole in the dying seconds, the reigning double champion said: &quot;No problem, I enjoyed driving Fuji for the first time in these conditions. I enjoy driving in the rain and have no worries about a wet race.&quot; Whether it was a piece of psychology meant for Hamilton is anyone&apos;s guess, but the British driver was hardly disturbed. It was hard to believe that such an accomplished error-free drive was the 22-year-old&apos;s first full grand prix in wet conditions. There have been precedents - Ayrton Senna&apos;s performance in the Toleman at Monte Carlo in 1984 and the great Brazilian&apos;s debut victory in streaming rain in Portugal the following year, or Michael Schumacher&apos;s win in Spain in 1996 when he lapped as much as five seconds per lap quicker than everyone else in a Ferrari that otherwise proved itself a difficult car. Schumacher, that day, was almost alone in having a call upon a spare car with a full wet set-up. And these are gods of the sport, men with 10 world titles between them. On the evidence of yesterday&apos;s race and all that has gone before it this year, Hamilton looks set to join them. &quot;Lewis did an excellent job,&quot; the McLaren team principal Ron Dennis said. &quot;His racing performance has shown that he&apos;s very, very mature and very disciplined. I don&apos;t think anyone can question his ability. The challenge for a driver in these conditions, especially leading the race, is to not drive too quickly and the challenge for the team is to not go over the top on slowing him down. So the message was not to take risks and keeping him informed of where the puddles were, where the heaviest part of the water was. It was not so much his speed that impressed, but a completely error-free drive that takes him to next weekend&apos;s Chinese grand prix with the world title in sight. With the Japanese race held in the environs of Mount Fuji on the last day of September, rain was always a likelihood. The same can be said of Shanghai next weekend, the Chinese race featuring a rainy spell last year. Storms and flash floods are also not unknown at Interlagos in Brazil, which stages the final race. Alonso must be wondering just what he has to do, having joined McLaren in the expectation of winning a third world title. The Spaniard had relentlessly closed down Hamilton&apos;s championship lead from 14 points, at Magny Cours in July, to only two and his wet-weather ability was hardly in doubt. But it was the champion who lost his car on lap 42 and slammed into the wall &quot;I saw on one of the circuit screens that it looked like he was OK, which was a relief,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;At the N\u00fcrburgring I had a similar incident and lost 10 points there, so I&apos;m very fortunate that I&apos;ve been able to gain those back. Obviously it&apos;s a big boost in my drive to be world champion but there&apos;s two races to go and I need to knuckle down. I won&apos;t be partying tonight.&quot; Alonso was not in the mood to give in but he is now 12 points adrift of Hamilton, and at odds with his team-mate and the McLaren hierarchy after a season spent in the shadow of his rookie partner. &quot;It&apos;s not over because mathematically it&apos;s not over. But I need a very unlucky weekend for him to have a chance to win,&quot; the Spaniard said. &quot;I&apos;m not throwing in the towel but unless Hamilton retires, we have to be realistic and see that it&apos;s very difficult to recover six points per race . . . I&apos;ll keep fighting because, as last year showed, anything can happen.&quot; Alonso&apos;s relationship with both Hamilton and McLaren is fragile with Hamilton openly stating that he is not interested in moving team and that he would prefer to see Alonso in a Ferrari, though the Italian team&apos;s principal Jean Todt appeared to have put paid to that notion yesterday.

Millions of TV viewers must have wondered about the strange beast bouncing up and down excitedly on the touchline in Karlsruhe&apos;s stadium on Saturday - after all, Winfried Sch\u00e4fer, the equally furry ex-manager, left the club long time ago. To be fair to Willi, it&apos;s really not his fault that he&apos;s anonymous. It&apos;s only his first season in the top flight; when Karlsruher Sport-Club M\u00fchlburg-Ph\u00f6nix e. V last graced the Bundesliga in 1998, they still had Swinny the Fox scaring little children. Despite the obvious allure of the alliteration, the choice of a wild boar is certainly a brave one. These animals are a German delicacy, but they&apos;re also pig-ugly, very shy, and famous for being little more than the favourite food of Asterix and Obelix. If his team continue the way they have started, however, Willi will soon be accepted into the rank of famous German football pigs, like ex-Schalke legend Marc &quot;Willy the War Hog&quot; Wilmots and Bastian Schweinsteiger. As one happy KSC player after another was interviewed following their emphatic 3-1 win over Dortmund, Willi had a field day in the background. He waved into the camera, stuck up two thumbs and raised a fist in jubilation. He had finally arrived. And so have the team. After their fifth victory, the newly-promoted Badeners find themselves in third place in the table, behind title-chasing Bayern and Schalke, and look set to be this year&apos;s beloved plucky over-achievers. Not even a punch-up between keeper Markus Miller and South African Bradley Carnell following their 1-0 away victory in Frankfurt has proved detrimental to their progress. Miller had complained about Carnell&apos;s lack of defensive discipline; Carnell didn&apos;t like Miller&apos;s goal-kicks. When the argument turned a little physical, the goalkeeping coach got involved just in time: Miller, a keen hobby boxer, was close to knocking Carnell out. The German FA saw no need to punish these intra-team fisticuffs, however, and manager Edmund &quot;Ede&quot; Becker also let the brawlers off lightly: they had to apologise and pay for the team&apos;s breakfast the next day. Whatever they were serving up in the Wildpark Stadion (insert your own wild boar sausage joke here, please) must have done the trick. KSC fans and players were delirious on Saturday, some were even talking about Europe. &quot;We are only accumulating points to stave off relegation,&quot; warned manager Becker. A KSC loyalist since 1990, the 51-year-old models himself on the reassuringly cheerless Werder boss Thomas Schaaf. &quot;Passion trumps talent,&quot; he explained in old-school terms after the demolition of Dortmund and he added that &quot;football is a running game&quot; for good measure. Before the season, Becker thought he was already &quot;60% fired in statistical terms&quot;, but both he and the intelligently-structured team seem good enough to stay the course. The same cannot be said of Thomas Doll, however. Three defeats on the trot have put poor Doll&apos;s head firmly on the chopping block. Borussia president Hans-Joachim Watzke remained silent in Karlsruhe but admitted to &quot;puking&quot; after Dortmund&apos;s 3-0 home defeat during the week. Even their own sponsor made fun of the team&apos;s ineptitude in a newspaper campaign. Once again, their performance was really quite revolting. Karlsruhe striker Sebastian Freis, who scored the home side&apos;s wonderful third goal, joked about the opposition&apos;s geriatric defence, Robert Kovac and Christian W\u00f6rns, who are a combined 68 years old. He called them &quot;mature gentlemen with problems catching up&quot;. Roman Weidenfeller in goal has never conceded less than three goals, either. &quot;Dolly&quot; can point to injuries to key players like Sebastian Kehl and Alexander Frei, and he wasn&apos;t solely responsible for the composition of the squad, either - sporting director Michael Zorc has been buying duds for a many a year now. For Frankurter Rundschau, Borussia resemble only &quot;a caricature of a class team&quot; and the Ruhr Nachrichten has simply called them &quot;a team of failures&quot;. The players have decided not to talk to the press - Schalke did the same last season - but that&apos;s only enraged the local media even more. &quot;For many weeks, captain W\u00f6rns has been playing like the leading actor in his own silent movie,&quot; thundered the Ruhr Nachrichten. They were thinking of Laurel and Hardy, not Valentino. But the manager is still the main culprit in the eyes of public. Doll, whose friendly, guy-next-door attitude nearly got Hamburg relegated last season, has always resisted calls to be more authoritarian. He simply does not look convincing when he now talks &quot;of a tough team meeting where tough words were spoken&quot;. He quickly cancelled a planned trip to the Oktoberfest beer festival in Munich, but can offer neither explanations nor genuine hope. In his desperation, he came over all biblical in Karlsruhe. &quot;We are walking through a deep valley but we will get out of it,&quot; he said. The vultures are circling. Stuttgart, though, have fallen perhaps even harder. Their 2-1 defeat in Rostock compounded the joy of their fierce local rivals Karlsruhe, and confirmed their own terrible start to the season. All their confidence seems to have dissipated over the summer break and the defence, in particular, is an unmitigated disaster. Next up are Barcelona in the Champions League, so no worries there. &quot;I think they might get some chances against us,&quot; said manager Armin Veh sarcastically. Bremen, on the other hand, &quot;are beginning to heat up&quot; quite nicely, according to sporting director Klaus Allofs. An 8-1 thrashing of Bielefeld proved that ridiculous results are not the prerequisite of Pompey and Reading, and the result has emboldened them to look at leaders Bayern with renewed confidence. Bremen not only covet the Bavarian&apos;s No1 spot but also one of their players: Lukas Podolski. The German international is unable to break up the Rib\u00e9ry-Klose-Toni trident and cuts an increasingly forlorn figure. General manager Uli Hoeness has criticised his pedestrian playing style and lack of attitude on the pitch. In his home town of Cologne, &quot;Poldi&quot; was hyped up as a superstar, but at Bayern, people are less prone to &quot;blow powdered sugar up his arse&quot;, as Hoeness delicately puts it.

Conditions at the Fuji Speedway, where the Japanese Grand Prix took place on Sunday, fitted the bill perfectly. It was wet, wet, wet and still pouring when the race started - behind a safety car. The safety car was deployed not because, as is usual, someone had crashed, leaving debris on the track. No, it was there purely on account of the impossible weather conditions. As if the rain wasn&apos;t enough by itself, it was pouring down on to a track hardly visible because of fog and mist. With the tyres raising a splash quite a few feet high, visibility between one car and another was notable by its absence. And then, there was the ever-present risk of &quot;aquaplaning&quot; - the life-threatening process whereby the tyres float on the water on the track, instead of on the tarmac. This renders the driver a mere passenger in a car whose movements he can no longer influence. At 50 mph, the horrendous conditions we saw at Fuji on Sunday would turn driving into a dice with suicide. At 150 mph and more, the dicing became an open invitation. And yet sons of women hurled themselves around the track at 150-plus for lap after lap after lap. &quot;Why don&apos;t they stop the bloody race?&quot; one wondered. Silly question. Motor racing is in every sense a blood sport. In fact, in years past, many stands on circuits were hung with banners proclaiming in large letters: &quot;MOTOR RACING IS DANGEROUS&quot;. That was supposed to deter spectators from getting too close to the track. Today, everyone is supposed to know - including the drivers - that once strapped into their cars, the drivers are no longer of this world, already. If that&apos;s why man, ever the closet voyeur, congregates in large numbers at racing circuits Sunday after Sunday during the Grand Prix season, why should the organisers spoil the &quot;fun&quot;? Well, the GP race at Fuji went on, though twice adjudged dangerous enough for the safety car to be called into use. And motor racing fans were lucky that it wasn&apos;t halted. For this was one of those races that no-one who saw it ever forgets. From beginning to end, it placed one&apos;s heart in one&apos;s mouth. Above all, this one race satisfied all our curiosity about Lewis Hamilton by answering every question we have ever wanted to ask about the new &quot;boy&quot; phenomenon of motor racing. Is he really a better driver than his team-mate, the current and twice world champion, Fernando Alonso? Undoubtedly. Driving the same car under the same intolerable conditions, Hamilton exhibited a coolness under pressure, total fearlessness and sheer concentration that saw him take winner&apos;s trophy, while his more &quot;experienced&quot; team-mate, Alonso, ended up crashing into a wall. Can Hamilton get good results if Alonso is not co-operating with him by sharing track information that can assist the engineers in deciding on the cars&apos; set-up? Absolutely. Hamilton took pole position from Alonso on his last lap during qualifying. With only two points then between him and Alonso, it stood to reason to conclude that even if Alonso wasn&apos;t already miffed at the challenge posed to him by the &quot;young pretender&quot;, he would not be human if he did not withhold any information that might conceivably benefit Hamilton. Indeed, in snatching pole position from Alonso, Hamilton gave one in the eye to the Spanish followers of Alonso who have been claiming in motor racing blogs that Hamilton owes his prowess on the track to Alonso&apos;s influence on the performance of the McLaren cars. Do the McLarens owe their magnificence to stuff the team has &quot;pinched&quot; from Ferrari? Obviously not: the McLarens outperformed the Ferraris both in qualifying and during the race at Fuji. Anyone who thinks that a Lewis Hamilton championship will be &quot;tainted&quot; by the Ferrari &quot;espionage&quot; affair must do us the favour of asking why, if the red cars are so good, they cannot beat the McLarens when it matters most? Can Hamilton, then, win the next race at Shanghai, China and take the championship even before the last race is held in Brazil? The answer is yes. After his Fuji miracle (for that&apos;s what it was) Hamilton has convinced many people that he is made of the same stuff as made Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher the most awesome men ever to apply a pair of hands to the steering wheel of a racing-car. And Hamilton is still only 22, and in his &quot;rookie&quot; year. Pure, solid, unadulterated genius - that&apos;s what he is.

He had begun the year with high expectations of qualifying for the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai next month, limited to the world&apos;s leading eight players, and was on track when he entered the top 10 for the first time at the beginning of the clay-court season. Then came the wrist injury in Hamburg that ruined his chances of further significant progress. He is currently ranked No18. Tipsarevic, the Serbian No2 behind Novak Djokovic, this year&apos;s US Open runner-up to Roger Federer, had beaten Murray in their only previous ATP Tour meeting in the Artois championships at Queen&apos;s last year but quickly found his serve under pressure against the Scot, who has built a reputation as one of the game&apos;s best returners.

Beneath their snug-fitting carbon-fibre skins are the technical masterpieces that will carry either Lewis Hamilton or Fernando Alonso to the world championship, if not tomorrow then almost certainly in Sao Paulo a fortnight later. Yet these two projectiles also symbolise an intense rivalry within McLaren, not only between the two drivers but also between the mechanics and engineers who toil behind the scenes to manage a complex balancing act. In effect it amounts to two independent technical units within the same team. So how does the hierarchical discipline work when it comes to administering these teams within a team as the high-octane formula one battle rages all around them? &quot;On the technical level we have Mark Williams, who coordinates the whole programme as chief race engineer,&quot; said Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren&apos;s chief executive officer. &quot;But beneath him the hierarchy splits into two separate groups with individual senior race engineers - Phil Prew on Lewis&apos;s and Mark Slade on Fernando&apos;s car - both of whom report to Williams. But they are assisted by a range of data- acquisition engineers and analysts who are responsible for collecting data from the car, controlling the set-up in any circumstance and communicating with the mechanics who have hands-on involvement with each particular machine. &quot;There is also what we know as a No1 mechanic on each car, both reporting to a chief mechanic, while there are a group of specialist engineers and data analysts to help process and interpret that information. The dedicated team on each car relies on that information coming in constantly over the weekend.&quot; Whitmarsh said the whole team were mindful of the challenges involved in keeping in check the conflicting pressures involved. He acknowledged that it was important to guard against the burning competition between these two self- contained teams spilling over the boundaries making personal achievement secondary to the team&apos;s overall strategy. &quot;I don&apos;t think it ever erupts out of control,&quot; he said. &quot;But there is plenty of natural competitive spirit within the respective groups and they therefore have a particular pride in how the individual cars - and therefore their drivers - perform. &quot;Their job is to optimise the potential performance but they are trying to beat the whole field - all the other cars - and not just their team-mate, although we acknowledge the reality that there is also a special rivalry between the two groups of guys within the same teams. &quot;While the team&apos;s individual drivers are interested in their own personal performances, I&apos;m sure that the engineers are a little more neutral. In that process all the data, whether generated from either car, is available to both drivers. Saturday morning we can do tyre evaluation, or an aerodynamic sweep [assessment] or simply testing new components.&quot; At the track the computer data are available to the team instantaneously. In fact a gear change will show up on the telemetry computer screen before the engineers in the pits hear the sound of the change. All this technology and know-how is seamlessly meshed within a complex technical cocktail designed to trim milliseconds off lap times as the team battle to keep the upper hand on their celebrated and equally confident rivals. &quot;The challenge is to supply more and more intellect to understand how the car is performing,&quot; said Jonathan Neale, the managing director of McLaren Racing. &quot;What we are trying to do is enable our engineers back at the McLaren Technology Centre [in Woking] to be a closer part of the business of running the car.&quot; Whitmarsh believes that most formula one drivers are very self-reliant as well as highly competitive individuals. He thinks they are also more resilient than one might expect and well capable of handling the ups and downs of the business. &quot;It&apos;s obviously amplified by the mood and is the same whether we&apos;re talking about the first race of the season or the championship decider,&quot; he said. &quot;Drivers of the calibre that we employ, like Lewis and Fernando, are ferociously competitive.

Either way, the title battle now goes on to the final round in Brazil next Sunday week after Lewis Hamilton possibly failed in his bid to become the sport&apos;s youngest ever champion after sliding into a gravel trap on the entry to the Shanghai pit lane. Lewis was leading the race commandingly and it looked as though he was on course to get the job finally done on a rainy day in misty China when this crucial slip occurred. Now he goes to Interlagos with 107 points, four ahead of his team-mate Alonso and seven ahead of the Kimster who scored his 14th career victory in fine style. Hamilton had dominated the wet opening stages, but stayed out too long on extremely worn intermediates tyres, and ran wide into the gravel in the pit entry when he finally came in for a stop. The McLaren became beached in the gravel and the championship leader was out of the race. Hamilton left the circuit pretty soon after retiring from the race, but the 22-year old paused to explain that he felt absolutely gutted in his disappointment. &quot;There is still one race to go and I can still do it,&quot; he insisted. &quot;I made a strong start to the race and prior to my pit stop I was constantly talking to the team [over the radio]. Although my tyres were in poor condition we took a joint decision to get through the last rain shower before switching to dry tyres.&quot; Raikkonen had overtaken Hamilton shortly before the British driver made his crucial slip, after which the Finn retained masterly control to score his fifth win of the season with the FerrarI team and the 14th overall in his career. He took the chequered flag 9.8sec ahead of Alonso&apos;s McLaren with Felipe Massa&apos;s Ferrari coming home third ahead of the impressive Sebastian Vettel&apos;s Toro Rosso and Jenson Button&apos;s well driven Honda. McLaren admitted they made the wrong call by not bringing Hamilton into the pits to switch to dry weather rubber earlier than the end of lap 31, by which time his worn wet rear rain tyres were shot to the point where they were delivering zero grip. &quot;If we&apos;d switched to new options we&apos;d probably have had graining in those conditions, but with hindsight we as a team made the wrong call, &quot;said McLAren CEO Martin Whitmarsh. &quot; If we&apos;d called him in one lap earlier we&apos;d have been in good shape, but by the time he got to the pit entrance his rears were badly damaged - and it was difficult enough without having tyres in that state.&quot;", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula one 2007", "Kimi Raikkonen"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-07T13:03:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/07/art.friezeartfair", "sentences": ["When she settled it wasn&apos;t at a London gallery but at the King&apos;s Lynn Arts Centre in Norfolk, which offered her a two-year bursary: &apos;Being outside London opened me up to a bigger picture.&apos; She curated a new-media show by Korean artist Kira Kim, and her expertise in Chinese art fed into an offsite project at the National Trust&apos;s Oxburgh Hall with Shanghai-based sculptor Liu Jianhua."], "title": "Unsung eleven: meet the art world's new pioneers", "article": "The expression &apos;think outside the box&apos; is an indisputably horrible one, I know, but in this instance, it comes in rather handy. On one level, art galleries are only boxes, after all: four white walls and a shiny parquet floor on which to hang or mount paintings, photographs and sculpture. Some of these boxes are the size of department stores, and justly celebrated for their blockbuster shows and their irresistible shops full of postcard souvenirs. Others are smaller, cooler and, for the majority of us, intimidating and impenetrable: your wallet must feel mighty swollen in the pocket of your Commes des Garcons cocoon coat before you even so much as dare to open this kind of gallery&apos;s fortress-like door. But there is another way. In Britain, a new generation of curators and entrepreneurs are thinking outside the box (Tara Cranswick, for example, has set up a co-operative in which members share ownership of an evolving collection). These people love and know about art, but they also want to make it more accessible to the public, and to help young artists benefit from what even the most cautious critics regard as a boom time for the art world. They don&apos;t worry too much about old-school rules, about such things as lighting or whether they are working out of a suitably grand address (the Riflemaker Gallery in Soho is in an old gun shop; the art production company Artangel&apos;s most recent work is at Wembley Stadium). This is a big month for art in Britain: Millais at Tate Britain is already under way, and this week a Louise Bourgeois retrospective opens at Tate Modern. So, too, does the massively lucrative Frieze art fair. But size isn&apos;t everything. The other end of the market - more fluid, less stuffy - is every bit as exciting, perhaps more so, if new ways of seeing and future stars are what get your fingertips tingling. Mark Sealy The diversity champion As director of Autograph, the Association of Black Photographers, and joint CEO of Rivington Place, a new public building in east London dedicated to culturally diverse art and photography, Mark Sealy has faced some opposition in his time. &apos;There are a lot of people out there who think we are building a cultural ghetto, but I think it&apos;s absolutely right that black and indigenous people should criticise us. It keeps us on our toes.&apos; When Autograph was set up in 1988, &apos;there were huge issues around race and representation post-Brixton riots,&apos; says Sealy. &apos;We lobbied the Arts Council and got funding, and aimed to create a more inclusive agenda in terms of the types of images that were being circulated.&apos; The organisation is not an agency, but supports and promotes black photographers through a programme of projects and events. Sealy is particularly excited about gaining recognition for older photographers, such as Shemelis Desta, who was court photographer to Haile Selassie in the Sixties and Seventies. But it is only this year that Autograph has found a home worthy of its ambition: the newly opened Rivington Place, designed by David Adjaye, which it shares with visual arts organisation InIVA. After training in fine art at Goldsmiths, Sealy spent many years working for the Arts Council and is acutely aware of inequality in the art world. &apos;There are an infinite amount of art spaces I&apos;ve been to where I am the only black person in the room. It&apos;s a fact that institutions reflect the kind of people that work in them. It&apos;s not surprising that people in the art world are white and middle class, because they have the support structures behind them to work in low-paid jobs. Similarly, the people who can afford to volunteer as a board member for an arts organisation are not single, black women. Put simply, the visual arts economy is pathetic.&apos; Katie Toms Isabella Macpherson The eco-aware facilitator With a background in fine art and business, Isabella Macpherson has found a niche bridging the gap between those who want to buy art but don&apos;t have relationships with dealers, and emerging artists whose work might not otherwise have that exposure. Arts Co, which she set up earlier this year with Sigrid Wilkinson, offers independent advice to companies and individuals, with a special interest in supporting emerging artists. Macpherson is also invited by collectors and project spaces to put on exhibitions, and because she is constantly scouting for new talent and doesn&apos;t have her own stable of artists, her advice can be independent. Arts Co also works extensively with environmental company Adventure Ecology, which has its own gallery open to the public in London&apos;s Charing Cross Road where Macpherson shows artists whose work addresses environmental issues. The current exhibition is a new discovery: 24-year-old, self-taught New York artist Aurel Schmidt, who explores the detritus produced by rampant consumerism. Macpherson also has an ongoing project, through Adventure Ecology, sending artists to respond to environmentally damaged regions; the first of these exhibitions, Ecuador Block 16, can currently be seen at The Hospital in Covent Garden. &apos;All our work has come through word of mouth,&apos; explains Macpherson. &apos;Art is becoming more democratised - artists have more of a voice, people are more aware, it&apos;s covered much more in newspapers and the corporate world is more interested in investing in the arts. It needs people driven by passion to bring the two together.&apos; Stephanie Merritt Tot Taylor and Virginia Damtsa The genre-juggling mavericks &apos;There is a format but it doesn&apos;t really apply to us,&apos; says Riflemaker&apos;s Tot Taylor on the subject of running a gallery. When, with co-director Virginia Damtsa, he took over John Wilkes&apos;s gun shop on Beak Street three years ago, they kept the five-storey Soho townhouse as they found it. &apos;The first three artists we brought in all said: &quot;Yellow walls? No lighting? You must be kidding!&quot;&apos; The white room wasn&apos;t the only convention the pair were happy to break. Shows at Riflemaker run for eight weeks, twice as long as at most other commercial galleries, and artists are often encouraged to make changes midway through. Last year, it &apos;became&apos; another gallery, revisiting shows from famous Sixties Mayfair space Indica.The directors Taylor, 49, and Damtsa, 30, have a background in music and avoid art-speak like the plague - &apos;No, we are not exploring ideas of gender!&apos; Even their decision to set up shop in Soho was somewhat unorthodox. Now they are preparing to open Riflemaker 2 in a much larger building on Soho Square. Making money does not appear to be their primary concern, but Riflemaker has been very successful in its three years of operation; a buzz surrounds everything they do. Taylor puts much of their success down to naivety and an unwillingness to compete with other galleries: &apos;We&apos;re not really watching anybody else.&apos; They represent 17 artists, many of them young and up-and-coming, such as Jamie Shovlin, who opened the space in 2004, and Francesca Lowe, whose Terminus, a collaboration with Scottish novelist Alasdair Gray, is currently on show at the gallery. Mixing disciplines in this way is characteristic of Riflemaker&apos;s approach, and Taylor and Damtsa spend up to two years planning and researching each project. Killian Fox Tara Cranswick The co-operative trailblazer Zimbabwe-born painter Tara Cranswick was working for Charles Saatchi and in her spare time putting on exhibitions of new work in disused spaces around London with a friend, when they came up with the idea of a shared-ownership contemporary art collection that would make owning art accessible to ordinary people. V22 is a plc traded on the smallest of the three London stock exchanges; investors buy shares in the usual way and also have some influence over the future direction of the collection. Work is bought for a mixture of cash and shares, so that the artists represented in the collection retain a stake in their own work and are actively involved in shaping the collection. &apos;Good artists know [other] good artists so they can introduce us to people and nominate new work. That&apos;s how it goes forward,&apos; Cranswick explains. Because they are investing other people&apos;s money, they have a set of criteria for inclusion: artists must be represented by a dealer or a major collection or have a solid working track record for the past five years. The real bonus is that, as an investor, you can treat the collection like a lending library and have works to show in your own home; what you can borrow is not dependent on the value of your shares, which makes it truly democratic (it is, though, dependent on your home meeting the insurance criteria). Attached to the collection is the V22 Ashwin Street gallery space, in Dalston, east London, a former squat that Cranswick and friends have spent a year refurbishing and that will show new works acquired by the collection, as well as experimental work by new artists. &apos;It&apos;s been an extraordinary thing, to start out with what seemed like a crazy idea and have people take it on and invest money in that idea,&apos; says Cranswick. &apos;The artists have responded well because there really is no model like it.&apos; SM Peter Jones The passionate publisher Turps Banana is a painter&apos;s delight. About as far from a stuffy art auction house as it is possible to get, the magazine is written by, for and about painters, and mainly comprises critical appraisals of artists&apos; work by their peers. Editors Peter Jones and Marcus Harvey sensed a lack of painting coverage in existing art magazines, but were not sure if interest would extend beyond their friends. The pair are practising painters in their forties, who met when they shared a studio in Brixton. Ten years of passionate conversation later, the magazine was born, with the first issue published in July 2005. Now approaching issue four the print run is 1,500, with back issues being snapped up with gusto. &apos;Our friends laughed when they heard about our idea for a painting magazine. It was them who started calling it Turps,&apos; says Jones of the magazine&apos;s unusual name. &apos;Then one night in the pub, I threw the word &quot;banana&quot; in and that caused them to giggle, so the name stuck.&apos; (The connotations with Andy Warhol&apos;s Velvet Underground album cover didn&apos;t hurt either.) A cover price of \u00a36 and a no-advertising policy means finance is tricky, so Jones and Harvey are holding an auction - of banana-inspired paintings of course - to raise funds. Contributors include Damien Hirst, David Hockney and Rebecca Warren. So is Turps Banana a backlash against the conceptual art of the era dominated by the YBAs? &apos;I&apos;m not crazy about a lot of the conceptual crew, but this isn&apos;t a &quot;stuff you&quot; to conceptual art,&apos; says Jones. &apos;It&apos;s simply that what we are interested in isn&apos;t out there. The truth is, painting has never gone away, but some people just don&apos;t know what to say about it.&apos; KT Sook-kyung Lee The new establishment insider &apos;I feel responsible for bringing artists over here from Asia,&apos; says Dr Sook-kyung Lee, Tate Liverpool&apos;s new curator of exhibitions and displays, &apos;because there are so many good artists and so few of them are really known in Europe.&apos; The westward tide of Asian talent is swelling and Lee is the foremost - perhaps the only - curator specialising in South Korean art in this country. Born and schooled in Seoul, she first came to London for a year&apos;s scholarship at City University in 1996. She returned three years later to do an art history PhD at Essex University and then became a freelance curator, &apos;putting on shows in Norway, Hawaii, anywhere&apos;. When she settled it wasn&apos;t at a London gallery but at the King&apos;s Lynn Arts Centre in Norfolk, which offered her a two-year bursary: &apos;Being outside London opened me up to a bigger picture.&apos; She curated a new-media show by Korean artist Kira Kim, and her expertise in Chinese art fed into an offsite project at the National Trust&apos;s Oxburgh Hall with Shanghai-based sculptor Liu Jianhua. Her new job at the Tate has meant she&apos;s had to forfeit the second year at King&apos;s Lynn, but she is planning a &apos;culminating project&apos; there next year, &apos;probably the first contemporary show of Korean art in a British public gallery, representing up to 15 artists&apos;. Lee is excited about the prospect of working with a national collection at Tate Liverpool and plans to &apos;develop a wider scope of artists and exhibitions than they have now: not just from Asia but also from North America and other European countries&apos;. KF Rebecca Wilson The online revolutionary A former editor of Art Review, Wilson was approached by Charles Saatchi to start up a daily web magazine that would cover everything going on in the art world. Since then, the website (launched as Your Gallery, recently rebranded as Saatchi Online) has expanded to become a platform for artists and art students where they can display their work. The website now has 50 million hits a day and its own saleroom, where artists can put up works with a price and sell them through the site, which most importantly doesn&apos;t take a commission. &apos;The art world is quite small and there are only really a handful of galleries,&apos; says Wilson. &apos;Many artists don&apos;t find it easy to put on shows and we wanted to create an alternative platform for people who haven&apos;t been to the right art schools or had the right connections. The internet has had a huge impact in terms of acquiring art and the traditional triangular relationship between artist, dealer and collector is changing.&apos; The site is completely open and there is no monitoring or curating; neither does it carry advertising, being funded by the Saatchi Gallery. But it is also proactive in taking work from the site out into the commercial environment - Wilson has selected 20 artists from the site to be exhibited at the Zoo art fair and is also working with Channel 4 on 4 New Sensations, a competition for students, with 20 shortlisted artists being exhibited at Brick Lane&apos;s Truman Brewery to coincide with Frieze. SM James Lingwood and Michael Morris The production powerhouse For 15 years, James Lingwood and Michael Morris&apos;s Artangel has worked with exceptional artists to produce some of the most resonant works of our time, in some very unusual places. As a production company for artists, Artangel&apos;s collaborations have produced work at sites as varied as an empty department store (Michael Landy&apos;s Breakdown) an east London park (Rachel Whiteread&apos;s House) and Margate (Penny Woolcock&apos;s forthcoming film Exodus, with contributions from Antony Gormley, Rufus Wainwright and 1,000 locals). When Lingwood and Morris began Artangel in the Nineties, it was with a feeling that the existing institutional set-up was unable to respond sufficiently to artists&apos; ambitions. Without the constraints of a building, a schedule and a budget, they hope that &apos;artists can step up a gear when they come to talk to us&apos;. They produce perhaps three or four works of art a year and have won thousands of admirers, many of whom have joined the Company of Angels, paying \u00a3500 a year for the thrill of being part of the creation of unfamiliar art in unfamiliar places. It&apos;s important art, too, because although Artangel stands outside what used to be thought of as the system, and the work it produces is often geographically peripheral (their current exhibitions are a crowd-inspired sound and video installation by Paul Pfeiffer in the shadow of Wembley Stadium, and a work by Roni Horn involving glacier water in a small town on the west coast of Iceland) the work is as culturally central as it gets. &apos;People sometimes talk of us as a brand,&apos; Lingwood says, &apos;but we&apos;re not a brand in the sense that there&apos;s any visual consistency. Each time, we start from the ground up, looking for divergency and specificity. As producers, it&apos;s very important for us to be stretching ourselves. So if we are a brand, it&apos;s a brand of one-offs.&apos; Geraldine Bedell Susanna Beaumont The Scottish ambassador Scotland was no Mecca for contemporary art when Susanna Beaumont, 43, opened her gallery in an old Edinburgh tyre shop six years ago. But with Doggerfisher Gallery, she has helped change all that. Most of the 15 artists she represents are building international reputations; four of them represented Scotland at the Venice Biennale earlier this year. &apos;It feels like we&apos;re a band on tour,&apos; she says. &apos;Berlin [this week], Frieze [next week]. You move around with a speed and energy that you might not have in London. And then you come back here and look at the hills: that&apos;s important.&apos; Beaumont lived in London and Egypt before moving to Edinburgh, where at first she worked as a journalist. &apos;It was the time of devolution and Edinburgh felt like a capital, but it didn&apos;t have the international contemporary art galleries that London or New York did.&apos; Her client list now includes a Turner-shortlisted artist, Nathan Coley, but Beaumont&apos;s focus is wider than her gallery. &apos;It&apos;s about the whole of Scotland, and being an ambassador and having a passion for what&apos;s happening elsewhere, in Dundee or Glasgow or up in Orkney.&apos; Unusually for an independent gallery director, Beaumont works closely with the National Gallery and other organisations to achieve what she calls &apos;collective pulling power: getting people up to Scotland to see all the great things happening here&apos;.

The championship leader had been struggling to keep his car on the track for some time, his tyres clearly shredding and worn flat. Now he must go to the season&apos;s last race in Brazil in a fortnight to try to claim his first title. It will be a three-way fight, with his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, four points behind him and yesterday&apos;s race winner, Ferrari&apos;s Kimi Raikkonen, seven points behind. Although nobody at the tyre company would comment on the matter, it is understood that the Bridgestone engineers told McLaren to abandon their gamble of keeping Hamilton going with wearing tyres to avoid having to make an extra pit stop for fuel later in the race. At the time Raikkonen, in second place, was slicing several seconds a lap off Hamilton&apos;s lead. Hamilton said he was dismayed at sliding off just after entering the pit lane but remained confident that he would win the title. &quot;I was having a great race and we didn&apos;t know whether it was going to rain or not,&quot; he said. &quot;The tyres I was on were getting worse and worse and in the end I could almost see the canvas underneath. &quot;Coming in to the pits it was like ice. I couldn&apos;t do anything about it. My mirrors were dirty; I couldn&apos;t see the tyres but it felt like they were completely finished. I was coming in on that lap so it could have worked out perfectly. I&apos;m sorry for the team; they did a fantastic job as always. We&apos;ve still got one more race to go. Don&apos;t worry, I can still do it. &quot;When I got out of the car I was just gutted because I hadn&apos;t made a mistake all year and to do it on the way to the pits is not something I usually do. But you can&apos;t go through life without making mistakes. I&apos;m over it, now we look on to Brazil.&quot; Ron Dennis, McLaren&apos;s team principal, said that Hamilton accepted some share of the blame for his failure to finish a race for the first time this season. &quot;I think Lewis drove an excellent race,&quot; he said. &quot;This was about how wet the pit lane was, tyre condition - it&apos;s just one of those things. He was very keen to maintain the lead and was so comfortable pulling out a gap on Kimi, although I suppose he gave the tyres just a little bit more of a hard time. &quot;I don&apos;t think we did anything dramatically wrong and I don&apos;t think Lewis did. But the circuit was much drier than the pit lane entrance and that made the difference. Lewis has been very controlled, obviously disappointed, and he acknowledges his part in the whole thing. &quot;We were unconcerned with Kimi and happy to just let him past. The problem was rain, and Lewis&apos;s tyres were in the worst condition. We weren&apos;t at all fazed about Kimi; we didn&apos;t care about Kimi; we weren&apos;t racing Kimi; he was racing Fernando. Kimi winning and Lewis coming second was adequate - but it just didn&apos;t work out that way.&quot; McLaren&apos;s chief executive, Martin Whitmarsh, admitted the team had to shoulder much of the blame for not calling Hamilton in earlier. &quot;With hindsight we should have brought him in one lap earlier and we would probably have got the job done,&quot; he said. &quot;But it was a long race and we made those calls. Sometimes they&apos;re bang on, sometimes they&apos;re not quite right.&quot; Whitmarsh said Hamilton would inevitably blame himself for how his race ended. &quot;Lewis wanted to win this race in style and was clearly a little bit harder on his tyres than some of the drivers around him,&quot; he said. &quot;He is such a professional and such a perfectionist, of course he&apos;ll blame himself, but he&apos;s part of the team. We win together and sometimes we get it wrong together. We&apos;re going to Brazil for a really exciting finale. He&apos;ll be determined to win in Brazil.&quot; Alonso, whose feud with his team and team-mate showed no signs of cooling at the weekend, must still beat Hamilton in Brazil to stand a chance of retaining his title. &quot;It&apos;s a very difficult championship because I know it will not be easy to take four points off Lewis,&quot; he said. &quot;The performance will be, I hope, very similar between the two of us all weekend. Hopefully I can do a good race, but for the championship I still have to do something really dramatic if I want to win.&quot;", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula one 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-07T23:07:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/08/motorsports.sport3", "sentences": ["But in Shanghai the challenge was more complicated, calling on the competitors to strike the optimum balance between the weight of the fuel load, the grip of the tyres and the wet or drying Tarmac track surface."], "title": "Formula one: McLaren lose tactical lottery", "article": "Lewis Hamilton&apos;s defeat and Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s victory in the Chinese grand prix reflected just what an unpredictable lottery formula one can be when a wild card, in the form of extreme weather conditions, is tossed into the competitive mix. Yesterday&apos;s race was all about tactics, drivers grasping any opportunity to inch their way up through the field while harnessing every bit of their teams&apos; technical and strategic experience to claim an advantage. In dry conditions races usually unfold in a routine and orderly fashion. But in Shanghai the challenge was more complicated, calling on the competitors to strike the optimum balance between the weight of the fuel load, the grip of the tyres and the wet or drying Tarmac track surface. The real risk in these conditions is being greedy and trying to squeeze too much performance out of your car for too long, as McLaren did with Hamilton, who skidded into a gravel trap and out of the race on his entrance to the pit lane after 31 laps. &quot;It was tempting to bring him in earlier,&quot; said McLaren&apos;s chief executive, Martin Whitmarsh, &quot;but there were spits of rain at that point and the threat of another shower. We could have brought him in. Our assessment at the time was wrong, but we thought there&apos;d be a greater risk if we put him on to dry tyres. The circuit was about ready for it but there is always a risk of a driver sliding off on coldish tyres in difficult conditions like that.&quot; In the opening stages Hamilton, having started from pole position, had built up a 6sec lead over Raikkonen after only 10 laps, with the Finn&apos;s Ferrari team-mate, Felipe Massa, third ahead of Hamilton&apos;s McLaren team-mate, Fernando Alonso. Hamilton made his first refuelling stop at the end of lap 15, briefly dropping to fourth, then climbed back to second before going back into the lead again on lap 19 after Raikkonen made his first scheduled pit stop. As the race settled back into its rhythm after the first spate of refuelling stops, so Raikkonen stepped up the pressure, trimming Hamilton&apos;s advantage to less than 0.1sec on lap 28, the two surviving a brief wheel-banging moment before Raikkonen took the lead, and after Hamilton&apos;s untimely exit the Finn was left comfortably in front of Alonso and Massa, with the impressive Jenson Button running strongly in his Honda, relishing treacherous conditions that put a premium on driving skill. Raikkonen managed to keep using wet-weather tyres until his second refuelling stop and maintained very quick lap times right through to the end of the second stint. Yet whereas the Ferrari driver won with a two-stop strategy, Toro Rosso&apos;s rising star Sebastian Vettel made very good use of a one-stop strategy to finish fourth, a performance described as &quot;a fantastic effort&quot; by the team&apos;s tyre engineers. Raikkonen said he had to battle serious understeer at the start of the race which slowed the pace of his Ferrari. &quot;I was one of the last to switch to dry tyres but this was a help as after a little while it began to rain again,&quot; he said. &quot;Even after the second stop the understeer came back again but, as before, the situation improved in the final stages.&quot; Bridgestone agreed that this had been a difficult race. &quot;Tyre management and pit-stop timing was very important in the changeable conditions,&quot; said Hirohide Hamashima, the director of the company&apos;s motorsport tyre development. Hamilton had driven superbly to take his sixth pole position of the season, handling his McLaren with a deft economy of effort that was as immaculate as it was effective. At the post-qualifying media conference the mood of the weekend was thrown into sharp relief as the Ferrari drivers Raikkonen and Massa - respectively second and third in the final grid order - sat scowling morosely on either side of the elated young Briton. Raikkonen had set the pace throughout the three practice sessions but lost time on Saturday morning with power steering problems. Alonso was equally furious that he had been unable to match Hamilton&apos;s pace in qualifying. The Spaniard climbed from his car and hurled his helmet at the pit garage wall before storming back to the team office in the paddock where he punched a door off its hinges. But some 24 hours later he was smiling at Hamilton&apos;s expense. &quot;Today was a very good result for me,&quot; he said after finishing second. &quot;I had a battle with Felipe Massa at the start but was not able to get ahead of him by the end of the opening lap. I lost a lot of time due to understeer in his slipstream and just managed to jump him at the final round of refuelling stops which assured me of second place.&quot; The Spaniard refused to back down on his comments on Saturday that he had &quot;expected much more&quot; from the team this season and that &quot;their treatment hasn&apos;t been that good. It&apos;s not treatment that a two-time champion deserves or even an ordinary person&quot;. &quot;I didn&apos;t say anything that is not true,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;The team has been saying many, many things, many bad things about me, from Spa onwards especially, and the relationship hasn&apos;t changed too much. He [the team principal, Ron Dennis] was the first one to say that he was not speaking with me and things like that, so from that point I understood that the championship was not easy for me at all.&quot;", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula one 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-08T00:04:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/08/motorsports.sport4", "sentences": ["Standings Hamilton 107 Alonso 95 Raikkonen 90 October 7 Chinese GP Shanghai Hamilton fails to finish for the first time."], "title": "Formula one: How the season went down to the wire", "article": "March 18 Australian GP Melbourne Kimi Raikkonen wins from pole but Lewis Hamilton&apos;s podium on debut steals the show.

And that&apos;s what I think will happen in Brazil, so everything will be up to me. &quot;The second half of the season has been difficult and it still is, but I think in the end the two cars will be the same.

Saturday's match could force me finally to choose", "article": "I have written about this before, but only on a theoretical level. I now have to confront it in reality. My nightmare dilemma has become real. Which of my nations do I support next Saturday: England or France? I am, of course, referring to the semi-final of the rugby World Cup, which was not expected to feature either country. So I&apos;ve been ill-prepared to have to make a choice. You rightly point out that I must have watched many contests between the two nations, especially at football and rugby. Yet somehow those choices didn&apos;t matter much, not deep down, and I was able to switch allegiances as the mood of the moment took me, mainly on issues of utmost triviality. I felt angrily French when some silly English food critics claimed that Britain had better restaurants than France, yet stoutly English when the French claimed that you couldn&apos;t get a decent meal in London. But that insouciant scatter-gun approach will no longer do. For some reason I believe that my decision about Saturday&apos;s match will be a watershed, more serious and long-lasting. In future, when people ask me (as they do, often), &quot;But what do you really feel?&quot; instead of answering with my usual flippant, &quot;It depends&quot;, I will be able, confidently, to assert whichever one I have chosen - and mean it. I don&apos;t want you to think that I&apos;m having some kind of crisis of identity. I&apos;ve been perfectly happy in my indecision; it hasn&apos;t mattered. It&apos;s not that I&apos;m desperately seeking to establish a permanent dominant patriotism, but I have this premonition that one will attach to me. How will I make up my mind? I have drawn up a balance sheet. On the left side, I was born in France, my father was in the resistance and I was brought up in a French cultural environment. But on the other side, I&apos;ve lived and worked most of my life in London, and I&apos;m now more attuned to English culture and general ambience than to their French equivalents. I won&apos;t go on about my lists because I soon realised that such mechanical comparisons could never determine loyalty. It has to come from the heart, a wise person once told me, and it comes unbidden. It&apos;s an emotional realisation, not an intellectual one. Alas, I have not yet been visited by whatever it is that provides the answer; my heart has not advised me which way to turn. But I have high hopes that it will, on Saturday evening. Perhaps I will only know the moment the two teams run out on to the pitch. Or maybe nothing will happen and I will spend the rest of my life in a limbo of perpetual patriotic uncertainty. I&apos;ll let you know. What with my natal city Marseille getting such a lot of media coverage over the past two weeks - not just as the scene of England&apos;s greatest victory on French soil since Agincourt, albeit on a rugby field, but also as the football team that miraculously beat Liverpool last week - I have become obsessively irritated with newspapers that spell it Marseilles, with a final s. The main culprits are the Times and the Independent. There is no reason whatsoever for those papers to continue this insulting practice, which has been going on for well over 100 years, for reasons that remain unclear to me. It cannot be compared with the English calling Roma Rome or Moskva Moscow. In those kind of cases it&apos;s a question of suiting the spelling to the pronunciation of a name which is different from the way the natives say it. The Englishisation may result from a genuine inability of the English to say or spell a name properly (Warszawa becomes Warsaw) or from a tradition born of laziness or arrogance (there is no reason why the English can&apos;t mouth Roma just as easily as Rome). Marseille is different from those sort of examples. The pronunciation is the same whether or not there&apos;s an s at the end. Everyone I&apos;ve heard say the name out loud - even readers of the Times and Independent - pronounces it Mar-Say, which is more or less OK. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve heard anyone say Mar-Sails. So what is the point of the extra consonant if it is always silent and has no impact on the name&apos;s pronunciation? It serves only as a reminder of British insensitivity. York&apos;s pathetic campaign to try to rid the city of foie gras reeks of utmost hypocrisy. Last week, its brave city councillors took the momentous decision to ban sales of the delicacy on local authority premises (the city hall&apos;s cafeteria will never be the same again), and anti-foie gras activists put on a hilarious pageant in which an attractive vegetarian model pretended to be force-fed, like the geese whose enlarged livers form the basis of the dish. It was rank hypocrisy because many animals and birds destined for our food tables are treated far worse than geese - chickens reared under battery conditions are just one example. There are many, many millions more unhappy chickens than unhappy geese. Did I fail to spot the attractive vegetarian model pretending to remain in a suffocatingly confined space for the whole of her life, surrounded only by others in similar torment? Have I missed the council&apos;s resolutions on all the other edible victims of bad treatment? The councillors had wished to go further, prohibiting restaurants and food-shops from selling foie gras altogether. It was pointed out that such a ban would be illegal. This week Marcel saw The Bourne Ultimatum: &quot;Good, but I preferred the days when intelligence agents had to use brains and instincts rather than have all the answers presented on a computer screen.&quot; Marcel unexpectedly followed the motor racing from Shanghai: &quot;Only because I was up early in the morning.

Further reflecting on his failure to win in China, Hamilton believes that, ignoring the disappointment of the moment, he still demonstrated the same dominant form that earned him the fourth victory of his rookie formula one season in Japan the previous weekend. &quot;We made a decision to stay out on the wet tyres - the intermediates - and after the first stop I was running between five- and seven-tenths of a second faster than Kimi and Fernando, so I was eating into my tyres quicker than they were going to,&quot; he said. &quot;My mirrors were just covered in mud and dirt from the rain and spray and I couldn&apos;t see anybody behind me. &quot;That also made it difficult for me to see the conditions of the rear tyres, but the team said it was going to be fine and there were only a couple more laps to do.&quot; He added: &quot;We were in a perfect position to win the world championship, but at the end of the day I wanted to win the race.&quot; Hamilton is considering a visit to his hero Ayrton Senna&apos;s grave after the race.

Hamilton, the 22-year-old Briton who could become the first rookie to win the formula one title as well as the youngest champion, leads Alonso by four points ahead of the decider at Interlagos on Sunday week. Finland&apos;s Kimi Raikkonen is a further three points back for Ferrari in the first three-way battle down to the wire since 1986. Carlos Gracia, head of the Spanish Motorsport Federation who will be attending the race as a guest of McLaren principal Ron Dennis, told AS newspaper that he had raised concerns with the FIA president Max Mosley last week. &quot;I showed my concern over the situation that Fernando is going through, which is no secret, and he [Mosley] reassured me,&quot; said Gracia. &quot;The FIA are going to have an official who is going to watch very closely that nothing bad happens to Fernando, above all in qualifying, which is where there have been most complaints or strange situations in recent races.&quot; Hamilton has been nurtured by McLaren for the past decade while Alonso joined from Renault at the end of last year and has become increasingly isolated within the team. Dennis revealed last week that their relationship was very cold and they were no longer on speaking terms while Hamilton has accused the double world champion of lacking loyalty. The breakdown in relations has been exacerbated by emails from Alonso that were used in evidence against the team in a spying controversy that cost McLaren the constructors&apos; championship and a \u00a350m fine. The Spaniard was strongly critical of Dennis and the team at last weekend&apos;s Chinese Grand Prix, suggesting again that McLaren were favouring Hamilton. &quot;My confidence in this team is zero,&quot; AS quoted Alonso as saying after qualifying in Shanghai. McLaren issued a statement yesterday reiterating their determination to treat both drivers equally in Brazil. Meanwhile, Hamilton has decided his PlayStation rather than space-age technology will serve him better ahead of Interlagos, a track on the calendar Hamilton has yet to experience, unlike Alonso and Raikkonen. That has not hampered Hamilton so far in his debut year as three of his four victories have been at circuits where he had not previously driven. But despite the fact McLaren have a multi-million pound simulator at their Woking factory, Hamilton feels his games console will prove more than adequate. &quot;I&apos;ve no plans to use the simulator, although I can if I want to,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;But I only use it if I come into the factory for development work on the car.

True, they were not pointing their guns at the babushkas but many people panicked, wondering how Chinese forces had reached parts of central Russia, a feat not achieved by either the Nazis or Napoleon&apos;s army. Those who watched local television knew this was a joint exercise, the first of such magnitude, between Russian forces and over a thousand men of the People&apos;s Liberation Army - and the most startling evidence so far of the extraordinarily cordial relations between Moscow and Beijing. It has become a commonplace of international diplomacy that Russia and China often work together on key issues. They have frustrated western hopes for sanctions or other tough action on disputes ranging from Burma and Darfur to Iran. They are blocking a solution on Kosovo. What few in the west have spotted is that Sino-Russian rapprochement has reached such a point that the two huge countries&apos; relations with each other are far warmer than either US-Russian or US-Chinese relations. In other words, the famous US-Russia-China triangle Nixon and Kissinger created by their path-breaking overtures to Beijing in the early 1970s is completely reversed. China, in those Maoist days, was mired in a mixture of international quarantine and self-imposed isolation, feared by the Soviet Union and hated by the US. The two Americans dramatically broke the mould. They cleverly manipulated Mao&apos;s ideological rivalry with Moscow to bring China back into the global arena and thereby infuriate and put pressure on the Soviets. This helped to ease the US retreat from Vietnam. Now Russia and China are together and the US is out of the loop. It is a stark fact that Condoleezza Rice and defence secretary Robert Gates cannot ignore today as they start two days of talks in Moscow. No more easy concessions from Moscow and Beijing. Both powers are big boys and can bargain as hard as anyone from Washington, whether neocon or &quot;realist&quot;. Russia&apos;s friendship with China is not just a ploy by their elites. It has grassroots resonance. As Oxana Antonenko, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies points out, many Russians now see China as their country&apos;s closest partner. The number of Russians who feel China is a friend, according to a recent poll, is more than double the number who feel that about the US. Some 24% of Russians fear clashes with America in the near future. Only 4% see a chance of that with China. These pro-Chinese views are particularly strong in the Russian far east, an area in which analysts used to detect Sinophobia, based on fears that China&apos;s booming population would covet eastern Siberia&apos;s rich resources and vast open spaces. Human contact, and economic benefit, have had the opposite effect. About 200,000 Chinese now live in Russia. This may not sound much compared with the numbers of Chinese in the US, Australia, or southeast Asia, but in Russia Chinese settlement started from a zero base a decade ago. Many more Chinese come in seasonally to plant and pick crops, not just in the border areas but deep into European Russia. Mixed marriages are common, and reports say that one of the favourite pastimes of Chinese teenagers living across the river Amur from the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk is to train binoculars on the girls going by, pick out a likely local lass, cross over and woo her - and then live in Russia. The countries&apos; economies differ - one reliant on exports of energy, the other on low-wage industrial products, but they are complementary. Each is a good customer of the other. At the policy level, their partnership functions most strikingly in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a body established six years ago. Working less formally until then as the Shanghai Five (other members were Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan), the group succeeded in resolving all the outstanding Sino-Russian disputes over the borderline. Now the SCO helps to accelerate Russia&apos;s rising military links with China, not only the export of weapons but also in licensing and joint production. It has proved so successful that India, Pakistan and Iran want to join, presenting the SCO with the same widening-versus-deepening dilemmas that the EU knows so well. Members are not in full agreement on how to proceed. China prefers to focus on regional economic links, Russia on military partnership and strategic concerns. But they share the view that by working together they can reduce US and western pressure while also preventing unwelcome democratisation of the &quot;colour revolution&quot; type. As Russia moves back from the freedoms of the Gorbachev and Yeltsin years, its internal politics increasingly resemble China&apos;s. Beijing tightens controls on activist websites and peasant protesters in advance of next year&apos;s Olympics. The Kremlin squeezes radical critics out of the December contest for seats in parliament. Unlike China, Russia is still nominally a multiparty system, but its ruling party is virtually unassailable. Putin&apos;s surprise decision last week to put himself at the head of the electoral list of the ruling party, United Russia, has lifted it to 54% in the polls. The Communists, on 6%, might not even break the 7% barrier required to get into the Duma. No doubt Putin&apos;s people will rectify that, since they want at least one quasi-opponent around, in addition to the phoney pro-Kremlin parties they have created. The two other ways that Russians could express opposition have been abolished. The right to vote &quot;against all&quot; is dropped. Low turnout will no longer invalidate an election. Hinting he may become prime minister, Putin has found the best way to get round the bar on a third consecutive term as president. The constitution describes the president as commander-in-chief, but it does not say he controls the foreign ministry and security structures. A presidential decree does that. In the remaining months of his term, Putin could sign a new decree giving control over them to the prime minister. It would be a masterstroke. Whether their system is best described as &quot;bureaucratic capitalism&quot; or &quot;authoritarian capitalism&quot;, Russia and China are firmer friends today than they were in their Communist period. They have given a new meaning to &quot;triangulation&quot;. The west should take note. j.steele@theguardian.com", "tags": ["China", "Russia", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-11T23:08:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/oct/12/personaleffects", "sentences": ["You could go on to Hong Kong or Vietnam from here by train; however, the Z trains to Shanghai will whizz you there overnight in comfort."], "title": "Is it worth paying more for business class?", "article": "I&apos;m desperate to go to New Zealand to see my children and granddaughter, but hate long-haul flights. Last time I was sick, but I couldn&apos;t even lie down to sleep. Should I spend some of my savings and go by business class? Is it worth it? Worth stretching yourself After years of long-haul holidays my wife and I, as a treat, decided to fly business class. That was four years ago and we would never travel any other way to distant destinations. Of course it costs more but you are treated like a human, have the ability to sleep reasonably comfortably, can take more luggage and in the event of delays have comfortable surroundings in which to pass the time. If your savings can take the expense, then treat yourself. Tony Greenfield, via email Slow boat cuts carbon count Go by cargo boat. They can be very comfortable and take about six weeks either way, but you don&apos;t have much opportunity to spend money. You&apos;ll be helping your carbon footprint too and if you keep a travel journal you may get a small fee from a travel magazine who&apos;d be interested in printing it.  Jacqui Davis, Cambridge Family ties bind Children living abroad often means you have to fly long haul to keep those family ties strong. These trips aren&apos;t just holidays, they&apos;re part and parcel of your family life. You may not always be able to travel, so go business class and make it an experience to remember.  Ann Newell, Thame, Oxfordshire Half-way house Travel in premium economy class. It may not be as luxurious as a fully flat bed but the seats recline 50% more than in economy and have a full leg rest and foot bar.  Stephanie Davenport, Milton Keynes.  Business isn&apos;t always the business Not all business class is the same, and they don&apos;t all have flat beds. It&apos;s not worth the extra if you only get a bigger seat.  Howard Peters, Haywards Heath Make a trip out of it Make up a flight of several sectors and spend a day or more at each city - for example, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney, Auckland. Each city has a lot to offer, as well as luxury accommodation that will add up to far less than the business class fare. Also, follow a few rules that will help your body cope with flight at altitude: do not drink alcohol or eat large meals for two days before and during the journey, drink water during the flight and set your watch to the destination time at the start of each flight.  Marilyn Charlton, East Yorkshire, who wins this week&apos;s \u00a325 National Book Token Peruse the permutations It can sometimes cost little more than \u00a3729 to fly London-Hong Kong-Christchurch-Auckland-Los Angeles-London, while other permutations up to \u00a31,400 are still cheaper than a business return. Even an overland leg, such as bus or train across North America, might ease the strain of long haul.  John Burke, via email  Railway&apos;s the way Go by Eurostar to Brussels then connect to the Thalys express to Cologne in time to do some food shopping, so you&apos;re not reliant on the restaurant car. You can now lie down on the clean sheets as the train heads for Moscow, where two nights later you arrive at 7.30am (ish). Just after 8am on most days a train leaves for Beijing, arriving by evening rush hour five days later, having seen lots of birch trees and most of Siberia and Mongolia. You could go on to Hong Kong or Vietnam from here by train; however, the Z trains to Shanghai will whizz you there overnight in comfort. Maybe time to fly a bit. Bangkok is not a long haul away. Now back on the train to head south through Thailand and Malaysia to Singapore, which is about two days away then a flight to New Zealand, possibly via Australia. This trip should give you plenty to talk about with the family. Visit  seat61.com, which is a wonderful know-all website for world train travel. If you are still considering flying business class, don&apos;t bother. Spend your money on this journey with real class.  Roger Coates, Hull Countdown to touchdown I always pack a pair of track pants which I change into just before the flight takes off, a pashmina, a blow-up pillow, some lip and face moisturisers, toothbrush and a clean pair of knickers. Audio books on an MP3 are the greatest thing for demolishing the time. Finally, once on board, remember that in less than a day you&apos;ll be seeing your children and grandchildren again and every hour on board is an hour less until you are reunited.  Kate Vennell, Coulsdon Go on, treat yourself Go first class. You occasionally find bargains, and even if you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll be treated like royalty and have the cabin almost to yourself. The only problem is that it spoils you for ever travelling economy again.  Tony Sherlock, Oswestry, Shropshire In-transit hotel My mother-in-law regularly does this journey and recently switched to business class due to back pain; definitely worth the extra, she says. Seat design differs by plane and airline, so do some research to make sure you get the right sort of seat. The long journey is also much more bearable if you split it and get a good sleep at an airport transit hotel. These are in the transit terminal itself, so make sure your bags are checked right through to New Zealand from the UK. They operate in six-hour slots (you can pre-book online) and are eminently affordable. If possible, go via Changi airport (Singapore) - it&apos;s the best international airport I&apos;ve been to, and there&apos;s even a swimming pool and gardens for transit passengers. And don&apos;t forget to check if you can get air miles too, especially if you stump up for business class. Rachel Smithies, London Join the club I have travelled to New Zealand twice - the first time economy and the second time club class. Club is well worth dipping into your savings for. I arrived much less stressed and didn&apos;t dread the journey back home. I am very frightened of flying, but felt very cared for in club class and the amount of space you get takes away the hemmed in feeling. Make sure you break the journey up into bearable lengths. London to Singapore and stopover two nights, Singapore to Sydney and one or two nights stopover, then a short hop to New Zealand, which you could do economy. Christina Davies, via email Around the world in less than the price of a business ticket If time is not a constraint, buy a round-the-world ticket and stagger your journey, stopping off for a couple of days in, for example, Dubai, Bangkok, Sydney, Bali, Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York. Even with the additional cost of accommodation this will be less expensive than flying business class. You&apos;ll also have visited new and interesting places, rather than simply laid down in hermetically sealed &quot;luxury&quot;.

Bored with his English major, he discovers a passion for politics and later graduates with honours in 1969. He also becomes interested in the topic of global warming after taking a course with Professor Roger Revelle, one of the first scientists to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 1976 Gore quits law school in March 1976 to run for the House of Representatives. He wins a Congress seat and is then re-elected three times, in 1978, 1980, and 1982.  Gore holds first congressional hearings on the climate change, and co-sponsors hearings on toxic waste and global warming. 1984 Gore successfully runs for a seat in the United States Senate, where he serves as a senator for Tennessee. 1988 Gore runs for president, but fails to obtain the Democratic nomination. While spending time with his son, who is recovering from a near-fatal car accident, Gore begins to write a book on environmental conservation.  1992  Bill Clinton chooses Gore to be his running mate for the 1992 United States presidential election.  Gore&apos;s book, Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit, is published. 1993  After a successful election campaign, Gore is inaugurated as the 45th vice-president of the United States. As vice-president, he pushes for the implementation of a carbon tax to modify incentives to reduce fossil fuel consumption, which is partially implemented.  1994  On Earth Day, Gore launches the Globe programme, an education and science activity that uses the internet to increase student awareness of their environment. 1996  Clinton and Gore are re-elected for a second term in the 1996 election. 1997  Gore helps broker the Kyoto protocol and pushes for the passage of the treaty, which calls for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. He is opposed by the Senate, which unanimously passes a resolution stating that the US should not be a signatory to any protocol that does not include binding targets and timetables for developing as well as industrialised nations or &quot;would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States&quot;.  The refusal to sign is symbolic, as the protocol is non-binding unless it is ratified by the United States. 1998 Gore symbolically signs the Kyoto protocol.  2000 After two terms as vice-president, Gore runs for president, losing controversial election to George Bush. He wins popular vote but loses electoral vote.  2002  Gore announces he will not stand as presidential candidate in 2004 elections. He criticises Bush for the war in Iraq. Gore returns his focus to the problem of climate change. He edits and adapts a slideshow he had compiled years earlier, and begins to tour it as a multimedia presentation around the US and worldwide.  2004  Gore launches the company Generation Investment Management, which aims to blend traditional equity research with sustainability issues.  After the premiere of the film The Day After Tomorrow in New York, film producers Laurie David and Lawrence Bender see Gore&apos;s slideshow presentation. Inspired, they meet with director Davis Guggenheim about the possibility of making the slideshow into a movie. Through sceptical at first, Guggenheim agrees after seeing the presentation.  2006 An Inconvenient Truth is released in May.  In the film, Gore reviews scientific opinion on climate change, discusses the politics and economics of global warming, and describes the consequences of global climate change if the amount of human-generated greenhouse gases is not significantly reduced. Using Antarctic ice core samples, he examines the annual temperature and CO2 levels for the past 650,000 years. The film includes many segments intended to silence critics who say that global warming is unproven.  Gore states that he will devote 100% of the profits to a new campaign to further spread the message about global warming. The makers of the film, Paramount, commit 5% of their profits for the film to the Alliance for Climate Protection. On a bank holiday weekend in the United States, the film grosses an average of $91,447 (\u00a345,097) per theatre - the highest amount for any film released that weekend, and a record for a documentary. Figures released in June 2007 showed that the film had grossed over $24m(\u00a311.8m) in the US and over $49m (\u00a324.1m) worldwide, making it the fourth highest-grossing documentary in America after Fahrenheit 9/11, March of the Penguins and Sicko. Later that month, the film is screened at the Cannes film festival. January 2007 An Inconvenient Truth receives standing ovations at the Sundance film festival in Utah.  February 2007 An Inconvenient Truth wins the Oscar for best documentary, and the Sir David Attenborough award for excellence in nature filmmaking. During global warming awareness month, Gore and Virgin boss Richard Branson announce the Virgin Earth challenge, a competition offering a $25m (\u00a312.3m) prize for the first person or organisation to produce a viable design that results in the removal of atmospheric greenhouse gases. March 2007 Gore hosts an event in Cambridge for power players from business, media and sport. He makes his slideshow presentation and teaches them how to make the case for action on climate change in their industries. Gore testifies about global warming during a hearing held by the Congress committee on energy and commerce. The Scottish executive announces plans to screen Gore&apos;s documentary as part of its geography curriculum. June 2007 Gore backs campaign to switch off London&apos;s lights for one night in mass carbon saving event. July 2007 Gore organises Live Earth, a seven-continent, 24-hour sequence of concerts taking place in London, Sydney, Johannesburg, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hamburg and New York to raise global awareness on climate change. October 2007 Al Gore wins Nobel peace prize.  An Inconvenient Truth is criticised by a high court judge who highlights what he says are &quot;nine scientific errors&quot; in the film. December 2007 Gore speaks at the UN climate conference in Bali, attacking Bush&apos;s position and urging ambitious plans despite the US refusal to compromise, saying that the US position will change when a new administration takes over. March 2008 The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) launches an advertising campaign claiming that Al Gore&apos;s Tennessee home uses 20 times the energy of the average American household. A spokeswoman for Mr Gore says that this claim is based on old data, prior to major renovations on his home being completed.  April 2008 Gore, through the Alliance for Climate Protection, launches a three year, $300 million campaign which aims to mobilise millions of Americans to force politicians to implement aggressive reductions in emissions. May 2008 La Scala in Milan announces it has commissioned a full-length opera based on An Inconvenient Truth, to be staged in 2011. June 2008 Gore endorses Barack Obama as the Democratic presidential candidate. July 2008 Gore calls on the US to produce all its energy from zero-carbon sources within 10 years, saying that the future of human civilisation is at stake. September 2008 At the Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York, Gore calls for direct action, saying he believes &apos;we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants&apos;. December 2008 Speaking at the UN climate change conference in Poznan, Poland, Gore says people have become too obsessed with celebrities such as Paris Hilton, O J Simpson and Anna Nicole Smith, preventing people from focussing on the crisis of climate change. January 2009 Gore testifies to the Senate foreign relations committee about the dangers of global warming, two days after President Obama vows to put the US at the forefront of the battle against climate change. March 2009 In an interview with the Guardian, Gore says he believes that following the election of Obama a &apos;political tipping point&apos; has been reached and there is now enough political momentum to tackle the challenge of global warming.", "tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "Al Gore"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-12T11:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/13/tvpickoftheweek.television", "sentences": ["Fist Of Fury (Lo Wei, 1972) 11.05pm, Five The inimitable Bruce Lee in his second feature film plays Chen Chen who returns to Shanghai to honour his dead kung-fu mentor, and kick some serious ass in the form of the low-grade karate thugs who murdered him."], "title": "The week's best films: Oct 13", "article": "Saturday Oct 13 The Way West (Andrew V McLaglen, 1967) 4.30pm, C4 With three of Hollywood&apos;s biggest stars saddled up, this is probably the best film from the recently deceased McLaglen. A band of Missouri farmers are beset by the usual perils on the Oregon trail: Kirk Douglas leads the way, Robert Mitchum is the scout and Richard Widmark the sneering rebel. A Beautiful Mind (Ron Howard, 2001) 8.30pm, BBC2 Howard&apos;s portrait of the Nobel prize-winning mathematician and paranoid schizophrenic, John Forbes Nash, turns a complex, conflicted soul into a standard Hollywood hero with charming chat-up lines (&quot;Ritual requires that we proceed with a number of platonic activities before we can have sex&quot;) and an occasional delusion thrown in. It won four Oscars anyway. Moulin Rouge! (Baz Luhrmann, 2001) 9.05pm, C4 Luhrmann&apos;s fantastically energetic anthem to the great, tacky Parisian nightspot turns a frenetic pop-video eye on grand opera: the result is a sensational musical that will leave you feeling either energised or exhausted. Nicole Kidman&apos;s Satine is the star of the show, a courtesan-cum-performer bearing a secret. Her yearning young love, Ewan McGregor&apos;s Christian, sets about putting on a showcase for her with his new chum Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Con Air (Simon West, 1997) 10.15pm, BBC1 Paroled after eight years in jail, innocent Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) just wants to get home to the family. But suddenly he&apos;s all mixed up in a mid-air break-out of loathesome cons led by John Malkovich&apos;s Cyrus &quot;The Virus&quot; Grissom. A big-bang bag of pyrotechnics, with Ving Rhames Steve Buscemi, and John Cusack. Birthday Girl (Jez Butterworth, 2001) 11.20pm, C4 Lonely suburban bank clerk Ben Chaplin injects a little excitement into his life by ordering a Russian mail-order bride from the internet, and gets more than he bargained for. She turns out to be Nicole Kidman - low-key and convincing as Nadia - who speaks no English and brings disruptive cousin Mathieu Kassovitz and his friend Vincent Cassel in tow. A diverting tale that starts out as romcom shifts into darker territory. Beautiful Thing (Hettie MacDonald, 1995) 2.05am, C4 This self-styled &quot;urban fairy tale&quot; is a lovely film that, like My Beautiful Laundrette, creates a magical gay romance in a dreary corner of London. Glenn Barry&apos;s introverted Jamie and the more outgoing sportsman Ste (Scott Neal) are neighbours on a tough south London housing estate: it&apos;s a raw world, but their relationship blossoms sweetly. Sunday October 14 Ladyhawke (Richard Donner, 1985) 2.50pm, Five Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer lead this entertaining medieval fantasy as lovers separated by a curse, with Matthew Broderick looking rather less comfortable as the young thief who comes to their aid. Fine dark-ages designs; a pity the story&apos;s so weak. The Princess Bride (Rob Reiner, 1987) 5.10pm, Five A wry and knowing telling of a fairy-tale in which young farm boy Cary Elwes goes on a quest to rescue beautiful princess Robin Wright. It has brigands, giants, an evil prince and screaming eels, and is very much played for laughs by an eclectic cast that includes Christopher Guest and Billy Crystal (both of whom starred in Reiner&apos;s This Is Spinal Tap), and Mandy Patinkin. Ice Age (Chris Wedge, Carlos Saldanha, 2002)5.40pm, ITV1 This exhilarating animated adventure involving Manfred the mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) is about as much fun as you can have on ice without skates. There are shades of Howard Hawks&apos; classic little bands of wild-west brothers in this odd, ramshackle trio of beasts who team up to rescue a human baby. Despite all the snow and ice, you&apos;re left with a warm glow. The Addams Family (Barry Sonnenfeld, 1991) 7pm, Five The kooky, spooky Addams family are just as hilariously bizarre on the big screen, thanks to inspired casting: Anjelica Huston&apos;s Morticia, Raoul Julia&apos;s Gomez, Christopher Lloyd&apos;s Uncle Fester and an early appearance by Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. A monster hit. Alfie (Charles Shyer, 2004) 9pm, C4 This remake of Michael Caine&apos;s swinging 1960s classic shifts the action to New York, where Jude Law rules the roost as the shagtastic geezer Alfie, with Marisa Tomei, Sienna Miller and Susan Sarandon among his conquests. It&apos;s all a bit charming-but-pointless: what&apos;s it all about, Alfie? Meet Joe Black (Martin Brest, 1998) 11pm, C4 The tale of the Grim Reaper - embodied handsomely in the form of Brad Pitt - taking a tour of modern life. His guide is Anthony Hopkins&apos; ailing media tycoon, who is buying a little more time; his daughter (Claire Forlani), meanwhile, is attracted to the enigmatic stranger. A handsomely mounted, lustrous production, but it lasts an eternity. B Monkey (Michael Radford, 1998) 1.10am, ITV1 Radford&apos;s follow-up to the radiant Il Postino could hardly be more different - it&apos;s a quirky, fast-moving London-set thriller in which Asia Argento plays a highly exotic jewel thief who tries to settle down with a sweet primary school teacher (Jared Harris). Jonathan Rhys Meyers, of The Tudors, also stars. Monday October 15 The Bigamist (Ida Lupino, 1953) 2pm, C4 One of Brixton-born, Hollywood star, Lupino&apos;s half-dozen excursions into directing. Edmond O&apos;Brien plays the travelling salesman-cum-bigamist, splicing his time between Lupino&apos;s homely mum and Joan Fontaine&apos;s career woman. It&apos;s done with compassion and an early awareness of feminist issues, with a taut, no-nonsense style. Fist Of Fury (Lo Wei, 1972) 11.05pm, Five The inimitable Bruce Lee in his second feature film plays Chen Chen who returns to Shanghai to honour his dead kung-fu mentor, and kick some serious ass in the form of the low-grade karate thugs who murdered him. Like his other, all too few films, the plot is risible, but Lee&apos;s charismatic screen persona make him a mesmerising screen presence. Lady Vengeance (Park Chan-wook, 2005) 12.45am, C4 In this final part of Park&apos;s icily violent revenge trilogy (following Sympathy For Mr Vengeance and Oldboy) a beautiful young woman (Lee Young-ae) is released after serving 13 years for the kidnap and murder of a boy, and sets about finding and killing the paedophile who framed her. The convoluted flashback structure and funereal-dark photography add disquieting tones to a gruesome, gripping tale. Tuesday October 16 White Sands (Roger Donaldson, 1992) 11.35pm, BBC1 Theft and murder down New Mexico way, with gaunt Willem Dafoe the deputy sheriff who takes on the identity of a dead man to track down the origins of a mysterious $500,000 stash. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is impressively dangerous, but Mickey Rourke is at his most aggravating as the gun-running kingpin. Fine, dry-dust atmospherics, but the twisty trail grows only faintly interesting. Wednesday October 17 Private Hell 36 (Don Siegel, 1954) 2pm, C4 A crisp early thriller from the great Don Siegel, mentor of Clint Eastwood, though this is just as much the brainchild of its star Ida Lupino, who co-wrote and co-produced it. She plays nightclub singer Lili Marlowe who&apos;s the key to a daring heist; cop Steve Cochran falls for her big-time, though not as big as he falls for the loot from the robbery. Miss Congeniality 2: Armed And Fabulous (John Pasquin, 2005) 9pm, ITV1 This inevitable sequel is a plodding follow-up, in which Sandra Bullock&apos;s Fed finds herself shoved into a PR role as the face of the FBI; but a kidnap plot soon has her and hardnut bodyguard Regina King back in action. Even the famous Bullock charm struggles to keep it going. Men Of Honor (George Tillman Jr, 2000) 10pm, Five The true-life story of Carl Brashear, the man who overcame horrific injury and institutional racism to become the US navy&apos;s first black salvage diver in the early 1950s. Cuba Gooding Jr plays Brashear with unusual restraint and quiet authority, and he is matched by Robert De Niro as Captain Billy Sunday, the training instructor who comes to respect him. It&apos;s an extraordinary story. Thursday October 18 Boomerang! (Elia Kazan, 1947) 1.50pm, C4 Based on the real-life murder of a New England churchman and largely shot on location for authenticity&apos;s sake, this effective thriller stars Dana Andrews as a state attorney out to prove the innocence of Arthur Kennedy&apos;s scapegoat hobo. Lee J Cobb adds his strong presence. Page 3 (Madhur Bhandarkar, 2005) 1.05am, C4 Not page 3 as in phwooar! - in India&apos;s tabloids it&apos;s where all the celebrity gossip goes, and Bhandarkar&apos;s sharp satire delves into the seamy side beneath the glitz. Konkona Sensharma plays a young page three reporter who would much rather be exposing social injustice, and finds herself teamed with ace crime journo Atul Kulkarni, casting a jaundiced eye on a sleazy world of drugs, child abuse and sexual favours. Friday October 19 Dead Men Don&apos;t Wear Plaid (Carl Reiner, 1981) 1.50pm, C4 Hilarious homage to film noir, with Steve Martin and Rachel Ward as Gumshoe and Dame-with-the-Boobs out of their depth in a Los Angeles murder case. Brilliantly edited, with Martin slipping seamlessly into scenes borrowed from the great noirs of the 1940s, swapping quips with the likes of Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster. Grosse Pointe Blank (George Armitage, 1997) 11.35pm, BBC1 It&apos;s reunion time at Grosse Pointe High School, in a smart part of Detroit. There are the usual types: bankers, doctors, lawyers, plus John Cusack&apos;s Martin Blank, who is a hitman. He&apos;s in town to go to the party, make it up with the prom date (Minnie Driver) he jilted all those years ago, assassinate someone, and come to an arrangement with his big rival, Dan Aykroyd.

Given Alonso&apos;s healthy persecution complex, the Spaniard would have been muttering aloud about conspiracy theories in the belief that the team had deliberately compromised his race in favour of Hamilton. The paranoia has reached such a pitch that it has prompted the sport&apos;s governing body, the FIA, to introduce a scrutineer to oversee fair play in the McLaren garage during next weekend&apos;s Brazilian Grand Prix when Hamilton, Alonso and Ferrari&apos;s Kimi Raikkonen fight for the world title in the final round of the championship. Given McLaren&apos;s policy of bending over backwards to achieve parity, sometimes to the detriment of the team as a whole, the FIA&apos;s unprecedented and unnecessary interference amounts to Ofcom appointing a referee to oversee the Antiques Roadshow. Not that it will satisfy Alonso, who felt there had to be a reason for his disappointing qualifying performance last weekend other than the patently obvious fact that Hamilton had warmed his tyres properly and was blindingly quick. Alonso had the last laugh as Hamilton failed to finish on a day when he could have become the first novice to win the championship. His only retirement of the season so far was caused by a combination of errors. The team, waiting in vain to assess the changeable weather conditions, kept Hamilton out for one lap too many. Hamilton, in turn, had pressed on earlier in the race to the detriment of his tyres when, arguably, there was no need. &apos;We were clearly in a perfect position to win the championship,&apos; said Hamilton. &apos;But, at the end of the day, I wanted to win the race. I was out there driving for the win, and things like that can just happen.&apos; Hamilton&apos;s raging desire to win has made him the strong competitor he is. But, according to Sir Jackie Stewart, there comes a time when such a natural instinct needs to be curbed, particularly when a driver has a 12-point advantage with two races to go. &apos;Lewis is probably a little bit naive in some respects - as any 22-year-old would be in his first season,&apos; says Stewart, winner of three world titles. &apos;He&apos;s not thinking as laterally as he will in three or four years&apos; time. He had nothing to prove in the winning department because he&apos;d already won four races, one of which was that superb drive in the rain in Japan. So there comes a time when a driver needs to think, &quot;Right, now I&apos;ve got to win the championship&quot;, and do whatever that requires at a crucial stage in the season.&apos; When he reaches the starting grid next Sunday, Hamilton&apos;s task will be much more complex and difficult than it was seven days before. He has never raced at Interlagos, whereas Alonso and Raikkonen have a useful working knowledge of the 2.7-mile circuit. Unfamiliarity may not have been a problem when Hamilton won in Montreal, Indianapolis and Fuji, but Interlagos is bumpy and tricky, as befits its age and reputation as one of the world&apos;s great race tracks. Whereas you could have heard a pin drop in the audience at Shanghai, Hamilton will be surrounded by a passionate, samba-playing crowd reared on the exploits of Brazilian heroes Emerson Fittipaldi and Ayrton Senna during the past 30 years. On Sunday, they will be rooting for Felipe Massa, the winner of this race last year and the one driver who could be a thorn in Hamilton&apos;s side. With his championship chance having disappeared two races ago, Massa will be out to provide legitimate help for his Ferrari team-mate, Raikkonen. It is a potential problem that did not seem to bother Hamilton when the subject was raised a few days ago. &apos;I&apos;ve not really thought about that, to be honest,&apos; said Hamilton. &apos;In the last few races, Kimi&apos;s been the one that made the charge for the title but, because he was quite far behind in points, Felipe&apos;s not really been a major threat. He&apos;ll be going out there to do his own job and I think perhaps, if the team ask him, maybe he will try and get in the way. Even if Kimi&apos;s in the lead and Felipe&apos;s behind him and holding me up, that&apos;s not really a big problem for me. I&apos;ll only need to finish fifth, so it&apos;s not a big issue. &apos;The important thing is that I&apos;m comfortable with the pace of my car, and with my abilities. And I have no doubt that we can do a better job than them. I&apos;m not going there thinking, &quot;Shit, I&apos;ve gotta watch out for Felipe.&quot; I&apos;m going out there to beat them all. I think we still have to approach the race weekend by trying to take pole position, lead from the start and win the race. But,&apos; he added thoughtfully, &apos;I think some part of the mind has to be focused on the end result.&apos;", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "Lewis Hamilton", "Formula one 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-14T20:22:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/15/comment.comment1", "sentences": ["In our knowledge-based New British economy we like to believe that making nothing much beyond money, while replacing engineering works with vast, energy-gobbling Shanghai-style shopping malls, or &quot;urban regeneration projects&quot;, is somehow clever."], "title": "Jonathan Glancey: Extinction of the engineers", "article": "A few weeks ago the QE2, one of the world&apos;s last ocean liners, sailed into Greenock docks - a final homecoming for the 40-year-old ship, built by John Brown &amp; Co at Clydebank. Next year the retiring Cunard liner sails to Dubai where, demoted to serve as a floating hotel and casino, her mighty engines and deep hooters will be silenced. The many thousands of people who came to watch this beautiful ship, as the RAF&apos;s Red Arrows performed aerial reels above her, will surely have felt as I did - sad that the Clyde is quite unable to produce such an internationally admired work of design and engineering today. In our knowledge-based New British economy we like to believe that making nothing much beyond money, while replacing engineering works with vast, energy-gobbling Shanghai-style shopping malls, or &quot;urban regeneration projects&quot;, is somehow clever. Just days after the QE2&apos;s tumultuous arrival on the Clyde, the Association of Consultant Engineers (Ace) revealed that Britain has a shortage of 20,000 engineers, a figure likely to rise by 4,000 next year. To meet demand, Ace is calling on the Home Office to relax immigration rules so that civil, structural, environmental and building services engineers can be headhunted from around the world to do the jobs that we oh so very postmodern British snub. And yet, because we want ever more major engineering-driven projects, including the 2012 Olympics, Crossrail, new high-speed railways, and ambitious &quot;urban regeneration&quot; schemes the length and breadth of the country, we need an army, navy and airforce of engineers to realise them. Just as we require ever more cheap labour from across the world to clean our offices, sweep our streets, drive our buses, pick our cockles and generally wipe our collective bottom, now we need engineers from Poland, India, China and elsewhere to design and build the infrastructure we find increasingly hard to make for our digital selves. We think it clever for foreigners to do our dirty, and now our practical and even creative, work for us. Eventually, though, we will lose out to nations willing to shape and make things, and who still take pleasure in what we see as grubby old heavy-duty engineering. The Germans clearly enjoy making things while enjoying a high standard of living. Bavaria is bristling with knowledge-based industries, while boasting many &quot;old fashioned&quot; engineering enterprises. On its Thuringian borders, the Meiningen works of the Deutsche Bahn (German state railways) has recently built a high-pressure steam boiler for the A1 Locomotive Trust, a Darlington-based organisation currently completing the first British mainline express steam locomotive in more than 50 years. This might seem quixotic, but no British company could take on a work that will give pleasure to countless people. A nation of call-centre operatives and customer service facility managers, we look on, stupefied, as foreigners weld and rivet for us. In an age of 300kph electric trains crisscrossing the Federal Republic, the idea of making a steam locomotive boiler is something the German railway is able to take in its stride. In Finland, the land of Nokia, the Aker Yards in Helsinki, and other major cities, continue to design, engineer and construct the world&apos;s largest passenger ships, among them the Freedom of the Seas class for Royal Caribbean International. Even bigger vessels are on the drawing board. The Finns, it seems, are quietly content engineering ships that are much bigger than the QE2 while mass-producing the latest in lightweight digital mass-consumption technology. In Britain we have come to believe that we are a nation of consumers rather than producers, that life is all about borrowing unfeasible sums of money to buy the disposable gewgaws we crave. But even shopping malls and the complex infrastructure underpinning them have to be engineered by someone. Still, leave that to foreigners. We&apos;ll complain, of course, as they arrive to take on the senior jobs we increasingly refuse to do, but now that we have begun to look upon heavy-duty engineering projects in much the same way as forest tribes might have gazed, uncomprehendingly, at Roman aqueducts two thousand years ago, what else can we do? \u00b7 Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian&apos;s architecture critic jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2007-10-14T23:08:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/15/tennis.sport", "sentences": ["His chances of qualifying for the end-of-season Masters Cup in Shanghai, reserved for the leading eight players, were ruined when his right wrist popped in Hamburg in May, but the British No1 is determined recapture the form that catapulted him into the top 10 this April."], "title": "Tennis: Murray takes his Masters test", "article": "Andy Murray, after reaching the final of a low-key tournament in France and then losing early at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, will fully test his continued progress since his comeback from wrist injury at the penultimate Masters Series event beginning here today.

A &quot;princeling&quot; from an elite family and a cadre who made his name in poor provinces are among the favourites to succeed President Hu Jintao when his term of office expires in 2012. At the 17th Communist party congress, which starts today, Xi Jinping, the son of a party elder, and Li Keqiang, who worked his way up from humble peasant origins, are expected to be promoted to the standing committee of the politburo, the most powerful body in China. The elevation of this pair and two or three other fifth-generation politicians will set the stage for what analysts say could prove an unusually open succession contest. The stakes have never been higher. The general secretary of the Communist party is guaranteed the job of president, which means he will lead the fastest growing economy and an increasingly important player in global trade and diplomacy. During the meeting of 2,017 delegates at Beijing&apos;s Great Hall of the People, Mr Hu will consolidate his power by promoting supporters from his powerbase in the Communist Youth League to the politburo and its standing committee. He is also expected to push for a reform of the party charter to include his concept of &quot;scientific development&quot;, which seeks a more environmentally sustainable and socially harmonious model of economic growth. Analysts do not expect major initiatives, but Mr Hu may call for greater &quot;inner party democracy&quot;, which means more voting by communists for communists. With 73 million members, the party increasingly resembles a giant aristocracy. &quot;Princelings&quot; - the children of current and former leaders - dominate the executive ranks of many of the nation&apos;s biggest firms. President Hu Jintao&apos;s daughter is married to the former head of the internet giant Sina. The son-in-law of the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, reportedly runs the country&apos;s most successful football team. The son of the former premier Li Peng controls China&apos;s biggest power generation company, while relatives of Deng Xiaoping are believed to dominate the huge Poly group. The hereditary trend could become more pronounced if Xi Jinping, party general secretary in Shanghai, is made heir-apparent. &quot;He would be the first princeling to take power. If that is the case, then we can truly say the Communist party has become an aristocracy,&quot; said a diplomat. But he is not a certainty. At least four places are likely to open up on the politburo&apos;s nine-member standing committee. Mr Hu does not have the power of past party strongmen. He must consider the interests of party factions and the wishes of his predecessor, Jiang Zemin. &quot;Given the present political situation in Beijing it is impossible for Hu Jintao to be dominant in making these decision,&quot; said Professor Joseph Cheng of the City University of Hong Kong. &quot;He will make concessions and look for a balance. It not just factional, but a mix of people from rich coastal provinces, some from inland, some princelings, some bureaucratic experts, cadres from the communist youth league and the propaganda department.&quot; Many observers believe there is no consensus. &quot;By the time of the 18th party congress, there will be a real contest because Hu Jintao does not have the authority to pick his successor,&quot; said Li Datong, formerly an editor at a publication controlled by the Communist Youth League. But he did not expect major reforms that would allow multi-party democracy of press freedom. &quot;Hu is not that type of person. He was educated by the party. You cannot change his brain. He just doesn&apos;t know what freedom of the press is.&quot; Academics say Mr Hu will have more room for manoeuvre after he wins a second term. &quot;Usually during their first term, leaders do not show their colours fully. It is only in the second term that their ideas become fully developed and mature,&quot; said Cui Zhiyuan of Tsinghua University. &quot;I hope that in the second term he will be more open for the media and introduce more democracy within the party.&quot; The party has stifled debate ahead of the congress, clamping down on the domestic media, detaining dissidents and blocking internet sites. Hardliners have long warned that increased accountability could take China down the road of Gorbachev&apos;s Soviet Union, which might lead the party to self-destruct. Professor Cui said it did not go far enough. &quot;What is more important is mass democracy, more media openness and more power for the people&apos;s congress.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-15T01:09:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/15/chinasfalteringleadership", "sentences": ["The authorities urge an end to the bull market on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges; the index has more than doubled this year.", "The Beijing rumour mill, based on a mixture of leaks and interpretation, has it that Li will be joined as a new member of the standing committee by another man in his fifties, probably Xi Jinping, the newly-appointed party boss in Shanghai.", "Hu may gain some solace if Vice-President Zeng Qinghong, who represents the &quot;Shanghai faction&quot; led by Jiang Zemin, steps down from the standing committee, but at least one of his allies will be promoted and he will remain a powerful backstage influence."], "title": "China's faltering leadership", "article": "This week&apos;s Chinese Communist party congress will be a well-ordered affair - even during the tumult of the Cultural Revolution such meetings were conducted with decorum in their customary veil of secrecy. But the stakes behind the scenes are high and, given the global impact of the People&apos;s Republic, are significant for people thousands of miles from Beijing. One thing seems certain: Hu Jintao will get a second term as party leader, and continue to grapple with the problems he has failed to surmount in his first five years in office. The party remains intent on preserving the monopoly power it has enjoyed since 1949. Its leader knows it needs a serious dose of rejuvenation to make it better able to relate with the rapid changes in China&apos;s economy and society. He recognises that the wealth disparities and the gap between the coastal and interior regions have to be lessened, the economy brought into better balance and corruption reduced - even if his main graft targets have just happened to be political foes. The trouble is that, for leaders of an autocratic system, Hu and prime minister Wen Jiabao have shown themselves remarkably poor at getting results. Their Five Year Plan provides for annual growth to fall to 7.5%; it has gone up to more than 11%. The authorities urge an end to the bull market on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges; the index has more than doubled this year. Instead of slowing down appreciably, as pledged, the trade surplus in the first nine months of 2007 was greater than in the whole of 2006. Pollution targets are not met. Wealth disparities grow. A campaign to get corrupt official to confess produced a grand total of a couple of thousand repenters. Now, all the signs are that the Congress is about to bring evidence of even more serious weakness at the top. One of the main tasks of the meeting is to pick the successor who will take over the party leadership from Hu in 2012. (As befits a 2,200-year-old civilisation, the Chinese like to look ahead.) Hu himself was chosen by Deng Xiaoping who also picked his predecessor, Jiang Zemin. Hu had his candidate lined up in the shape of the party secretary of Liaoning province, Li Keqiang, a man who follows the leader&apos;s doctrine of &quot;scientific socialism&quot; and the pursuit of a &quot;harmonious society&quot;. Li was to be elevated to the top body, the standing committee of the politburo at the end of the congress as Hu&apos;s doctrines were adopted to put him in the pantheon alongside Mao, Deng and Jiang. But it does not seem to have worked out that way. The Beijing rumour mill, based on a mixture of leaks and interpretation, has it that Li will be joined as a new member of the standing committee by another man in his fifties, probably Xi Jinping, the newly-appointed party boss in Shanghai. Though Xi, who previously ran go-ahead Zhejiang province, is definitely identified with the coastal boom, his elevation would be not so much the product of policy differences as a matter of personal power. Most of the other members of the standing committee simply do not want Hu to get too strong, and so have been scheming all year to promote a non-Hu figure as the potential successor. Hu may gain some solace if Vice-President Zeng Qinghong, who represents the &quot;Shanghai faction&quot; led by Jiang Zemin, steps down from the standing committee, but at least one of his allies will be promoted and he will remain a powerful backstage influence. At the same time, various members of the &quot;princelings&quot; group - sons of previous generation leaders - are expected to be put into important posts. All this may smack of obscure (if fascinating) political manoeuvring without much relationship to the real world. But it matters for one reason: it shows that, five years after succeeding Jiang, Hu is a leader shackled by factionalism and unable to assert himself as the job demands. Policy formulation has been stumbling enough for the past couple of years; implantation even more so. Now, if the top leadership is to be the scene of jockeying for the leadership - for instance between Li and Xi - that can only get worse. This would be particularly grave coming at a time when the regime needs to get to grips with major challenges from the wave of liquidity bred by the trade surplus to the land, water and pollution crises. The leadership has to find ways to cut through the jungle of interest groups, administrative and provincial baronies and CCP immobilism to catch up with the economy and the deep problems spawned by growth on Dengist lines. To make the best of a bad job, Hu&apos;s acolytes have been putting it about that he decided not to name a successor in the interests of &quot;inner party democracy&quot;. Greater internal discussion may indeed be needed, but, as regards picking the man for 2012, this is altogether too sudden a switch to be credible. For the world, the main danger may be that a long-term leadership contest will encourage chauvinism as the contenders compete to prove themselves the best nationalists. On Taiwan, for instance, the tough PLA line is likely to prevail if only because nobody who wants to become party secretary dares forfeit the army&apos;s backing or be seen to flinch from doing what is necessary to retrieve the island. Overall, the prospect is that China will become even more of an empire without an emperor, headed by authoritarians without authority. The Communist party is not going to fall, or accept significant change in its status. China&apos;s growth is not going to be halted, even if the growing imbalances point to a serious bump in the road ahead. Whatever reformist ideas may be spun from think tanks and universities, the party&apos;s will to accept them, let alone to move to implementation is hardly apparent, particularly given the spectre of the collapse of the Soviet Union and its east European empire that is held up as a terrible warning at political education sessions for cadres. In contrast, as the fate of Wen Jiabao&apos;s policy pronouncements demonstrates, the economy has a life of its own, driven by factors which the leadership cannot control. The outcome could be that, in place of the ordered progress to the next generation of leaders which it was meant to achieve, the 17th party congress could mark the start of a new period of instability that will pose fresh issues not just for China, but for the world beyond.", "tags": ["China", "Hu Jintao", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-15T10:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/15/londonfilmfestival2007.londonfilmfestival", "sentences": ["Ang Lee Lee returns with a film that is part espionage thriller and part psychosexual drama, set in Japanese-occupied Shanghai during the second world war."], "title": "Peter Bradshaw's top 10 movies to catch at the London film festival", "article": "Eastern Promises dir.

The 17th Communist Party Congress will pick the helmsmen and set the course for the world&apos;s most populous nation at a time when it is becoming an increasingly influential global player. The meeting&apos;s biggest challenge will be to recalibrate the mix of capitalist economics and communist politics that have powered China, but left environmental degradation and income inequality in their wake. But while many in the west believe that rising wealth inevitably leads to greater democracy, this congress is thought unlikely to produce any major political reforms despite near double digit GDP growth every year since the last congress in 2002. Transparency and accountability are notable for their absence. In the run up to the congress, the domestic media has been locked down and dissidents locked up. While there will be nominal elections, all the key decisions have already been made behind closed doors. With so little open debate, it is difficult to predict what the congress will bring, but politburo watchers expect few surprises. President Hu Jintao is considered certain to win a second term as general secretary, which will put him in a strong position to pursue his goal of balanced development and assure his place alongside Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin in the historical pantheon of communist state leaders. Thirteen members attended the first party congress in Shanghai in 1921. This year, there will be 2,217 delegates. With each expansion and transfer of power, the charisma and authority of the ruler has diminished. Unlike Mao in the fifties and sixties, Mr Hu will not dominate this congress by force of personality. Instead, the former hydro-engineer must demonstrate the skills of a technocrat and secure a balance among party and provincial factions. The most important posts are the 22-member politburo and within that, the all-powerful nine-member standing committee. President Hu is thought likely to promote cadres from his support base in the Communist Youth League, further eroding the influence of his predecessor Mr Jiang. He is also expected to push for a reform of the party charter to include his doctrines of &quot;scientific development&quot; and &quot;harmonious society&quot;, which together underpin his efforts to move China towards a more balanced and environmentally sustainable path of development. Political reform, if it is included at all, is likely to be restricted to an expansion of &quot;inner-party democracy&quot;, which means more opportunities to vote, but only for communist party members. Given that the party claims to have 73 million members, that would be a step towards accountability of sorts.

I tried 1NT, ostensibly showing a strong, balanced hand, hoping my opponents might pass it out when they had a game available. More-over, I would make 1NT if a spade was led. 1NT again passed to South, who again doubled for takeout, and North-South bid to 4 of spades.

Any military intervention in the Caspian Sea area would be unacceptable, Mr Putin declared as he attended a five-country regional summit in Tehran. &quot;We should not even think of making use of force in this region,&quot; Mr Putin told his fellow leaders. His remarks also appeared directed at Azerbaijan, amid Russian media speculation that the US might be trying to negotiate with the republic on the right to use military facilities there, something Azeri officials deny. &quot;We are saying that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any Caspian state,&quot; Mr Putin said. A summit declaration from the five, which include Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan beside Russia, Iran and Azerbaijan, subsequently stressed that &quot;under no circumstances will they allow (the use of their) territories by third countries to launch aggression or other military action against any of the member states&quot;. The first Kremlin leader to visit Iran since Joseph Stalin in 1943, Mr Putin is holding talks with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, on Tehran&apos;s nuclear dispute with the west during the summit. The importance of Mr Putin&apos;s trip to the Iranian side was clearly illustrated by the presence of Manouchehr Mottaki, Iran&apos;s foreign minister, who greeted Mr Putin as he stepped of his plane after it landed at Tehran&apos;s Mehrabad airport at around 9am local time (6.30BST). Leaders from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan were met by lower-level dignitaries. Mr Putin was later greeted personally by Mr Ahmadinejad, before the start of the summit at the palatial Saad Abad complex in north Tehran, local media reported. Mr Putin has been accompanied by a retinue of 180 staff, aides and security personnel. A fleet of armoured cars has also been shipped from Russia for his trip. The Russian leader&apos;s arrival had earlier been in doubt after the Russian special security services disclosed on Sunday that they had uncovered a plot to assassinate him in a suicide bomb in the Iranian capital. Iranian officials angrily dismissed the alleged conspiracy as &quot;psychological warfare&quot;. Mr Putin&apos;s presence was widely expected to overshadow the official purpose of the conference, which is ostensibly to thrash out disagreements over the sharing of resources in the oil-rich Caspian Sea. Iran sees the arrival of Mr Putin - who accepted Mr Ahmadinejad&apos;s invitation to visit when the pair met at an Asian co-operation summit in Shanghai in August - as a major coup in its efforts to resist western pressure over its nuclear programme, which the US and its allies suspect is aimed at building an atomic bomb. Russia&apos;s veto on the UN security council means its support is vital if Iran is to avoid a third round of sanctions when the body meets next month. Moscow has criticised US attempts to pressure Tehran through economic sanctions and military threats and has called for greater engagement with Iran. Last week, Mr Putin angered the US by declaring that there was no &quot;objective evidence&quot; that Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb. However, he has also called on Iran to show greater openness and flexibility over its uranium enrichment programme. The nuclear issue is not on the summit agenda, but it will be discussed when Mr Putin holds one-on-one meetings with Mr Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran&apos;s supreme leader, who has the final say on all state matters. Despite the official hype, Mr Putin&apos;s visit is being treated with scepticism. Russia is mistrusted by many Iranians, who point to a history of hostile relations going back two centuries. Iran is angry over delays in a \u00a3500m contract with Russia to build the Bushehr nuclear power station. Russia has put completion on hold because of alleged late payments by the Iranians. Iran has denied the accusation and believes Russia is merely trying to use the issue to wring concessions over the nuclear programme. The historic suspicions were reflected in an article today on the reformist No Rouz website, headlined The Second Turkmanchai Is On Its Way, a reference to an 1828 peace treaty in which Iran was forced to cede large swathes of territory in the Caucasus to Russia. The article claimed Iran was being pressed to accept a &quot;shameful&quot; agreement giving it an 11% share of Caspian resources in a package that would allow Russian nuclear submarines to sail close to the Iranian coast. Until 1991, Tehran and Moscow had equal shares in the Caspian Sea, but the break-up of the Soviet Union triggered moves to re-allocate resources. Iran says the resources should be shared equally among the five Caspian states, but Russia believes it should be based on coastal size, giving Tehran a much smaller proportion and depriving it of gas and oil resources. Opening today&apos;s conference, Mr Ahmadinejad ignored such difficulties. &quot;The five countries are all cradles of civilisation and have existed in peace for thousands of years,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Azerbaijan", "World news", "Russia", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "US military", "Europe", "South and Central Asia"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-16T14:54:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/oct/16/thebigdebatecanlewishamil", "sentences": ["But what events in Shanghai did show, of course, is that things can just happen over which you have no control.", "There is certainly no danger of a repeat of the mistake that was made in Shanghai."], "title": "Big debate: can Hamilton be beaten to the formula one title?", "article": "Jody Scheckter Won the world drivers&apos; championship in 1979 Yes In formula one nothing is ever nailed on. Is Lewis Hamilton the favourite to take the title in Brazil? Absolutely. But I have been around the sport for so long that I know you can never count your chickens. Lewis will only be the world champion when he is standing there at the end on Sunday having achieved what he set out to do. Do not forget that he should have won it in the last race in China - but he didn&apos;t. That is not to say that I think Lewis was showing vulnerability when he ended up in the gravel and had to retire. I am not close enough to the McLaren team to know exactly who made the decisions on that day but it did seem that he was not called in to put on his dry tyres soon enough. Gauging when to come into the pits is a split-second decision and it wasn&apos;t his: he has been unbelieveable this season in the way that he has not made a mistake when it matters. The quality of his decision-making has been so far from what you would expect from a young driver, better even than from an experienced driver. But what events in Shanghai did show, of course, is that things can just happen over which you have no control. One of the most amazing things about this season has been the way that Lewis has driven better whenever the pressure has been on, so it will not be an issue with the title in the balance. The opposite is true for his team-mate Fernando Alonso - only four points behind in the standings - who has made mistakes and shown weaknesses. And that has happened because it must be so hard to swallow when you are a twice world champion and you have this young guy who comes in and beats you all the time. For that reason, qualifying is going to be extremely important at Interlagos. If Lewis qualifies ahead of him, that will put Fernando under pressure and he is liable to make mistakes, as he has all season. If it is the other way around we will have a very different type of race because he has performed differently when starting ahead on the grid. Even the Ferraris could get in on things and make it difficult because there is still the mathematical possibility that Kimi Raikkonen can win the drivers&apos; championship. I would love Lewis to win because I think of all the drivers this year he deserves it the most: the way that he has driven in his first season in formula one has been incredible. But it is a three-way battle for the title and anything can happen. What happens if the two McLarens crash into each other? We&apos;ve seen that type of thing happen many times before in formula one. Then there is a likelihood that Ferrari, and Raikkonen, would win. It is all possible. When it comes down to the last race like this, you cannot predict anything with certainty. Mark Blundell Former McLaren driver turned TV commentator No I believe Lewis Hamilton will still win the world title at Interlagos. He goes into the race with an advantage of four points for a start and has a desire to win and the total focus of what is required to do so. At that point, everything is in his favour and there is no reason to think he will not win. There is certainly no danger of a repeat of the mistake that was made in Shanghai. What happened in China was one of those situations which made everyone remember that he is in formula one terms, a rookie. The fact is that everyone forgets he is essentially learning on the job and we saw that last time around. Now and again he is going to make a mistake. People are going to look at what happened and say, &quot;Oh, but that&apos;s a big mistake when the title was there to be won&quot; but the error was no different to the sorts of things some of the other younger guys on the grid have been doing. Except, of course, for the fact they are not in the limelight like Lewis because of the position he is in in the championship. He is still learning his trade but while doing that he has been able to sit on pole position several times, win grands prix and lead the world championship for most of the season. Why will he win? Firstly, let&apos;s remember that he does not need to win the actual race in Sao Paulo to be assured of the title. Lewis simply has to concentrate on beating his team-mate Fernando Alonso. That will be his entire focus to make sure he wins the championship, even though he can still triumph if Fernando finishes ahead of him. On the issue of the greater experience of his rivals at Interlagos, it is almost irrelevant. If you analyse Lewis&apos;s performances all season, he has mastered a circuit that he has never driven before within five laps. That is a quality any formula one driver must have, but it takes most of them 10 laps. So it will only work against him for maybe the first 30 minutes on Friday morning. Lewis is also sitting in the best car, and certainly the best car for Interlagos because it is so compliant now McLaren have dealt with some of their earlier issues with grip. That will be important on what is a bumpy track. Kimi Raikkonen is driving a Ferrari and he is seven points behind in the championship. I suppose that his team-mate, the Brazilian driver Felipe Massa, could be the fly in the ointment if he drives for Ferrari in a supporting role. But at the end of it all, I am not sure that you can really play games like that out on the circuit without it being picked up on and besides, Massa will be driving in his home event and will want a win to finish the season on a high.", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula one 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-16T23:08:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/17/tennis.sport", "sentences": ["He qualified for the Masters Cup in Shanghai with his Kremlin Cup win last Sunday."], "title": "Tennis: Nalbandian fluffs his lines but Safin just slinks away", "article": "David Nalbandian recovered from an error-strewn first set to defeat France&apos;s Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 at the Madrid Masters yesterday.

I do it for myself, the people I love, my fans - but I don&apos;t really run after being part of the history of the sport.&quot; Speaking to reporters on a free day after receiving a bye into the second round of the Zurich Open, she added that the defence of her 2004 Olympic title would be one of her main goals for 2008. Henin, 25, has dominated the women&apos;s tour this year with eight titles, adding the 2007 French and US Open championships to her career haul of seven grand slams. She also reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon - the only grand slam title still to elude her - and is unbeaten in 16 matches since then. &quot;I&apos;ve been dominating for the last few months, that&apos;s for sure, but it&apos;s hard to stay at your top all the time. I&apos;ve been playing for 20 years and giving everything for it, so I&apos;m not going to stop now because I have the feeling there is a lot I want to do.&quot; Unlike Federer, who is just two trophies away from equalling Pete Sampras&apos;s record of 14 grand slam singles titles, Henin knows the corresponding record in the women&apos;s game is probably beyond her reach. Australia&apos;s Margaret Court leads the way with 24 grand slam singles titles, 11 of which were won in the Open era. More recently, Steffi Graf won 22 grand slam singles titles with Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova each taking 18. &quot;When you see what the greatest girls in the sport have achieved then you have to think that nobody is going to do that again in the women&apos;s game,&quot; Henin said. One achievement that Henin could still match is the &quot;Golden Slam&quot; requiring a player to win all four grand slams and the Olympic gold medal. To do that in one year, as Graf did in 1988, Henin will have to defend her 2004 gold at Beijing next year and finally win Wimbledon. &quot;It would be a great achievement if I could win the lot.

China&apos;s Communist party has failed to live up to the expectations of its people. It is not tackling either the environmental or social consequences of an annual growth rate of 10%. Corruption is endemic. The gap between rich and poor is growing and so too is the imbalance between booming cities on the eastern seaboard and grinding rural poverty in the western interior. All of this is true and the leadership have been warning about such things for much of the past decade. The issue is not the diagnosis but the cure. Ever since China&apos;s central government devolved responsibility for social services, health and education down the chain of command, local authorities have used contracts with entrepreneurs as a way of offsetting the burden of paying for these services. They have not been able to sell land, but they have privatised its use. Lucrative contracts for high-rise developments that concrete over scarce arable land feed corruption. The party says that it punished over 97,000 members last year, and staged show trials of highly placed miscreants, but it still cannot master the problem. Mr Hu made only the most cursory of nods to political changes that challenge the one-party system and gave no timetable for expanding direct accountability beyond the election of village chiefs, the lowest level of government. But he did use a curious phrase. He said power must be exercised &quot;in the sunshine&quot; to ensure that it is exercised correctly. If he was not prepared to loosen the party&apos;s monopoly on power, he did envisage an expansion of &quot;inner party democracy&quot; which would give 73 million party members more opportunities to vote on policy and leadership. What this means in reality is unclear. As Mr Hu spoke, the two most widely tipped prospective members of the new politburo, Xi Jinping, party boss of Shanghai, and Li Keqiang, boss of the Liaoning province ,were lined up at the front of the Praesidium, their physical proximity to the source of power an indicator of their bright political prospects. Some habits die hard. China is changing more rapidly than the party can cope with. If it is to address the quality of economic growth, rather than merely its quantity, Mr Hu must also look outside the party to the growing ranks of professionals, campaigning lawyers and environmentalists for help. Chinese non-governmental organisations are tolerated on a local level as long as they do not form national associations.

Even more surprising was that both wins came in the earlier rounds of back-to-back Masters Series events in Indian Wells and Miami - small wonder there were dark mutterings about the fact that Canas had only just returned after being banned for two years in 2005, reduced to 15 months, for failing a drugs test. Yesterday Federer crushed Canas 6-0, 6-3 to reach the last eight of the Masters Series event here, a win that gave him considerable satisfaction. &quot;It was disappointing to lose to him in the US, particularly in Miami where I had a lot of chances, but I always felt that I was in control this time,&quot; he said. Effectively the Argentinian could do nothing on an indoor surface that is not especially fast but nevertheless is perfectly suited to Federer&apos;s all-court game. Paradoxically those two defeats against Canas in California and Florida allowed Federer to rest his body after winning the Australian Open for the third time. &quot;It was big news at the time when I lost but I regrouped and went on to reach the final at Roland Garros and win Wimbledon and the US Open,&quot; he noted. At this time of the year all players are beginning to feel their aches and pains, coupled with the mental strain of a long season. However, Federer has high expectations of winning his fourth Tennis Masters Cup over the past five years next month in Shanghai, and to retain his place as world No1 for a fourth successive year. To help him he has taken on Johan de Beer, Tim Henman&apos;s former physio. Many leading players have fallen by the wayside this week during a tournament that could have been played out of doors, with the city bathed in sun. Federer has been an exception, as has the young Serb and world No3 Novak Djokovic, who yesterday beat Spain&apos;s Juan Carlos Ferrero, a former world No1, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4. &quot;It&apos;s been a long year and I&apos;m tired both physically and mentally,&quot; said Djokovic, who has been the success story of the past 10 months, reaching his first grand slam final in New York together with the semi-finals of the French Open and Wimbledon, all at the age of 20, one week younger than Andy Murray. He has also won two Masters Series events in Miami and Canada and next year is surely set to challenge the duopoly of Federer and Rafael Nadal. &quot;Rafa and Roger have a game which is on a different level,&quot; said Djokovic who will play Croatia&apos;s Mario Ancic, returning after injury and illness, in the quarter-finals today. &quot;I&apos;ve made incredible progress this year and now have reason to believe that I&apos;m nearly on their level. This is my breakthrough year, although everything depends on whether I can keep it up next year. But I truly believe I can be a big challenger for the No1 place.&quot; The Serb does most things well, and nothing badly, even if it sometimes remains unclear quite why he has risen so rapidly. Perhaps the answer lies in his tremendous self-belief and an iron will. Jamie Murray, Andy&apos;s brother, waited four days to play his opening doubles match and was knocked out in straight sets. He had temporarily teamed up with Mark Knowles of the Bahamas, who with Canada&apos;s Daniel Nestor is ranked No2 in the world. But they were beaten 6-4, 7-6 by a Polish duo of Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski. Since Murray split up with the American Eric Butorac in the summer he has struggled to find a regular partner and will hope to get matters sorted out for next year. The problem is that all the leading doubles players want to keep their options open until the end of the year because of the money to be made if a partnership gels.

At the first mainland exhibition since Mattel recalled 21m potentially hazardous items, buyers and exhibitors said more children than ever are likely to get Christmas presents produced in Guangdong province in December. China makes 60% of the world&apos;s toys, and is an increasingly important market. At the mainland&apos;s biggest toy show, its dominance was evident in a record 400-plus exhibitors and more than 3,000 registered buyers. It is a long way from the worst fears in August, when the world&apos;s biggest toy firm, Mattel, pulled items including Batman, Barbie, Polly Pocket and Doggie Daycare products from the shelves because some toys contained lead paint or magnets that could be swallowed by children. The recall led to a suicide, a bankruptcy and the tarnishing of the Made in China label. But China&apos;s manufacturing juggernaut has powered on. Toy exports rose 18% in the first nine months of this year, Mattel has been forced to apologise for its design faults and multinational toy firms are still lining up to enter the domestic retail market. If there is an impact it will not be felt until next year, when toy prices could rise because of tighter safety checks. &quot;We are very, very worried about the export market,&quot; said Stella Ng of the TianQuan toy factory in Guangzhou, which supplies Dream Baby dolls to Toys R Us. &quot;Our English customers are asking for far more test reports than last year. If there is no test report, then there is no shipment.&quot; Among the displays was one for British company Hornby, which makes its Scalextric cars in China. Many others were there for the first time, including London-based HiT entertainment, which wants to introduce Thomas the Tank Engine to the local market despite a recall of many of these Chinese-made products from US shelves this summer. English buyers said product safety fears were exaggerated and the blame misplaced. &quot;I think Mattel caused its own problems by not policing its products properly,&quot; said Sean Charlesworth of Whitehouse Leisure, an Essex-based company that supplies plush toys to several big British retailers. &quot;It is all about price. You squeeze a factory too hard and it leads to problems.&quot; Mr Charlesworth said tighter checks introduced since the scandal mean shipments are being delayed, more goods are being rejected and costs are likely to rise. But in his sector of cuddly toys, he said, there were bigger threats to China&apos;s competitiveness. In the past year, the yuan appreciated 7% against the dollar, migrant labour wages rose 17% and tighter environmental controls helped to increase the price of Chinese-made teddy bears by 10-25%. For the first time, he is planning to look at Vietnam and India as an alternative for the millions of cuddly toys he buys each year. Charles Riotto, president of the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers&apos; Association, said the scandal was the biggest since he entered the industry 20 years ago, but the worst is over. &quot;When we look back at 2007, it will be viewed as a year when manufacturers and licensers really took a look at how safe their products are and how they are perceived by customers. They realise that it is not enough just to have a good product at a good price. It must also be safe and consumers must feel satisfied.&quot; But, like almost everyone at the fair, he did not expect a change in the pecking order of the toy industry. &quot;China has a big advantage. It has the workforce and the manufacturing capacity in place. The business is theirs to keep.&quot; Christmas looks set to be made in China for several years to come.", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-19T23:14:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview2", "sentences": ["It was as if, in Beatrice Webb&apos;s words, the empire began to suffer from &quot;a sort of senile hypertrophy&quot;, reaching new heights of brutality with the Amritsar massacre of 1919 and new peaks of decadence in expat enclaves from Kenya to Shanghai."], "title": "Review: The Decline and Fall of the British Empire by Piers Brendon", "article": "The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997 by Piers Brendon  640pp, Jonathan Cape, \u00a325 When did the British empire end? Was it on the night of August 15 1947, when India and Pakistan gained independence, and devastated Britons felt (as Enoch Powell later remembered) as if their world was &quot;coming apart&quot;? Was it in the autumn of 1956, when Britain invaded Suez only to withdraw its forces in humiliation within a week? Was it in April 1980, when Margaret Thatcher teared up in front of a television set in Westminster, watching the transfer of power in Rhodesia? Or in June 1997, when Chris Patten wept on camera as the union flag came down in Hong Kong? Rather like a chap found dead in a club chair, nobody seems able to say quite when the British empire expired, but everyone agrees it is no more. Even while the empire expanded, some were forecasting its decline. A 1774 issue of Lloyd&apos;s Evening Post published a futuristic fantasy set in 1974, describing a tour by two men from &quot;the empire of America&quot; through the ruins of London. No less unwittingly prescient was Edward Gibbon, the first volume of whose Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire rolled off the presses early in 1776. His sales could only have been helped when the American Declaration of Independence was signed a few months later. Pudding-faced Gibbon, &quot;with his chubby cheeks ... and his weakness for puce-coloured velvet suits and orange zig-zag dimity waistcoats&quot;, provides a touchstone for Piers Brendon throughout his sumptuous chronicle of the British empire. The spectre of decline and fall, he suggests, haunted empire-building from Gibbon&apos;s age onwards. Where most accounts of British imperial collapse concentrate on the 20th century, Brendon begins his story on the battlefield of Yorktown, in 1781. It was there that Britain suffered its first major anti-colonial defeat, when Lord Cornwallis surrendered to George Washington, effectively conceding American independence. Rather than portraying Yorktown and subsequent setbacks as anomalies in an arc of imperial ascent, Brendon uses this novel point of entry to reinterpret the British empire as an enterprise whose validity was persistently challenged, from within and without. What follows is a compelling and spectacularly detailed retelling of imperial &quot;rise&quot; as well as fall, from Yorktown to Hong Kong. Not since Jan Morris&apos;s Pax Britannica trilogy has anyone recounted these events with such sustained panache. Brendon&apos;s empire is a ramshackle affair, managed for decades out of a Colonial Office that boasted &quot;an assortment of rickety chairs and old, baize-covered tables,&quot; a basement &quot;so damp that it had to be pumped out twice a day&quot; and an attic that doubled as a fives court. Virtually every page offers up some memorable observation. Brendon gleefully traces the career of that characteristic imperial accessory, the moustache. British cultivation of the hairy upper lip was inspired, he suggests, by Indian ideals of virility, and would decline in proportion with the empire&apos;s reach: Harold Macmillan was &quot;the last British prime minister to sport a moustache&quot;. The book also doubles as an extended meditation on Britain&apos;s fraught love affair with ancient Rome. Brendon peppers his pages with contemporary allusions to the Roman empire, and they were legion. British rulers were steeped in the classics, from Richard Wellesley, who filled Calcutta&apos;s Government House with &quot;the busts of a dozen Caesars&quot;, to George Nathaniel Curzon 100 years later, who &quot;lisped in Gibbon&quot;. Such training meant that even as they gilded and gloried in their empire, Britons always worried about intrinsic tendencies towards decline. Necessarily, blood flows freely through this book. At Cawnpore in 1857, where nearly 200 British women and children had been notoriously slaughtered by the Indian mutineers, the British forced suspected perpetrators to &quot;lick blood from the slaughter-house floor before they were hanged&quot;. At Isandhlwana in 1879, British soldiers were shredded by Zulu iklwas blades, &quot;so named in imitation of the sucking sound they made when pulled from human flesh&quot;. But it was mass slaughter, 20th century-style, that would truly bring the empire down. During the Boer war 160,000 white civilians would be rounded up into ghastly concentration camps - creating a precedent explicitly cited by the Nazis. The first world war carried Canadians and Indians to &quot;the bone-chilling, gut-wrenching, soul-destroying shambles of the western front&quot;, and Australians and New Zealanders to the hell of Gallipoli, where relentless firing turned &quot;their trenches into cemeteries&quot;. With the end of the first world war, even as Britain acquired new protectorates, the imperial patchwork was undeniably coming apart at the seams. It was as if, in Beatrice Webb&apos;s words, the empire began to suffer from &quot;a sort of senile hypertrophy&quot;, reaching new heights of brutality with the Amritsar massacre of 1919 and new peaks of decadence in expat enclaves from Kenya to Shanghai. The second world war accelerated the crash. On hearing the Japanese bombing of the causeway that linked Singapore to the mainland, the headmaster of Raffles School asked what all the noise was. &quot;That,&quot; replied Lee Kwan Yew, Singapore&apos;s future prime minister, &quot;is the end of the British empire.&quot; He was not far wrong. As Brendon shows, the chaos of war made it virtually impossible for Britain to retain India and Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, all of which gained independence by 1948. &quot;To save the empire&quot;, Labour ministers observed, required &quot;giving the colonies self-government&quot;. In Malaya Britain did try to hold on, only to face insurgent attacks. It responded by declaring a state of emergency and pursuing a bitter campaign against Chinese &quot;communist terrorists&quot;. This would gain cruel resonance in Kenya, where the imposition of a state of emergency in 1952 provoked intensified insurgency and the British rounding-up of tens of thousands of Mau Mau suspects into horrific detention camps. In central Africa, too, decolonisation was born in violence: worst of all in Rhodesia, where savage conflict erupted between the black majority and the fiercely racist white leadership which had unilaterally declared independence in 1965. Set against such blood-stained operations, Britain&apos;s most recent imperial war - in the Falklands - appears relatively tame. (Though sadly the West Indies, once Britain&apos;s most valuable colonial territories, rate little more space in this book than those desolate isles.) Brendon conducts his comprehensive tour of empire&apos;s fall with characteristic flair, but what depressing sights it offers. All told, The Decline and Fall of the British Empire presents a glittering panoply of decadence, folly, farce and devastation. Brendon&apos;s characters alone could fill a pantomime stage many times over. The empire seemed to abound in British oddballs, from the notorious Richard Burton, who &quot;liked to boast that he had indulged in every vice and indulged in every crime&quot;, to the maverick General Orde Wingate, who &quot;would ... hold interviews while lying naked on a bed and combing his body hair with a toothbrush&quot;. Postcolonial heroes fare little better. Jomo Kenyatta &quot;sported plus-fours, drank literally inflammatory Nubian gin and so indulged his sexual appetites that he was suspended from church membership&quot;, while Tunku Abdul Rahman of Malaysia was &quot;notorious for dancing, horse-racing, driving fast cars and getting into tight corners with loose women&quot;. Kwame Nkrumah &quot;studied the occult, consulted oracles&quot; and &quot;compared himself to Christ&quot;. Mahatma Gandhi becomes &quot;a compound of oriental mystic and occidental crank, humble sadhu and astute advocate&quot;. These titbits make for amusing reading, but they also make it hard to take any of these figures seriously - and, by extension, to understand the wellsprings of their popularity or power. What exactly is the point in telling us that Gandhi &quot;means &apos;grocer&apos; in his native Gujarati&quot;? Gibbon means a kind of ape. This touches on the chief casualty of Brendon&apos;s descriptive approach: the relative absence of explanation and analysis. After so much rich narrative, one is left craving synthesis - particularly comparison across regions, for such interconnections help make an empire what it is. How, for example, did the use of partition in Ireland in 1921 influence its subsequent application in Palestine and south Asia? How might British counter-insurgency tactics developed in one domain - South Africa or Ireland, Palestine or Malaya - have been replayed in others? (To say nothing of their influence on the Americans in Vietnam, or the French in Algeria.) To what extent did imperial personnel carry policies from region to region? What kinds of networks of influence existed among anti-colonial leaders, such as the black nationalists inspired by Gandhi, or advocates of non-alignment? Brendon nods in these directions, but readers looking for deep answers will want to turn elsewhere. &quot;I wonder if the Romans ever went back to visit Britain,&quot; mused Jawaharlal Nehru when he received a visit from Macmillan in India in 1958. At all events, the Romans, like the British, revisited their empire through the medium of history-writing - and Brendon has produced remarkable testament to how seductive such excursions can be. The real wonder, after reading his book, is how Britain ever managed to have an empire at all. \u00b7 Maya Jasanoff&apos;s Edge of Empire: Conquest and Collecting in the East 1750-1850 is published by HarperPerennial", "tags": ["Books", "History", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-20T22:49:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/21/foodanddrink.restaurants1", "sentences": ["Jean-Georges, Shanghai Designed by acclaimed American architect Michael Grave, this oriental outpost of culinary superstar Jean-Georges Vongerichten is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful-looking restaurants on the planet.", "It has a sultry red interior inspired by the grandeur of old Shanghai and a view from its setting on the legendary Bund that looks across to Pudong and wonders of new Shanghai.", "No.3 The Bund, 4th Floor, 3 Zhong Shan Dong Yi Road, Shanghai, +011 8621 6321 7733, www.jean-georges.com 27."], "title": "The 50 sexiest places to be fed", "article": "1.

A striking interior that includes rather modish-looking Corian chairs, replete with retractable handbag shelves, and a huge exploded chandelier complements the faultless, seasonally inflected, classic French cooking.

Louis XV, Monaco As chosen by Raymond Blanc, chef-patron of the deeply sexy Manoir aux Quat&apos; Saisons. He says, &apos;this is one of the most amazing places I have ever visited! It is so over the top, but it is just absolutely beautiful. Bold gold colours and cherubs, and it has the most amazing ambience. All the staff dress in black tie, yet the welcome is so warm and personal. The colourful dishes reflect local flavours and the menu reflects the seasons with wonderful themes including the vegetable garden and the sea.&apos; Place du Casino, Monaco, +377 98 06 88 64, www.alain-ducasse.com 37. Shomben Yokocho, Tokyo Unromantically nicknamed &apos;Piss Alley&apos;, this cramped warren of ramshackle huts tucked between the back of a Shinjuku department store and some train tracks is home to a series of bars and yakitori stalls, serving beer, sake and delicious skewers of grilled meat. Sitting at one of the bars, late at night, watching as tired and emotional salarymen stagger home (hence that sobriquet), the neon flickering, the atmosphere is electric; like eating on the set of Blade Runner 38. Tetsuya&apos;s, Sydney The best restaurant in Australia is guarded behind swish embassy-style gates, has a dining room that opens onto a serene Japanese garden of bonsai and water features and a menu from chef Tetsuya Wakuda that&apos;s a 14-course seafood-rich journey. 529 Kent Street, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia, +61 2 9267 2900, www.tetsuyas.com 39. Calistoga Ranch, California In what was once a hippy commune in a private canyon in the Upper Napa Valley, lies the luxury Calistoga Ranch resort, built around a forest of ancient oak trees. Its restaurant is tucked away in a secluded lake house and has a menu built on organic produce and a wine list heavy with vintage Californian bottles. 580 Lommel Road, Calistoga , California, +707 254 2800, www.calistogaranch.com 40 &apos;C&apos;, Los Caos, Mexico Legendary Chicago chef Charlie Trotter&apos;s oceanfront restaurant at the swanky One &amp; Only Palmilla Resort in Los Cabos offers a panoramic view of the Sea of Cortez and a menu that focuses on locally caught seafood.

Les Ambassadeurs, Paris This is a sexy place to eat or to stay - a super-luxe hotel on the Place de la Concorde where you can sleep in a suite the size of the average British house, all done out in grand si\u00e8cle style. Eating Jean-Francois Pi\u00e8ge&apos;s food is a real treat, particularly his crazy reconstructions of dishes such as spaghetti carbonara or rice pudding - nothing like what you might expect but delicious none the less. The dining room is all gold candelabras and marble walls but is nowhere near as hushed and restrained as it initially appears. For those (who get) lucky enough to stay over, Sunday brunch is possibly an even more decadent affair than dinner, involving eggs en cocotte (often with white truffle), raw Joselito ham, miniature pastries, Ladur\u00e9e macaroons, Norwegian smoked salmon, fruits, breads and tiny little pots of improbably rich desserts. 10 Place de la Concorde, Paris, 33(0)1 44 71 16 16 42. The Crazy Bear, Oxford Lovably eccentric, laid-back boutique hotel housed in a 16th-century coaching inn with roaring open fires, champagne on tap behind the bar, a Thai brasserie and an English restaurant, each with a seriously comprehensive menu and sumptuous surroundings. Bedrooms are foxy: each one is different - but think animal-print chaise-longues, dark red walls, richly coloured velvet, Tiffany mirrors and baths at the foot of the Baroque beds. For real privacy, go for a cottage. Bear Lane, Stadhampton, Oxford, 01865 890714, www.crazybeargroup.co.uk 43. Gambero Rosso, Tuscany A bijou dining room overlooking the cobalt-blue Tyrrhenian Sea in a small seaside town off the main Tuscan tourist trail is the only place that you&apos;ll find food prepared by Fulvio Pierangelini. The man many consider to be Italy&apos;s finest chef. In an era of jet-setting superstar chefs Pierangelini is an anachronism, a world-class culinary talent with no ambitions to open anywhere else and who simply doesn&apos;t open his restaurant if he&apos;s not there. Piazza della Vittoria 13, San Vincenzo, Livorno, Italy, +39 05 65 701021 44. The Witchery, Edinburgh Patronised by Hollywood stars, this gothic fantasy of a restaurant, in a 16th-century building by the gates of Edinburgh Castle, has seven theatrical suites, all spendidly decorated in reds and golds, with accoutrements such as four-poster beds and roll-top baths big enough for two - if you&apos;re planning to let the food, wine and setting all go to your head.

The morning after the night before Everybody knows that a sexy breakfast is a must after a successful night out, and what could be better than a proper, over-sized New York brunch? Take your date to one of these two: either Norma&apos;s for pancakes and four-egg omelettes, or Sarabeth&apos;s for French toast and blintzes.

For British brunch For that slightly grubby, proper diner experience, head for Rocotillos in Bristol - don&apos;t go for a 10-gallon Tex special if you&apos;re still trying to impress someone, though. If in Leeds, go to Anthony&apos;s at Flannels, where the legendary Anthony Flinn leaves molecular gastronomy to one side and turns out properly good eggs Benedict.

Summer Isles Hotel, Scotland At the risk of being overly literal, the sexiest restaurant has to be one where there is a realistic expectation of getting some - and that has to mean a restaurant with rooms. Top of my list then has to be the Summer Isles Hotel in Achiltibuie, on the far North West coast of Scotland. It scores on so many levels. For a start even if you&apos;ve come there from the nearest town you&apos;re still miles from anywhere and there is nothing better calculated to encourage a little intimacy than isolation. The view, of tiny mist-garlanded islands, is delicious - as is the Michelin-starred food. Thinks lots of locally caught fish and seafood from the waters just beyond the door, or game from the hills, cooked to its very best advantage, all of it served in a dining room that, while hardly a bordello, has a certain cosy charm. Best of all there&apos;s no anxiety over who eats what. The menu changes every night but there is just the one, a five-course set dinner for every guest. So there are no distractions from the important business of dining each other into bed, ideally in one of their log cabins or croft houses overlooking the bay. Any downsides? The Summer Isles Hotel is entirely seasonal and has just closed for the winter, so you&apos;ll just have to save it for the spring and the rising of the sap. Achiltibuie, Ross shire, Scotland, 01854 622282, www.summerisleshotel.co.uk 48. The Fat Duck, Berkshire Heston Blumenthal&apos;s modernist pilgrimage site used to win the sexiest restaurant competition hands down on account of just one course: a curious if delicious concoction - potato, lime jelly, maple syrup - spoon-fed to you by certain of the more comely members of the front-of-house team. You were not allowed to feed yourself. That moment, since dropped from the tasting menu, used to silence everyone around the table, as wistfully they watched their gorgeous waiter retreat. But there is, I think, still something about this restaurant, which is calculated to turn every guest into one large erogenous zone. Blumenthal&apos;s food - his roast scallop with chocolate and caviar, his best end of lamb with sweetbread and oyster, the smoky bacon ice cream whipped up tableside in a bowl of liquid nitrogen - is so engrossing, so dramatic, so damn entertaining, that after eating here anything seems possible. This is food that takes you and your companion on a journey. At the end of which all you will really need to complete the event, is the bill and a room somewhere nearby. Bray, Berkshire, 01628 580333 And finally ... 49. For a kebab Our columnist Alex James says, &apos;Kebab shops are sexy. Restaurants are for marrieds and meetings innit?&apos; Sources (who are not Alex James) tell us that apparently one of the best places to go is Marathon Kebab in London&apos;s Chalk Farm, a deliciously drunken and debauched post-pub venue up the road from the notoriously heady Camden Barfly. Expect live music from bedraggled saxophonists and the wine to come in screw-top bottles. 87 Chalk Farm Road, London NW1 50. For naked ladies The most risque recommendation we got? From Mourad Mazouz, owner of Sketch. Apparently if you go to Bordo in Moscow, a restaurant and, ahem, gentleman&apos;s club, naked women will drape themselves around as you eat.

Ever since Sunday, March 18 - the opening round of the grand prix season - expectations have snowballed that Britain would be celebrating its first Formula 1 drivers&apos; crown in 11 years. And after last night&apos;s sorry reminder that in every game there have to be losers as well as winners, the pressure must have been nigh-on unbearable. Hamilton carried the weight of a nation on his shoulders at Brazil today. If only Formula 1&apos;s technology geeks had devised a way of reading drivers&apos; minds then we&apos;d know what he was thinking when he saw the headlines this morning. His stiffest challenge this year came from team-mate Fernando Alonso, who has shown himself to be a master of mind games and, often, petulance. He made clear his dislike that Hamilton refused to bow to his two world championship titles and now he&apos;s finally got the better of him. Second on the grid but held up by a fast-starting Kimi Raikkonen, Hamilton was passed at the start by his Spanish rival. He could have let him go, but he fought back and ran wide. Soon a gearbox problem dropped him down the order and, coupled with a third pitstop, scuppered his chances of winning the title. In many ways, though, today&apos;s outcome does not matter. Hamilton has smashed so many records and rattled so many cages this year that you&apos;d be foolish not to forgive him for missing out on this final goal. By leading the championship for most of the year, winning four races and being in the thick of the best of this year&apos;s action, he has already proven he will one day be world champion. To have done it in his debut year would of course have been incredible, but he&apos;s shot so far past peoples&apos; expectations that to finish second in the championship is still an amazing result. In the end there was just a single point in it. Raikkonen took six wins and Hamilton should feel no shame in losing out to him. Once again today, Hamilton displayed that key trait of a champion (future or current): never, ever give up. Take the European Grand Prix where after slithering off the track in dire weather conditions he kept his engine going and was controversially winched back on track. He didn&apos;t finish in the points at the Nurburgring - one of only two races that he&apos;s not scored in this year - but by god he tried. It was the same tenacious attitude that caused him to push to keep advantage over Raikkonen in the Chinese Grand Prix. And, with seriously worn tyres, we all know what happened in that race. If Hamilton had wrapped up the title in Shanghai the fairytale would have been complete, the unthinkable achieved. Instead he kept us on tenterhooks until today. Grand Prix racing is not a national sport, yet after defeat against Russia and South Africa, Hamilton was England&apos;s last chance of restoring its pride. The boy from Stevenage went to Interlagos to do a job today, to finish the debut season he&apos;s spent most of his life preparing for. Carrying the weight of his country just added to the burden and in the end he made a rare mistake. That error didn&apos;t cost him the title, but it didn&apos;t help his cause. Lewis Hamilton has not become the first rookie to win the world championship, but he&apos;ll take many more records over the coming years. There are some who cheer at his disappointment, claiming his season is tarnished, that because of the controversies that have dogged McLaren his achievements have come by less than fair means. But let&apos;s be honest - those calls are from people who were rooting for their own national heroes. Sadly this year, it just wasn&apos;t Hamilton&apos;s - or England&apos;s - turn for glory.", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula one 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-21T18:05:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/21/foodanddrink.features9", "sentences": ["Instead he is flying madly round the world in the next few months opening new Frankie&apos;s restaurants in hellholes like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and planning 20 more Frankie&apos;s in the Caribbean."], "title": "Interview: Marco Pierre White", "article": "I heard a presenter on XFM talking about the recent series of Hell&apos;s Kitchen, and he said, &apos;I don&apos;t know who that chef guy was but he was very good&apos;, and someone else piped up, &apos;I think he&apos;s the man who trained Gordon Ramsay&apos;. Oh Marco, I sobbed, has it come to this? He was the youngest ever chef, at 33, to win three Michelin stars and the first Briton. He was our one-man answer to French gastronomic complacency because he had never trained in France. In the Eighties and Nineties he bestrode the British restaurant industry like a colossus. And now he is &apos;the man who trained Gordon Ramsay&apos;- it is tragic. But it is his own stupid fault: he retired from cooking on 23 December l999, handed back his three Michelin stars, and since then has squandered his reputation in a bewildering succession of short-lived business ventures. I first interviewed him back in 1992 when he was still at Harvey&apos;s in Wandsworth, the restaurant that made his name. He was gorgeous in those days, very thin, staring-eyed, and fiery, but almost unintelligible. He spent hours expounding his &apos;philosophy of life&apos;, which seemed to consist of baffling aphorisms like &apos;Only dead fish swim with the tide&apos;. Presumably it went down well with junior staff and models (he was a great modeliser in those days) but a bit wasted on me. Anyway we &apos;go back a long way&apos;, as he keeps telling me, while pouring compliments over me like custard. The only thing that slightly spoils the effect is that he later goes into a paean of praise to Rosie Boycott that makes my portion of compliments seem somewhat meagre by comparison. Unfortunately Marco has developed a whole new concept in making life difficult for interviewers. He keeps saying, &apos;On the record but not for publication&apos;, which seems to mean that I am allowed to keep the tape recorder running but am supposed to - what? - lock his secrets in my bosom? Deliver them to the Public Record Office for release 30 years after his death? Bah, humbug. It is not the job of journalists to keep secrets. But it means that he keeps half-telling me things then refusing to explain. For instance, he told me, &apos;on the record but not for publication&apos;, that he no longer owns his own brand name: &apos;I gave it to a trust to ... So if you want to do a deal with me, you don&apos;t deal with me. I can&apos;t go into details. But it&apos;s simplified a lot of my life.&apos; Perhaps this explains why he disappeared from the Sunday Times Rich List a few years ago. We are lunching at Luciano&apos;s, a restaurant he co-owns with Sir Rocco Forte, which used to be Prunier&apos;s, in St James&apos;s Street. It is a glorious art deco room but puzzlingly empty - for much of lunchtime we are almost the only customers. Marco is thrilled when an elderly lady arrives in a hat. &apos;Oh I love ladies in hats!&apos; he exclaims. &apos;One rule of restaurants: never take a hat from a lady; wait for her to offer you the hat because she might not want to take it off - she might not have had time to do her hair properly.&apos; This is typical of Marco&apos;s persistent enraptured infatuation with the upper classes - I have never met anyone, let alone anyone from a Leeds council estate, so uncritically devoted to the ancien regime He asks a waiter for the menu and reads it as if for the first time. &apos;Why is this starter \u00a36.20?&apos; he wonders. &apos;I can understand \u00a36.50 or \u00a36.95, but not \u00a36.20.&apos; But this is supposed to be his restaurant - it is named after his eldest son - so why doesn&apos;t he know? Apparently he doesn&apos;t do the money side - Rocco Forte does all that. Anyway, he quickly orders riboletta (bean soup) and fettucine for himself and tells me to have the veal cutlet, with zuccini on the side, and crab with &apos;pane caude&apos; to start with. Pane caude turns out to be some sort of crispbread rolled like a brandy snap, which makes it completely unsuitable for sopping up crab. I can&apos;t believe the old three-star Marco would have approved. He orders a glass of champagne for me but not for him. &apos;I don&apos;t really drink,&apos; he tells me, and looks stern when I laugh. &apos;Think of all the times you&apos;ve met me, you&apos;ve never seen me drink. I never had a drink at all till I was 38, I&apos;m just not a drinker. I go days without drinking. Only journalists sometimes get me drunk!&apos; Is this right? I&apos;ve never had a sober meal with Marco but, come to think of it, maybe that&apos;s just me. On the other hand, when I ask for a glass of red later, he orders a bottle of Bardolino Classico and seems quite happy to share it - &apos;It&apos;s a little wine from my mum&apos;s village, and I always think if it came out of the same ground as my mum, it must be good&apos;. His mum, of course, is a constant companion in any Marco conversation. When he recently had &apos;words&apos; with Angus Deayton, who presented Hell&apos;s Kitchen and made some disparaging remark about his name, his parting shot was, &apos;Angus, the eyes you look at are the eyes that watched my mother die&apos;. Deayton was understandably perplexed but anyone who knows Marco knows that he habitually uses his mother&apos;s death as his Get out of Jail Free card. He saw her collapse with a brain haemorrhage when he was six and that explains and excuses everything. A customer comes over to compliment Marco on Hell&apos;s Kitchen and I warmly pitch in, saying truthfully that I loved the show. But Marco is very sniffy at first and says he hasn&apos;t even watched it. He claims he was first asked to do it four years ago - before Gordon Ramsay - and only agreed this time &apos;for my kiddies, because they&apos;d never seen the old man cook&apos;. But it was his first time in the kitchen for seven-and-a-half years - wasn&apos;t he apprehensive? &apos;I don&apos;t think like that. I went there to do a job and my job was to feed 76 people every night and sometimes 100 people with what I&apos;d been given. And I proved to myself that I can still do it. I might not be as fast as I was - my boys said that I was 35 or 40 per cent slower than I used to be - but if I was that fast, I&apos;d have left the celebs behind.&apos; It was a long hard stint. For a month he was living and working in this strange telly bunker in darkest east London, away from his family and with his mobile phone switched off. He reckons he worked at least l8 hours a day, starting at six and finishing at midnight. The previous Hell&apos;s Kitchen chefs, he sniffs, didn&apos;t work nearly such long hours and had prep chefs round the back but, &apos;I didn&apos;t. I led from the front. Sometimes I took such a bashing on that pass - you&apos;d got all these tickets and all this food to serve and I&apos;d put one ticket in my mouth, one over there, one over there, so that it didn&apos;t look so monstrous.&apos; He had just two experienced assistants, Matthew and Tim, who&apos;ve worked for him since they were l8, and then 10 assorted celebs as his brigade. He had no say in choosing the celebs, and still seems a bit vague about who some of them were. But right at the beginning he gave them the task of cooking an egg, which allowed him to assess their basic competence: &apos;You can tell by the way they crack it, they hold the pan, by the way they stand by the stove.&apos; He found Jim Davidson most reliable: &apos;He was the person that from very early days I could turn my back on in the kitchen and know that what he did was right. He&apos;s very bright and he enjoys cooking - he cooked for the staff most days.&apos; And he loved Rosie Boycott: &apos;She was my favourite - interesting, intelligent, a proper person, and I remember the day she was voted off I was very sad. She was a lady.&apos; But they were all good, he says, because &apos;In the kitchen they&apos;re no longer celebs, they&apos;re my crew, and my job was to lead them like I led young boys in Harvey&apos;s all those years ago. The best bit of the entire journey was actually teaching and inspiring them.&apos; As soon as we have finished the first course Marco asks, &apos;Do you still smoke? Do you want a fag?&apos; so we dash outside to puff away under scaffolding in the rain and he gives me his jacket to keep warm. &apos;It&apos;s not bad sneaking for a fag outside, is it? Are you happy in life, Lynn? Despite your bereavement? I think the best you can do is accept it, like with my mum - the pain will never go. I&apos;ll always remember 20 February, the day she died, and 30 November, her birthday, so I always go very strange on those days - I always go to Brompton Oratory and light a candle and stay there for about an hour by myself. But I&apos;ve learned to accept it, and my mum lives on through my children. I&apos;m not saying life&apos;s easy - I have my complications - but it all contributes to this life we live.&apos; Back indoors for the main course, I ask whether doing Hell&apos;s Kitchen made him want to get back to cooking? &apos;No! I&apos;ve been there, done that. I won my three stars, I did what I had to do, and you&apos;ve got to move on. I wouldn&apos;t want to be in one room, 20 hours a day, 52 weeks a year, with four white walls and a stove. I think it stunts your growth as a human being. When I left the kitchen at 38, I was quite socially inept. I think I&apos;ve developed more as a person in the past seven years than I did in all my years in the kitchen.&apos; But what&apos;s he been doing all this time? He has opened several restaurants and closed some of them, he has established a pasta chain called Frankie&apos;s with Frankie Dettori that seems to be doing quite well, and has just opened a new Marco&apos;s at Chelsea football ground. He has published his autobiography, White Slave, though he freely admits it was all written by his friend James Steen, &apos;But I did lots and lots of interviews with him and it&apos;s the most wonderful form of counselling ever, free of charge, and I was being paid for it!&apos; But even he admits that he has not been focused, like he used to be. &apos;To be quite honest, I did nothing in seven years really, apart from try to discover myself and understand myself as a person. I was unemployed and I&apos;d lost all sense of direction in my life. I was 38 and I&apos;d just had enough. Because I&apos;d won my three stars at 33 and I felt, &quot;Oh, is that it?&quot; It was quite weird. If I&apos;d been 48 like Albert Roux [when he won three stars] it&apos;s different, but at 33 - it was very young. When you start, you&apos;re always pushing, always chasing, wanting to do better and better, but once you get to that level, it becomes very systematic. And I just thought: I&apos;m not happy. I thought that by winning three stars I would be happy, I thought I&apos;d be accepted. But I was almost in a worse position. Because when you&apos;re a one-star chef, your mentors don&apos;t feel threatened by you; even when you&apos;re a two-star chef they don&apos;t, because they&apos;re still top of their tree and they think &apos;my boy Marco&apos; - because remember, I was totally home-grown, I never went to France. And then when I won three stars, they&apos;d all started to crumble, or got bored with the stove, and what they couldn&apos;t cope with was that Marco was now the boss in their world. And then I saw the knives come in behind me and I started getting disillusioned with my whole world. Because with all my failings, I&apos;m a very loyal individual.&apos; This is not the impression one gets from his autobiography. In the past seven years Marco seems to have fallen out with everyone - with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gordon Ramsay most publicly, but also with his mentor Albert Roux who he used to say was &apos;like a father&apos; to him; with Michael Winner who paid for his honeymoon; with Michael Caine who backed his restaurant Canteen; and with his youngest brother to whom he hasn&apos;t spoken for nine years. In White Slave, he recounts these fallings-out as if they were great moral victories, but they hardly resound to his credit. Take the famous incident at Heston Blumenthal&apos;s Fat Duck restaurant in Bray. He was having lunch there when he saw Gordon Ramsay also having lunch. He immediately summoned Blumenthal and told him to tell Ramsay to leave. Blumenthal was embarrassed; Gordon Ramsay was furious and called Marco a &apos;fat bastard&apos;; the other customers were agog. Marco thinks he deserved a standing ovation. For what? For making a scene in a restaurant? Respect! A few months ago he threatened to sue Gordon Ramsay over a chapter in Ramsay&apos;s autobiography in which he admitted stealing the reservations book from Aubergine - his own restaurant - and then blaming it on Marco. Ramsay told Bill Buford: &apos;It was my one stroke of genius, fucking someone over without his knowing that I was the one who did it.&apos; Marco threatened to sue for malicious falsehood but says now that he didn&apos;t need to sue because he got the publishers to withdraw the chapter. But of course they&apos;re still not speaking. Were he and Ramsay ever friends? &apos;No. Gordon worked for me. I helped set up his first deal at Aubergine. I was always brought up in life, by my father, never to forget what people do for me - unfortunately some people have short memories.&apos; Quite - rather like his own short memory \u00e0 propos Albert Roux. But the most serious of all the recent fallings-out has been with his wife Mati, mother of his three youngest children. Their relationship was always fiery. In 2003 she found texts on his mobile phone which she thought meant he was having an affair with a woman banker and sent a message to everyone on his mobile saying, &apos;Marco Pierre White has left his wife and three children for Robin Saunders&apos;. A year or so later she called the police to their house and accused Marco of assault - he spent the night in the cells though she never pressed charges. Last summer she marched into Luciano&apos;s and fired a waitress, telling her, &apos;You are the second waitress my husband is fucking&apos;. On another occasion, she went to Frankie&apos;s and publicly demanded a divorce. And, according to Marco, they are now divorced - &apos;I have my decree nisi&apos; - though they are still living together. Isn&apos;t that a bit odd? &apos;My life has not been normal, Lynn!&apos; So are they back together? &apos;I think in life, the more you force things, they break. You just let things happen.&apos; But is there someone else in his life? &apos;Not to my knowledge. And, to be honest, I have no interest.&apos; What? No interest in women? This must be a first. &apos;Not really. I have my children. I get so much love from my children. I love my family. I know what it&apos;s like to come from a broken world.&apos; So why did they ever divorce in the first place? &apos;On the record but not for publication - I think my wife was just trying to get my attention. Trying to win my respect. And that&apos;s her right. It&apos;s very easy for Marco to go off and do this, do that, do whatever. I have all this freedom in the world - or I&apos;m perceived to have this freedom - whereas my wife is a mother and it can be very difficult for a woman.&apos; He claims that he is now more mature and happier than he&apos;s ever been. &apos;I think my biography played a very big part in that - going down that road of self-discovery and reliving my life and questioning everything. I stepped into Hell&apos;s Kitchen because I finally felt comfortable with myself as a person. Seven-and-a-half years is a long time away from the stove. But I felt very confident in myself mentally. I felt I could do the job. And I know my industry is very happy that I stepped back into the ring.&apos; Everyone was happy to see him back in the ring. So why doesn&apos;t he stay there - not necessarily in a restaurant but at least on television, teaching people to cook? He was so good in his heyday. Instead he is flying madly round the world in the next few months opening new Frankie&apos;s restaurants in hellholes like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and planning 20 more Frankie&apos;s in the Caribbean. It sounds a nightmare: he says he enjoys it. He likes the fact that Frankie&apos;s is &apos;democratic&apos;, that families can eat there with their children. And he likes the people he is dealing with. &apos;Even in these superficial worlds, where one is an illusion, one is a building site, there are interesting people.

Zeng Qinghong, the vice-president, was among three of the party&apos;s most senior cadres who lost their places on the new central committee unveiled yesterday at the close of the 17th party congress. Although Zeng has avoided friction with Hu, his departure is seen as a boost to the president, who secured his second five-year term by winning 2,233 of the 2,235 votes in the tightly controlled selection process. It will allow Mr Hu to replace almost half of the nine-member politburo standing committee, which will be announced within the next two days. Mr Zeng is a party strongman, who previously held the reins of the powerful organisational department and maintained strong ties to the military and the propaganda apparatus. A rocket-scientist turned politician from Jiangxi province, he rose to prominence as an aide to the previous president, Jiang Zemin, who has exerted considerable power behind the scenes since he stood down in 2002. But the congress strengthens Mr Hu&apos;s authority. As well as promoting more allies into the central committee, the leader has secured inclusion of his concept of &quot;scientific development&quot; in the party charter. The process is far from democratic. The delegates to congress are carefully picked and they have little choice. In the election of a new central committee of 204 members, only about 20 of the candidates failed to secure a post. Most of the senior cadres who were not reappointed were past retirement age.

Xi Jinping, a &quot;princeling&quot; from an elite family, and Li Keqiang, the son of a low-ranked rural official, were propelled into the highest echelons of the Communist party after protracted backroom dealing that will shape policy and personnel for a generation. The duo joins the politburo standing committee, the most powerful body in China, in a reshuffle aimed at consolidating the authority of the party leader and state president, Hu Jintao. At the 17th party congress, which ended at the weekend, Mr Hu secured his second five-year term as leader and had his concept of &quot;scientific development&quot; written into the party charter. The president has had difficulty implementing his policies of environmental protection, redistribution of wealth and clean government because power is diffused among provinces and factions. The reshuffle only partially strengthens his hand. Out went his biggest rival, Vice-President Zeng Qinghong and two other senior cadres who were close to Mr Hu&apos;s predecessor, Jiang Zemin. But the factional bloodlines of both newcomers suggest Mr Hu will still have to make compromises. Of the four new appointees, only one - Mr Li - is a pure Hu protege. Like the president, Mr Li worked his way to the top by running some of China&apos;s poorest provinces, and exploiting his connections in the Communist Youth League. Mr Li had been tipped as Mr Hu&apos;s most likely successor in 2012, but a rival whose different background underscores the divisions inside this fast-changing society has since eclipsed him. Mr Xi is the son of a party elder, the husband of a famous singer and - until today - the party boss of the commercial capital, Shanghai. An engineering and law graduate of Tsinghua University, he has a reputation as a talented troubleshooter with close connections to business and foreign investors. He is seen as a compromise candidate because he is close to both Mr Hu and Mr Jiang. At the public unveiling at the Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi was introduced ahead of Mr Li, suggesting he will be the next president, with the latter the next prime minister. But some analysts have suggested both men are so closely matched that there could be a genuine leadership contest at the next congress. Both are in their 50s, well below the all-male standing committee&apos;s average age of 62. Underlining that both men are chosen ones, Mr Hu went out of his way to give a special introduction. &quot;Xi Jinping, 54, and Li Keqiang, 52, are two comrades who are relatively younger,&quot; he said. The two other new members - Zhou Yongkang, who takes the helm of the public security ministry, and He Guoqiang, who is in charge of party discipline - are seen as closer to Jiang-Zeng camp. The continued influence of the former president was further underlined when two scandal-tainted cadres close to Mr Jiang retained their posts.

He began his working life in Gansu province, rapidly progressing in the Ministry of Water, Conservancy and Power. As his political career took off, at first serving in the Youth League, then later acting as party chief for Tibet and Guizhou, he gained experience working in some of China&apos;s poorest regions. In 1992 he become the youngest ever member of the CPC central committee. He has been general secretary since 2002, president of China since 2003 and in 2004 succeeded Jiang Zemin as chairman of the central military commission. His coming to power has marked the transition of Chinese rule from old-style communism to a technocracy. Wu Bangguo  Chairman of the standing committee of the 10th National People&apos;s Congress Like Mr Hu, Wu Bangguo was also from the Anhui region and studied engineering at Qinghua. He joined the communist party in 1964, and began his career at factories in Shanghai. He was recruited to work for the party and in 1983 was appointed secretary of the science and technology commission in Shanghai. Another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jiang Zemin, he joined the politburo with Mr Hu in 1992. He was made chairman of the standing committee of the National People&apos;s Congress in 2003. Wen Jiabao Member of the standing committee of the politburo of the CPC central committee and premier of the state council Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, is from Tianjin and joined the CPC in 1965. After studying geology to post-graduate level at the Beijing Institute of Geology, Wen Jiabao began a political career in this field and was eventually made vice-minister of geology and mineral resources. He continued to ascend to the higher ranks of the party, but not without the occasional hiccough. In 1989 he famously accompanied then-party secretary Zhao Ziyang to Tiananmen Square to visit the students on hunger strike. Mr Zhao was forced to leave the party immediately, but Mr Wen survived the incident. In his current role as premier, he has overseen the country&apos;s economic reforms and is popular with the people. Jia Qinglin  Chairman of the 10th national committee of the Chinese People&apos;s Political Consultative Conference Jia Qinglin is a native of Hebei. He studied manufacturing at Hebei Engineering College and began his political life in the ministry of industry. He moved on to work in Fujian province and became head of the party in the area in 1993. He was brought in to act as mayor of Beijing from 1996, leading the city in celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People&apos;s Republic of China. In his current role he has little power. Li Changchun Member of the standing committee of the politburo of the CPC central committee Li Changchu is from the industrial province of Liaoning. He studied electrical engineering then worked at factories in Shenyang. He has been fast-tracked up the political ranks, becoming the youngest ever mayor of a major city and the youngest member of the politburo, beating Mr Hu&apos;s record. His work within the committee is said to be related to propaganda. Xi Jinping Secretary of the CPC Shanghai municipal committee Son of Xi Zhongxun, a founder of the Communist guerrilla movement in northern China, Xi Jinping is from Shaanxi. He joined the Youth League and then became a member of the party in 1974. He studied at Beijing University, where he gained a degree in law and completed a PhD in economics. Li Keqiang Member of the 16th CPC central committee, secretary of the CPC Liaoning provincial committee and chairman of the standing committee of Liaoning provincial people&apos;s congress Li Keqiang was born in Anhui and studied at Beijing University, where he completed a doctorate. In 1999 he took on the role of governor of Henan, then in 2004 took up his position as CPC committee secretary in Shanghai. He Guoqiang Keeps the party&apos;s personnel files A native of Xiangxiang in southern Hunan province, He was appointed to the politburo in 2002. An engineer by training, He served for three years as the secretary of the party committee in Chongqing, a booming south-western city, before becoming the head of the central committee organisation department in 2002. He was also selected as secretary of the party&apos;s central discipline commission. Zhou Yongkang The public security minister and petroleum industry veteran Zhou enforced tough security policies in western China while serving in Sichuan province, including the arrest of a leading Tibetan Buddhist teacher.

But it&apos;s not surprising, given that Kirk is in the school every week and joins in on &quot;the fun side of school&quot;, acting as a judge on the school&apos;s Pop Idol competition. Kirk has been around Belle Vue for longer than most: it is 18 years since she joined the board of governors, four since she became its chair. Since 1989, when she joined, Bradford has become increasingly ridden with social problems. The 2001 Bradford riots demonstrated that ethnic division has become more pronounced, the &quot;white flight&quot; has created ghettos and unemployment is consistently high. And yet Belle Vue has flourished, drawing students from 40 primary schools across Bradford city. The only local authority all girls&apos; school in Bradford, Belle Vue had 500 students when Kirk started as governor; now there are 1,080. While fences give the school exterior a dreary appearance, inside, Belle Vue&apos;s warmth and modernity become evident. Its reception, and indeed the whole school, is full of the students&apos; artworks. There&apos;s an easygoing relationship between students and staff. In a display case are plaques for writing competitions among Bradford schools: poetry, prose and story writing. Platt and Kirk make a formidable team. They meet weekly. Platt says: &quot;I have lots of ideas; Kirk identifies the good ones.&quot; Kirk, according to Platt, is &quot;a critical friend&quot;: &quot;It&apos;s a very robust relationship, which was a bit of a shock at first!&quot; But Platt, who nominated Kirk for the award, adds that she gets great support and advice from her. She believes that &quot;governors must have a relationship with the stakeholders&quot; - staff, students and their parents. Recently she has started meeting three sixth formers who are involved in the board of governors which, she says, has been very interesting, as they are getting the student perspective on school matters. In a deprived area, the relationship between the school and students&apos; parents is often tenuous, but 99% of parents turn up to Belle Vue&apos;s review days; a figure that sounds quite phenomenal when one considers it used to be 30%. With 30% of its student intake on the SEN register, Belle Vue has educational challenges. But the school is well known for the progress its students make and the national value added league tables consistently place it in the high performing schools category. A banner in front of the school announces that 50% of its A-level students got A*-C grades this year. Kirk and the school see cultural difference as a positive asset. Ninety per cent of Belle Vue&apos;s students are Muslim and several wear a veil. The language of the playground is English, but several of the students come from families who speak Urdu and Punjabi at home. Kirk and Platt appear unperturbed by the challenges presented by the growing number of foreign students, and see Belle Vue is well-positioned to educate them, being a specialist language college. An exchange programme has been established with the school Kirk&apos;s daughter teaches at in Shanghai, and already a number of Belle Vue teachers have been there. Some teachers from Shanghai visited the school in November, and it hopes some students will be able to travel to China next year. The judges said: Staff told us the school now &quot;belongs to the community more than it did before&quot; and that staff and students &quot;own their own school&quot;.

It is a long shot and may require him to win this week and then reach the final of the last Masters Series tournament, in Paris next week, but the 20-year-old Scot is in a rich vein of form and was a shade unfortunate to lose against Spain&apos;s Rafael Nadal, the world No2, in the Madrid Masters last week. Murray had twice before played and beaten Mirnyi, predominantly a doubles player these days but formerly in the top 20, and knew what to expect. The so-called &quot;Beast of Belarus&quot;, who is 6ft 5in, crowds the net in an old-fashioned serve-and-volley style and Murray duly picked him off with forensic expertise. Mirnyi won his opening service game to love but thereafter found himself lunging impotently as Murray passed him time and again. &quot;Andy has surpassed me in all aspects today,&quot; Mirnyi said. &quot;He has neutralised my attacking game with passing shots.&quot; Murray is acknowledged as one of the leading returners and has been working hard on his serve, which as he showed in Madrid is fast becoming a potent weapon of greater reliability. As against Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic and Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina last week, he demolished Mirnyi, who was made to look ordinary. Murray is seeded No2 in St Petersburg behind Russia&apos;s Nikolay Davydenko, the world No4, and appears well placed to challenge for his third career title. The Tennis Masters Cup is restricted to the world&apos;s leading eight players and with 12 days left five have qualified - Roger Federer, Nadal, Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic, Davydenko and Andy Roddick. Spain&apos;s David Ferrer, this year&apos;s surprise US Open semi-finalist, is virtually home and dry, effectively leaving two places available, currently filled by Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez of Chile, this year&apos;s beaten Australian Open finalist, and Tommy Haas of Germany. Murray is one of 19 vying for the last places. He is in 18th place overall and would almost certainly have qualified had he not suffered a wrist injury during the clay-court season that forced him out for more than three months and made him miss the French Open and Wimbledon. His main goal at the start of the year was to reach the top 10 and make it to Shanghai. He duly reached No8 in the world in April before being injured and slipping back to his current ranking of 16th. He should be seeded for the final Masters Series event in France, a tournament which Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski won. Henman played in the Tennis Masters Cup three times, reaching the semi-finals in 1998, and Rusedski played in 1997 and 1998 but did not progress beyond the round-robin stage. Murray proved to himself in Madrid against Nadal that he is back close to his best, although with only two tournaments left it would need exceptional circumstances for him to qualify for Shanghai. He reached two Masters Series semi-finals this year, in Indian Wells and Key Biscayne, and would love to end his year on a high in preparation for an assault on the top five next year.

His tenure as Lady Margaret&apos;s professor of divinity (1951-76) spanned a period of university expansion and new opportunities for international cooperation after an insular period. As a doctoral supervisor and leader of the famous seminar established by F C Burkitt, Moule did more than anyone to make Cambridge the natural training ground for future university teachers in his field. Equally significant, he influenced generations of clergy through three decades of ever-evolving lecture courses on the theology and ethics of the New Testament and a long association with Cambridge&apos;s liberal evangelical theological college, Ridley Hall, at a critical time. Moule was born in the Chinese city of Hangchow (now Hangzhou, near Shanghai), the third son of missionary parents, and brought up in the compound where his grandfather was still bishop of mid-China. After the first world war, the family returned to the vicarage of Damerham, Hampshire, and Charlie attended Weymouth college. He won a classical scholarship to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1927, and after graduating with a first was ordained at Ridley Hall in 1933. After a year as tutor, and a second curacy at Rugby, he returned to Ridley in 1936 as vice-principal. In 1944, he became dean of Clare College and university assistant lecturer, a post he held until 1951. As a life fellow and bachelor don, Charlie continued to live in college as professor, supporting his remarkable successors as dean, from John Robinson through Maurice Wiles, Mark Santer and Arthur Peacocke to Rowan Williams. Combining sociability and charm with Bonhoeffer&apos;s &quot;secret discipline&quot;, he was emphatically a college man, for many years secretary of the Clare Association. Emmanuel College made him an honorary fellow in 1972, and, in 1988, Cambridge added an honorary DD to that received from St Andrew&apos;s university 30 years previously. He was made CBE in 1985. A fellow of the British Academy from 1966 and president of the International Society of New Testament Studies (1967-68), he was awarded the academy&apos;s Burkitt medal in 1970. On his retirement in 1976, he also ended 21 years as canon theologian of Leicester, but returned to Ridley as New Testament tutor until 1980. He moved to Pevensey, Sussex, until in 2003 infirmity prescribed a residential home in Dorset, close to his family. Charlie&apos;s undergraduate tutors had persuaded him to concentrate on the language of the New Testament, a project that eventually yielded an inaugural lecture and An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek (1953). Meticulous exegesis is characteristic of his whole oeuvre, but his interests were always primarily theological. Here he combined faithfulness to his evangelical roots with a remarkable independence of thought. Largely self-taught in theology, he belonged to no school, but his admiration for CH Dodd, also a classicist by training, and close collaboration with him as a translator of the New English Bible, signals an affinity. Both saw the gospel enshrined in the life and ministry of Jesus, and appealed to history for its elucidation and defence. This confidence that historical study would support Christian faith, including belief in the Resurrection, allowed Moule to remain steadily orthodox in the 1960s, when some of his colleagues were more critical of doctrinal tradition. His courtesy and engaging openness disarmed the many who disagreed with him. His first book to attract a wide international readership was The Birth of the New Testament (1962, revised 1981), a mature synthesis of investigations into the church&apos;s worship, self-awareness and use of the Jewish scriptures. Its balanced and sober judgments are refreshing when re-read in a more sceptical and fragmented age. This masterpiece was followed by The Phenomenon of the New Testament (1967) and several substantial articles, later collected in Essays in New Testament Interpretation (1982) and Forgiveness and Reconciliation (1988). Both collections and a third, prizewinning book, The Origin of Christology (1977), point to a primary focus on christology, the Spirit, and salvation. In speaking of the atonement, Moule preferred personal to sacrificial or cultic terms, and saw punishment as always restorative or deterrent, never retributive. He opposed uncritical views of scripture and doubted whether &quot;inspiration&quot; was a helpful way of describing its indispensability. It is, however, the person, as much as the work, that will be remembered. The transfer of the label &quot;Holy Mouley&quot; (from his great-uncle, the first principal of Ridley and conservative scholar bishop of Durham) to the modest, approachable and pastoral professor, had substance as well as affection in it. Those who heard him preach or lecture sensed deep seriousness, humanity and devotion, but in conversation it was the light touch and puckish sense of humour that stood out. A love of the countryside led to Man and Nature in the New Testament (1964), and his collaboration with colleagues produced Miracles (1965) and (with Ernst Bammel) Jesus and the Politics of his Day (1982). In the faculty, his wisdom usually prevailed, showing gentleness and humility are not to be confused with weakness.  \u00b7  Charles Francis Digby Moule, priest and theologian, born December 3 1908; died September 30 2007", "tags": ["Religion", "World news", "UK news", "Society", "Ethics"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-24T09:53:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/26/musicnews.china", "sentences": ["The market for dance music is shifting abroad.&quot; The explanation for such a trend is likely to lie, as with so many things, in the continuing Chinese economic boom, which has funded outsized nightclubs in cities including Shanghai and Guangzhou.", "Dance music website dontstayin.com has community pages for eight such venues in Shanghai alone."], "title": "The superstar DJ is alive and well - in China", "article": "It may seem some time since British youth culture was in thrall to clubs like Cream and Gatecrasher and figures like Paul Oakenfold and Norman Cook were as popular as Oasis. But a poll released yesterday shows that the cult of the superstar DJ is alive and well, it&apos;s just moved to China. Dutchman Armin van Buuren was named the world&apos;s favourite DJ this week in the annual readers&apos; poll run online by DJ magazine. While most of the names at the top of the list are practitioners of a high-tempo form of techno music known as trance, the style of their music is perhaps of less note than the people who voted for it. &quot;We got 350,000 people voting this year up from 229,000 last time around,&quot; said Jason Robertson, the publisher of DJ Magazine. &quot;That&apos;s largely down to a real appetite for dance club culture coming from outside the UK. The US was the biggest voting bloc, then the UK. But China was close behind them both and eastern European countries not far behind either. China was a big player this year. The market for dance music is shifting abroad.&quot; The explanation for such a trend is likely to lie, as with so many things, in the continuing Chinese economic boom, which has funded outsized nightclubs in cities including Shanghai and Guangzhou. Dance music website dontstayin.com has community pages for eight such venues in Shanghai alone. A rise in the consumption of ecstasy and other drugs has been acknowledged by Chinese authorities which may have helped encourage an appetite for repetitive beats. Bill Brewster, the co-author of dance music history Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, says a decline in appetite for big name DJs in the UK has forced them to look abroad. &quot;In a parochial sense it&apos;s over,&quot; he said, &quot;but there remains a higher echelon of mega-DJs who are huge all over globe. &quot;In countries where youth culture is a relatively new thing, there is a huge appetite for music like trance.

Since the 1950s, China has been providing scholarships for doctors, engineers and scientists as part of efforts designed to strengthen its &quot;soft power&quot; in the developing world. But in recent years, this campaign has taken on a sharper focus. Most prominent is the foreign ministry&apos;s campaign to promote the teaching of Chinese culture across the globe in order to ally anxieties about the country&apos;s growing political and economic clout. The ministry&apos;s Confucius Institutes are proliferating - there are already more than 150 such Chinese language schools across the world. Now it is seeking to attract a greater share of foreign students looking for degrees and qualifications in an international education market. While providing education to impoverished students from Asia and Africa remains a key part of China&apos;s efforts to extend its soft power abroad, the country is aiming to reposition itself in the global education market with internationally competitive universities offering a full range of curricula, and tuition in Mandarin, English and other languages. For the schools and universities themselves - there are more than 500 universities now offering tuition to foreign students - there are other considerations. Many of China&apos;s educational institutions are ridden with debt - a recent study showed that each university owed an average of $59m - and they are desperate to raise funds in a more competitive economy. For them, the more foreigners the better. Impressive levels of economic growth have made China an increasingly attractive destination for adventurous overseas students, with many studying not only Mandarin, but also subjects such as Chinese medicine, acupuncture, opera and even English. The financial pressures faced by some institutions haven&apos;t deterred foreign firms from investing in the country&apos;s education boom. This month, Raffles Education Corp spent nearly $274m on the Oriental University in Hebei province, making Raffles the largest foreign education provider in the country. The most successful private education providers, including New Oriental, based in Beijing, are even listing on the New York stock exchange and boasting earnings equivalent to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. There were about 160,000 foreign students from 185 different countries in China last year, according to figures from the ministry of education. The figure is expected to rise, with the city of Shanghai alone expecting 70,000 students by 2010. Shanghai&apos;s 24 publicly run universities enrolled 30,000 foreign students last year, and the city has already given permission to a number of private colleges to accept foreigners. New Oriental, China&apos;s biggest private English language provider, is aware of the trends. While the company focuses mainly on its local Chinese market hungry for English language training, it is also expanding services in Japanese and Korean language tuition, as well as German and French, according to its chief financial officer, Louis Hsieh. &quot;The demand for private education among the Chinese is surging, with more and more Chinese students wanting to go overseas. And as they get wealthier, they can go overseas because they can afford it,&quot; he said. &quot;More than 95% of our students are Chinese, with many coming from Hong Kong, but we are getting more and more foreigners,&quot; Hsieh said. Some universities have set up joint ventures with their foreign counterparts to launch their own overseas campuses inside China. The University of Nottingham in Ningbo, a city on the east coast, opened in 2005 in conjunction with the local Zhejiang Wanli University. It not only intends to provide a British education for Chinese students, but also a British education for foreigners who are prepared to forgo Britain. They will earn the same Nottingham University degree at a quarter of the cost. There are as many as 10,000 Indian students in China. Some are enrolled at Nottingham&apos;s Ningbo campus, but many are not so lucky. China&apos;s Ministry of Education, concerned that the search for profits were undermining educational standards, recently cracked down on a number of institutes offering tuition to foreign medical students. The ministry provided new rules aimed at guaranteeing quality of education. Only 30 institutes have qualified under the regulations, which not only stipulate that students are competent in English, but also insist on a knowledge of Chinese medicine and the Chinese language. Naturally, there is more at stake for medicine students, where negligent training could cost lives, but where does that leave the vast majority of schools, colleges and training centres? Most of China&apos;s educational institutions seem to operate outside the regulations and even the knowledge of the Ministry of Education. New Oriental&apos;s Louis Hsieh said that there were now more than 30,000 private &quot;short-term&quot; English language schools in China. And while the more prominent among them might have to face scrutiny, most are free to operate however they see fit. None of them are subject to a great deal of Ministry of Education inspection, or to any central government curriculum. With the government concentrating on a number of ambitious programmes aimed at improving educational standards in the countryside, the priorities lie elsewhere. &quot;The short-term training market doesn&apos;t really concern the ministry so much,&quot; Hsieh said.", "tags": ["Tefl", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-26T15:09:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/26/china.uknews4", "sentences": ["So much so that until he took pole position on Monday in the race to lead a fifth of humanity, the party boss of Shanghai was less well known in China than his celebrity wife Peng Liyuan, a folk singer in the People&apos;s Liberation Army&apos;s musical troupe.", "He has twice been called upon to clean up high-profile corruption cases, most recently in Shanghai where the former party boss Chen Liangyu was caught up in a social security fund scandal."], "title": "Most corrupt officials are from poor families but Chinese royals have a spirit that is not dominated by money", "article": "When he was sent to the countryside at 15 and his father was jailed, Xi Jinping learned a lesson in political pragmatism that has helped to carry him to within a step of the pinnacle of power in China. Eschewing the turbulent fervour of the Cultural Revolution in favour of stable growth, he has spent the 30 years since working his way up the Communist party hierarchy. The rise has been unspectacular. So much so that until he took pole position on Monday in the race to lead a fifth of humanity, the party boss of Shanghai was less well known in China than his celebrity wife Peng Liyuan, a folk singer in the People&apos;s Liberation Army&apos;s musical troupe. The stout 52-year-old&apos;s premier position among the &quot;fifth generation&quot; of communist leaders was signalled at the Great Hall of the People on Monday at a ceremony to unveil the new standing committee of the politburo. Introduced in strict hierarchical order, Mr Xi emerged ahead of his rivals, signalling that he is most likely to become the next party leader and president in five years&apos; time. To emphasis his status, Hu Jintao, the president, mentioned his name first in introducing &quot;the relatively young comrades&quot; in the inner sanctum. Despite his pedigree as the son of a high official of the revolutionary era, Mr Xi&apos;s elevation was a surprise to many politburo watchers, but it signals the growing strength of party &quot;princelings&quot; and the diffusion of power inside the world&apos;s biggest political party. Mr Xi was born in Shaanxi province in 1953. His father Xi Zhongxun was a veteran of the revolution who survived the Long March and became a vice-premier. But Mr Xi&apos;s privileged childhood was turned on its head by Mao&apos;s purges. His father spent 16 years in prison. It was only in 1975 that he was released, later becoming an advocate of reform. Like many &quot;intellectual youths&quot; in the Cultural Revolution, Mr Xi was dispatched to the countryside to learn from the peasant masses. It was a bitter experience that helped to shape his views. &quot;In the past when we talked about beliefs, it was very abstract. I think the youth of my generation will be remembered for the fervour of the Red Guard era. But it was emotional. It was a mood. And when the ideals of the Cultural Revolution could not be realised, it proved an illusion,&quot; he told state-run CCTV in 2003. He returned to Beijing to complete the first of his two degrees from the elite Tsinghua University. Unlike most recent politburo members he has a doctorate in law and ideological education. A communist from the age of 21, Mr Xi cut his administrative teeth in the fast-growing provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. Foreign investors and diplomats spoke highly of his English, knowledge of international business practices and ability to get things done. He has twice been called upon to clean up high-profile corruption cases, most recently in Shanghai where the former party boss Chen Liangyu was caught up in a social security fund scandal. Officials such as Mr Xi have also come under suspicion because of the advantages they can secure through their family ties, but leading reformers believe they can be a force for change. &quot;Most corrupt officials come from poor families. But Chinese royals like Xi have a spirit that is not dominated by money,&quot; says Li Datong, a former editor who was fired for refusing to toe the line of the propaganda department. Privately, people who have met Mr Xi describe him as open-minded, friendly and not the type to put on airs. In public, his views on policy are largely orthodox. He is less bellicose than other senior officials on Taiwan, which China considers to be a rogue province. But on other matters his speeches have carefully followed the leadership line. Loyalty to the party, a lack of controversy and the ability to please all factions are the main qualities needed to rise inside today&apos;s communist party, according to Nicholas Becquelin of Human Rights Watch. &quot;There are no particular policies associated with Xi,&quot; he says. &quot;If you are tipped to go up the ranks, you have to be as bland as possible with nothing on your record that can attract opposition from rivals.&quot; In contrast to the autocratic rule of Mao Zedong, Mr Hu has had to balance the interests of rich and poor provinces, powerful families and patronage groups in choosing a successor. The favourite to become the next party leader had been Li Keqiang, the party boss of Liaoning who was a protege of Mr Hu&apos;s for more than a decade. But he was too close to the president for the liking of other powerbrokers, such as former president Jiang Zemin, so Mr Xi became the compromise candidate. &quot;His rise is slightly unexpected, but he has broad appeal,&quot; said a European diplomat. His succession is not guaranteed. But if recent precedent is a guide, Mr Xi will probably be president from 2012 to 2022. Before then, he will at least start to become as much of a household name as his wife.

Winning the title in St Petersburg would give either of them a boost towards late qualification, leaving everything to play for in the final Masters Series event beginning in Paris next weekend, from which Andy Roddick withdrew yesterday. The American, one of five men to have qualified for Shanghai, has returned to the United States following his first-round defeat by Fabrice Santoro in Lyon. Murray and Youzhny know it is a long shot. Both have won titles this year - Murray in San Jose, California, and Youzhny in Rotterdam - and ordinarily both would be highly pleased simply to add a second as the season draws to its conclusion. However, the possibility of reaching the TMC in China for the first time will doubtless be on their minds this afternoon. For Murray it was his goal when the year began. By April he had reached No8 in the world and appeared set fair. Then came the crippling injury to his right wrist on the clay courts of Hamburg that ruled him out of the French Open and Wimbledon. The psychological damage was almost as great as the physical and, when the 20-year-old Scot picked up his rackets again in August, he hired a sports psychologist to help him regain his confidence. It worked. This month he reached a final in Metz and then came close to defeating Raphael Nadal, the world No2, in the Madrid Tennis Masters where he played some of his best tennis ever, crushing Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic and Argentina&apos;s Juan Ignacio Chela. Murray has continued this form in St Petersburg, even though yesterday he struggled initially in his quarter-final against Russia&apos;s Dmitry Tursunov before winning 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 in two hours 13 minutes. Murray had defeated him twice in straight sets last year but on this occasion he struggled with his first serve and the Russian piled into his second. Murray was broken to go 4-2 down in the first set, broke back immediately, only to drop his serve again with Tursunov having the opening set done and dusted in 35 minutes. The Russian had chances galore, 14 in the match, to dismantle Murray&apos;s serve and it was to the British No1&apos;s credit that he saved 12 break points, including four in the second set. Once into the tie-break, Murray assumed control, although Tursunov had further chances to swing the match his way in the deciding set. In contrast Murray&apos;s chances were few but, when they arrived, he took full advantage.  &quot;He had so many chances on my serve he probably deserved to win the first two sets,&quot; said Murray. &quot;But I made a lot of great first serves and in the tie-break I won every point on my serve. I also changed my tactics towards the end of the second set, started to play more aggressive and come to the net a bit more.&quot; Youzhny reached the last four when Germany&apos;s Philipp Kohlschreiber retired after losing the first set 6-4. Youzhny, who had lost his previous three matches against the German, was delighted to win and to conserve his energy for today.

Murray opened the match in scorching form, taking the first four games to hint at a comfortable victory over home favourite Youzhny, but eventually had to save two match points on his opponent&apos;s serve and break back from 5-3 down in the final set. It was a remarkable recovery from a man who appeared to have lost his composure altogether as he put alternate forehands into the net and then beyond the baseline as he dropped serve in the fourth game of the set.  By that stage Youzhny, one of Murray&apos;s direct rivals for the remaining places in Shanghai, had already pulled off a similar recovery following a woeful start to the match. After finally holding serve at the third attempt, Youzhny rarely threatened Murray before he forced a first break point in the fourth game of the second set, and didn&apos;t manage to seal a break until the set&apos;s final game, taken with the help of a controversial line call. On set point Youzhny&apos;s shot appeared to have fallen well outside of the court, but an outraged Murray was unable to challenge the decision after using both his Hawk-Eye challenges earlier in the set. Youzhny quickly took control, as Murray continued to stew over the decision, breaking again before saving two break points to take a 4-1 set lead.

I never knew my father and I lost my mother when I was eight years old. One morning, as I dressed for school, my mother showed me how to braid my hair in a special way. She was standing behind me and I felt her hands tremble as her eyes met mine in the mirror. &quot;I should have shown you how to do this for yourself before ... &quot; she said. A catch in her voice alarmed me. Her eyes were over-bright. I could see her biting her lower lip - I realised later she was trying not to cry. My mother told me she had to go to a hospital, for routine tests, and when she returned home we would have a holiday. She walked me to school, as usual, and I waved goodbye through the fence. She was wearing a navy blue blazer and skirt and high heels. I never really saw her again. I was not allowed into the hospital. I caught a glimpse as I stood outside and saw her standing high above, in a 10th-floor window - she was wearing a pink nightgown. She had instructed me on the phone: &quot;I am on the 10th floor - I will be at the fourth window from the left ... You&apos;ll see me ... &quot; A few days later, the nightgown was folded, in a box, in the apartment that we had shared, awaiting shipment to ... I know not where. Neighbours and relatives appeared. Life, as I knew it, had ended. Her death was sudden - only two weeks before we had been on an excursion, and she had hiked with me and rowed a boat across Central Park lake. Her death was incomprehensible. I remember hearing the word &quot;orphan&quot; and I could hardly believe that this word applied to me. The only orphans I knew of were in literature - A Little Princess and The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett - or in the comics: Little Orphan Annie. Would my life take on that grim Victorian plot? Might I be placed in an orphanage? Each dawn &quot;after&quot;, I would wake up as if from a shuddering fall, knowing something horrible has happened. How could I live without my mother? The box of her clothes disappeared: her glasses, her ice skates, her winter and summer clothes, her shoes and slippers - almost everything she had owned was packed up and given away. I hoarded what few items I could - bits of costume jewellery, an ivory heart-shaped pin, her perfume (Fleur de Lys), a sweater, and a special organdy &quot;party&quot; apron. I still have the apron, tucked in my bureau drawer, and sometimes I touch it, to remember. Even today, I sleep in a bedroom with my mother&apos;s portrait on the wall - I feel she watches over me, somehow. The ache has never gone away. I don&apos;t believe anyone who loses a mother or father, or both, at such a young age, will ever truly &quot;get over&quot; it - rather, one is newly defined by it. I ceased to be a child, and became an orphan. Nothing would ever be the same, and I would never again feel as safe as I had when my mother lived. I was fortunate, however, and my mother&apos;s younger brothers, two bachelors, came to my rescue and joined forces to bring me up. I was loved and protected, but it is impossible to relay how much I missed her. There is a delicate period of adjustment - any orphaned child will take quite a while to adjust to being raised by someone else, and there is a period of sickening suspense, before one&apos;s fate is decided, and before a child can acknowledge that an irrevocable tragedy has occurred. In fact, it was weeks before I could acknowledge that she had really died. I think many orphaned children indulge in similar fantasies - I would believe anything but that my mother was dead. This period of magical thinking or denial, whatever one calls it, is common and I believe it may be a natural buffer so that there can be some internal adjustment. The true horror does strike, usually weeks or months later. For me, this occurred while I was away at a summer camp where I had gone in the chaos after my mother&apos;s death. I had saved a &quot;secret charm&quot; for last - I just knew my mother would appear if I summoned her. I became desperate enough to call out to her, alone in the woods, and when she did not appear or answer, I knew. I really knew then that I would never see my mother again. Being an orphan is learning to bear the unbearable. My kind uncles overcame my sorrow but no one could replace my mother. I would imagine seeing her on the street, pulling her Persian lamb coat closed ... hurrying home to me. The grief lessens with time, but never vanishes. I still feel hollow when I see a woman my age accompanying her mother to the theatre, or shopping. While I am a happy person, with much love in my life, there is also the shadow life - haunting me. How different everything would have been. The holidays are happy, but always, always, there is someone missing and I silently mark my mother&apos;s birthday, August 14, and I shiver on the date she died - June 22. The way I mourned my mother was to remember her. I remember the exact moment I swore never to forget her, at that summer camp. I shut my eyes and concentrated, conjuring her face. I then reviewed all the wonderful moments we had shared - how she surprised me with a kitten in a wrapped gift box - the kitten poking her paws through the air holes - all our weekend outings - how she loved a picnic. I remembered her dancing and singing around our apartment. Part of the grief is that one becomes set apart - when I was a small child I was the only orphan I knew. There was one afternoon when two boys chased me, screaming - &quot;Is it true? Your mother is dead!&quot; I think I was a threat, in some way, a reminder that the unthinkable might occur. Historically, orphans were more common. Epidemics, purges, floods, war - all killed so many young adults that orphaned children were the norm. In other parts of the world famine and disease continue to decimate families. And there are other sorts of &quot;orphans&quot; - children whose parents have not died but who have abandoned them. I adopted two of these &quot;orphans&quot; - Alexandra, now 17, my oldest daughter, is from an orphanage in Romania, and my younger daughter, Jasmine Sou Mei, came from an orphanage in Shanghai. I was more drawn to taking a baby in need than to having children in the usual way. It is obvious that I identify with my daughters - we are all orphans. Perhaps our tender, loving family is sensitised by this condition - I calmed myself by comforting them as babies. I can remember whispering over and over to the little girls, if they cried in the night - &quot;Don&apos;t cry, it&apos;s all right, Mama&apos;s here.&quot; &apos;Their lives haven&apos;t ended too&apos; Edward Davey was four when his father died of Hodgkin&apos;s disease. Eleven years later, his mother too died of cancer, leaving behind 15-year-old Edward and his two brothers. Davey is now the Liberal Democrat MP for Kingston and Surbiton and campaigns for improved services for bereaved children. &quot;The death of my parents was tragic, but in a way I was lucky: after my mother was diagnosed with bone cancer, my brothers and I looked after her and we got to talk for a long time. I didn&apos;t need counselling because my mother had been able to prepare me for a life without her. &quot;The children of the people who died in Portugal are in a very different situation: Bob and Debbie Fry, and their friend Jean Dinsmore, probably didn&apos;t have a chance to say goodbye. It is crucial that their children receive professional care. They will need someone to listen to them and offer support. Charities like Jigsaw - of which I am on the board - can help: they enable kids who have lost their parents to talk to other bereaved children. Such children need to be shown that their parents had hopes and aspirations for them, that their lives haven&apos;t ended along with their parents&apos;. &quot;Child bereavement services in this country are very good where they exist, but there are not that many of them. It&apos;s part of a very British problem: we don&apos;t always put children first. There is, for example, no obligatory training for teachers on how to deal with children who are bereaved. &quot;Before my dad died, he made his will and chose executors. With the kids in Portugal, the situation could be more complicated, as they are younger and their parents might not have nominated a guardian. The last thing you want is uncles and aunts fighting over them. I&apos;ve learned from my dad: I am going to make a will before my wife and I have our first baby next month. &quot;It might sound odd, but dealing with tragedy at such an early stage can have a positive long-term effect: it teaches you to take responsibility. When my mother was still alive, I tried to get good grades at school to make her proud. Suddenly there was no one to come home and show off to - so why should I bother to do my homework? I remember making my first decision then, just before my O-levels: I&apos;m doing this for myself now, I thought.&quot; \u00b7 Laura Shaine Cunningham is the author of the memoir Sleeping Arrangements, published by Bloomsbury", "tags": ["UK news", "Children"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-27T22:55:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/28/news.sport1", "sentences": ["Those who have not been to Asia before are looking forward not just to this trip, but to the March game, should United qualify, in Shanghai, probably against Bayern Munich."], "title": "Special report: Games without frontiers", "article": "Monday morning, local time, in November 2020 and Manchester United have just landed in Mumbai, where they play Milan in a Champions League match on Wednesday night. The number of fans who travel with them, home and away, has dropped to a couple of hundred since United started playing European games in China, the United States and India, but, even so, a few of those supporters, the wealthier ones with time on their hands, have been here before. Some had a memorable trip when they came to watch Lancashire lose in the World League Twenty20 play-off final two years ago; a dozen or so others were here only three months ago, to watch the 2020 Olympic Games, the first Olympiad to be staged on the subcontinent. The Olympics were a late arrival. There are many, many more attractions for sports fans in this part of the world, because this is where the growth is. The multibillion-pound sports-tourism industry makes travel easy and plenty of United followers have friends who have been over to watch the Indian Grand Prix - now rated the best on the circuit for atmosphere, with three Indian drivers in the world top 10 - the cricket, and the Indian Open, which has seen off the USPGA and become golf&apos;s newest Major. Money talks, especially from Asian banks. Those who have not been to Asia before are looking forward not just to this trip, but to the March game, should United qualify, in Shanghai, probably against Bayern Munich. It makes a change from last year&apos;s jaunts to Miami and Boston. There is talk of Australia joining the circuit, but so far no one in Sydney or Melbourne has been able to come up with the \u00a3100million guarantee for the clubs. And the journey, even on Virgin&apos;s &apos;satellite shuttle&apos;, is that much more tiring. If United were scheduled for a Saturday game - most games kick off at primetime 7pm now - after a midweek trip to Australia, they would be back and ready to play, but ideally they would want a Sunday slot and if they have to buy one it may cost as much as \u00a325m. Talking of the weekend, this will be &apos;the big one&apos; for boxing, the richest four days on the sporting calendar. Not so long ago there were fears that boxing might go under, as UFC grew and grew, but tradition still counts for something even in the 21st century, and the ultimate fighters were seen off. By money, of course. The world&apos;s biggest brewery, still an American company, saw a way to tell the world: &apos;We&apos;ve been around a long time, and we&apos;re the world&apos;s best-selling beer.&apos; So they put in billions of dollars to buy up everyone in boxing and turn back time. There are now eight weight divisions, eight world titles - all sponsored - and everyone who cares will be able to name all eight of them after the Thursday-to-Sunday championships in Las Vegas. The forecasters cannot see how they will be able to afford it, but they said that about the China National Bank deal that gave birth to golf&apos;s world tour - and the booming target-golf circuit - and just look how wrong they were. A fifth major, held in China, looks a certainty now. Of course, &apos;being there&apos; is not what it used to be for those United fans. If you really must fly all the way to India to watch your team, good luck, but hardly anybody does because they are more than happy with their virtual sports studio back home.

Plenty about London&apos;s NFL team; the Pacific islands&apos; rugby play-off that earns the winner a guest spot in the Eight Nations; more headlines about the landmark appeal-court hearing over who owns the rights to cloned racehorses; a big preview to London&apos;s NBA game tomorrow - after beating Boston and Los Angeles in early-season games, they could top the league with victory over Madrid - and the indispensable guide to viewing in the sports room tonight. Andy Murray is in the turbo tennis grand finals in New York. He last played a grand-slam event in 2016, but he is still making a mint on the turbo circuit. No match lasts longer than 45 minutes, the whole thing is over in three days. Worth staying up for... Before you start thinking &apos;What a lot of futuristic, fictional nonsense&apos;, it is worth doing two things. First, listen to what some of the most important people in the sports industry think: not those constrained by working for a specific club or league, or for a governing body who have been around since the 19th century, but those whose job is to be innovative, move fast and gain an edge on their competitors. People with financial clout, people who, whether you agree with them or not, have vision. Second, take yourself back in time. Instead of going forward to 2020, go back 20 years to 1987 and ask yourself this: would anyone have believed it if they had been told what sport would be like in 2007? With so many American sports executives in London over the past week, for today&apos;s NFL game at Wembley, there has been widespread talk about the possibility of Premier League matches being played in the United States. West Ham&apos;s Eggert Magnusson caused a stir when he said: &apos;I can see that happening sooner rather than later - it would be good for the game,&apos; and he has an unlikely ally in Steve Bruce, the Birmingham manager who says, &apos;Anything that promotes the game has to be good. I really can&apos;t see a downside to the idea.&apos; A more likely scenario, given that there would not be such an outcry from fans of all league clubs, is the playing of Champions League matches outside Europe. &apos;That could very easily happen,&apos; says Joe Bailey, who played a key role in bringing the Miami Dolphins to Wembley for today&apos;s ground-breaking game, &apos;if they [Uefa and the clubs] think that, by doing so, they can generate new customers and develop new business relationships. That&apos;s for the strategic planners to try to figure out.&apos; Today&apos;s game is &apos;part of a concerted effort to establish ourselves internationally, going after half-a-dozen key territories to create some level of foundation&apos;, says Alistair Kirkwood, an NFL expansion executive. Why now? &apos;The best time to change is from a position of strength. In a way, when you have full stadiums it is more difficult to justify taking a regular-season game elsewhere, but that&apos;s what you have to do. &apos;What seemed like a whimsical idea a few years ago can now be seen as possible. If there is a business rationale for doing it there will be opportunities to play Champions League games outside Europe.&apos; Miami Dolphins v the New York Giants today is just the start. Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, can see the Super Bowl coming across the Atlantic, too. &apos;There&apos;s a great deal of interest in holding a Super Bowl in London,&apos; Goodell says, &apos;so we&apos;ll be looking at that.&apos; Bailey, who believes the American sports industry is 10 years ahead of the rest of the world, says the Wembley game, the first competitive NFL match played outside North America, is &apos;a foreshadowing of a lot of other things that are going to happen, not just to the NFL but to sports in general. Just think what&apos;s going to happen when India starts getting really active [in sport]. Think of what&apos;s going to happen in China.&apos; American basketball is all too aware of what is happening in China and is making a big marketing push there. &apos;Businesses, whether they are US, multi-nationals, UK, or Asian based, are not talking about borders, that&apos;s the game changer here. It&apos;s a global opportunity,&apos; says Heidi Ueberroth, who heads the worldwide expansion programme of the NBA. Can she see foresee Manchester United playing in Miami? &apos;Sure.&apos; Manu Sawhney is India&apos;s top TV sports executive. As managing director of ESPN Star, Asia&apos;s number-one sports broadcaster, he oversees a company expecting exponential growth. &apos;India is steadily developing into a multi-sports market,&apos; he says. &apos;While cricket continues to grow and is the most popular sport, viewing figures for English soccer have increased by 58 per cent throughout Asia in five years. Other sports, such as motor sport, golf and tennis, are also gaining viewers.&apos; Sawhney is a big fan of Twenty20 cricket, which has transformed the market in India. Women are drawn to Twenty20 far more readily than to longer forms of cricket and the recent World Championship final between India and Pakistan drew an audience of 400 million - 16 times bigger than the best British figures for a sports event. He and other top executives say &apos;short&apos; forms of sport will play a key role in the future and sports will have to adapt. The aims of the main sports remain the same - to score goals, tries, runs and points, or to be first over the line - but the rules have successfully been tweaked in recent years, leading to a faster, more entertaining spectacle, certainly in football and both codes of rugby, and in Test cricket. The biggest changes have been in the packaging and presentation of sport - and in viewers&apos; attention span. &apos;There is an inevitable conflict between what the sports federations want and what the public want,&apos; says Greg Dyke, the former director general of the BBC who was head of sport at ITV earlier in his career. &apos;Governing bodies always put too much emphasis on tradition.&apos; Guy Kinnings, head of golf at IMG, the sports agency and marketing group, predicts: &apos;There will be a growth in short-form golf because people will have even less leisure time by 2018 and golf needs to have a form of the game that allows it to be played in, say, an hour. I&apos;m sure this will be showcased by some of the top pros.&apos; Donald Trump, a keen investor in golf and one of the world&apos;s most famous businessmen, disagrees about &apos;short golf&apos; but sees a big future for the sport. &apos;Golf is very important for a certain group of Americans,&apos; Trump tells Observer Sport. &apos;It&apos;s not like football or baseball, it&apos;s the very high end of the market which advertisers love because they spend a lot of money on product. It&apos;s very important, it&apos;s very influential. Tennis has lost its mojo. Just lost it. Roger Federer may be the greatest player ever, but for some reason tennis is just losing ground.&apos; Maybe tennis must reinvent itself, too. It, like squash, is dabbling with a short-form version. American football is trying to push &apos;Arena Football&apos; - an indoor version of gridiron - as an Olympic sport. The value of live events will increase as viewers&apos; habits change, along with their means of consuming sport. The TV will be displaced by computer screens and there will be no such thing as scheduling as we know it. You will be able to watch Coronation Street whenever you want to - which gives sport a big advantage. &apos;In a world where you can download anything, you can&apos;t download live sport,&apos; Dyke says. &apos;Anything live becomes more important. The price paid by broadcasters will continue to go up.&apos; Sir Martin Sorrell, one of the world&apos;s foremost names in marketing, says: &apos;The power of big sports events will be there forever and they are becoming more, not less, important. There is a growing pool of money that wants them and a very limited number of sufficient quality and size.&apos; Sorrell - who is chief executive of WPP, one of the world&apos;s biggest advertising companies - adds: &apos;What companies are looking for are mass events that have a very strong appeal worldwide.&apos; If there are not enough to go around, but the money is there to &apos;invent&apos; some - as has happened with Twenty20 cricket - who knows what might happen? Back in 1987, no satellite TV company had yet been given a licence to operate, and those that existed, long before Sky&apos;s current conformation, were losing a fortune. There were no millionaire footballers and no paid rugby union players (at least not officially). Test cricket was shown on BBC, or at least home series were - no UK broadcaster had ever screened an England tour live, beyond a single session from Australia in 1983. The total income for all football from TV companies was roughly one tenth of what every single Premier League club is now paid. The highlight of the rugby season was the Five Nations, not Six, and the game was played by doctors and bankers and farmers, who look like matchstick men alongside today&apos;s hulks. Backers of the first World Cup, in New Zealand, lost \u00a31m. At club level, long-forgotten names such as Orrell, London Scottish, West Hartlepool and Moseley would be watched by a few hundred spectators. In tennis, Wimbledon had just made the radical decision to use yellow balls, rather than white ones, and commentators bemoaned the disappearance of wooden rackets. There was little sport on a Sunday, no football on Monday or Thursday, and no pull-out sports sections in the daily and Sunday papers. There was no sign that motor racing would ever stage a grand prix in China, Malaysia, or Turkey, much less a floodlit one in Singapore, as will happen next year. Britain&apos;s top boxer was Barry McGuigan and everyone knew who he was because his fights were on BBC1. In 1987 there was no such thing as the Premier League, and any thought of a Russian, or many Russians, investing in British football - plagued by hooliganism and hated by the Government - would have been dismissed as madness, not least because Russia was a communist country. Foreign players were still a curiosity, and no one knew which teams were in La Liga, never mind who played for them. The Iron Curtain was still there, Germany was split, and nobody in Estonia would have dared dream that their Soviet-run state would be free to play at Wembley as an independent nation, as they did this month. Wembley itself was an old dump that featured, that year, an FA Cup final won by a team who are now in what was then the Second Division (Coventry City) and the following year by a team who no longer exist (Wimbledon). Everton were the Football League champions. To qualify for the European Cup you had to do what Everton did and win the title, though all English clubs were banned from Uefa competition because of the Heysel disaster two years earlier. Teams from Romania, Portugal and Holland were champions of Europe in successive years from 1986-88. The Cup Winners&apos; Cup was a big deal. So were snooker and Saturday afternoon horse racing. Fans were fans, not customers of &apos;the guest experience&apos;. Very few wore replica shirts and most paid on the gate, stood up to watch and expected to be treated like penned cattle. And whoever would have thought Indians would want to watch English football - or, come to that, any football? Now, India is a magnet, as that 400 million Twenty20 audience shows. The newest form of cricket takes another big step next year with the launch of the Indian Premier League, which uses both the Champions League and the NFL as models for its format. Franchises will compete for a first prize of \u00a32.5m. The Commonwealth Games will be held in Delhi in 2010. In the same year the first Indian Grand Prix is expected to take place in the same city, with an Indian team on the grid, backed by the Kingfisher brewery. Golf&apos;s Indian Open will start in February - as part of the European Tour, not the Asian Tour - and other sports are coming up fast. India has never been as keen on football as the rest of Asia, but that is changing. Manchester United are helping to popularise football in India this week, holding a skills camp for more than 5,000 children aged 10-16 at the Nehru Stadium in Goa. Brian McClair, the former United and Scotland star who now heads the club&apos;s academy, is leading the pilot project, which was launched at the invitation of the All India Football Federation (the Indian FA), with the backing of billionaire businessman Sunil Mittal. Manchester United Soccer Schools and Nike are partners in the project. &apos;Investment in cricket and hockey has been going on for many, many years, and this [investment in football] is a very ambitious project,&apos; says McClair. &apos;Sport is a massive part of Indian life, and football can be part of it. It will grow, I&apos;m sure of that.&apos; McClair believes it will be &apos;a minimum of 10 years&apos; before football takes a real hold, but one top player could make a huge difference. Dale Hobson, international development director of Manchester United Soccer Schools, says, &apos;If you had just one Indian player in the Premier League, football would go into the stratosphere here. The scope and scale of Indian football could be colossal.&apos; Vijay Mallya, the man behind the F1 team - which he has named Force India Formula One - is also keen on football and says &apos;it can be as popular as cricket&apos;. he predicts that India &apos;will not only emerge as a global superpower in economic terms, but also in sporting terms, over the next five years&apos;. And not just on the cricket pitch. &apos;We have a very young demographic in India. We produce more than a million graduates a year. They are getting good jobs. They are basically looking for an alternative to cricket, and Formula One meets their aspirational needs. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there&apos;s a humongous increase in television viewership of Formula One. For the sentiments of the Indian people, Formula One was always perceived to be out of reach. Now we have an Indian car on the grid it demonstrates that India has truly arrived.&apos; Nearly half the 1.1 billion population is under 20 and in a few years that figure will be 55 per cent. Over the next year, more than 130 new cable television channels will be launched across the country. There are 200 million mobile phones in use in India and predictions of 600 million within three years. And Indians love to follow sport on their mobiles. &apos;The young take their media habits with them,&apos; Sorrell says. &apos;If you are not part of their habit now you most definitely won&apos;t be in their future.&apos; Two-thirds of all overseas sales of the Premier League are in Asia. The World Cup will surely come to India: Fifa&apos;s Sepp Blatter went to Delhi in April, armed with cliches and describing the country as &apos;the sleeping giant&apos; of world football. Another &apos;sleeping giant&apos; is China, whose population is 150 million more than that of India. The Chinese New Year was watched by a billion people on the state broadcaster CCTV and the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing next year will be seen by 800 million within China alone. There are more mobile phone users than in Britain, America and Germany combined, and 35 million of them followed the last football World Cup via mobile news updates. Basketball, the world&apos;s second most popular team sport after football, is booming, and an estimated 300 million Chinese play it. While India hopes for a footballer to make his name in Europe, China already has a global hero in basketball, the 7ft 6in Yao Ming, who plays for the Houston Rockets. Yao Ming is the iconic figure in the NBA&apos;s push to promote the American game in China. Timothy Chen, one of China&apos;s best known business executives, has just become chief executive of the new Chinese subsidiary, NBA China. He was Microsoft&apos;s top man in China until he resigned last month. As well as negotiating new deals for TV and internet rights, he will work on the possibility of launching a new, NBA-branded league. &apos;We believe the potential of a market with four times the population of the United States ultimately must be at least what the United States is,&apos; says Adam Silver, the NBA&apos;s deputy commissioner. Asian money is also behind a radical plan in boxing. The new president of the governing body of amateur boxing (AIBA), Ching-Kuo Wu, of Taiwan, wants to set up a world league. Amateurs would move on from Olympic glory straight into the professional league, cutting out the promoters. Tom Virgets, chairman of USA Boxing, says, &apos;We are talking about an investment of $200m to $300m... to make this happen.&apos; The Asians are confident they can find the backers. For now, though, despite all the potential in Asia, America dominates. &apos;The sports industry in the US is $300billion and growing,&apos; says Miami Dolphins&apos; Joe Bailey. Money from NBC still props up the Olympics. The network has paid $2.2bn for the 2010 and 2012 Games, around two-thirds of the IOC&apos;s TV income, despite evidence that the audience is ageing and, according to Dyke, declining. The big team sports appear to have the edge over the Olympics. Today, Miami Dolphins supporters have a taste of globalisation, and it has not gone down well. Dolphins season-ticket holders have only eight home games a season and many lament the loss of this weekend&apos;s prime fixture. &apos;It&apos;s bullshit!&apos; wrote one of many irate Dolphins bloggers in Florida. &apos;It&apos;s all about more dollars for the owners and the NFL.&apos; Others are so outraged at the game being switched to London that they have started a petition to have Goodell sacked as NFL commissioner. &apos;Many fans are upset about the proposed outsourcing of American football games in general,&apos; says a statement on Miami fans&apos; anti-globalisation, anti-Goodell website. &apos;We welcome all [fans] who are opposed to outsourcing of any major league sporting events to join us.&apos; Those are views with which British sport fans might soon empathise.

Even though the seven-times world champion had retired, the feeling was that the Australian Grand Prix would be another processional bore. The start might be worth watching before either returning to bed or settling into the morning paper. Raikkonen, Schmikenen; what did it matter who was in this race? The result would be decided at the first corner. True enough, Kimi Raikkonen would start his Ferrari from pole and lead all the way. The laconic Finn would eventually take the title at well past the eleventh hour, but events at Melbourne&apos;s first corner were to spark the realisation that the coming season might be very different to the dozen or so that had gone before. In the midst of the jostling pack, the driver of a silver McLaren-Mercedes was laying down a marker by daring to - wait for it - overtake another car. Two cars, in fact. This was Lewis Carl Hamilton&apos;s first race in F1 but he seemed to be treating it as merely another event in his highly successful career. Overtake? There&apos;s a gap, so why not? The fact that he had passed his much-vaunted team-mate, reigning champion Fernando Alonso, was both good and bad. This was the start of a truly remarkable debut for Hamilton, one that would carry him to within heartbreaking proximity of a world championship and revive the interest of a previously jaded audience. It was also the first sign of a fraught season for Hamilton&apos;s boss. Ron Dennis aged noticeably in 2007 but it had nothing to do with the CEO of McLaren turning 60 in June. What was supposed to be a dream season had turned into an unimaginable nightmare. Accusations of cheating had been levelled - but not proven - against one of the most clinically correct teams in Formula One. McLaren were charged with spying on their great rival, Ferrari, a serious enough claim in itself but one that exacerbated an already disintegrating relationship between Dennis and one of his drivers. When Alonso joined McLaren for 2007, the assumption was that he would clinch his third consecutive title. He would have done exactly that but for the emergence of Hamilton, who would captivate the world with performances that went far beyond anything achieved previously by a novice in such a difficult and demanding sport. Alonso may have been unprepared for such a challenge but even Dennis, Hamilton&apos;s mentor for the previous eight years, was pleasantly surprised by such an astonishing debut. The frustration for the McLaren boss was that circumstances, largely of his own making, would prevent him from savouring what should have been the proudest and most memorable season of an F1 career spanning 25 years. Instead of enjoying victory at the end of a dominant performance, Dennis looked as if he had been beaten up. The McLaren headquarters on the outskirts of Woking has no equal in F1. The semi-circular building, designed by Sir Norman Foster and built at an over-budget cost of \u00a3200m, is an immaculate monument to Dennis&apos;s craving for perfection. This curving monolith of glass, steel and chrome is far removed from the traditional motor racing image of workbenches and girlie calendars. In December 2006 Dennis addressed an informal gathering of the British media around a large oval table in the boardroom. His intention was to win their support when dealing with the arrival of his young protege in such a high-profile arena. The start of the 2007 season may have been three months away but Dennis was anxious about the exceptional interest in a 21-year-old who had won championships in every junior category he had entered. &apos;We will bend over backwards to be cooperative and fulfil the media&apos;s wishes for both Fernando and Lewis,&apos; said Dennis. &apos;But we have dug as deep as we can possibly dig within our own organisation and we are really, really going to try hard to win races. And that means that, when it comes to the drivers, we are going to try to create the best environment for them to succeed.&apos; In other words, media access to Hamilton would be limited. It was obvious that Dennis, having had the foresight to spot Hamilton&apos;s potential at the age of 13, was determined not to have progress at such a crucial stage ruined by a section of the F1 establishment that is, in his view, a necessary evil at best and an infuriating and potentially dangerous nuisance at worst. Dennis&apos;s fixation with an overactive media would reach such a pitch that he would not be aware of treacherous developments within his own team; events that would have a more devastating effect on McLaren than the best efforts of the most wilful and wayward journalist. Mike Coughlan was McLaren&apos;s chief designer. The title is deceiving since it conveys the sense of one man having complete control of the shape of the McLaren F1 car. In fact, Coughlan was overseeing the general design concept while assimilating information from various specialist departments such as aerodynamics, chassis design and construction, electronics, engine manufacture and its installation in the car. Dennis had made much of a so-called matrix management system that was horizontal rather than pyramid in form, thus allowing openness and understanding between every section of the company. It was a structure that was about to be questioned and ridiculed in public, never mind within the company itself. A talented 48-year-old, Coughlan had learned his trade with various teams, among them Benetton (since renamed Renault), where he had worked with Nigel Stepney, one of the team&apos;s leading mechanics. Stepney went on to join Ferrari, where he brought his extensive skills to bear in the reorganisation of a team that, in 1993, was in considerable disarray. Stepney knew things could only get better with the arrival at Ferrari of Ross Brawn, the former Benetton technical director who would play the leading role in raising Ferrari&apos;s standards to match those of Michael Schumacher, the driver with whom Brawn and Stepney had worked when winning two championships at Benetton. When Schumacher, having won five more world titles with Ferrari, retired at the end of last year and Brawn took a sabbatical, the restructuring of Ferrari&apos;s technical department did not meet Stepney&apos;s approval. While not expecting to assume Brawn&apos;s role, Stepney was not impressed when Ferrari gave that title to someone who had previously been in charge of human resources and appeared to know little about the necessary technicalities. Relations between Stepney and Ferrari were about to go into steep decline. On 1 February, Stepney made the mistake of telling the British magazine Autosport that he wished to take a year off. &apos;I&apos;m not currently happy with the situation within the team,&apos; he said, &apos;I really want to move forward with my career and that&apos;s something that&apos;s not happening right now.&apos; Ferrari refused his request for time off and, three weeks later, Stepney was given responsibility for Team Performance Development, a role that would not involve travelling to the races. What had so far been a domestic issue became more serious when, in June, the district attorney in Modena, near Ferrari&apos;s Italian headquarters, opened a criminal investigation following a formal complaint by Ferrari over Stepney&apos;s conduct. While the precise details were not revealed, the Italian newspapers were soon carrying stories connecting Stepney with sabotage. It was alleged that powder had been found in the fuel tank of a car prior to the Monaco Grand Prix on 27 May [see panel on page 71]. Stepney denied charges that, to most people involved in F1, seemed unlikely. Stepney&apos;s intricate knowledge of a sophisticated grand prix car is such that, if he had sabotage in mind, something more devious than powder in a fuel tank would have been employed. However, Stepney was implicated in the exposure of Ferrari for using a rule-bending car in the first race of the season. This, in turn, would lead to the uncovering of a spy scandal that would rock McLaren to its core. The final performance of an F1 car is governed largely by the passage of air over and under it. These laws of aerodynamics dictate that the lower the car runs to the ground, the faster it will go. There are myriad restrictions imposed by the technical regulations, one of which prohibits certain parts of the bodywork from moving in order to gain a performance advantage. The floor of an F1 car is a critical area and it was believed that Ferrari had a device that allowed the floor of their car to flex more than it should when at speed, but which was perfectly legal when measured while the car was stationary. McLaren asked the governing body of motor sport, the FIA, for a clarification. The part in question was banned after the FIA&apos;s scrutineers deemed that the technical regulations were being pushed too far. By then, Ferrari had already won the first race in Melbourne. As the season began to unfold, and with it the spy scandal, the tricky question of Ferrari winning a race with a car that was subsequently found technically illegal would be overtaken by the fact that McLaren knew about the ruse in the first place. At the time, McLaren&apos;s actions were put down to the credible fact that engineers study their rivals&apos; cars intently and McLaren&apos;s educated guesswork over the Ferrari floor had been proved correct. That view would change dramatically four months later when Stepney&apos;s alleged part in feeding information to McLaren was raised. However, in the meantime, far greater importance was being attached to the actual racing and the remarkable progress of Lewis Hamilton. Melbourne opened the season and the first photo call for the McLaren drivers involved a stunt with the team&apos;s main sponsor, Vodafone. A fast dinghy swept Alonso and Hamilton towards St Kilda Beach. As they came ashore, the sun appeared to shine even more brightly on McLaren as Alonso said he was looking forward to his new challenge and Hamilton explained how honoured he was to be racing alongside someone of Alonso&apos;s experience and quality. Both drivers meant every word. Their relationship was destined never to be as harmonious again. The racing season was barely five seconds old when the rot began to set in. Alonso had qualified ahead of Hamilton but, calm as you like, the novice ran round the outside of his more experienced team-mate at the first corner. Alonso eventually finished ahead of Hamilton, but only thanks to a more favourable pit-stop strategy. Either way, Hamilton&apos;s debut was nothing short of sensational for a rookie, the best since Jacques Villeneuve in a Williams almost won his first grand prix at the same circuit in 1996. Alonso was quickly aware that his younger partner might not be a pushover. By Monaco, in May, he was sure of it. Hamilton had finished on the podium at every race, from Melbourne, through Malaysia to Bahrain and Spain, his efforts quickly winning praise from seasoned campaigners such as former world champion Niki Lauda. &apos;The guy is good,&apos; said Lauda. &apos;He&apos;s been quick everywhere, on all sorts of track so far and he withstood pressure from Raikkonen in his second race in Malaysia. Now we need to see what he can do at Monaco, which is a completely different challenge.&apos; Hamilton not only finished second on the streets of Monte Carlo but he also had the audacity to claim the team had given Alonso preferential treatment, thanks to the timings of their pit stops - this was unavoidable because both drivers could not come in at the same time. That victory put Alonso back at the top of the championship. But not for long. Two weeks later in Canada, the inevitable happened; Hamilton claimed his first pole position and then won a race in which Alonso made the sort of mistakes observers had expected from the novice. When the Englishman repeated the result seven days later in the United States, Alonso&apos;s frustration at being unable to beat his team-mate in a straight fight manifested itself as, towards the end of one lap, he veered towards the pit lane and shook his fist at the McLaren team management. Although neither driver was saying much in public at this stage, the former McLaren driver, Alain Prost, recognised the warning signs. He knew all about disputes within this team, having been at war with Ayrton Senna in 1988 and 1989. &apos;I think now having two equal cars within the same team is a mistake,&apos; Prost told El Pais newspaper. &apos;In the end it will hurt them [McLaren] because it generates too much tension.&apos; Hamilton was destined to lead the championship from here until the last race in Brazil but, several times, it seemed as though it would be taken from him as this increasingly bizarre season went from one crisis to another. Difficult though it was to believe, the story connecting Nigel Stepney with sabotage became minor news just before the British Grand Prix in July when it was revealed that a 780-page Ferrari dossier had been found in the home of Mike Coughlan. This detailed document revealed everything about the 2007 Ferrari and the team&apos;s modus operandi. The pair&apos;s friendship made it easier to work out how it had come into Coughlan&apos;s possession than to determine just what McLaren might have done with such sensitive information - but that did not stop Ferrari from seizing the chance to destabilise their rival. Ferrari expressed outrage when an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris in July agreed that McLaren held Ferrari information but could not prove that any of it had been used to McLaren&apos;s advantage. This supported Dennis&apos;s view that Coughlan had acted unilaterally and the team knew next to nothing about his actions. No action was taken and the case appeared to have been closed - only for Dennis inadvertently to reopen it thanks to the petulant actions of Alonso. The Hungarian Grand Prix will go down as the low point in Dennis&apos;s season - possibly his entire career - when both his drivers used self-interest to flout team instructions. Hamilton would not let Alonso move ahead as planned during qualifying, the Spaniard extracting revenge by delaying Hamilton in the pit lane. Alonso was angered both by his own subsequent five-place grid penalty and by Hamilton escaping punishment and taking over from him on pole as a result. He threatened to reveal the content of emails showing Ferrari information if Dennis did not provide the preferential treatment that he continued to believe was his due. Alonso later retracted his angry words but not before Dennis, who previously knew nothing about the emails, had informed the FIA of this development in his spirit of openness and honesty. Sensing McLaren were more deeply involved in the Ferrari scandal than Dennis had earlier claimed, the FIA reconvened the World Motor Sport Council on 13 September. After an all-day sitting and powerful legal arguments from all sides, the council found that McLaren were not guilty of incorporating Ferrari&apos;s details in their car, the MP4/22. But it was agreed that possession of the information had bestowed McLaren with a &apos;significant sporting advantage&apos;. For this, McLaren were stripped of their championship points and fined $100m (\u00a349.2m), a record amount for any indiscretion, never mind a charge characterised by phrases such as &apos;insufficient evidence&apos;, &apos;impossible to quantify&apos; and &apos;some degree of advantage was confirmed&apos;. The hearing had revealed that Dennis, admired for his management skills, actually knew less about what was going on within his team than he thought he did. This was just as damaging as the public exposure of his apparent inability to cope with headstrong superstars, something Dennis had managed when he ran Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna, drivers closer to his age at the time, but an attribute that was clearly no longer relevant in 2007. The breakdown of Dennis&apos;s relationship with Alonso was made clear in a transcript of the hearing on 13 September. &apos;We are not on speaking terms, but that does not matter,&apos; said Dennis. &apos;We have not had any conversations since that point [Hungary]. In Fernando&apos;s mind, there is the firm belief that our policy, whereby each driver receives equal treatment, does not properly reflect his status as World Champion.&apos; Dennis also revealed McLaren had asked Alonso to attend the Paris hearing. &apos;Mr Alonso is not here because he does not want to be here,&apos; said Dennis. &apos;He does not speak to anyone much. He is a remarkable recluse for a driver. He is not here by choice. Moreover, he said he had other things to do by previous arrangement. I cannot force him to come.&apos; Dennis, previously respected for his integrity, had also dismayed the media by being economic with the truth when foolishly attempting to defend Alonso&apos;s actions in the pit lane in Hungary. None the less, Dennis had earned widespread sympathy for the manner in which the so-called spy drama had been blown out of proportion, a notion that did not have the support of Max Mosley. The president of the FIA claimed that McLaren had got off lightly and the drivers were fortunate not to have been stripped of their championship points. Mosley went further by suggesting that if Hamilton won the title, it would be tainted and, in any case, McLaren had polluted both this and future championships, the implication being that McLaren might use Ferrari information on their 2008 car. If Mosley&apos;s remarks were unpresidential, then the son of Sir Oswald Mosley became deeply offensive when answering trenchant criticism of the FIA by Sir Jackie Stewart. Mosley referred to the triple world champion and winner of 27 grands prix as &apos;a certified half-wit&apos; who dressed &apos;like a 1930s music-hall man&apos;, a reference to Stewart&apos;s penchant for tartan trousers and wearing hats bearing allegiance to RBS, with whom the Scotsman had an ambassadorial role. Mosley&apos;s extraordinary on-the-record outburst was the talk of the paddock when the teams met in the shadow of Mount Fuji for the Japanese Grand Prix. This would be the beginning of the season&apos;s last phase, moving from Japan to China and, finally, Brazil. It seemed no further drama could be in store but fickle weather at Fuji changed all that. Hamilton won a race run in atrocious conditions and Alonso crashed, thus leaving the championship 12 points in the Englishman&apos;s favour ahead of Alonso and Raikkonen. Then, four days after the event, the FIA decided to examine Hamilton&apos;s driving at Fuji. Twenty hours would pass from the moment that word of the investigation was leaked until its conclusion. During this time, the British media, waiting for practice to start in Shanghai, were drip-fed sketchy information - notably with the irrelevant discussion of YouTube footage - that was enough to cause panic on the sports pages over Hamilton&apos;s championship. The stewards, having felt no need to investigate Hamilton&apos;s behaviour in Japan, found he was not at fault. In the meantime, F1 had hit the headlines yet again and, in the process, the sport had been damaged by understandable claims of incompetence. This had been yet another test for Hamilton and, once again, he had come through it with his customary degree of equanimity. While expressing dismay at recent events, he managed to contain himself and yet indicate that he was not prepared to be trifled with. &apos;I just think it&apos;s a real shame for the sport,&apos; he said. &apos;Formula One&apos;s supposed to be about hard, fair competition. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve tried to do this year, just be fair. There&apos;s been some real strange situations this year where I&apos;m made to look the bad person. If this is the way it&apos;s going to keep going it&apos;s not somewhere I really want to be.&apos; Even Ferrari boss Jean Todt, in the midst of continually pouring scorn on McLaren and that team&apos;s achievement, found time to recognise Hamilton&apos;s achievement. &apos;Normally a very talented driver in their first year in F1 doesn&apos;t drive for a winning team with a winning car,&apos; he said. &apos;That was the opportunity he had and he used it very well. We can only have respect and admiration for what he has achieved this year.&apos; Hamilton, whose progress had been almost blemish-free, then made a catastrophic error by entering the pit lane too quickly during the Chinese Grand Prix and sliding into a gravel trap and retirement. The team, dithering over the changeable weather and leaving Hamilton on track too long on worn tyres before calling him in for that fateful pit stop, had assisted his mistake. Yet afterwards, Hamilton found time to speak to his mechanics and shake hands with the team management operating at the pit wall before making a quiet departure while the race continued. His dignified attitude was in stark contrast to Alonso who, 24 hours before, had flung his crash helmet across the garage and smashed an office door from its hinges after failing to match Hamilton during qualifying. This was Alonso&apos;s persecution complex in full flow as the Spaniard continued to disappoint many of his followers. It was further evidence that Alonso, brilliant driver that he is, cannot cope with being beaten. Despite McLaren&apos;s tactical faux pas in China, Hamilton remained the mathematical favourite, particularly when he claimed a front-row starting place in Brazil, ahead of both Alonso and Raikkonen. But this bizarre season was not yet over. Hamilton, legitimately boxed in at the start by the pole position Ferrari of Felipe Massa, lost his cool briefly when not only Raikkonen jumped ahead but Alonso too. Going into the fourth corner, Hamilton attempted a hasty move on his team-mate, only to run wide and drop to eighth place. All was not lost. Hamilton could surely work his way into position to score enough points during the remaining 70 laps. Then his luck ran out. After 16 races of bullet-proof reliability, Hamilton&apos;s car let him down. The electronic gearbox suddenly selected neutral. This had never happened before in a grand prix. By the time the system had rebooted itself, Hamilton was at the back of the field. He would stage a strong recovery to seventh, but it was not enough. Raikkonen had taken his sixth win of the season to become 2007 world champion. With Alonso finishing third, a single point covered the first three drivers. Or so we thought. Six hours after the finish, the race stewards had dismissed a claim that the cars finishing fourth, fifth and sixth had been running illegal fuel. If they had been thrown out, Hamilton would have been promoted to fifth - and become world champion. With so much at stake, McLaren said they were considering an appeal. Hamilton had lost, and yet he had won. Sir Jackie Stewart preferred to discuss Hamilton&apos;s star quality rather than commenting on either Mosley&apos;s invective or the vagaries of the championship that had helped make Hamilton great. In particular, Stewart was referring to Hamilton&apos;s world profile after a sensational debut in Australia and victories in Canada, the United States and Japan. &apos;Lewis is involved in a branch of the motor industry with its connections with tyre, fuel and oil companies,&apos; said Stewart. &apos;That makes motor racing the biggest capital investment sport in the world. It will help lift Hamilton onto the same level, perhaps above that of Roger Federer and Tiger Woods. Lewis is doing it in such a polished way that he could turn out to be the biggest earner in world sport. And the great thing is that he is British. We&apos;ve never really had a truly global superstar before, but we&apos;ve definitely got one now.&apos; That single fact alone has helped F1 rise far above the rancour and suspicion that has been part of a hugely dramatic and memorable season. Ron Dennis will be one of the few who wishes he could turn back the clock. \u00b7 Maurice Hamilton is The Observer&apos;s motor sport correspondent and an F1 commentator for BBC Radio Five Live", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula one 2007"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-27T23:22:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/oct/28/michaelwhitespoliticalblog19", "sentences": ["Among the world&apos;s 25,000 universities it is ranked No 25 by the smart Shanghai Jiao-Tong university league table and has 20 Nobel laureates."], "title": "Michael White's political blog: October 28", "article": "West London, Sunday morning: I hope you remembered to put the clocks back. But should you have done so? Politicians often bottle this issue. The FT pundit, John Kay, argued the other day that, since most of us are not longer governed by agricultural habits or the lack of electrical lighting, it would be smarter to put them forward not backwards - further forward at that. Why so? Because the annual return to GMT - and its continental variations affecting 300 million Europeans - means that some of us will still be abed in relative daylight and be caught by darkness in late afternoon when more of us are up and about. An Englishman called William Willett dreamed up what Americans call daylight saving (their clocks go back next weekend) 100 years ago. It soon caught on, deployed by both sides in World War I. But politicians are wary of it and - in our tall thin island - the Scots get cross. I can already hear Alex Salmond holding forth at this weekend&apos;s triumphant party conference in Aviemore about the English stealing Scotland&apos;s daylight. True, but only up to a point. A crossbench peer and amateur astrologer called Lord Tanlaw got short shrift the last time (2006) he called for double summer time in summer and a one-hour forward movement of clocks in winter. An experiment was tried in 1968-71, but might be worth another go if the government (full of Scots) changed its mind. It&apos;s easier in France - it&apos;s a hexagon. Many of the FT&apos;s wealthy City readers will be unaffected since nowadays they have to start work so early in our globalised financial economy. So it was good to read that Peter Durose, Tesco&apos;s \u00a3250,000 a year head of fresh produce purchase, has given up his successful but time-poor 14-hour-a-day career to open an organic British fruit and veg store in a Hertfordshire village. Instead of selling \u00a33 mn worth of apples a week, he knows sells them at 40p a pound. There are several excellent jokes in the Sunday papers. including the Sunday Times which is not famous for its sense of humour. It accuses Mark Thompson, top man at the BBC, of calling Tessa Jowell &apos;&apos;Mrs Shit for Brains&apos;&apos; when she was culture secretary and he was at Channel 4. Hardly wit in the Oscar Wilde class, but the joke ties in young Tess&apos;s wholesome response. &apos;&apos;I would stake my life on the fact that Mark never, ever said that about me. He invited me to his 50th birthday party,&apos;&apos; she told the paper. Innocence is like armour plate, a protective shield you can&apos;t penetrate. The paper&apos;s account of the clam dredged from the Atlantic seabed off Iceland and found to be 405 years old is also enhanced by the fact that the little chap was promptly named Ming. Unfair to Sir Ming, late leader of the Lib Dems, I hear you cry ? Perish the unkind thought. It is named after the Chinese dynasty of that name which came to power about time the mollusc was born (are they born?). How do we know how old Ming (alas, he also died when disturbed) was? You count the layers in its shell under a microscope. The Sunday Times also reports that newly declassified documents show that Henry Kissinger was advised by State Department officials in the mid-70s that diplomats on the scene did not much rate the chances of the new Tory leader, one Margaret Thatcher. &apos;&apos;Unfortunately for her prospects of becoming a national, as distinct from party leader, she has over the years acquired a distinctly upper middle class personal image,&apos;&apos; said one memo which also noted her plumy voice, &apos;&apos;quick, if not profound, mind&apos;&apos; and tendancy to be patronising. All fair enough, except that they missed the point; as an Establishment outsider and a woman Thatcher could do things the chaps couldn&apos;t. Harvard-educated chaps in the diplomatic couldn&apos;t spot that any more than their Oxbridge counterparts of the period could.  That, incidentally, is why Monty Python sketches are still funny, but still shockingly misogynistic. But a lot of diplomatic telegrams, especially from grander embassies (some of the small ones are terrific) are guff, as FoI requests nowadays often demonstrate. It comes from reading the local newspapers. The same Americans seemed to think that Jacques Chirac, then an up and coming French political rascal, would better serve US interests. Ho hum By coincidence yesterday I attended a &apos;&apos;40 Years On&apos;&apos; fund-raising lunch (it wasn&apos;t called that) at my old college, UCL off London&apos;s Euston Rd. UCL now has 4,300 staff - about the number of students in my day - and has touching on 20,000 students this autumn.  Among the world&apos;s 25,000 universities it is ranked No 25 by the smart Shanghai Jiao-Tong university league table and has 20 Nobel laureates. Not bad. The last time I attended a bash there the speaker was Jonathan Ross, who was touchingly grateful for the opportunites UCL opened for him (it certainly did!). So are we all. An ex-diplomat among our number yesterday complained over lunch at the way the Blair-Brown government has slashed the Foreign Office budget and piled what will soon by \u00a38 bn a year to spend by Dfid, the department for international development.  &apos;&apos;It was done to placate Clare Short,&apos;&apos; someone else tells me. Not fair, but Douglas Alexander whose Dfid budget grows and grows is more of a Brown favourite than Ms Short ever was his or TB&apos;s. Jane Fenoulhet, a delightful 20th century Dutch literature specialist who sits next to me, reveals that the Dutch-speaking Flemings whose taxes support the French-speaking Walloon south of deeply-divided Belgium, have what amounts to an embassy in London. Didn&apos;t know that. She is also hopeful that Afrikaaner literature will be better known in the wider world now that the taint of apartheid has been lifted from South Africa. The Dutch took the Cape from the Portuguese and lost it to the British after 1815. But settlers were calling themselves Afrikaan a century earlier and claim theirs is the only authentic white language - not a mere dialect but created - not imported into Africa. A sensitive claim.  Jane says the Boers discarded the &apos;&apos;Mother country&apos;&apos; stuff with the Netherlands long ago - as British ex-colonies only lately did. But ties are ties. UCL has fourth generation Hong Kong Chinese in its law department and yesterday&apos;s guest from furthest away, a Nigerian oil engineer, flew in from Lagos - and will fly home today. Footnote: I see it is being routinely held against Gordon Brown that Speaker Martin &apos;&apos;rebuked&apos;&apos; him last week after accusing David Cameron of &apos;&apos; misleading people&apos;&apos; over his interpretation of the Gould report into the mess made of Scots ballot papers on May 3. As Brown tried to explain above the hub-bub all the main parties sought to put their convenience ahead of voter comprehensive in designing the ballot paper for Scotland, But Labour was in charge - Mr Alexander actually - so it&apos;s mainly Labour &apos;s fault. But what the Speakers said on Wednesday (Col 285) was : &apos;&apos; Order. Let me consult ( Hon Members:&apos;&apos; Withdraw!). I call for temperate language.&apos;&apos;  It is clear from context that the plea was directed at everyone who was bellowing at the time - quite possibly GB among them. But when the media turns against someone it&apos;s hard to reverse the Gadarene flight. PS: No, I don&apos;t know whether the Royal blackmail allegations were serious or a scam. But I suspect we will all know quite soon.

Murray will need a good showing in the Paris Masters next week to make up the necessary ground on eighth-placed Tommy Haas, but his cause received a welcome boost with victory over Verdasco, who produced an erratic display that belied his world ranking of 30.

Murray suffered a momentary loss of concentration when a line-call challenge went against him in the next game, but recovered from 0-30 with some powerful serving to consolidate his advantage. That proved a key moment for the Scot, who maintained the pressure on the increasingly erratic Spaniard with some relentless hitting until, at 4-2, a trio of backhand errors by Verdasco yielded a second break. In the next game, Murray sealed the set with an ace.

Indeed, there is even a case to be made that the history of the city - from the French Revolution of 1789 to riots in the suburbs of November 2005, via the Commune of 1870 and the student revolt of May 1968 - is no more than one long argument. This is, after all, the city where sitting at cafe tables, smoking fags, drinking coffee or booze, and planning to destroy &apos;society as we know it&apos; was first invented and then made into an art form. I first came here in the Eighties and fell in love immediately with the famous Parisian culture of la contestation (basically an intellectual French justification for having a belting row, usually accompanied by drink) and I have been here on and off ever since, writing books on the city and its people, teaching French (mainly Parisian) literature and always enjoying my immersion into a world where - from the Glorious Revolution to the recent riots - intellectual violence is never that far away from the real thing. But, in recent years, the talk at cafe tables has turned from arguing revolt and revolution to much more worldly matters. Formerly so-called &apos;intellectual quarters&apos; - such as Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and Od\u00e9on - have become gentrified to the extent that few ordinary Parisians can afford to live there. At the cafe tables where Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir once held court, the talk is of property prices and holidays in the Maldives. Except for the surly waiters, still faithful to the long Parisian tradition of grumpy service, you could easily be in South Kensington - a posh and soulless inner-city enclave for the international super-rich. Across town, in the north-eastern edges of the city, where ordinary Parisians can still just about afford a beer, the talk is, in contrast, focused more often on the mundane realities of city life. More precisely, Parisians are asking whether their city has improved since Nicolas Sarkozy came to power as President in May, promising to rejuvenate a city that in the past decade or so has become a byword for economic stagnation and racial tension. As the Eurostar links improve, Paris is emerging as the hub of a new Europe, with high-speed international links to Germany, Italy and Spain. As such, the city is once again in the kind of central role in Europe that it has always assumed to be its destiny. At the same time, unlike the competing cities of Barcelona, Berlin or Milan, Paris has not been forced to reinvent itself since the Sixties. There is therefore none of the architectural daring that characterises the new Berlin or the truly globalised designer culture of Barcelona. Indeed, after long years of political and cultural stagnation, the big question is whether tired old Paris - once so proud of its status as the so-called the &apos;Capital of the 19th Century&apos; - is even fit for purpose in the 21st century. The problem is that Paris is still beautiful. The city centre is still all 18th-century elegance on the Right Bank - the heart of the heaving nightlife quartier of the Marais is still centred on h\u00f4tels particuliers from that period - and a pleasing jumble of medieval alleyways and long, 19th-century boulevards on the Left Bank. When the Seine is shrouded in autumn mist on the Pont Louis-Philippe, there is possibly no more beautiful or evocative place on earth. But for many Parisians, this kind of picture-postcard scene is precisely the problem. This is all very well for tourists, they argue, but there is a greater danger that, as property prices escalate beyond the reach of ordinary Parisians, the centre of Paris is being left to rich foreigners and inherited wealth. Old Paris is no more, argue social commentators in the pages of serious left-leaning quality journals such as Le Nouvel Observateur and Lib\u00e9ration, and it has been replaced by &apos;Paris Ville-Mus\u00e9e&apos; - Paris as a museum, a place with no living substance. The Marais has been one of the key victims in this process. The area is known as one of the gay capitals of Europe, but its cosmopolitanism is also its undoing. &apos;One of the problems with the Marais is not that it&apos;s gay but that it lacks character,&apos; says the artist Philippe Blondez, editor of the uber-hip art and design journal Bil Bo K, who has his office in the rue des Archives at the centre of the gay Marais. &apos;You can feel too easily that it is just an international gay ghetto. In fact, it&apos;s just like Christopher Street in New York or Old Compton Street in London - it&apos;s fun but its not especially Parisian. You wonder now, in fact, where you can find real Paris. And if we will ever see it again.&apos; In the same vein, across town, Frederika Fenollabbate mourns the slow death of the quartiers chauds (the red-light districts) of the city. Frederika is an up-and-coming novelist who specialises in wildly erotic and elegant texts (her book Apolline Francoeur is a particularly good example). &apos;It is impossible to find good group sex in this city now,&apos; she says, as we eat lunch in Les Bourbons, an ultra-chic restaurant behind the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, where Sarkozy was known to snog and row with C\u00e9cilia. &apos;I think the rave and techno movements were good in the Nineties for introducing hardcore club culture to Paris. But at the same time its oldest traditions of clandestine eroticism started to die.&apos; Worse still has been the influx of well-heeled and youngish upper-middle-class families into the areas of eastern and north-eastern Paris that belonged traditionally to the old working-class. This socioeconomic group, whose members are usually liberal or left-leaning, are called &apos;bourgeois-boh\u00e8mes&apos;, or &apos;bobos&apos; - a term that is almost always followed by an accompanying sneer. &apos;The gentrification of Paris is a reality which is creating bad consequences everywhere,&apos; says Luis de Miranda, a 36-year old editor and novelist who lives in the 13th arrondissement (a place he still reckons is just about free from gentrification). &apos;But the biggest thing is the way it has changed people&apos;s mentalities, the way that they look at the city.&apos; Luis then points out that we are drinking in a bar named for a famous phrase of Arletty - the actress who was the archetypal Parisian working-class girl, an equivalent to Barbara Windsor&apos;s &apos;cockney sparrer&apos;. On the bridge opposite the bar, in the classic Thirties film H\u00f4tel du Nord, Arletty uttered on this bridge the famous lines: &apos;Atmosph\u00e8re? Est-ce que j&apos;ai une gueule d&apos;atmosph\u00e8re?&apos; - &apos;Atmosphere? Do I look like the sort of bird who goes for atmosphere?&apos; - to Louis Jouvet, who was trying to seduce her by promising the &apos;atmosphere&apos; of a day in the countryside. All Parisians know and love these lines as emblematic of the true city-dweller&apos;s contempt for the countryside. The real H\u00f4tel du Nord, which gave its name to the movie, is now a comedy club for visiting UK stand-ups. &apos;This is what we call progress,&apos; say Luis drily. &apos;It means killing the city.&apos; It has been, however, precisely the plan of the city government for some time to revitalise the dying areas of the city. Even more intriguingly, the model for the future of Paris is not London but New York - or at least this is the model that is cited by the likes of Christophe G\u00e9rard, chief adviser to Bertrand Delano\u00eb, the Mayor of Paris. Delano\u00eb himself is openly gay and unrepentantly socialist (although Sarkozy is said to admire him for his determination). Above all, Delano\u00eb has long been impressed by the story of how New York was transformed from a dirty, dangerous and corrupt city in the Seventies to the safe and gleaming consumerist capital o f 21st-century city breaks. Welcoming Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of New York, on a recent trip to Paris in September, Delano\u00eb declared that his city had much to share with and learn from New York. &apos;We want to work with New Yorkers,&apos; he said, &apos;because we share the same destiny.&apos; Certainly, one of Delano\u00eb&apos;s key objectives since he took office in 2001 has been to clean up the city in every sense. He came to power with two grand projects - the first to solve the accommodation crisis in Paris, which has seen large parts of the city depopulated due to high property prices, and to diminish the primacy of the car in favour of public transport. Before he even came to power Delano\u00eb questioned why 94 per cent of Parisian road surfaces should be occupied by private motorists. Since then he has announced, and begun to deliver on, a series of measures making Paris largely car-free and therefore one of the cleanest and most pleasant cities in the world. These included building the first new tramway in Paris since the Thirties, increasing the number of lanes exclusively for use by buses, taxis and bicycles, and restrictions on access to, and parking in, the city centre, all while lowering parking rates in residential areas and introducing a cheap bicycle scheme across the city. At the height of the heatwave in 2003, when it seemed that every breath you took was full of poison, nobody in their right minds could have argued against Delano\u00eb&apos;s vision for cleaning the city. The bike scheme has been a roaring success - it costs only \u20ac1 to hire a bike all day - and it is noticeable that it has been taken up by Parisians of all generations and levels of fitness. There have been teething troubles - everybody is quite happy, for example, to freewheel down the hills of Belleville and M\u00e9nilmontant but no one wants to cycle back, which means discreet lorry-loads of bikes being delivered back up the hill every evening. There are still dissenting voices, however. Strangely, some of the most strident, and occasionally convincing, arguments have come from the left. In March Les Temps Modernes, the journal founded by Jean-Paul Sartre and still an important influence on the Parisian intelligentsia, published two articles fiercely attacking Delano\u00eb&apos;s policies - and, by extension, the ruling Socialist party in Paris. The first of these, by the veteran poet and philosopher Michel Deguy, was called &apos;La Destruction de Paris&apos;. Most significantly, Deguy compares Paris not only to New York and London, but also Cairo, Mexico City, Bangkok and Shanghai, and finds Paris lagging behind. More precisely, he observes the cityscape from the corner of the rue de Rennes and the boulevard St Germain - the crossroads that is at the heart of newly sanitised Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s - and notes, with a rising sense of alarm, the relative calm and lack of movement. So where, he asks, is the noise, bustle, confusion and danger appropriate to a great city? Surely, he says, this cannot be Paris when it looks and feels like no more than a mildly pleasant provincial town? Crucially, Deguy is no Jeremy Clarkson-style petrol-head barking on about defending his right to drive his car wherever he wants in the city. He is, in fact, a dedicated cyclist who sees cars merely as a necessary evil. His real argument - in a rant that has a direct appeal to all Parisians of a leftist bent - is that Delano\u00eb&apos;s measures are a way of controlling and policing the city. More to the point, Delano\u00eb&apos;s attempts to make the city safe and clean are also efforts to make Paris banal. This is a crime, says Deguy, that no true Parisian could condone. The &apos;new green&apos; as represented by Delano\u00eb, Deguy concludes, is a hypocritical puritan who does not understand the inner life of the city. Slightly madder, but no less convincing, is a short piece in the same issue of Les Temps Modernes by the psychoanalyst G\u00e9rard Wajcman called &apos;En Haine de la Ville&apos; (&apos;In Hating the City&apos;). In this article Wajcman accuses Delano\u00eb of a &apos;Soviet-style&apos; authoritarianism driven by a pathological hatred and fear of the people of Paris and &apos;racism&apos; towards motorists, smokers and other free spirits. This may well be going too far - smokers are still beyond being a persecuted race in Paris, as a visit to any bar will prove - but there is a serious point to be made about how far Paris can continue to be Paris if it is ordered and safe, managed by what Wajcman calls the &apos;brutalist thugs of the green movement and their pseudo-science&apos;. One of the ironies of this argument is that while the centre of Paris is probably cleaner and safer than it has ever been in history, the most direct threat to the stability of city life comes from outside the city centre - from the banlieues, the vast suburban housing estates that lie outside the city limits. These estates are home to a population of predominantly African immigrants. Life is tough here and dominated mainly by the grim realities of unemployment, crime and deprivation. These are the areas that exploded into the world&apos;s consciousness in November 2005, when a series of riots in the Parisian suburbs triggered copycat events across France. It&apos;s all too easily forgotten now, but for a month the French government was nearly brought to its knees. That particular confrontation may be over, but the war between the suburbs and the city centre goes on. The latest form of provocation is for kids from the suburbs, dressed like black Americans, but with accents and manners from North Africa, to stage pitched battles in central Paris - Les Halles, La D\u00e9fense or Gare du Nord - terrifying shoppers and workers alike. Like the rhetorical violence in rap music - at which these Parisian suburbanites excel - the aim is to shock the jaded spectator into feeling something, anything. Most recently there have been regular (and often deadly) skirmishes between police and immigrant youths at Gare du Nord and Les Halles, where the suburban trains come into Paris. Trouble happens so frequently here that the shooting by police a few weeks ago of an unknown Algerian youth brandishing a gun near the Euro-star terminal merited only a paragraph in Le Parisien - the equivalent of London&apos;s Evening Standard The social theorist Marc Aug\u00e9 has tried to explain this violence, real and staged, by writing that the edges of the city are now made up of &apos;non-spaces&apos; - shopping malls, car parks, business districts - that contradict everything that central Paris, in its eclectic intimacy, has always represented. The only appropriate response to this contradiction, which defines life in the banlieues, is, he says, alienation or violent rebellion. From this point of view there is, however, still something quintessentially Parisian about these provocations. Indeed, they are all firmly in the tradition of Louis Chevalier, probably the most famous and important historian of modern Paris, who argued that the real history of Paris in the 19th and 20th centuries was made not by government or the bourgeoisie but by what he called &apos;the dangerous classes&apos; - vagabonds, misfits, drinkers, sexual outsiders, anarchists: all those who had no stake in society, and therefore no fear of total disruption. This is an appealing if unorthodox theory that partly explains, even if it doesn&apos;t quite justify, the 21st-century violence from the banlieues. More appositely, such violence can be seen as a sign of vitality and health - it is indeed the direct opposite of the Paris Ville-Mus\u00e9e, the &apos;non-space&apos; where the press and television complain regularly that Parisian culture has been undermined and destroyed by the corporate culture that has brought Starbucks and basketball to the city, wiping out the bistros, tripots and troquets - the bars and dives that are the traditional spaces of old-style urban intercourse. &apos;I don&apos;t condone violence,&apos; says Malik Akbib, an Algerian born and raised in the banlieues, but now resident in the relatively swish 14th arrondissement, &apos;but I know instinctively what these kids are trying to say when they wind up the cops at Gare du Nord or at the football. It&apos;s like saying we belong here, too. You can&apos;t keep us out.&apos; Actually, there is, to my mind and for all this loud debate, every reason to be optimistic about the future of Paris, and precisely because of the views of the likes of Malik. More to the point, the key to understanding the future of the city lies (as Chevalier also indicates in his writings) in avoiding the phoney nostalgia - another typically Parisian trait - that causes Parisians to mourn the passing of their cherished city without noticing that a new city is being born around them. Second, it may well be the case that the future history of the city lies with the banlieues. This, indeed, is the theme of one of the best and funniest books about Paris in recent years - a book that happens to be the work of a Spanish novelist now mainly resident in Morocco. This is the novel Paisajes despu\u00e9s de la batalla (Landscapes After the Battle) by Juan Goytisolo, in which he invents a comic version of the city, whose inhabitants wake one morning to find that Arabic has replaced all signs in the familiar Roman alphabet. It follows from this incident that the hierarchical world of the city is literally turned upside-down, or inside-out. The European capital of modernity can be deciphered only by immigrants from the developing world - the new &apos;dangerous classes&apos; - who are now suddenly the cultural masters of the metropolis. In a neat reversal of the well known Spanish dicho (or proverb) that &apos;Africa begins in the Pyrenees&apos; the narrator of the novel observes that &apos;Africa now begins at the boulevards&apos;. All of this is richly comic, but there is also a serious purpose at work. Most notably, Goytisolo has indicated his real meaning in a brief essay in Spanish called &apos;Par\u00eds, Capital del siglo XXI&apos; (&apos;Paris, Capital of the 21st Century&apos;). In essence, the argument is that Paris has to be completely destroyed in order to emerge as the capital of the 21st century. Goytisolo had in fact spent decades of his life in Paris, mostly living in the Sentier district. This is where the revelation had come to him that the idea of a European capital - made by and inhabited only by Europeans - is not just an anachronism, but a dangerous myth that must be destroyed. The reason for this, he said, is because the purely European idea of the city does not correspond to the reality of the streets. Paris is, for example, one of the biggest African cities in the world. It just so happens not to be in Africa. As I was finishing my own recent book on Paris - a history of the city deeply influenced by Louis Chevalier&apos;s ideas - I went to interview Juan Goytisolo in Tangier, where he lives now, and where we met in the wonderfully named Caf\u00e9 Maravillosa. Goytisolo is now in his mid-seventies, but although lauded across the Hispanic world as the pre-eminent figure in Spanish letters, he has evidently lost none of his combative style or his contempt for middle-class values. Goytisolo said to me that he had always loved the city because he believed that its oldest and truest tradition was the instinct for cultural and political subversion. &apos;Paris is revolt and revolution,&apos; he said, &apos;or it is not at all. That is all I have to say - and why I understand the youth in suburbs. To fight back, to argue hard, is, I think, the oldest tradition in the city.&apos; It was this tradition, he also said, that had been temporarily lost at some point towards the end of the 20th century and that needed to be reawakened. The city had to be &apos;de-Europeanised&apos; in order to make space for new dissident voices. This was in fact the real answer to the problem of the banlieues - the way to bring Paris back to life again is not just in the Delano\u00eb solution of tidying up the city and offering free bikes but to literally break down the borders to the city, bring the immigrants and so-called outsiders into the heart of Paris, where they can start to develop a new, genuinely multicultural and hybrid culture. I told Goytisolo that I thought this was already happening. After the interview I returned from Tangier to Paris, to my flat in Temple, four floors above a Berber coffee shop, next to a building populated by mainly West Africans, and in the heart of what was known as a working-class Chinese district. There I thought about how strange and distinctive Paris still is. In the world of cheap international travel, where everybody travels everywhere when they want, it&apos;s all too easy to forget this. Paris is, however, even in the globalised 21st century, a total and unique experience. The proof of this is in walking the streets. This is the secret to understanding Paris, in its infinity and its detail. One of my favourite walks in Paris is a demonstration of this notion. It begins at the corner of rue d&apos;Oran and rue L\u00e9on in the 18th arrondissement. From this point you can take any number of directions towards the city - towards the market at Doudeauville, or the rue Myrha or rue Polonceau. At any point, depending upon the angle of your vision, you could be in Casablanca, Algiers, Dakar, Tirana, Beirut or the back streets of Bucharest. But you know that you are always in Paris - in the long, grey Haussmann streets, or the cobbled alleys, or the back lanes with their medieval curves and edges, you could never really be anywhere else. And as you continue to walk, down towards the heart of the city, making your way through the crowded and smelly streets of Barb\u00e8s, dodging Bosnian beggars, French junkies and African clairvoyants, picking your way through the Oriental squalor towards the Gare du Nord or the Eurostar terminal, only one thing is sure: the city is changing again.  Plus ca change... A brief history of Paris c4200 BC The first permanent settlement in the Paris area is established. 450 BC The Parisii, a tribe derived from the Celtic Senones, settle near the Seine. 52 BC The Romans conquer the Paris basin and later establish a permanent town called Lutetia. This grows over several centuries to become a major city. c400 AD The decline of the Roman Empire leads manyParis residents to abandon the city. The remaining inhabitants begin calling Lutetia by its original name of Paris. c500 Frankish king Clovis I makes Paris his capital and commissions its first cathedral. 886 Paris survives a siege by the Vikings but much of the settlement on the Left Bank is destroyed. 987 Hugh Capet, the Count of Paris, becomes King of France, marking the beginning of the Capetian dynasty which will establish Paris as the capital of France. 1418 Paris is occupied by English-allied Burgundians during the Hundred Years War. The city is reclaimed by Charles VII in 1437. 1572 Thousands of Huguenot Protestants are slaughtered in Paris during the St Bartholomew&apos;s Day Massacre. The violence spreads throughout France, devastating the French Protestant population. 1789 The storming of the Bastille occurs on 14 July, now a French national holiday. A mob angered by King Louis XVI&apos;s attempts to stifle political change takes over the city&apos;s medieval prison in one of the first flashpoints of the French Revolution. Three years later, the monarchy is overthrown. 1832 A cholera epidemic claims the lives of 20,000 of the city&apos;s 650,000 inhabitants. 1889 The Eiffel Tower is completed for the Exposition Universelle, an exhibition to mark the centenary of the French Revolution. It is planned as a temporary monument. 1940 Paris falls to the forces of Nazi Germany, who occupy the city until August 1944. 1968 Riot police acted against protesting students and workers urge a general strike in an attempt to dislodge the government of General Charles de Gaulle. May 1968 becomes the catalyst for a shift in French society towards more liberal values. 2005 Rioters torch cars and public buildings as the worst civil unrest since 1968 engulfs Paris&apos;s suburbs in October. It is triggered by the deaths of two teenagers who are electrocuted after fleeing from the police into a power station.", "tags": ["Paris holidays"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-28T23:37:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/29/tennis.sport2", "sentences": ["Andy Murray will barely have time to reflect on his third career title, gained yesterday when he defeated Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco 6-2, 6-3 in the St Petersburg Open final, before he is pitched into the mad scramble in Paris for the remaining two places in next month&apos;s end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai.", "&quot;I said at the start of the week that to have a chance of qualifying for Shanghai I really needed to win here.", "&quot;Getting to Shanghai would be a ridiculous effort after what has happened to me.", "If I was to make Shanghai I think it would be an unbelievable effort and I&apos;m going to give it my best shot.&quot; By winning in Russia Murray collected the biggest cheque of his short career, almost \u00a370,000, but greater riches await him in the TMC.", "The only certainty is that, if Murray were to win in Paris next Sunday, he would be sure of reaching Shanghai.", "Then came the wrist injury which appeared to stymie his hopes before this late run, including a final in Metz at the beginning of the month, rushed him to within a chopstick&apos;s length of making it to Shanghai."], "title": "Tennis: Murray's third title puts him in reach of Masters", "article": "Andy Murray will barely have time to reflect on his third career title, gained yesterday when he defeated Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco 6-2, 6-3 in the St Petersburg Open final, before he is pitched into the mad scramble in Paris for the remaining two places in next month&apos;s end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. Not that the hue and cry along the banks of the Seine will bother him, for only a few weeks ago all thoughts of making it to China appeared no more than a pipe dream. &quot;I said at the start of the week that to have a chance of qualifying for Shanghai I really needed to win here. Now I think a couple of wins in Paris and I&apos;m probably one of the favourites to make it,&quot; said Murray. &quot;I played a pretty solid match, not too many mistakes. I came to the net at the right time and put a lot of pressure on his serve, so overall, it was a pretty comfortable match for me. &quot;Getting to Shanghai would be a ridiculous effort after what has happened to me. A wrist injury, as every tennis player knows, takes such a long time to come back from. If I was to make Shanghai I think it would be an unbelievable effort and I&apos;m going to give it my best shot.&quot; By winning in Russia Murray collected the biggest cheque of his short career, almost \u00a370,000, but greater riches await him in the TMC. This event, to be held in London from 2009, has a total value of \u00a31.8m, with more than \u00a3500,000 going to an unbeaten champion. Suddenly the 20-year-old Murray is close to the big league, although there may be many a slip between cup and lip before matters are finalised this week. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Nikolay Davydenko, Andy Roddick and David Ferrer have all booked their tickets, leaving 19 players hustling for the two places which, on current points, would go to Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez of Chile and Germany&apos;s Tommy Haas. It is impossible to work out all the permutations at this stage. A few years ago the ATP listed a dozen possible TMC options on the quarter-final day of this tournament and they were all wrong. Such are the complications. The only certainty is that, if Murray were to win in Paris next Sunday, he would be sure of reaching Shanghai. The rest, for the time being, is speculation, although yesterday&apos;s victory in Russia moved the 20-year-old Scot into 11th place in the race, something that seemed inconceivable in mid-summer as he nursed a severe right wrist injury incurred on the Hamburg clay courts in May. Clearly it will be tough for Murray. His confidence will be high but he will have little time to adjust. By climbing the rankings in recent weeks he earned himself a seeding of 15th in Paris and a first-round bye that gives him a little extra time. His first match, probably on Wednesday, will be against Jarkko Nieminen of Finland or Argentina&apos;s Juan Monaco, and then his potential third-round opponent is Djokovic, the world No3, who has won all his three previous matches against Murray. However, the British No1 is certain to be fired up. Reaching the TMC was one of his main objectives this year and by April he was well on course, having broken into the top 10 for the first time. Then came the wrist injury which appeared to stymie his hopes before this late run, including a final in Metz at the beginning of the month, rushed him to within a chopstick&apos;s length of making it to Shanghai.

Roddick is due to spearhead his country&apos;s attempt to win the Davis Cup for the first time since 1995 when they meet Russia in Portland, Oregon, less than two weeks after the cup. The American, who lost in the first round of the tournament in Lyon last week and then pulled out of the Masters Series event here in Paris, has not made any official statement as yet, though he has always made it clear that winning the Davis Cup is of paramount importance. There are two places open for Shanghai, and if Roddick were to withdraw it would clearly increase Murray&apos;s chances of making his debut in the lucrative event that will move from China to London in 2009. Murray will not worry one jot how he gets to Shanghai and has high expectations of clinching his place. He made a late decision last week to play doubles here at the BNP Paribas tournament with his brother, Jamie, to give him extra time to adjust to the indoor surface at the Palais Omnisports. &quot;They&apos;ve changed the courts, so this way I&apos;ll get a feel for the surface and hopefully I&apos;ll feel good going into my singles,&quot; said Murray. They are due to play today, with Murray meeting either Finland&apos;s Jarkko Nieminen or Juan M\u00f3naco of Argentina in his opening singles match tomorrow. Murray, having won his third career title in St Petersburg on Sunday, is understandably bubbling at the thought of playing in the Masters. &quot;To be in the top eight players in the world is amazing. There are very few players in any sport who can say they&apos;ve done that.&quot; When the Scot severely injured his wrist last May, forcing him to miss both the French Open and Wimbledon, it appeared the opportunity would be denied him this year but he never gave up hope. &quot;Around the US Open time you don&apos;t really look at it but after that everybody knows what&apos;s going on and what they have to do. You&apos;d have to be dumb not to. Mentally it&apos;s been much easier going into a match knowing that if I win I may make Shanghai. Some guys are a bit tired mentally at the end of the season, while for me the thought of getting to Shanghai has made me fight for every ball, and I&apos;ll be checking what everyone else is doing this week.&quot; Roger Federer, who by winning in Basle at the weekend clinched the end-of-season No 1 spot for the fourth successive year, has already qualified together with Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Nikolay Davydenko, Roddick, and David Ferrer, while the scramble for the final two places has rarely been so crowded or complicated. The key match for Murray may be on Thursday when he is due to meet Djokovic, his fellow 20-year-old and the world No 3, who has won all three of their previous meetings. However for the moment Murray has to concentrate on Nieminen and M\u00f3naco. &quot;I used to train with Juan in Barcelona a little bit so we know each other pretty well. &quot;He&apos;s just had a great middle part of the year. Nieminen I played once before and had a really tough match against him in Toronto a year and a half ago and he&apos;s obviously had a good week by getting to the final in Basle. Both of them are in the top 30 so I&apos;m expecting a tough match either way.&quot; But Murray is currently on a huge high. The terrible frustration of the late spring and early summer months when he was unable to play at all have vanished, and during the penultimate Masters Series tournament in Madrid the form that lifted him into the top 10 before the wrist injury was re-captured and perhaps bettered. &quot;I&apos;m coming here feeling very confident and like I said in Madrid, when I&apos;m playing at my best I&apos;ve got a chance of beating all the top players.&quot; How dearly would Murray love to put this to the test in 12 days&apos; time when the Tennis Masters Cup begins.

Murray had decided to play doubles last week in order to give him a little extra time to adjust to the courts here after winning the St Petersburg Open on Sunday, his third career title. However the rigours of the journey from Russia, exacerbated by the accident, were still affecting him. &quot;I got in late on Monday night after two flights and then our car crashed on the way to the hotel, so it took quite a long time to get here,&quot; said Murray. &quot;There was a lot of traffic on the way from the airport to the hotel.

When you get hit that hard, it&apos;s a pretty loud bang and you get thrown forward and back pretty quickly.&quot; Fortunately neither Murray nor his coach, Brad Gilbert, was hurt. &quot;My back was a little bit stiff but nothing serious. I got stretched by the physio this morning which cracked it and my neck a little bit but I feel fine now,&quot; said Murray, shortly after he and his brother had lost to Jordan Kerr of Australia and Brazil&apos;s Andre Sa 6-1, 2-6, 11-9, having missed two match points in the deciding champions&apos; tie-break on a court in the Palais Omnisports that is as near to subterranean as is possible on the ATP Tour.

There is no doubt he felt his chances had gone when he injured his wrist in May, forcing him out for more than three months, although as the season reached its denouement his late surge was aided by a series of surprise results at the penultimate Masters Series event in Madrid. &quot;All the guys right in front of me all lost in the first round in Spain,&quot; said Murray. &quot;I guess them losing kind of made up for that time that I missed. If I had been playing those three months, who knows what my ranking would be now but I&apos;ve finished the year playing some really good tennis and I feel like I should be one of the eight in Shanghai,&quot; said Murray. Murray and Nieminen, ranked No26 in the world, have met once before with Murray winning 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 last year in the quarter-finals of the Canada Masters in Toronto.

Murray boosted his chances by winning the St Petersburg Open last weekend for his third career title, and the second this year, although he was well aware of the potential difficulty of his match against Nieminen, who had reached the final in the Basel indoor tournament last Sunday, losing to Roger Federer, the world No1. Murray put Nieminen&apos;s serve under immediate pressure and had a total of seven break-points in the opening set, but with the score at 5-5 the Scot hit his own patch of trouble with a double fault and a wayward forehand. The Finn continued to look dangerous in the tie-break, and took a seemingly decisive 5-3 lead when Murray netted an overly ambitious backhand drop shot. One of Murray&apos;s undoubted gifts is his ability to recover in times of crises, though, and he duly won the tie-break 7-5, a set that had taken precisely one hour. He appeared a little tired and lacking in concentration as the second set unfolded, dropping his serve for the first time to go 3-1 down. Nieminen was a point away from a 4-1 lead when Murray once again displayed his powers of recovery from awkward situations, and went on to win the next five games with a mixture of heavy hitting and superb improvisation. Nieminen, not involved in the race to Shanghai himself, pushed Murray all the way but ultimately could never match the Scot&apos;s variety.

It was quite well known across parts of western Europe too. But it was not a global brand. Earlier this year, however, on the back of record results, the company&apos;s chief executive, John Patterson, hailed the company as a truly global player. The manufacturer&apos;s decision to go global has helped it overcome the pressures of a strong pound. The company ranks number three in construction equipment worldwide; it sold 55,000 machines (worth \u00a31.75bn) last year, and has 17 factories and more than 8,000 employees spread across four continents. &quot;In the mid to late 1990s we were a UK manufacturer with a very strong European presence but towards the end of the decade we started looking very seriously about how to progress,&quot; according to Mr Patterson. It is a policy that has produced dividends, not least at a time when the pound is riding high against the dollar. &quot;The strong pound creates challenges for all exporters and JCB has not been immune from the effects. However, we would have felt the effects much more keenly a decade ago. JCB has evolved into a global manufacturer over the past few years, which has mitigated some of the impact of currency.&quot; Globalisation is a well-trodden route. The opportunities - low-cost competition invading traditional markets on the one hand but access to low-cost suppliers, manufacturing and developing economies on the other - are well known. Ten years ago the path was less frequented, but JCB was responding to two pressures. First, its dealers were telling the company it needed to expand its product range. The company itself felt it needed a presence in more markets and that to reach some markets, local production was essential to cope with issues such as freight costs and tariffs. &quot;The dealers were always asking us for more products and in some markets import duties meant you almost had to have a manufacturing base there. You remove a lot of logistical issues by manufacturing in different countries,&quot; Mr Patterson said. JCB had a joint venture in India, which had been producing equipment at Ballabgarh, near Delhi, since 1980. But its initial focus was on North America. &quot;In the 1990s we started to look seriously at how to make progress in the US, given that the US represented a fairly substantial percentage of the world market for construction equipment.&quot; At the end of the decade JCB built a \u00a340m plant in Savannah, Georgia, to serve the US market. It was a decision that has paid off in more ways than one. Last year JCB won a multimillion-dollar contract to supply the US army with high-speed diggers. &quot;Had we not been manufacturing in the US, we would not have won the military contract,&quot; said Mr Patterson. A year after the first machines began rolling off the production line in Savannah, JCB opened a new plant at Sao Paulo in Brazil. Two years later, in 2003, it took sole control of the Indian business and has subsequently built two new plants at Pune, near Mumbai. Last year it opened a factory near Pudong, near Shanghai. JCBhas not only chased low-cost manufacturing locations. It bought a German compaction equipment firm in 2005 and doubled production. In the UK it spent \u00a380m on its own engine production capacity in Derbyshire. But the spread of manufacturing capability has meant JCB has been able to grow faster than would otherwise have been the case, said Mr Patterson. &quot;We would not have been able to produce the number of products last year, and indeed this year, without overseas manufacturing capability.&quot; Manufacturing has also helped with the currency issue. &quot;Over the past three years we have invested \u00a3120m in expanding our global manufacturing capability. We have also increased international sourcing of components. So while the strong pound does continue to have an impact, JCB is much better placed to deal with the effects.&quot; The company&apos;s spread also allows it to develop skills outside the UK, where qualified engineers are in short supply. One of the factors behind the development of JCB&apos;s 350mph Dieselmax project - the world&apos;s fastest diesel - was to demonstrate the exciting challenges on offer for those choosing a career in engineering. &quot;There is no doubt it is having a benefit in getting young people to come and talk to us. The UK is just not producing enough graduate engineers. We have work to do at grassroots level. Countries like India, the US and China turn out far more graduate engineers.&quot; JCB is still a privately owned firm, which it argues has made the pursuit of its global ambitions easier. &quot;I&apos;m sure you could have done it [as a public company] but being a public company I&apos;m not quite sure you could have done it so quickly,&quot; said Mr Patterson.", "tags": ["Business", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-31T23:50:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/01/tennis.sport", "sentences": ["The Scot knows he needs to stay alive to qualify for the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai next week but he would much prefer all his rivals to give up the ghost.", "Slowly, a little too slowly for Murray&apos;s liking, his potential rivals for the two remaining places in the eight-man Shanghai field are being whittled down, and the seemingly good news for Murray was that Novak Djokovic, the world No3, whom he might have played today in the third round here, was easily defeated by France&apos;s 34-year-old Fabrice Santoro, the oldest player in the top 50.", "The 20-year-old Serbian let the cat out of the bag when he revealed he would be leaving for China on Sunday &quot;so I will have five or six days&apos; preparation in Shanghai&quot;."], "title": "Tennis: Djokovic exit moves Murray closer Shanghai", "article": "Andy Murray resembles an elderly lady reading the obituaries column of the local newspaper and being secretly pleased on finding names of friends and acquaintances younger than herself who have died.

Pete Sampras may have dubbed Santoro &quot;the magician&quot;, and the years have not staled the variety of his double-fisted forehand and backhand, but the legs are not what they were, and one is swathed in support bandages after he tore a muscle in Lyon last week. Not that Murray will treat him with anything other than caution. &quot;He is my favourite player to watch. You won&apos;t see a game style like his probably for the rest of my career,&quot; said Murray. &quot;He&apos;s just a completely different player and hits some unbelievable shots.&quot; The Scot will need to be careful, given his penchant for the more unusual shot, that he does not get drawn into the sort of chess game of which Santoro is a master. He feels victory is well within his grasp. Another day, another step closer to China, or so Murray hopes. Djokovic, who with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Nikolay Davydenko, Andy Roddick and David Ferrer has qualified for the Masters Cup, entered the arena wearing a Halloween mask then blamed his defeat on a wisdom tooth extraction, though it hardly took the wisdom of Solomon to figure out he had not put heart and soul into the match against Santoro. The 20-year-old Serbian let the cat out of the bag when he revealed he would be leaving for China on Sunday &quot;so I will have five or six days&apos; preparation in Shanghai&quot;. Santoro, who has never played Murray but has practised with him, has a lot of admiration for the Scot. &quot;He&apos;s a great player. He has good hands and knows the game pretty well for a young player. He always plays the right shots. I remember the first time I practised with him in Melbourne I was very surprised how much time he had to hit every shot. And that&apos;s a very important quality.&quot; Sometimes Murray, because of his ability, is tempted to overdo the finesse. He was fortunate against Nieminen that a missed backhand drop shot, which saw him go 5-3 down in the first-set tie-break, was not exploited. He strongly believes that he deserves to be at the Masters Cup: &quot;It&apos;s almost like the last game of a football season and you know you just need to draw and hope that the other teams lose. It&apos;s tough to focus on your own match.&quot; But focus he must, particularly against the wily Santoro.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Andy Murray"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-01T00:17:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/01/tennis.andymurray", "sentences": ["The British No1 is doing battle with a handful of players to clinch the eighth spot in the ATP Tour Race, and earn his place at the lucrative event in Shanghai."], "title": "Tennis: Murray canters into last eight as Davydenko comes a cropper again", "article": "Andy Murray continued his rich vein of form with a 6-4, 6-2 win against Fabrice Santoro in the BNP Paribas Masters to reach the last eight and further boost his late charge for a place in the Masters Cup. The British No1 is doing battle with a handful of players to clinch the eighth spot in the ATP Tour Race, and earn his place at the lucrative event in Shanghai. Santoro made Murray&apos;s job easier by beating Novak Djokovic in the previous round but he failed to show the kind of form seen in that victory as the Scot progressed with ease. The first two games followed serve before some strong play from Murray - and a missed lob from his opponent - handed the 20-year-old a first break point. He spurned that but accepted a second to take the lead. Santoro refused to lie down, though, and hit back at the first opportunity, breaking Murray in a lengthy fourth game which saw both men take advantage at deuce. The Frenchman, not suffering notably despite sporting a heavily-strapped knee, kept the tempo high and Murray needed to did well to clinch a second break, outgunning his opponent with some clinical passing shots. Santoro held the ninth game to make Murray serve for the set, which he did with little trouble. Murray continued to produce regular winners, securing another break at the first attempt in the second set and following up with a service game of his own to move into an instant 2-0 lead. The Scot then produced perhaps his most complete game of the day to make it 3-0, beating Santoro to love on his own serve with a series of fine cross-court winners. Santoro again failed to score as an increasingly dominant Murray cantered into a 4-0 lead. It came as a relief for the home fans when Santoro finally opened his account in the set, making it 4-1 but there were no further breaks of serve as Murray wrapped up a 6-4 win to take the match and set up a meeting with either James Blake or Richard Gasquet. Meanwhile, Nikolay Davydenko was at the centre of more controversy after losing 6-2, 6-2 to Marcos Baghdatis. The world No4 was told by chair umpire Cedric Mourier to &quot;try his best&quot; after the official questioned why he was serving so many double faults. The Russian has endured a miserable time of late after being fined by the ATP for not giving his all in his loss to Marin Cilic in the St Petersburg Open. The ATP is also investigating a match in Poland in August in which Davydenko won the first set 6-1 against Martin Vassallo before retiring with a foot injury, after irregular betting patterns were brought to its attention. Davydenko looked hopelessly out of sorts from the off against Baghdatis and struggled on serve in particular. The matter came to a head in the second set when Mourier told Davydenko he had served &quot;too many&quot; double faults. He ended up with 10 and was broken five times in the match, which lasted just one hour and 13 minutes. When Davydenko asked the chair umpire, &quot;What can I do?&quot; Mourier replied, &quot;Serve like me.&quot;", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Andy Murray"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-01T13:38:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/02/tennis.sport1", "sentences": ["If he were to lose to the talented Frenchman, then Murray&apos;s chances of reaching the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai would be dependent on others dropping out before the tournament begins a week on Sunday.", "Murray defeated another Frenchman, Fabrice Santoro, 6-4, 6-2 yesterday while Gasquet effectively ended James Blake&apos;s chances of joining the eight-man Shanghai shuffle with a 6-4, 6-4 win over the American."], "title": "Tennis: Murray maintains momentum for Gasquet clash", "article": "The winning must not stop.

A victory would not guarantee the trip to China but he would become tantalisingly close. Murray defeated another Frenchman, Fabrice Santoro, 6-4, 6-2 yesterday while Gasquet effectively ended James Blake&apos;s chances of joining the eight-man Shanghai shuffle with a 6-4, 6-4 win over the American. Murray and Gasquet, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon this year, have met only once previously, with the 21-year-old Frenchman winning in the semi-finals of last year&apos;s Masters event in Toronto. Murray will nevertheless fancy his chances. Gasquet has one of the supreme backhands in the men&apos;s game but his serve is attackable and returning is Murray&apos;s major strength. Santoro was in no doubt that Murray would be in the world&apos;s top five if he had not injured his wrist in May. &quot;He&apos;s able to adapt to any kind of player. He can play fast, he can play slow and he&apos;s very clever. He&apos;s also a great fighter while it&apos;s incredible how fast he can run.&quot; Murray will relish what is bound to be an electric atmosphere inside the Palais Omnisports today, for he thrives on the big occasions. This is not to say he is entirely devoid of nerves but he has felt good on court, an extension of his mood last week when he won the St Petersburg Open, a third career title that opened the way for this week&apos;s charge on China. &quot;I&apos;m not that tense, to be honest. Playing on the Centre Court at Wimbledon you&apos;re pretty tense and Davis Cup is similar but I&apos;m not getting that way here.&quot; That may change as today unfolds, although the pressure will perhaps be greater on Gasquet in front of his home crowd. Should Murray reach tomorrow&apos;s semi-final he will play either Spain&apos;s David Ferrer or David Nalbandian who last night beat Roger Federer 6-4, 7-6. Yesterday the supporters of the 34-year-old Santoro sensed early on that the man dubbed &quot;the magician&quot; by Pete Sampras, was not about to pull any rabbits out of hats. It was essential for Murray to get on top quickly. He broke for a 2-1 lead, then immediately dropped his own serve. The first four games, which took 19 minutes, were full of absorbing cat-and-mouse tennis of exquisite quality but gradually Murray&apos;s power and depth began to tip the balance. &quot;I started playing much more aggressively, coming to the net a lot more, and that changed the match,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Andy Murray"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-02T00:11:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/02/tennis.andymurray", "sentences": ["Andy Murray&apos;s hopes of reaching the Masters Cup in Shanghai were ended as Richard Gasquet edged their quarter-final in the Paris Masters tonight."], "title": "Tennis: Murray's Shanghai dream ends", "article": "Andy Murray&apos;s hopes of reaching the Masters Cup in Shanghai were ended as Richard Gasquet edged their quarter-final in the Paris Masters tonight.

But a leg-weary Gasquet recovered his composure and snatched a crucial break in the fifth game of the decider to progress 6-3, 0-6, 6-4.  Gasquet will now go on to play David Nalbandian, conqueror of Roger Federer, with his hopes of making the prestigious eight-man event in China still alive.  There was little between the players in a serve-dominated first set with Murray paying the price for one sloppy game in the eighth. After seven games in which neither player earned a break point, Gasquet grabbed the initiative by playing patiently and forcing 15th seed Murray into errors.  Gasquet was little troubled as he closed out the set, the first Murray had dropped in the tournament, but the Scot powered back in style to take the second. He dramatically moved up a gear and hit more convincingly, particularly with his backhand, to sweep through the set to love. Gasquet&apos;s confidence appeared to drain from him and his movement slowed as Murray cranked up the pressure and the Scot levelled the match by seizing on his third set point off the Frenchman&apos;s serve.  The third set proved much more competitive with Gasquet, perhaps responding to a few boos in his home crowd, rallying to force two break points on the opening Murray serve. He failed to convert either but dug deeper to break through in the fifth game and force himself ahead.

Clearly Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic, the current world No3, has made the season&apos;s biggest leap, having reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, together with the US Open final, yet there is little doubt that the player who excites almost everybody, critics and players alike, is Scotland&apos;s Andy Murray. France&apos;s Richard Gasquet, this year&apos;s Wimbledon semi-finalist, and at 21 years old one of the leaders of the chasing brat pack, is unequivocal. &quot;Andy is a player I love to watch. It seems he&apos;s always able to play the right shot at the right moment. You know, many of today&apos;s players know how to hit hard left and right, and have good volleys, but Andy knows how to do everything. He&apos;s a great player.&quot; Murray has always been aware of his own talent, and the priceless ability to be different from the herd: &quot;I know I can play shots that others don&apos;t try.&quot; When he won the US Open junior title in 2004 his ability to wrong-foot his opponents stood out a mile. The one uncertainty was whether he would develop the big weapon or weapons that are essential at the very top of the professional game. Those questions have been answered. Murray&apos;s forehand is a big boomer, his double-fisted backhand, notably when hit down the line, can be similarly vicious, while his first serve is being cranked up notch by notch well beyond the 130mph mark. The Scot has always been a supremely gifted returner; link this to an increasingly dangerous serve and his success was all but guaranteed in terms of being a top-10 player. What may take him much further, and into contention for grand slam titles, is his sublime unorthodoxy. Murray mentioned this week, after his third-round victory over Fabrice Santoro, how much he admired the little Frenchman&apos;s skills: &quot;You won&apos;t see another player like him in my career.&quot; But he forgot to mention himself. Like Santoro Murray can conjure winning shots out of nothing, finding angles and spin that are beyond the compass of most. Both have the hands of a magician; unlike Santoro, Murray also possesses the stature and power of an axe man. &quot;If he had not had the wrist injury Andy would have qualified for Shanghai well before this week,&quot; said Gasquet. &quot;He would already be No5, that&apos;s for sure, and will be a permanent member of the top eight every year from now. He has a great future, he works hard and is a great guy.&quot; Such plaudits are increasingly commonplace. There was always similar admiration for Tim Henman in the locker room, with fellow players loving to watch his volleying skills, even though most reckoned, rightly or wrongly, they knew how to beat him. Murray is similarly admired, the difference being that those at the top are much more wary. For here is a 20-year-old who has both the talent and the power to usurp them, and they know it. Of course, Murray must stay fit, and then prove he has the mental toughness that has marked the rapid rise of Djokovic this year, the two having been neck and neck prior to the Scot&apos;s wrist injury at Hamburg in May that kept him out of the French Open and Wimbledon. &quot;Providing he stays fit, Andy has no reason to fail,&quot; said Gasquet.

Should two players drop out between now and next week it is possible he might win a reprieve, although he admitted it appeared unlikely and he will not travel as a reserve.  This was Murray&apos;s big chance, and the Frenchman snatched it away from him. &quot;I played three bad games,&quot; a disappointed Murray said.  It was all a little cruel for Murray, particularly given the wonderful form he has shown in the latter part of the year, one truncated by more than three months after he severely injured his right wrist on the clay courts of Hamburg in May. There were bleak times, when the 20-year-old Scot wondered whether he would get back on the courts at all before the end of this year, and to have come so close to a place in China was a magnificent effort.  Six players - Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Nikolay Davydenko, Andy Roddick and David Ferrer - had qualified by the beginning of this week, with an almighty scramble for the final two places. Yesterday Fernando Gonzalez sealed his place and the eighth is between Gasquet and Marcos Baghdatis, with the Cypriot needing to win the title tomorrow in order to deny the Frenchman.  Murray remained in the mix after wins over Finland&apos;s Jarkko Nieminen and Fabrice Santoro of France, and so well had he been playing that there was real concern in the Gasquet camp despite the 21-year-old playing in front of his home crowd. The pressure on Gasquet, a child prodigy, has always been immense but he made his breakthrough at grand slam level this year by reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon before losing to Federer.  Murray entered the Palais Omnisports carrying his puffer jacket like some comforter blanket, as if expecting icy blasts. But the two youngsters soon traded ground strokes in the opening two games, probing each other on both sides with change of flight and pace and displaying exactly why they are regarded as two of the most talented players of their generation.  Having calmed their nerves both Murray and Gasquet settled into a fluid routine and from 1-1 to 3-3 neither dropped a point on his serve. In these exchanges Murray executed a stunning heavily sliced-drop shot from near the back of the court which spun away from Gasquet like a Shane Warne leg-break. It is a shot he loves, though it can also be his Achilles heel.  All was going well for Murray until the eighth game of the opening set. A too casual forehand, planted deep into the bottom of the net, saw Gasquet claim his first deuce on the Murray serve and two backhand misses prompted the 8,000 French crowd to erupt for the first time as their man took a 5-3 lead.  It was an opening Gasquet had no intention of missing. The Frenchman had hoped Murray might have been a little tired after his exertions in Russia last week, when he won his third career title in St Petersburg, and that was the way it looked. Another Murray backhand error took Gasquet to within a point of the first set which he clinched with a lovely backhand drop-shot that equalled anything Murray had displayed in its deftness.  Those in the Murray camp either chewed their lip or made encouraging nods. Murray clearly needed to hit back quickly and decisively but nobody was quite ready for what happened next, least of all Gasquet. Suddenly and spectacularly Murray put his foot on the pedal, achieving a surge of momentum that left his opponent scurrying around trying to play catch-up. The crowd did their best to lift the Frenchman, though to no avail. His confidence was being shredded by a relentless Murray.  Gasquet retreated to his chair after losing six games in a row and heaved his lungs as if all the air had been sucked out of the stadium. His eyes focused on some distant nirvana where he hoped to find succour and comfort - the lawns of Wimbledon perhaps. Murray made it seven consecutive games before Gasquet finally stopped the rot at 1-1 in the final set. The match was rattling along at a huge lick although, having been so dominant after the disappointment of losing the opening set, Murray now had to save two break points on his serve as Gasquet pressed to claw back the initiative.  It seemed the force was still with Murray but then unaccountably, as at the end of the first set, the errors crept back and he lost his serve to love to go 3-2 down. This time Gasquet held firm. &quot;It was a one-set match to go to Shanghai,&quot; said Murray. &quot;Next year I&apos;ll be there.&quot; Surely he will.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Andy Murray"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-03T01:15:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/04/seanpenn.madonna", "sentences": ["During the shooting of Shanghai Express, in which the couple co-starred, he famously dangled a press photographer from his ninth-floor hotel balcony."], "title": "Sean Penn: an activist and an optimist", "article": "In the few seconds it takes Sean Penn to amble across his hotel room to shake my hand, I have the distinct feeling that he has already sized me up. It&apos;s the way those sleepy blue eyes seem to take everything in, and give nothing back. He is smaller than I expected, compact and self-contained, but there is no denying his presence. After the briefest of greetings, he steers me to a nearby sofa and waits, without uttering a word. Sean Penn, you suspect, does not do small talk. He is here to promote Into the Wild, the fourth film he has directed, and the first to be based on a true story. It&apos;s an adaptation of Jon Krakauer&apos;s bestselling book about Christopher McCandless, a disaffected and impossibly idealistic young man who walked into the Alaskan wilderness in the summer of 1992 to test himself to the limits of his endurance, and died there of starvation 112 days later. &apos;I still have one foot in California,&apos; he says as I sit down. &apos;It may take me a while to get going.&apos; It does. In fact he doesn&apos;t really get going, become affable and animated, until our conversation shifts from film-making to politics. Though he won a Best Actor Oscar for Mystic River in 2004, it is directing and political activism that really engage him now. &apos;I&apos;m an optimist, basically,&apos; he says at one point, grinning. &apos;I think we can turn things around. To do that, you got to get involved.&apos; Sean Penn is someone who tends to get involved. Not getting involved is never an option. The commitment that now fuels his activism has long underpinned his acting and, of late, his directing. He has left behind the bad boy image that lingered for years after the break-up of his brief and stormy marriage to Madonna in the Eighties. These days Penn&apos;s anger is primarily directed at the White House. He is Hollywood&apos;s most high profile liberal-left activist, a title he has stolen from his friend and fellow actor, Tim Robbins, who directed him in Dead Man Walking. In the last few years, even with that Oscar under his belt, he has become as famous - and, to the American Right, as infamous - for his outspoken opposition to George Bush as for his acting. In October 2002 he placed a three-quarter page advert in the Washington Post in the form of an open letter to Bush, castigating him for his policy on Iraq and his &apos;systematic destruction of civil liberties&apos;. It cost Penn $56,000, and earned him the opprobrium of the Right, who view him as the epitome of limousine liberalism. He incensed them further in August when he travelled to Venezuela to meet Bush-baiting President Hugo Chavez. &apos;I take a lot of flak,&apos; he says, grinning, &apos;but truth is stubborn. I ain&apos;t going to say it don&apos;t annoy me but, if the intention is to make me do it less, it&apos;s really going the other way.&apos; Does the flak just come from the right-wing media or does he get it from the public as well? He looks momentarily fazed. &apos;OK. Well, yeah. Sometimes it does. But mostly not. There&apos;s been about four incidents compared to the hundreds that are positive. The flak I do get is pretty violent. People just don&apos;t know what to do with themselves,&apos; he shrugs. (When American Esquire profiled him in September, calling Penn a great American, the readers&apos; response was overwhelmingly vituperative. They called him instead: &apos;the ultimate American hater&apos;, &apos;Communist scum&apos; and &apos;a traitorous un-American bastard&apos;.) He stares at the wall for a moment or two, shaking his head. &apos;I&apos;ll tell you something, when I got back from Baghdad the first time, I went straight to Memphis, Tennessee, where you might think I&apos;m going to get trouble. But you know what? The guys I came up against who didn&apos;t share my views were just like, &quot;We respect your right to disagree&quot;. Same with the soldiers in Baghdad. They said, &quot;That&apos;s what we&apos;re doing here. We&apos;re fighting for the right and the ability to disagree&quot;.&apos; Another pause. &apos;Most of the time it&apos;s people telling me to go for it, though. It&apos;s heartening, you know.&apos; Penn has visited Iraq twice since the war started, and wrote about his experiences for the San Francisco Chronicle. &apos;I don&apos;t know if this is true,&apos; he says, &apos;but I may have written the first published piece in mainstream journalism that actually explained what these contractors were up to over there. I went back and looked for information on this, and the word I kept hearing was &quot;oversight&quot;. Why weren&apos;t we finding out that people were building up these private militias out of the Pentagon with tax payers&apos; money? Oversight? In the media, nobody&apos;s watching this stuff, and it&apos;s eating away at our democracy.&apos; Essentially, Sean Penn is not so much a radical as a romantic idealist. The single-mindedness that drives the work also drives the politics. He believes in the ideal of a democratic America, where politicians must be held to account. &apos;The way I see it,&apos; Penn says, calmly, &apos;if you believe in democracy, you got to do something. We have people running the country now who really should be in prison for what they are doing to democracy. If you define our country by the constitution, we have enemies of the state in the White House, the defence department and the state department. That&apos;s where we are now.&apos; Where Penn is right now is intriguing, too, though. His most dramatic role in the last few years was the real-life drama he literally waded into when he headed to New Orleans on a one-man rescue mission straight after the levees burst and the city was flooded. Several residents owe their life to his intervention, and he became a hero of sorts when he appeared on television, mud-splattered and exhausted after his efforts, and castigated Bush and his government once more for their failure to respond quickly and determinedly to the crisis. &apos;That was slightly different,&apos; he says now. &apos;I had spent a lot of time down there - I had a lot of friends down there. It was just an instinctive reaction, you know, to just head down there and help. I didn&apos;t think about that too much.&apos; According to his wife, Robin Wright Penn, he doesn&apos;t tend to think too much about anything important before he does it. In Richard T Kelly&apos;s recent oral biography, Sean Penn: His Life and Times, she recalls her husband&apos;s sudden decision to visit Iraq for the first time in 2002. &apos;The idea came from nowhere, pretty much. But then I&apos;m used to that with Sean... He&apos;s not one to just sit back and let things happen... It&apos;s that part in him of his dad, and I back it all the way.&apos; Leo Penn, who died in 1998, is an abiding presence in his son&apos;s life, a key determinant not just of his fierce integrity as an actor and director but of the idealism that underpins his radical politics. Alongside his wife, Eileen Ryan Penn, a gifted actress and now painter, who starred in many long-running dramas, including Bonanza, and whom Kelly describes as &apos;a strong, shrewd, humorous, exuberant woman&apos;, Leo belonged to the old bohemian Left that flourished in California in the Forties. A decorated Second World War hero, he was blacklisted because of his radical politics, and his refusal to testify against his friends during House Un-American Activities Committee investigations. I ask Penn if he has inherited his father&apos;s ideals. He pauses, as he does every time the talk turns towards the personal. &apos;It would make sense, right?&apos; he replies, in that defensive way of his, then immediately softens. &apos;I mean, I would certainly be proud to attribute it to that but it&apos;s not a conscious thing.&apos; Sean, too, has had his run-ins with the government. For the last five years he has been under investigation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, an Orwellian-sounding body connected to the US treasury department. &apos;It&apos;s what they do to bicycle tourists who pass through Havana,&apos; he says, shrugging. &apos;The standard kind of threat. Cost me a lot of money, though. That&apos;s what they do, jack it all up, but I think I am out of the woods.&apos; In a recent New Yorker profile he revealed how friends of his in the Los Angeles Police Department tipped him off that he was under surveillance. I wonder if he ever feels threatened or scared. &apos;Well, at any point in time, all somebody has to do to shut you up is to dump a few kilos of heroin in the back of your car, and then mention to a cop that something might be there.&apos; Does he honestly think that sort of thing could happen? &apos;I know cases where it has happened. Look at Geronimo Pratt [a member of the Black Panthers, who had served in Vietnam. He was sentenced to life for a murder that was committed when he was under surveillance by the FBI in a different state]. He spent 27 years in prison before he was exonerated by their own surveillance evidence.&apos; He falls silent. &apos;You ask, could they do that to me? I think the reason they don&apos;t is that I haven&apos;t been a threat. I haven&apos;t been productive. I think they have won, and continue to win. For the moment I am a minor figure, and there has not been a major figure come up who has made a difference.&apos; For all that, there is little sense that he will stop trying to make a difference. When I contact Bono, who has been friends with Penn for more than 20 years, for a quote that might sum up Penn&apos;s character, I receive back by email a eulogy that, among other things, says, &apos;Sean Penn has a comedian&apos;s face that turns to flint when important stuff is at risk, like family, friendship, art, America... He is one of danger&apos;s great journalists, great company for an uphill hike. And he has a brain the size of Alaska and a bigger heart than he&apos;d like you to know.&apos; The Oscar Penn won in 2004 for his role as Jimmy Markum in Mystic River was a belated acknowledgement by the Hollywood establishment that he is an actor of singular talents, perhaps the only one of his peer group who stands comparison with the likes of Nicholson and de Niro. &apos;I think there is no one better of his generation,&apos; says biographer Kelly. &apos;His contemporaries look up to him as the man who sets the standards, and the giants who went before him regard him with the utmost respect. In every way he&apos;s an actor&apos;s actor.&apos; It is Penn&apos;s other career as a director, though, that has brought him to the UK. Into the Wild is an unapologetically romantic account of Chris McCandless&apos;s ill-fated Alaskan odyssey. It is a role, you suspect, Penn&apos;s younger self would have fought tooth and nail to play, a character whose wanderlust and extreme attempt at self-determination he identifies with wholeheartedly. &apos;Chris was a kid in search of a place to belong,&apos; he says, &apos;a place that would accept him as he was. His quest was a quest for goodness and purity. It woke up some stuff in me, for sure. I totally support his decision to go outside the comfort zone, even with all the risks he took. The way I see it, whatever it takes for you to be truly alive in this life, short of intentionally hurting someone else, you have to do.&apos; Penn first approached the McCandless family about dramatising their son&apos;s fatal adventure over 10 years ago, and stayed in contact with them while he worked on other projects. &apos;They were just not ready back then,&apos; he says. &apos;I told them then that I would never lose interest in the story. I think that&apos;s what I shared with them ultimately - even though it took them more time to arrive at it: the sense that this is a story that it is necessary to share with the world. I truly believe that.&apos; It is this tenacity coupled with an undimmed idealism that has made Penn a director whose films hum with a heartfelt intensity that is rare in American cinema these days. In the three films that preceded this one, The Indian Runner (1991), The Crossing Guard (1995) and The Pledge (2001), the austerity of his directorial vision was sometimes as gruelling as it was compelling. With Into the Wild, though, you sense he is becoming the great director he has willed himself to be since making the notoriously tricky leap from one side of the camera to the other. Whatever you may think of the film&apos;s often overwrought romanticism, it is an intensely cinematic experience, full of often visceral images that stick in the mind for days afterwards. And he has pulled a performance of such sustained intensity out of the 22-year-old Emile Hirsch that it makes you wonder if the young actor must not be altered in some way for having come through it. &apos;That was something I both warned him of and seduced him with,&apos; says Penn, smiling. &apos;It was even tougher than I had imagined though. Eight months of filming on location with no creature comforts. Miserable, really. He just stuck it out. I&apos;m not exaggerating - I think he went into it as a boy and came out a man.&apos; You do not have to spend too much time around Penn to detect what Richard Kelly calls his &apos;purity of purpose&apos;. In an age when actors, like everyone else, tend to compromise their integrity if the cheque is high enough, Penn has consistently chosen often demanding roles purely on the strength of the script. In Dead Man Walking he played Matthew Poncelet, a doomed killer on death row; in Casualties of War, the unravelling, war-damaged Sergeant Tony Meserve; in All the King&apos;s Men, the corrupt southern governor, Willie Stark. All these roles, alongside his chilling turn as Markum in Mystic River, drew on the fabled Sean Penn edge, that mixture of suppressed aggression and tentativeness that he still exudes, but not to anything like the degree he did when he was younger and struggling to define himself in Hollywood. Back then, his on-set rows with directors were the stuff of legend, and when not working he seemed intent on redefining the notion of the Hollywood hell raiser. Or, at least, that is the reputation that has dogged him ever since. &apos;I think he has been treated unfairly in that regard,&apos; says Kelly, who spent a considerable amount of time with Penn while researching his biography. &apos;The clashes he had with directors were always arguments of principle about the script. Then, unfortunately for him, the whole shroud of his first marriage fell over everything.&apos; Penn&apos;s tumultuous marriage to Madonna pitched him into a maelstrom of media attention and paparazzi intrusion that he seemed utterly unprepared for, and reacted against with a rage that landed him in jail twice. During the shooting of Shanghai Express, in which the couple co-starred, he famously dangled a press photographer from his ninth-floor hotel balcony. Later he was jailed for a month by a Californian court after he failed to keep to the terms of a probation order imposed on him for whacking an overzealous fan who harassed his wife. Kelly says: &apos;I don&apos;t think anyone else has ever felt the white heat of media attention in the way those two did in the Eighties when the whole aggressive celebrity culture that we are almost used to today was just starting. The paparazzi would constantly taunt him, or insult her in order to get a reaction from him. Most men would agree that there is a correct way to respond when someone insults your wife, and that&apos;s what he did.&apos; In 1996 Penn married the actress Robin Wright. They have two children, a daughter, Dylan Frances, and a son, Hopper Jack. They family home is in Ross, California. Last year his brother, Chris, an actor who shone in Short Cuts and as Nice Guy Eddie in Reservoir Dogs, died after taking a mixture of prescribed and proscribed drugs. &apos;It was a natural death, Sean Penn said later, &apos;but a natural death brought on by hard living.&apos; Penn makes it clear without saying so that his personal life is out of bounds. It is tempting to conclude that the anger that fuelled the younger Penn back in those tumultuous days is now channelled into his activism. When I suggest this, albeit in a roundabout way, he stiffens. &apos;You know what?&apos; he says, after a long pause, &apos;Who cares? It&apos;s like, whatever it takes to get me to do the right thing at the time is fine by me, whether that is anger or whatever. Anger can be a problem but it has tremendous potential too. It&apos;s just figuring out what to do with it.&apos; Last year John Lahr wrote a long, and positive, profile of Penn in the New Yorker. When I mention it, Penn fires me a black look. &apos;Oh, he was fulla shit. I spent time with him, and he was bright, and it came over as a pro-Sean Penn piece, but it was really the autobiography of John Lahr. Let&apos;s just say, he&apos;s a whole lot more interested in Freud than I am, and you&apos;d have to assume that he knows me a whole lot better than I do to go along with the thrust of that piece.&apos; Point taken. There is something essentially old-fashioned about Penn, about the idealism, the romanticism, even the machismo and the anger. His commitment to whatever he believes, and willingness to put his head above the parapet, sticks out at a time when celebrity culture is dominant, and materialism and cynicism the norm. It comes as no surprise to hear that his close friends include the writers Sam Shepard and Cormac McCarthy, both also cut from a different, older, cloth, and whose writings, poetically dissect the great American myths. In writing and directing, Penn has found a way to do the same. Towards the end of the interview I ask if his heart is no longer in acting the way it once was - if directing has become his prime vocation. &apos;Oh hell, yeah,&apos; he answers, without hesitation. Which begs the inevitable question: could the greatest American actor of his generation walk away from the spotlight at the height of his game? And, even more intriguingly, could he then become one of the great American directors? &apos;Let&apos;s just say I&apos;m going to do two more movies, one with Gus Van Sant this year, and one with Terry Malick after that - because, you know, you can&apos;t say no to Terry Malick - but then I&apos;m going to take a long, long time to think about stuff. Let&apos;s just leave it at that.&apos; We do, but I really hope he doesn&apos;t. The cinema would be a less exciting place without him up there, lighting up the screen with his intensity. Long may he simmer and burn. \u00b7  Into the Wild opens on Friday Fast times &amp; past times Early life Born on 17 August 1960 to actor and director Leo Penn and actress Eileen Ryan. Studied at Santa Monica College along with future actors Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen and Rob Lowe. Film career Came to prominence in 1982 in his second film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, playing slacker Jeff Spicoli. Has starred in over 40 films and received a best actor Oscar in 2004 for Mystic River, as well as three other Oscar nominations. Personal life Married Madonna in 1985. They divorced in 1989 after a stormy relationship. Was jailed for 32 days in 1987 for assaulting an amateur photographer on the set of his film Colors. Began a relationship in 1989 with actress Robin Wright, whom he married in 1996. The couple have a teenage son and daughter and live in California. Penn&apos;s younger brother, Chris, an actor who played Nice Guy Eddie in Reservoir Dogs, died in 2006 of heart disease and the effects of a mix of multiple medications. Political engagement Took out an advertisement in the Washington Post in October 2002 calling on George Bush to abandon plans for an attack on Iraq. Penn also criticised the Bush administration for its erosion of civil liberties. Visited Iran in June 2005 to report on the country for the San Francisco Chronicle. Met Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in Caracas in August and praised him for his opposition to the Bush regime.

History will be made as China&apos;s biggest-ever share listing gets under way. But the flotation of a fraction of the shares in PetroChina - a subsidiary of state-run China National Petroleum (CNP) - to raise \u00a34.5bn is just half the story. Asia&apos;s biggest gas and oil company, which already has a listing in Hong Kong and New York, will quickly see its 4 billion shares double in value to 16.70 yuan each (\u00a31.08), turning PetroChina into the world&apos;s second-biggest company by stock market valuation, with a price tag of \u00a3200bn. Only Exxon Mobil will be bigger. But not for long: Beijing analysts are confident that within months, if not weeks, PetroChina will become number one. For its front-line adviser, UBS, the float ought to represent a triumph. It will be the first time a European bank has taken the lead on a major Chinese listing, and the deal will earn the Swiss bank tens of millions of pounds. But as bankers mix with Chinese power-brokers tomorrow, a growing storm of controversy is taking the gloss off UBS&apos;s Chinese coup and threatening to spill over into a worldwide row. Last week activists, including three Nobel peace prize winners, sent a letter to UBS urging the bank to request that China National Petroleum, PetroChina&apos;s parent, suspend its activities in crisis-hit Sudan. Swiss-based campaigners have sent a similar message. International concern is focusing on how proceeds from the oil industry are funding militia groups, who have contributed to the deaths of as many as 450,000 people in recent years. Questions are also being asked about PetroChina&apos;s operations in Burma, where it is under fire for investing over \u00a3500m in a pipeline project that will provide the military junta with an income of \u00a375m each year. Andreas Missbach, of Swiss campaign group The Berne Declaration, hopes the private banking clients of UBS will be moved to give up their investments with the bank, or raise serious questions about its involvement with firms linked to the Sudanese oil industry. Campaigners believe it was the Sudan link that prompted Warren Buffett to sell his 11 per cent shareholding in PetroChina last month. Buffett made a cool $3.5bn by bailing out, but it could have been a lot more - especially if the world&apos;s most powerful investor had waited until after this week&apos;s float. And Buffett is by no means the only investor to have pulled out of PetroChina. Fidelity, after pressure from activist groups, also announced in a filing in the US that it had sold 91 per cent of its American depositary receipts in PetroChina in the first quarter of 2007. UBS said that, as of last year, it no longer worked in Sudan and other repressive regimes. It accused campaigners of getting their facts wrong, saying that although CNP owned 88 per cent of PetroChina and shared key executives, the two firms were totally separate. It said that the proceeds of PetroChina&apos;s float would only be invested in China. It seems a new phase of campaigner activism is making headway. Two weeks ago, European pension funds withdrew almost \u00a3110m in investments from French oil company Total in a matter of days in protest at the company&apos;s involvement in Burma. The boycott is being led by pension funds in Denmark, which acted after Danish foreign affairs minister Per Stig Moller called for European Union sanctions on investment into the country. The Burma campaign is now targeting the insurance and banking industries, which help keep the brutal regime in power. Campaigners will focus on the Swift electronic trading network, which is owned jointly by most of the world&apos;s leading banks. Swift technology enabled the Burmese government to sidestep US economic sanctions imposed by George Bush, which four years ago banned the repressive regime from trading in dollars. The Burmese authorities decided to adopt euros instead. The change required a wholesale change in its electronic trading system, which Swift carried out on behalf of the junta. Activists will also heap more attention on Lloyd&apos;s of London for failing to prevent some of its stakeholders sharing the insurance risk on Burma&apos;s ports and aircraft. Lloyd&apos;s says it is just a marketplace and, as such, cannot tell its members what countries to trade in. &apos;There is a huge debate taking place within Europe&apos;s largest institutional investors about whether they should boycott companies with links to Sudan or Burma,&apos; says Hugh Wheelan, editor of Responsible Investor magazine. &apos;If they do, multinationals, particularly oil groups such as PetroChina, Total and Chevron, could potentially have billions of assets pulled from them.&apos; And for a bank like UBS, the damage to its reputation could be just as significant.", "tags": ["UBS", "Business", "Oil"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-04T23:48:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/04/china.theobserver", "sentences": ["Divorce rates are climbing steadily in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, where one in three marriages ends in failure."], "title": "Notebook: Beijing", "article": "&apos;Scored yet?&apos; That was the first question from several young adventurers crowded around a table at a bar in Lhasa, Tibet&apos;s colourful capital city. Between sips of yak butter tea, they trade jokes and swap tales about their latest sexual encounters. These twentysomethings on leave from city jobs could have been from anywhere in the world looking for spiritual enlightenment, romantic encounters, or both. But they were all from China, where such conversations and attitudes would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. &apos;Why not?&apos; said Sandy Li, a 28-year-old fashion designer from Beijing, lighting a cigarette from a candle and confessing that she took the trip to meet someone with no strings attached. &apos;Just for a bit of harmless fun. We don&apos;t have to behave ourselves here; we don&apos;t know anyone. Finding a proper boyfriend is a lot harder than finding a man you can go to bed with.&apos; Li&apos;s attitude is typical of many of the young urban middle class, whose slogan could well be carpe diem or rather carpe noctem. Apart from Lhasa, another popular pick-up place is Lijiang, in Yunnan province. Of course, people don&apos;t have to travel to far-flung places for casual sex. Your own flat would do. Less than 20 years ago, singles had little choice but to stay with their parents. Now cohabitation, like sex before marriage, is commonplace. Before a split six months ago, Li lived with her photographer boyfriend for three years but had never introduced him to her family. &apos;For my parents, bringing a boyfriend home means impending marriage. I am still young. I&apos;d like to make a splash in my career first, and explore what life can offer.&apos; &apos;The singles are not talking about marriages, and lovers aren&apos;t talking about the future,&apos; goes one popular saying among colleague students. And a joke describes the pattern of &apos;one-week&apos; relationships: &apos;On Monday, you send out vibes. Tuesday, you express true desire. Wednesday, you hold hands. Thursday, you sleep together. Friday, a feeling of distance sets in. Saturday, you want out. On Sunday, you start searching again.&apos; Youngsters&apos; unwillingness to settle down is causing great anxiety to the older generation. In Zhongshan Park, a stone&apos;s throw from the Forbidden City in Beijing, dozens of parents, armed with photographs and information about their children, gather and search for potential partners. Some even go &apos;eight-minute speed dating&apos; on behalf of children who themselves will be chatting and flirting on the internet. &apos;Today&apos;s young people are probably more sexually charged than their parents&apos; generation,&apos; said Susie Huang, author of All About Susie, a collection of essays about the love and sex lives of today&apos;s burgeoning bourgeois. It&apos;s China&apos;s literary version of Sex and the City. &apos;To start with, it&apos;s now safe to be naughty,&apos; she said. &apos;Before you might have landed in a labour camp for conducting an extramarital affair.&apos; But is it safe? A more tolerant social environment has led many to experiment in uncharted waters, with mixed results. Divorce rates are climbing steadily in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, where one in three marriages ends in failure. Syphilis has skyrocketed, with a 25-fold increase since the early 1990s. And extra-marital affairs are now common. Maybe Muzi Mei, a former sex blogger, is an extreme example of today&apos;s restless and hedonistic crowds. Her site used to attract 10 million visitors a day before it was shut down by the government in 2003. Officials objected to her online diary, which explicitly detailed her exploits. She was forced to resign from her Guangzhou-based magazine as a sex columnist and now works for a website, but still continues her man-hopping ways. &apos;My sex life is very interesting. Some may find it educational as well as entertaining,&apos; said the 29-year-old journalist over a bowl of steaming soup in a Beijing restaurant. &apos;I sleep with lots of men because I don&apos;t want to be imprisoned in one relationship,&apos; she declared to the giggles of eavesdropping waitresses. &apos;I am a free spirit.&apos; She is also a romantic. In her magazine she offered tips on creating the right environment on a date and suggested playing your favourite music while making love. There are books available too, offering step-by-step guides to dating, from basic advice such as not spitting to sending flowers on Valentine&apos;s Day. Kissing, something the Chinese people once saw only in foreign films, is now part of the landscape. A recent cover story in the national News Weekly concluded that &apos;China&apos;s love life is in a stage of revelry, featuring the emphasis on sex rather than love; on physical pleasure rather than spiritual fulfilment&apos;. Susie Huang thinks she knows why: &apos;It is a globalisation of some sort: China is becoming more westernised.

For any absenteeism would let in Argentina&apos;s David Nalbandian, who yesterday underlined that he is currently the most dangerous player on the planet by defeating Nadal 6-4, 6-0 in the final of the BNP Paribas Masters. He thus completed back-to-back Masters titles, the former Wimbledon runner-up having beaten Federer in the Madrid final two weeks ago. In the Spanish capital Nalbandian had also defeated Nadal in the quarter-finals, dropping only three games, while by the banks of the Seine last week he dispatched Federer in the third round. It has been astonishing tennis by the 25-year-old who in his previous 15 tournaments this year had managed to reach just one quarter-final. Nalbandian slipped through the back door as a late reserve for the Tennis Masters Cup two years ago and promptly won it, coming from two sets down in the final against Federer. On a slow centre court in the Palais Omnisports, Nadal had been expected to have the edge. After all, this city is the Spaniard&apos;s second home, the 21-year-old having won three French Open titles in succession at Roland Garros. This was his first appearance in what used to be called the Paris Indoor Open, and there seemed every likelihood that his unbeaten record in Paris would be maintained but once the score reached 4-4 in the opening set Nalbandian was unstoppable, breaking Nadal&apos;s serve four times as he reeled off nine consecutive games. It is rare for the young Spaniard to be so outclassed, though this was brilliant tennis by Nalbandian who continually found cross-court angles of explosive impudence. The Argentinian was inspired. Knee and back problems hampered Nalbandian this year right through to the US Open when he finally felt injury-free. If he could maintain this form then clearly he would become a huge threat in all the slams next year, although the five-set format has frequently been his undoing. He has always been a great returner; the clear difference over the last few weeks has been the quality of his serve, something he has been working on with his new coach and fellow countryman, Mart\u00edn Jaite, whom he ran to embrace at the end of yesterday&apos;s final. So, having defeated Federer and Nadal in consecutive tournaments, could he challenge for the No1 spot? &quot;You have to play like this all season on clay, hard, grass and indoors,&quot; said Nalbandian. &quot;I think the only guy who can do that is Roger.&quot;", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Rafael Nadal"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-05T02:48:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/05/china", "sentences": [" PetroChina, China&apos;s largest oil and gas producer, became the world&apos;s first trillion dollar company today after floating on the Shanghai stock market.", "&quot;The opening price is really too high as far as PetroChina&apos;s corporate fundamentals are concerned,&quot; industry analyst Wang Jing at Orient Securities in Shanghai told Reuters.", "China&apos;s growing army of small investors are still restricted from trading shares on overseas markets, and this has helped the benchmark Shanghai index more than triple in the last year."], "title": "PetroChina becomes world's biggest company", "article": " PetroChina, China&apos;s largest oil and gas producer, became the world&apos;s first trillion dollar company today after floating on the Shanghai stock market.

Another factor behind PetroChina&apos;s huge market valuation is that just 2% of its shares were floated on Monday.

The Hang Seng&apos;s fall was caused by hints from Chinese prime minister Wen Jiabao that Beijing is planning the launch of a programme allowing China&apos;s population to buy shares directly on the Hong Kong index. Mr Wen reportedly said that the individual investor scheme cannot launch without extra conditions to prevent a flow of capital away from China&apos;s domestic stock markets. According to some reports, one factor pushing down the FTSE was concern that property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, a major Sainsbury shareholder, may now be forced to reduce his stakes in other companies to cover losses and margin calls. Several companies in which Mr Tchenguiz owns a significant shareholding, including pub chain Mitchells &amp; Butlers, fell sharply this morning.", "tags": ["Business"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-05T17:01:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/nov/05/features11.g2", "sentences": ["At the 2007 World Championships in Shanghai, Michael Rosenberg and his wife Debbie reached the finals of their respective events, the Open and the Women&apos;s series."], "title": "Zia Mahmood: Bridge", "article": "At the 2007 World Championships in Shanghai, Michael Rosenberg and his wife Debbie reached the finals of their respective events, the Open and the Women&apos;s series.

It was defeated by the complexity of the new generation of structured financial products. It lost the ability to price risk accurately. It is not alone in these failings but, even allowing for Citigroup&apos;s size, the scale of its write-offs is enormous - an extra $8bn (\u00a34bn) to $11bn. The point to remember is that these sums are only running estimates. As Citigroup itself said, the actual impact on its full-year results &quot;will depend on future market developments and could differ materially from the range above&quot;. That catch-all phrase - &quot;market developments&quot; - is worth examining. A few weeks ago the US Federal Reserve estimated that the eventual blow to banks from the sub-prime fall-out could be $100bn. The figure seemed huge at the time, but not now. As Citigroup&apos;s statement made clear, the damage is now being felt in asset-backed securities that were regarded as top quality a few weeks ago - like the &quot;super senior&quot; tranches, as the bank described them. If so, $100bn looks conservative. The bears say $250bn is more like it. The uber-bears say twice or even three times that. We&apos;re not there yet, and - if you&apos;re an optimist - even Citigroup&apos;s extra hit can be viewed as consistent with a total market impact of about $150bn. The actual outcome, as Citigroup also said, will depend partly on house prices in the US. At the moment, though, there is no sign of an upturn on that front. Settle back: it is a reasonable guess that more bankers will lose their jobs and reputations before this tale is over. Waste of time The Qatar Investment Authority did not walk away from Sainsbury&apos;s at the 11th hour. It was more like two minutes to midnight. In the eyes of the City, that is so late it is indecent. It will be some time before the investment body is again taken seriously in London as a buyer of companies. Too many people&apos;s time has been wasted. Lest we forget, advertising the Gulf state&apos;s supposed attraction as a responsible custodian of assets was meant to be part of the plot here. If even the Sainsbury family members - sceptical, and conscious of their duties towards staff - could be persuaded to sell, then Qatar would gain a feather in its cap. In fact, that hard work had been done. A deal in principle with the pension fund was in place, and the Sainsburys themselves were about to fall in line. So what killed the bid? Was it the slide in the dollar, the currency in which Qatar earns its billions from natural gas? Was there a falling out with Paul Taylor, the financier who heads the Delta fund that was fronting the bid? Or was it pure fatigue, given that this saga has been running since July. We may never know the full details, but the official explanation - the \u00a3500m increase in funding costs - cannot be the whole story. Only a few weeks ago the QIA was happily saying it would inject more equity if necessary. An extra \u00a3500m in the context of a \u00a311bn bid is not much if your pockets are deep and if your avowed aim is to own the asset for at least a decade. Something happened. Aside from looking amateurish, the QIA, having bought 25% of Sainsbury&apos;s at about 582p a share, is \u00a3600m down on its investment. It can afford to be patient, as can the family members with their 18%. Poor old Robert Tchenguiz, with 10%, must speak for himself but it&apos;s no use blaming others; there was a neon-lit clue when savvy value investors like Brandes got out of Sainsbury&apos;s. At some point the three big shareholding blocks will probably come together. But how, and when, is anybody&apos;s guess. It&apos;s taken about a year to reach this ownership mess; finding a route out could take even longer. Crash beckons PetroChina yesterday became the world&apos;s first trillion-dollar company - sort of. The valuation is based on the company&apos;s new listing in Shanghai, where small Chinese investors are clearly barking mad. Yesterday they were buying PetroChina shares at 150% above the price prevailing in Hong Kong, home of the main listing. In Honkers, PetroChina is a $420bn enterprise. So the Shanghai market lives in la-la land. The stock market bubble there is old news, but the PetroChina example illustrates how painful the crash will be when it comes. The locals&apos; faith seems to rest on a belief that the government would not allow a market catastrophe before next summer&apos;s Olympics in Beijing. That&apos;s a good reason for thinking the crash will arrive rather sooner. nils.pratley@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Business"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-06T23:47:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/06/highereducation.internationaleducationnews", "sentences": ["Nottingham University is still waiting for its teacher from Fudan University in Shanghai to arrive."], "title": "China's Confucius Institutes: cultural or political bodies?", "article": "There have been some strange goings-on in the sleepy Welsh town of Lampeter lately. First, the Chinese flag was seen fluttering above the university&apos;s main building. Then, Chinese lanterns were spotted adorning campus premises on the high street. And a fortnight ago, the vice-chancellor was seen in a tie patterned with Chinese dragons. The University of Wales, Lampeter, is the latest university in the UK to open a Confucius Institute - the Chinese government&apos;s equivalent of the British Council, Alliance Francaise or Goethe-Institut. At Lampeter&apos;s Confucius Institute, the university&apos;s students, the town&apos;s 2,000 or so inhabitants, and scores of others from Wales and beyond will have the chance to learn about things Chinese, from the Mandarin language to the making of tea and the principles of feng shui. The Confucius Institutes organise cultural exchanges, breakfasts to discuss doing business in China, exhibitions, and language taster days in local primary and secondary schools. The institutes are popping up everywhere. By the end of last year, there were more than 120 in at least 50 countries. Lampeter&apos;s is the 10th to open in the UK since 2005, when the initiative started here. Admittedly, the other institutes in the UK are in big cities. Manchester, Cardiff, Nottingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh all have one. London has four. Chinese foreign policy The Asia Times has described their proliferation as reflecting a &quot;sea change in China&apos;s foreign policy&quot;. Others say it shows the scale of ambition of a country some believe will rival the US in world power. However, cultural institutions are hardly new. The Alliance Francaise, Goethe-Institut and British Council have been around for years. But historically they have been independent. The Confucius Institutes in the UK are all part of universities - except for one that is based in schools under the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust. Universities do separate their Confucius Institutes from the activities of their Chinese studies departments, such as teaching and researching Chinese politics. Nevertheless, some experts are not comfortable with receiving money to spread Chinese government propaganda, as they see it. The institutes are funded by the Chinese government&apos;s Language Council International - known as the Hanban. Jocelyn Chey, a visiting professor in Chinese studies and a former Australian diplomat in China and Hong Kong, is worried the institutes are an attempt to convey a certain limited view of China. In a soon to be published paper, Confucius Redux: Chinese &quot;Soft Power&quot; Cultural Diplomacy and the Confucius Institutes, she writes: &quot;Scholars around the world already research Chinese economic, political and social development and have reached generally fair, unbiased and comprehensive conclusions that have been well publicised in the international academic press. The Confucius Institute programme, in so far as it supports culture and outreach, may be valuable. In so far as it aims to promote academic research in Chinese studies, it is fundamentally flawed because of its close links with the Chinese government and party. At best, it will result in a dumbing down of research; at worst, it will produce propaganda.&quot; Not so, says the vice-chancellor of Lampeter, Professor Robert Pearce. &quot;We have seen no evidence of the Chinese government using the university as a propaganda tool through the Confucius Institute. Lampeter is a relatively quiet place. Our belief is that we need to offer an education that gives us an international and national reputation. Our future and that of our grandchildren are going to depend on Britain trading with China. If we don&apos;t build links now, Britain has a very bleak future.&quot; Professor Xinzhong Yao, director of the Confucius Institute at Lampeter, agrees. &quot;We make it very clear that we are independent of the Chinese government. We will not compromise our views on Chinese politics because we have a Confucius Institute.&quot; But it would be naive to say that this wasn&apos;t an issue at all for Confucius Institutes, says Tim Wright, professor of Chinese studies and executive board member of the Confucius Institute at Sheffield University. &quot;China is less democratic than Britain or Germany. And because there are partnerships with universities in China, the independence is less clearcut. But the Chinese government is well aware of the danger of Confucius Institutes being perceived in this way. We are given more or less a free rein to do what we want. We ask what the weaknesses of China are, as well as the strengths. Someone who wished to undermine China might not be welcome at the institute, but then the British Council didn&apos;t exactly put on talks about the IRA.&quot; Dr George Zhang, director of the Confucius Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, says the institutes are simply the Chinese government&apos;s way of making new friends. &quot;China is not trying to take over the world. We don&apos;t have those sorts of ambitions. We invented gunpowder, but we used it for fireworks, not for missiles. The economic growth is there, it&apos;s about making friends.&quot; Most of the institutes seem to steer clear of Chinese politics. Many, like Nottingham&apos;s, teach Chinese in local schools. The Confucius Institute at London South Bank University, which opens in September next year, plans to run courses in Chinese medicine and Chinese massage. Soas offers classes on Chinese calligraphy and how to make Chinese tea. The London School of Economics Confucius Institute, which opened in September, aims to promote Chinese for business. One of Lampeter&apos;s goals is to get 30 to 40 more Chinese students to its campus a year and to build &quot;a bridge between China and Wales&quot;. Financial uncertainty Indoctrination may not be seen as a potential problem, but financial stability is. The Chinese government gives each university approximately \u00a350,000 to set up a Confucius Institute and promises the same amount for two more years. But what about long-term funding, asks Shujie Yao, head of the school of contemporary Chinese studies at Nottingham University. &quot;There is some uncertainty as to how the institutes are going to be financed long-term,&quot; he says. &quot;In Nottingham we are very keen to make the institute work - it&apos;s part of the university&apos;s strategy. My worry is it will take too long to get the institute into full gear because it is hard to get teachers to come and there is a shortage of Mandarin teachers.&quot; &quot;I share this concern,&quot; says Yao of Lampeter&apos;s institute. &quot;The Chinese government has set aside a lot of money for Confucius Institutes. But how long will that continue? I worry about the institutes across the world. What will happen after three years? Will they continue to send teachers from China to our universities?&quot; Wright says: &quot;If the expectation is that the institutes will self-fund after three years, that is totally unrealistic. The Chinese government has to accept that these institutes will require funding for a substantial period of time, 10 to 20 years perhaps.&quot; Confucius Institutes in the UK each have a partner university in China for teacher and student exchanges. Relationships with some of these institutions are already under strain. Sheffield University says it wants more say over which teacher is appointed. Nottingham University is still waiting for its teacher from Fudan University in Shanghai to arrive. These are mere teething problems perhaps. The first secretary for education at the Chinese embassy, Pinwei Qi, says: &quot;there have been no problems. Many people want to learn about China and the Chinese language.&quot; For the moment, Confucius Institutes are flavour of the month. And not just in education circles.

The energy company&apos;s soaring valuation underlines the frenzy among Chinese investors for new stock despite concerns that a bubble has formed in the country&apos;s closed equity markets. In scenes reminiscent of the dotcom boom, heavy demand saw the shares race up from the flotation price of 16.7 yuan (107p) to 43.96 yuan by the close, giving the group a market capitalisation of about $1 trillion (\u00a3480bn). At that level it accounts for almost a quarter of the entire Shanghai A-share market. As well as leapfrogging ExxonMobil - whose $480bn market capitalisation had previously made it the world&apos;s biggest company by market value - PetroChina found itself worth nearly twice as much as Royal Dutch Shell and BP combined. China now has five of the world&apos;s 10 most valuable companies. China Mobile, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Life Insurance and Sinopec join PetroChina in the top ranks. Analysts said that PetroChina, which is already listed in Hong Kong, was benefiting from soaring oil and gas prices but cautioned that the stock was also fuelled by speculators seeking a quick profit. One factor behind PetroChina&apos;s huge market valuation is that only 2% of its shares were floated yesterday. China&apos;s growing army of small investors are still restricted from trading shares on overseas markets, and this has helped the benchmark Shanghai index increase almost sixfold in the past two years. Several analysts warn that China&apos;s stock-market boom is a bubble that will soon burst. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned in May that China&apos;s stock market was due a &quot;dramatic correction&quot;. Since then the market has gained another 35%. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has also expressed concern about China, warning that its markets were &quot;too hot&quot;. Mr Buffett has been a significant investor in PetroChina, but will not profit from yesterday&apos;s flotation. In October he revealed he had sold his entire stake in the company. Despite the warnings from Buffet and others that prices are excessive, the Chinese authorities have restricted themselves to watching with a wary eye. At the weekend, prime minister Wen Jiabao said the government would take measures to prevent bubbles forming. The China Securities Regulatory Commission ordered securities funds to avoid &quot;blind expansion&quot; or speculative activities. But amid a widespread belief that the government will not allow a major decline in stock values before the 2008 Olympics, the appetite of investors for new shares shows little sign of abating.

But are these tables useful? Not very, according to a study published last month in the open access journal BioMedCentral Medicine. In fact, the study goes so far as to say they are misleading and should be abandoned. Researchers looked at THES&apos;s 2006 world university rankings and the Shanghai Jiao Tong University academic ranking of world universities. Their study found that only 133 institutions were shared between the top 200 lists of the Shanghai and Times rankings - four of the top 50 in the Shanghai list did not even appear among the first 500 universities of the THES ranking. The study&apos;s authors argued that such discrepancies stem from poor methodology and inappropriate indicators, making the ranking systems invalid. The Shanghai system measures research excellence partly by the number of Nobel and Fields winning alumni at the institution, but these do not guarantee a good undergraduate education, and reveal far more about an institution&apos;s prowess at poaching prestigious awardees. The THES ranking places great emphasis on the results of a survey sent out to more than 190,000 researchers who list what they think are the top 30 universities in their field of research. Fair enough, but its flaw is that it is entirely opinion-based and has a response rate below 1% - and this may contain significant bias, the researchers said. Perhaps naively, the authors called for a global collaboration to standardise data on key aspects of universities and other institutions, and any flaws should be openly admitted and not underestimated.

Brian Gilbertson, then chief executive of BHP, recommended to his board four years ago that the world&apos;s largest diversified miner should join forces with Rio but the idea was vetoed and Mr Gilbertson left soon after. One of the surprises about the latest move has been that the new boss, Marius Kloppers, has proceeded so quickly with the takeover plan. He has only been in the top job for a matter of weeks, having taken over from Mr Gilbertson&apos;s successor, Chip Goodyear, on October 1. Equity analysts, particularly at the US investment bank Citigroup, have been arguing for some time that a merger should really be considered again. When Rio Tinto launched its successful bid for the Canadian steelmaker Alcan in May this year, there was chatter about whether BHP could fall victim to private-equity buyers. But Clarke Wilkins at Citigroup argued in a note that it made sense for BHP to bulk up and buy what was perceived as a considerably undervalued Rio &quot;given synergies and nationalistic control issues with Australian assets&quot;. BHP and Rio, vital components of the London Stock Exchange, both have dual company structures \u2014 with headquarters in Australia and Britain. That satisfies Australian political pride and could help win round regulators, but makes a tie-up operationally more complex.  Not everyone agrees with Citigroup that the two companies make obvious stablemates. Charles Kernot, a mining analyst at Seymour Pierce, argued today that a tie-up &quot;did not make much sense&quot; for a variety of reasons, not least the regulatory ones. He fears a BHP bid being made at a premium but the necessary disposals made at a discount. Despite insistence from BHP that the competition issues can be handled through a series of careful disposals, Mr Kernot is convinced that US and European Union regulators would crawl all over such a deal and the Chinese would be horrified. There has already been speculation that some large state-owned fund such as Citic in China could make a counter-bid for Rio, or at least make sure that it can get its hands on any disposals. Iron ore will be at the centre of any political arguments because BHP and Rio are two of the three biggest producers (along with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil) and so vital to the steel-making industry and China&apos;s industrial revolution. Rio derives around 40% of its earnings from the huge iron ore mines around Pilbara in Western Australia and some commodity analysts have predicted that iron ore prices \u2014 already at very high levels \u2014 could surge a further 50% over the next 12 months. The specialist mining website MineWeb ran a story this week under the headline &quot;iron ore gold rush&quot; highlighting how one smaller miner, Australian Resources, witnessed a 15% rise in its share price on Wednesday after saying it planned to focus entirely on iron ore. But it is not just iron ore that matters to BHP. The company has a huge involvement in the uranium market at a time when these prices have also shot up, triggered by a resurgence in the building of nuclear power stations. BHP and Rio are also both big producers of copper and the kind of coking coal that is needed to fire blast furnaces in the steel-making sector.  BHP&apos;s move on Rio is the latest in a rush of consolidation in the mining sector driven by the commodity boom that was triggered by increasing demand from China but now also includes India and other Asian nations. In August, BHP reported a 21% increase in its annual pre-tax profits to $18bn as the company benefited from record prices for several of its products. The stainless steel materials division soared 310% on the back of a spike in nickel prices and the company said it expected 10% growth in the Chinese economy over the next year. The strength of the boom has spurred the Shanghai stock exchange to new heights while New York and London have been badly hit by fall-out from the sub-prime lending crisis in America. PetroChina became the first trillion-dollar company this week when it launched an initial public offering in Shanghai but there have been repeated warnings from leading financial figures that the Chinese stock market is vastly overvalued. And critics fear that if the bubble did burst, the impact on mining companies such as BHP would be extensive. China accounts for 20% of the company&apos;s sales and the success of any acquisition of Rio largely depends on demand remaining strong.", "tags": ["Mining", "Business", "BHP Billiton", "Rio Tinto"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-08T16:18:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/09/tennis.comment", "sentences": ["It may be seen as apposite that with the men&apos;s end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup about to begin in Shanghai this Sunday the game is currently almost deafened by Chinese whispers.", "They still don&apos;t know what happened.&quot; De Villiers and members of the ITF and the Grand Slam Committee are scheduled to meet next week in Shanghai, where Davydenko will be taking part in the Tennis Masters Cup."], "title": "Steve Bierley: Game must get its chaotic house in order after spate of scandals", "article": "It may be seen as apposite that with the men&apos;s end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup about to begin in Shanghai this Sunday the game is currently almost deafened by Chinese whispers. The latest and most bizarre story concerns the possibility that Tommy Haas, a player hardly renowned for his fortitude of body or spirit under pressure, was poisoned prior to Germany&apos;s Davis Cup semi-final defeat against Russia in September. &quot;We take this very seriously,&quot; said the International Tennis Federation spokeswoman, Barbara Travers. &quot;The investigation starts today.&quot; It was the same statement the sport&apos;s top brass have been uttering ad infinitum over the past few months as scandal after scandal has rocked the game. Wimbledon may remain predominantly white but all shades of grey, it seems, are currently flooding over, through and around the net. Martina Hingis tested positive for cocaine. Russia&apos;s Nikolay Davydenko, already under investigation for involvement in an alleged match-fixing scam in Poland, was fined for not trying in St Petersburg. The French kicked out spectators with laptops at the Paris Masters last week in a betting crackdown. British juniors were suspended for posting party pictures on the internet, and a British coach was jailed for molesting a junior. Meanwhile, or so it has seemed, every other male player has a story about being approached to lose matches, and this after the ATP, the men&apos;s ruling body, initially suggested match-fixing was an invention of the media. Suddenly the genteel &quot;Anyone for tennis?&quot; strawberries-and-cream-on-the-vicarage-lawn world of tennis - itself a marketing myth created by Wimbledon to disguise the corporate troughing - has been scattered to the four winds, even if the PR and marketing men and women are currently rubbing their hands and marvelling at the sport&apos;s newly discovered sex, drugs and rock and roll image. Forget the tirades of John McEnroe and Ilie Nastase, or the teens and pre-teens chasing Bjorn Borg&apos;s short shorts and golden tresses - this is the real thing. Haas poisoned? You betcha. The tennis authorities, rarely the fastest-moving organisations in the world, have been left looking more dilatory than usual. This is a sport complicated by the fact that four organisations preside over it. These are the ITF, which is the overall ruling body, the ATP, the WTA, the women&apos;s ruling body, and the Grand Slam Committee, representing the interests of Wimbledon and the three other majors in Australia, France and the United States. To see them move as a coordinated force is a rarity, and individual pronouncements occasional beggar belief. The need for a tennis commissioner to oversee the sport has never been so compelling. Etienne de Villiers, the ATP president who previously worked with the Disney corporation and is referred to in a less than flattering way as &quot;Mickey&quot; by many of the players, has been acting tough. He told a sports business conference in London last week that tennis was being seriously threatened by match-fixing and gambling syndicates. &quot;As far as we are concerned, if they are involved in match-fixing they will be thrown out.&quot; Yet this is the same organisation, 50% owned by the players, which at the beginning of the year fined Davydenko five times more for criticising the way the sport was run than, more recently, for not trying. It is also the body that mismanaged the nandrolone scandal four years ago, so that to this day it is believed that ATP trainers inadvertently administered the drug through contaminated substances, even though this was never proved. De Villiers&apos; assertion last week that a lot of doping came down to &quot;accidental or third-party influences&quot; was scarcely believable, and it was little wonder that Dick Pound, outgoing head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said some federations did not have the stomach for the fight. De Villiers may have been talking a hard line on match-fixing but, with the Davydenko issue still unresolved, the fact that the world No4 had lambasted the ATP president in Monte Carlo this year, suggesting he knew nothing about the game, has led some to wonder if the Russian is at the centre of a witch-hunt. It seemed so last week in Paris when the French umpire C\u00e9dric Mourier appeared to be telling Davydenko, whose game was malfunctioning, how to serve. A spokesman for the ATP brushed the matter off as a normal conversation but it was unclear whether an edict had gone out with regard to Davydenko&apos;s play. The supervisors took no action. Davydenko&apos;s lawyer, Frank Immenga, placed further pressure on De Villiers and the ATP yesterday when he revealed that a Scotland Yard investigator, hired by the ATP, had told him that the Russian holders of nine betting accounts stood to share \u00a3725,000 on Davydenko&apos;s match in Poland against Argentina&apos;s Mart\u00edn Vassallo. &quot;We have done everything possible,&quot; Immenga said. &quot;The question is, what is the ATP doing? They still don&apos;t know what happened.&quot; De Villiers and members of the ITF and the Grand Slam Committee are scheduled to meet next week in Shanghai, where Davydenko will be taking part in the Tennis Masters Cup. All parties need to tread extremely carefully, because tennis has never been under such forensic scrutiny.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-09T00:07:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/09/mining1", "sentences": ["The strength of the boom has spurred the Shanghai stock exchange to new heights while New York and London have been badly hit by fallout from the sub-prime lending crisis.", "PetroChina became the first trillion-dollar company this week when it launched an initial public offering in Shanghai but there have been repeated warnings from financial figures that the Chinese stock market is vastly overvalued."], "title": "How China's insatiable demand made a takeover bid irresistible", "article": "Revelations of the potential mega-merger between BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto took investors by surprise yesterday, but the idea is far from new. Brian Gilbertson, then chief executive of BHP, recommended to his board four years ago that the world&apos;s largest diversified miner should join forces with Rio but the idea was vetoed and Mr Gilbertson left soon after. One of the surprises about the latest move has been that Marius Kloppers has proceeded so quickly with the takeover plan. He has only been in the top job for a matter of weeks, having taken over from Mr Gilbertson&apos;s successor, Chip Goodyear, on October 1. The sector has been gripped by mergers amid a commodity boom. Rio Tinto itself bought Alcan of Canada for $38bn (\u00a318bn) this year and the Anglo-Swiss group Xstrata swallowed Falconbridge for $4.5bn last year. Rusal and Sual - both of Russia - merged with Glencore to create the world&apos;s biggest aluminium group and Freeport-McMoran Copper &amp; Gold bought Phelps Dodge Corporation for $25.9bn to create the world&apos;s largest stock-listed copper company. Equity analysts, particularly at Citigroup, have been arguing for some time that a merger between BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto should be considered again. Clarke Wilkins at Citigroup argued that it made sense for BHP to bulk up and buy what was perceived as a considerably undervalued Rio &quot;given synergies and nationalistic control issues with Australian assets&quot;. BHP and Rio, powerhouses of the London Stock Exchange, both have dual company structures - with headquarters in Australia and Britain. That satisfies Australian political pride and could help win round regulators, but makes a tie-up operationally more complex.  Not everyone agrees with Citigroup that the two companies make obvious stablemates. Charles Kernot, a mining analyst at Seymour Pierce, argued yesterday that a tie-up &quot;did not make much sense&quot; for a variety of reasons, not least the regulatory ones. He fears a BHP bid being made at a premium but the necessary disposals made at a discount. Despite insistence from BHP that the competition issues can be handled through a series of careful disposals, Mr Kernot is convinced that US and European Union regulators would crawl all over such a deal and the Chinese would be horrified. Iron ore will be at the centre of any political arguments because BHP and Rio are two of the three biggest producers (along with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil) and so vital to the steel-making industry and China&apos;s industrial revolution. Some commodity analysts have predicted that ore prices - already at very high levels - could surge a further 50% over the next 12 months. The specialist mining website MineWeb ran a story this week under the headline &quot;iron ore gold rush&quot; highlighting how one smaller miner, Australian Resources, witnessed a 15% rise in its share price on Wednesday after saying it planned to focus entirely on iron ore. But it is not just iron ore that matters to BHP. The company has a huge involvement in the uranium market at a time when these prices have also shot up, triggered by a resurgence in the building of nuclear power stations. BHP and Rio are also both big producers of copper and the kind of coking coal that is needed to fire blast furnaces.  BHP&apos;s move on Rio is the latest in a rush of consolidation in the mining sector driven by the commodity boom that was triggered by increasing demand from China but now also includes India and other Asian nations. In August, BHP reported a 21% increase in its annual pre-tax profits to $18bn as the company benefited from record prices for several of its products. The stainless steel materials division soared 310% on the back of a spike in nickel prices and the company said it expected 10% growth in the Chinese economy over the next year. The strength of the boom has spurred the Shanghai stock exchange to new heights while New York and London have been badly hit by fallout from the sub-prime lending crisis. PetroChina became the first trillion-dollar company this week when it launched an initial public offering in Shanghai but there have been repeated warnings from financial figures that the Chinese stock market is vastly overvalued. And critics fear that if the bubble did burst, the impact on mining companies would be extensive. China accounts for 20% of BHP&apos;s sales and the success of any acquisition of Rio largely depends on demand remaining strong.", "tags": ["BHP Billiton", "Rio Tinto", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Mining", "China", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-09T23:54:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/10/china.mainsection", "sentences": ["Hong Kong is no longer the world&apos;s busiest port - that position is held by Singapore, and both ports will soon be overtaken by Shenzhen and Shanghai - but 500 ships still call here every week, mainly to load the machine-made products of Guangdong, the province in southern China that has become the factory to the world.", "This week Alibaba.com, a website connecting China&apos;s entrepreneurs to buyers and sellers in the rest of the world, raised $1.5bn in its first public offering on the Hong Kong exchange, while, thanks to feverish share-buying in Shanghai, the worth of PetroChina rose to more than a trillion dollars, the highest market capitalisation of any company in history."], "title": "Ian Jack: Land is to Hong Kong what oil is to a Gulf state", "article": "Having breakfast at my hotel in Hong Kong, 60 floors up, I looked down over the harbour and counted the ships. Two dozen of them were moving, bow waves and wakes creasing the narrows between Hong Kong island and Kowloon: ferries, tugs, barges, and a couple of Star Line liners returning through the mist from the overnight casino cruises that allow passengers to gamble legally outside Hong Kong&apos;s territorial waters. More ships were at anchor, awaiting their place at the container wharves. Hong Kong is no longer the world&apos;s busiest port - that position is held by Singapore, and both ports will soon be overtaken by Shenzhen and Shanghai - but 500 ships still call here every week, mainly to load the machine-made products of Guangdong, the province in southern China that has become the factory to the world. A hundred years ago the Thames was as crowded and just as befogged: in Hong Kong, the carbon emissions from those Guangdong factories and power stations drift south and east, so that for nearly a fifth of the annual daylight hours one side of Hong Kong harbour, which takes seven minutes to cross by ferry, is invisible to the other. But it was not Conrad&apos;s river that I thought about when I glanced at the newspapers and studied the view. At breakfast I thought about Detroit. On Wednesday General Motors reported a loss of $39bn (\u00a319bn), among the biggest ever for a multinational company, while British Airways announced that after 50 years of service it would stop flying to the city that was once the automotive trade&apos;s world capital and the sixth (by some estimates, the fourth) largest city in the US. Ford is said to be on the verge of bankruptcy, more than 320,000 workers have lost their jobs in American vehicle and auto-parts manufacturing in the past seven years. Detroit is a ruin to equal Grozny or Machu Picchu. From the air, you see a huddle of old skyscrapers surrounded by many acres of scrubland where the inner suburbs once stood. On the ground, the streets of downtown Detroit - represented aerially by the huddle of skyscrapers - are almost empty of cars and people. The abandoned railroad terminus rises in six storeys from an open plain of vacant lots. When I went there three years ago to see Diego Rivera&apos;s famous murals of car-making in the Detroit Institute of Arts, an old man approached me on the gallery steps to ask where I was from, lone strangers being so unusual as to be welcomed. Exemplifying the change in the world&apos;s balance of power by contrasting the fortunes of Detroit and Hong Kong is too crude a trick. Still, reading reports from the western world in Hong Kong is rather like hearing about a bitter winter from the vantage point of a warm spring. This week Alibaba.com, a website connecting China&apos;s entrepreneurs to buyers and sellers in the rest of the world, raised $1.5bn in its first public offering on the Hong Kong exchange, while, thanks to feverish share-buying in Shanghai, the worth of PetroChina rose to more than a trillion dollars, the highest market capitalisation of any company in history. General Motors&apos; loss equalled Bulgaria&apos;s gross domestic product; PetroChina&apos;s market value briefly (the shares went down) equalled the worth of all shares tradeable on the Russian stock exchange. The soundtrack to the harbour view is the noise of tower blocks being built, often on land reclaimed from the sea. The harbour has shrunk and goes on shrinking, and Hong Kong has exported most of its factories to Guangdong. What Hong Kong does more than ever is money. Turn away from the harbour and towards Hong Kong island&apos;s high ridge: the power of money rises vertically in tower after tower, sometimes topped off, retro-style, in simple versions of the Chrysler or Empire State buildings. Lost at the feet of these money towers is a domed building from the British era, passed on the street beside it by double-deck trams of the same vintage. This is the chamber of Hong Kong&apos;s legislative council, which Chris Patten did his best to democratise in his time as the colony&apos;s last governor. Ten years ago, the fear was that Beijing would trample all over it. In fact, the handover&apos;s &quot;one country, two systems&quot; solution has persisted. A proportion of the council is directly elected by public vote and Beijing has promised that the chief executive will be elected by universal suffrage from 2012. How strong, meanwhile, is the demand for democracy or the perception of Beijing oppression? A council by-election is scheduled to take place on December 2 and on Thursday I went to an election meeting at Hong Kong University&apos;s main hall. Eight candidates sat in a line across the stage, but only two of them really mattered. This is a contest between two women, Anson Chan and Regina Ip, both of them former senior civil servants in the British colonial administration (Chan was Patten&apos;s chief secretary). They represent the argument between &quot;democracy&quot; (Chan) and &quot;good governance&quot; (Ip), which is to say between government by the popular Hong Kong vote and government according to the wishes of the Communist leadership in Beijing. Ip is seen as Beijing&apos;s placewoman; Chan is the socially grander of the two and tried to have the meeting conducted in English rather than Cantonese. The hall was packed with students and television crews. The sparring between the two women was often applauded, though the level of discourse would strike anyone from Britain or the US as polite and brief. And it may be a mark of the absence of open argument in Hong Kong that the next day&apos;s front page headline in the South China Morning Post ran &quot;Ip, Chan go head to head in rough-and-tumble debate&quot;. Opinion polls have Chan and Ip running neck-and-neck, which suggests that &quot;democracy&quot; (and therefore Beijing disapproval) is not a popular cause. There may be historical reasons for that. Christine Loh, who runs Civic Exchange, a thinktank that produces lively insights and information on Hong Kong&apos;s politics and environment, says that a characteristic of former colonies is that they&apos;re accustomed to the idea that policy is decided elsewhere. &quot;Our bureaucratic structures are there to implement rather than make policy. We&apos;re used to commenting on policy, even criticizing policy, but we don&apos;t have a tradition of competing ideas.&apos; But the larger reason for content is surely money. By no means is everyone rich in Hong Kong. Nearly half of the population lives in public housing, and the people who shop in the many outlets of Armani, Vuitton and Marc Jacobs have often crossed from mainland China and places such as Dongguan, where this week Tony Blair was paid his $500,000 for speechifying at a new development of luxury villas. (Bill Clinton got only half that for a speech in Shenzhen five years ago: the &quot;progress of capitalism&quot; marches on in China and no mistake.) Every Hong Kong citizen, however, shares standards of public transport, schools, hospitals and general civic efficiency that would be unusual in mainland China. How does the government raise the money? Not from income tax with a marginal rate set to fall from 16% to 15%. The answer is land. Turn away from the sea view again and look down from another window at the white-painted cathedral of St John&apos;s. It sits on the only freehold plot in Hong Kong. The Crown claimed the rest of the colony, and now the government of the Special Administrative Region owns it, taking great dollops of leasehold rent and premiums from developers. Land is to Hong Kong what oil is to a Gulf state, which is why piles are being driven into the seashore and so much of the harbour has vanished. The revenues have sustained a long outbreak of peace.", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-10T23:47:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/11/tennis.stephenbierley", "sentences": ["Gasquet, playing this tournament for the first time, had cut short Andy Murray&apos;s late surge to Shanghai when he beat the Scot over three sets in the quarter-finals of the last Masters series event of the year in Paris 10 days ago."], "title": "Tennis: Rafael Nadal overcomes Richard Gasquet at the Tennis Masters Cup", "article": "Ideally, for the purposes of drama and tension, the world No1 spot should still be in doubt when the Tennis Masters Cup rounds off the season, but Roger Federer, winner of three slams this year to take his total to 12, ensured he could not be overtaken when he won his home tournament in Basel last month. Rafael Nadal&apos;s challenge had faded at the US Open when tendonitis in both knees brought him to a virtual standstill, although it was abundantly clear from his opening 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 round robin victory over Richard Gasquet of France that Rafa, those knees still bandaged, intends to remind everybody here that he remains the main threat to Federer. He has clung to Federer&apos;s coat-tails since July 2005, a couple of months after he had won the first of his three consecutive French Open titles, and will become the first player to finish at No2 for three consecutive years since the current ranking system was introduced in 1973. Had he beaten the Swiss in the Wimbledon final, and he came precious close, then the 21-year-old left-hander from Mallorca might well have toppled Federer this year. Victory here this week would go a long way to persuading Nadal that the seemingly impossible might be achieved next year. Gasquet, playing this tournament for the first time, had cut short Andy Murray&apos;s late surge to Shanghai when he beat the Scot over three sets in the quarter-finals of the last Masters series event of the year in Paris 10 days ago. He clearly took the decision against Nadal that there was no point trying to play percentage tennis. The Frenchman, just a couple of weeks younger than the Spaniard, went for his shots like a man possessed, and literally left the Nadal standing on occasions. Gasquet&apos;s backhand, a wonderful flowing shot, has always been an immense weapon, one that pinned Federer like an insect to a collector&apos;s board on the clay of Monte Carlo two years ago. Now he has added a forehand that is becoming increasingly more reliable under pressure, and was almost equally as spectacular as his backhand during the opening set. Nadal could only shake his head and knit his brows, waiting for the storm to subside a little. &quot;To beat Rafa you have to play a perfect match. I played a perfect set,&quot; said Gasquet. There was no disputing that, even if it was all a little puzzling for the audience in the Qi Zhong stadium that has hosted the TMC for the last three years, with one more remaining before London takes over. The Chinese take the world tennis order at face value, and expected Nadal to win. They duly greeted his victory with the sort of ecstatic applause that was a mixture of almost naive enthusiasm and wonderment. And very charming it was, as if the sport had suddenly been re-invented, and all the recent talk of match fixing and any other skulduggery were no more than a temporary bad smell that had been wafted away in the breeze. Of course, the questioning of the players did not go away. What, Gasquet was asked, did he think about an Italian player [Alessio di Mauro] being punished with a nine-month ban by the ATP for betting on tennis matches? Was it fair? Reaching back into the great tradition of French philosophical and logical thinking, Gasquet replied: &quot;Spanish tennis is incredible. They are better than French guys now. We are trying to play like them.&quot; For sheer unadulterated avoidance of a question it was almost as perfect as his first set, although the more prosaic explanation was that he mistook the word &apos;punished&apos; for Spanish. The opening day turned into a Spanish fiesta when David Ferrer defeated Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic, 6-4, 6-4. Djokovic, the world No 3 and this year&apos;s US Open finalist, came to China earlier than most of the other seven in order to be fully prepared.

Mao said he had been fighting the censors for 10 years, during which time more and more ordinary people had been coming together online to share their ideas and find an alternative to the traditional media, which were tightly controlled by the government&apos;s propaganda department. He said there was more than one layer of censorship: the net police monitored websites and blogs to block sensitive material. But the system also relied heavily on self-censorship, as businesses employed large editing teams to filter their own sites. However, Mao said he was &quot;very hopeful that we can break down the system in the long run.&quot; More and more of China&apos;s 160 million internet users were finding ways around it: installing tools to bypass the censors, using IM, email and social networking sites such as Facebook to relay and share information quickly. Asked about access to foreign websites in China, Mao said the BBC was completely blocked, but the Guardian&apos;s site and others in English were available. &quot;If you translate into Chinese, you will be censored.&quot; There was some discussion about western news sites that selected less sensitive material for translation in an attempt to beat the censors. Mao felt that, like other businesses, they should &quot;stick to their principles&quot; rather than practise self-censorship. There were hopeful signs. The Chinese authorities had recently unblocked YouTube and some other sites. A man in Shanghai was suing the telephone company for blocking his website. People were saying to the government: &quot;If you block Wikipedia, our children will not be so well educated and maybe we will lose the future.&quot; Businesses were adding to the pressure because they feared they would lose money if censorship harmed their creativity. &quot;I&apos;m very optimistic,&quot; Mao said. &quot;One day, censorship will collapse.&quot; Earlier, the conference had been unimpressed by Gordon Brown&apos;s foreign policy speech last night.

I encountered his mythical Chinese dictionary as a social sciences student. A more sensible woman would have studied a real one, in pursuit of a degree in Mandarin. Back then, it was still considered relatively esoteric; these days it seems that everyone is learning, and my excellent tutor has City lawyers and policemen competing for her attention. China&apos;s economic ascendance and growing influence in global affairs has concentrated British minds remarkably, despite our linguistic laziness. Schools are getting in on the act too and this week we learned that secondaries are to be offered basic language packages as part of an education programme ahead of the Beijing Olympics next year. Learning Chinese is rather easier these days, thanks to the range of support materials in shops and online (try chinesepod.com, plus Plecodict, a dictionary tool for PDAs, to learn characters). Still, it remains a hard grind for me and my progress is steady rather than spectacular. The good news is that the grammar is much simpler than English, though westerners often struggle with the four pitched (and one neutral) tone. Be grateful: Cantonese has twice as many. And be prepared; there is no alphabet. Instead of letters one has characters for each word - thousands of them: beautiful, but also complex and easily forgettable unless revised repeatedly. (Native speakers may not find it much easier; a Japanese neighbour just told me she has the same problem with kanji.) Yet every frustration is offset by the joy of connecting with another world - not only a booming modern economy, but one of the great ancient civilisations. My beginner&apos;s Chinese has allowed me to decipher phrases on historic plaques in Xian, discuss my grandfather&apos;s love of the erhu with old men in a teahouse in Shanghai and talk to a Beijing taxi driver about British schools - albeit with copious references to Plecodict. It has more functional uses, too, such as ordering food, asking directions and buying a phone charger. (One&apos;s vocabulary can seem awfully random. But if you want to discuss aforesaid charger or the Lib Dem leadership race, I&apos;ll do just fine.) No doubt I&apos;ll soon be surpassed by the hordes of teenies being hothoused or hired Chinese nannies by pushy parents. So be it. Children learn more easily; but also, I suspect, less enjoyably. How many would appreciate the poetry of the character meaning grieved or anxious (composed of &quot;heart&apos; and &quot;autumn&quot;)? Or the light that language can shed on a culture&apos;s priorities and preconceptions?

An audience of more than 200 million, plus countless more overseas. The two great totems of the nation&apos;s sport going, as they say, mano a mano, as families gathered around their TV sets and parties raged to witness the spectacle. Super Bowl? Small beer. This encounter was on Friday night, in downtown Houston, where the Rockets were taking on the Milwaukee Bucks, an early-season contest which would - with good reason - have passed by largely unnoticed if it were not for the presence of Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian on the court. To cite NBA commissioner David Stern: &quot;I have seen the future - and it is Chinese.&quot; To claim that China is the new promised land for basketball&apos;s money men is like Tesco admitting it would quite like to open a few more stores on a bypass near you. The whiff of a potential profit is in the air, and the vast numbers (double the US audience for American football&apos;s annual spectacular) who watched the first clash of these two towering titans have only fuelled the league&apos;s desire to go forth and conquer. It may still be an emerging market but the appetite for the NBA is already bulging in a nation of 1.3 billion, 300 million of which, it is claimed, play basketball. Nineteen television stations and two websites screened the match, which came a month after two sold-out pre-season exhibitions in Beijing. Replica jerseys are as common on the streets of Shanghai as Seattle (although, curiously, the best seller is that of Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, with Yao lurking in sixth place). The concoction is curious. Stern&apos;s enterprise is a model of capitalism, its revenues leaping vastly since he took charge 23 years ago. It has fattened the wallets of his players and bumped up the value of franchises which once could not be given away. But China, for all its Olympic-fuelled reform, is still cautious when it comes to handing over control. &quot;The NBA has to be careful,&quot; Xia Song, one of Asia&apos;s leading sports agents, warned recently. &quot;The market in China is very complicated. They can come in as a leader on the floor but they need to show they are team players. Otherwise there will be a lot of adversity.&quot; Thus far, the relationship has been fraught with perils and politics. When Wang Zhi Zhi became the first Chinese star to try and jump to the NBA, it was a tougher sell than getting an A-lister into the jungle. Wang was then playing for the Army club, who immediately banned him from leaving the country. He was eventually allowed to join the Dallas Mavericks, on condition that he returned each summer to turn out for the national team. Once, when he refused, he was made a persona non grata in his homeland. Only after a very public and grovelling apology was he allowed to return. It was a salutary lesson that the generals who oversee China&apos;s system of sporting centres of excellence will not just let their prize assets flee. Yet instead of resisting the lure of the open market, they have gleefully taken their cut. When it was the turn of Yao - a 7ft 6in colossus - to plan his exit after he became Houston&apos;s top draft choice in 2002, the contractual conditions were clear: 30% of his salary would go to the Chinese Basketball Association, 10% to the player&apos;s home city, and 10% to the state&apos;s sports administration. Given that Yao, now considered the best centre in the sport, pockets \u00a314m a year, it&apos;s no bad deal at all for the People&apos;s Republic. Yi, should he continue as he has started, will add a few more yuan to the pot. Who said communism and the free market can&apos;t peacefully co-exist?

Or both? And then there is the secondary, contemporary question - how far is China still run on lines he set down in 221BC, and, if so, can that survive in a globalised world with the rise of the internet and huge economic and social changes in the People&apos;s Republic? The variety of opinions such questions arouse was on display last night at a debate organised by the Guardian and the British Museum in connection with the sell-out exhibition on the First Emperor and the Terracotta Warriors at the museum (listen to the full debate here). Here we lay out the views expressed then, and invite you to add yours in this confrontation of China old and new - or old-new? The widely accepted view of Qin Shi Huangdi, who established his empire in 221BC after defeating other warring states in northern China, is that he was (in the title of a television documentary about him) &quot;The Man who made China&quot;. His legacy of unity, despotism and the building of a centralised state is taken as a template for the way the nation is ruled, not only under the empire that lasted till 1912 but also in the communist regime which has held sway since 1949. But what is the reality of the first emperor&apos;s legacy? The core question is whether the template set more than two millennia ago still applies in a world in which the People&apos;s Republic has become a central player in globalisation, open to outside influences however much the party seeks to control them. In that context, will individualism be allowed to express itself otherwise than in making money, or will the leadership in Beijing try to perpetuate the top-down conformity demanded by the founder of the Qin empire? One panellist, the author Sun Shuyun, recalled an early sign of individual initiative in the most sensitive of places in China - Tiananmen Square. In 1984, she and her classmates had been drilled for hour after hour to frogmarch past Deng Xiaoping chanting slogans wishing him a long life. But, in the event, they simply shouted &quot;Hello Deng&quot;. For her today, the Chinese people have shown so emphatically what they have been able to achieve economically, that it is time for the country&apos;s rulers to loosen their grip and allow wider freedoms. Venture capitalist and blogger Isaac Mao, who had flown from Shanghai for the debate, noted how the framework of censorship that surrounds him had shaped his mind - when he got to London he expected websites he accessed to be blocked as they would have been in the People&apos;s Republic. He noted the explosion in the number of Chinese bloggers, now reaching 14 million. The process, he thought, was unstoppable. China had entered a new phase not only because of the economic growth of the last three decades, but also through the influence of communications such as the internet. Social networks enabled people to exchange ideas; the internet had hit the traditional top-down system. Professor Steven Tsang from Oxford and I went back into history. I outlined facets of Chinese governance that stretched down the centuries from the foundation of the Qin empire. Steve Tsang noted how the man who ordered the Terracotta Warriors to be made to guard him in the afterlife had proclaimed a universal empire - those inside it were civilised, those outside were barbarians. His victory over neighbouring kings ended the period of the warring states, but replaced this with &quot;gigantic slavery and use of resources which he exhausted&quot;. China was a superpower under the Qin and succeeding dynasties such as the Han, Tang, Sui and Qing, and declared itself to be good and benevolent. Today China was sincere in proclaiming its desire for a &quot;peaceful rise&quot; because it is in Beijing&apos;s interests for peace to reign. But what, he asked, would the PRC do after it had risen? I advanced the notion that new forces in China&apos;s economy and society were escaping from the control of the centre which was growing relatively weaker, while Isaac thought the best hope for progress would be a combination of &quot;wise leadership from the top&quot; and the growing education and influence of the grassroots. A well-designed system was needed to run a country like China. Society should be &quot;made more intelligent&quot;. &quot;In the 21st century,&quot; he added, &quot;China&apos;s people should have their own thought model. To cooperate with the leadership.&quot; But modernisation should not mean neglecting the cultural heritage. Focussing on the Warriors, themselves, Shu Shuyun said she did not regard them as from an alien past but as part of her that happened to have been made two millennia ago. Continuity and civilisation defined the Chinese as Chinese, she went on. Ancestors had to be venerated, as shown by the way the family name comes before the given name in China. But the country faces a major problem in the removal of welfare services from the poor, a decision, she noted, that had been made without any public debate. Steve Tsang drew attention to the way China has accepted foreign rulers in dynasties such as the Qing and drew a contrast between Taiwan where Chiang Kai-shek sought to operate a Confucian model after 1949 while the mainland was run under an ideology imported from Europe. A problem with authoritarian leaders, he added, is that they have to get things right, while democracy &quot;can accommodate idiots&quot;. After the panel debate, China&apos;s ambassador in London, Fu Ying, was invited to join in from the audience. She recalled that she had been on the podium when Shu and her classmates marched past Deng - interpreting for a foreign visitor. Though the first emperor in the school books, she doubted that Chinese today thought about him. The kind of regimentation Shu had experienced in her youth no longer existed. China scholar Elizabeth Wright said it was a mistake to think of China as a united country; rather it was a federal state. As for its global status, being a superpower was a very difficult role to play, she added. All superpowers were accused of behaving badly. To which Steve Tsang drew attention to the remaining power of the Communist party - including its authority over the military. Isaac Mao foresaw &quot;a very diversified country&quot; as no one policy could deal with the differences in contemporary society. Shu Shuyun asked why the first empire fell after only 16 years, and found the answer in the fragility of absolute rule. The country was bound to rebel given the oppression employed by the Qin founder. On the other hand, the survival of the next dynasty, the Han, for two centuries, was based on the harmonious teachings of Confucius in place of the harsh legalism of the first emperor. Returning to the issue of censorship, Isaac Mao said that, instead, the Great Firewall that drew on the old control system was totally wrong. Rather, the creativity and innovation of the Chinese people should be encouraged. I noted both the strength of regionalism and the way in which President Hu Jintao had put innovation at the top of his economic agenda for the next five years - even talking of the need for companies that could promote Chinese brands globally. The last intervention, from writer and journalist Isabel Hilton, provided a strong summation to the evening by saying that China had been trying to find a new political form since the end of the empire in 1912. To whom does the state belong? was the crucial question. The doctrine of Chinese exceptionalism, based on the ideology of the first emperor, was, she argued, an avoidance of that question, designed to postpone change.

The embodiment of China&apos;s economic dream has nearly doubled its population to 21.5 million over the past 15 years and now has more skyscrapers than New York. Where 20 years ago the streets were full of bicycles, now the car is king and it is choking the city. While a ride in one of Shanghai&apos;s ubiquitous VW Santana taxis can be a more exciting experience than you might want, you are more likely to spend a frustratingly long time stationary in one of the city&apos;s clogged arteries. China is seen as a vital battleground in the global fight against pollution and environmental damage, so where better for Michelin to host its annual eco-car contest, Challenge Bibendum. The International Energy Agency, in its World Energy Outlook report earlier this month, predicted the number of cars in China would grow seven-fold by 2030. If that happens, China will have 140 cars for every 1,000 people - well short of the 680 cars per 1,000 people in Europe - and an indication that the country might hardly have even started on this journey. Rather than trying to persuade people to drive cars less frequently, the solution proposed by the auto industry is to make cars greener sooner - but it is clear from Michelin&apos;s event that no one silver bullet has emerged.  Car makers are investing in a broad range of technologies and many of the vehicles on show here - hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell and electric cars - have been seen before, at least by the specialist motoring press. The world&apos;s largest car maker, General Motors, is displaying the Opel Corsa 1.3 CDTi Ecoflex, which uses the world&apos;s smallest turbo diesel engine of its type to deliver more than 60 miles per gallon. The Ford Edge on show combines a hydrogen fuel cell with a battery-powered electric car. Electric cars appear to be making a bit of a comeback - despite criticism that they merely displace much of the pollution from the city to the power station where the electricity is produced - and this 4x4 can do 85mph for around 25 miles on its lithium-ion battery.  Once that is depleted, the car&apos;s fuel cell kicks in to provide an additional 200 miles of range. Finding an appropriate filling station to top up your hydrogen tanks could be a different matter, however. Apart from southern California&apos;s &quot;hydrogen highway&quot;, the infrastructure does not yet exist. Smart&apos;s ForTwo Cdi is the world&apos;s most economical production car, with the lowest CO2 emissions, thanks to the smallest direct-injection diesel engine around. While the car is on general sale, the SunDiesel fuel being used here is not. This second-generation biofuel, known as biomass to liquid or BTL, can be produced from wood waste, avoiding many of the problems associated with biofuels produced from food crops such as corn or sugar. A recent report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted global food prices could soar 20-50% over the next decade, citing the demand for biofuels as one of the main drivers. It could be many years before these technologies are available to the public. Engineers at Daimler said their BTL project could be ready by 2015, while a designer at Ford admitted that petrol prices would have to increase by more than 50% before fuel cell technology becomes viable. Michel Rollier, Michelin&apos;s chief executive officer, remained optimistic. &quot;The $100-a-barrel oil spike of recent days has reinforced a feeling of urgency,&quot; he said. &quot;The technology is ready. Governments are more ready for action than ever.

At least in all those previous tournaments he has had to play the Swiss only once. Now there looms the possibility of two defeats within three days. Federer demolished the American 6-4, 6-2 in the final round-robin match last night, with a real probability they might meet in tomorrow&apos;s final. And it could turn out to be a double murder most horrid. In the semi-finals today Federer takes on Rafael Nadal, ensuring the world&apos;s No1 or No2 players will be in the final, while Roddick is up against the Spaniard David Ferrer, that little wall of China and the only man in the tournament to remain undefeated this week. He has beaten the American twice in their four previous meetings and has been in outstanding form here, although the indoor court should favour Roddick, assuming his confidence has not been completely shredded by the Swiss. There were any number of stupendous shots in Federer&apos;s win, so much so that it was tempting to think that the Federer who had struggled in his previous two round-robin matches, losing the first against Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez of Chile, was a Chinese fake. Federer had begun the sixth day assuming a victory over Roddick would be essential for him to reach the last four, only for his place to be assured in the prior match when Nikolay Davydenko ended Gonz\u00e1lez&apos;s hopes with a 6-4, 6-3 victory. &quot;Let&apos;s not overrate this win over Andy,&quot; said the world No1 generously, &quot;because we both knew we were qualified and we could both play freely.&quot; There is no doubt that Roddick&apos;s suspect backhand has improved significantly under the tutelage of Jimmy Connors, although it is rumoured that in a week of splits the two may be about to part. Andy Murray noted that Brad Gilbert had failed to make any significant change to the Roddick backhand, which caused him ultimately to question whether Gilbert would be able to enhance his own progress substantially. Federer, currently without a coach, was asked if he might be interested in the garrulous American. &quot;No chance,&quot; he replied with terse finality. Etienne de Villiers, the ATP chief executive, continues to wrestle with the complexities and cost of funding the investigation into possible match fixing. &quot;I&apos;m going to look at the online betting companies to fund it because the problems are caused by them,&quot; he said yesterday in a declaration which seemed akin to the poachers having a whip round to pay the gamekeeper. The Lawn Tennis Association is calling on the help of the Serbian world No4, Ana Ivanovic, to set a much needed example to young British players. The LTA has done a deal for Ivanovic to train at the \u00a340m National Tennis Centre in Roehampton next month. Ivanovic, in return, has agreed to practise with lowly ranked British players and offer them an insight into the workload and commitment required to be a world-class player. She might also give the often pampered locals a perspective on how fortunate they are to come from one of the richest tennis nations in the game and be so generously financed by a governing body which receives around \u00a325m each year via the surplus profits from Wimbledon. Ivanovic, 20, grew up in post-civil war Belgrade and famously had to learn to play tennis in an empty swimming pool because there were no usable courts around. No wonder she is impressed with Roehampton. &quot;I&apos;m at a stage in my career where I really want to have the very best facilities in the world,&quot; she said.

But after that, I got in the zone and played incredibly. Once I get on a roll, it&apos;s hard to stop me.&apos; Federer moved into fifth gear while serving at 4-4 in the first set. Nadal, who earlier squandered his only break point, pulled ahead 15-30. Federer then ran off 20 of the next 21 points, including 15 in a row. Looking stunned, the Spaniard managed to win only three points in the first five games of the second set. &apos;When he&apos;s 100 per cent, he&apos;s playing in another league. It&apos;s impossible to stop him,&apos; said Nadal. Nadal finally held at love to break Federer&apos;s streak of seven games. Serving at 5-1, Federer hit an overhead winner to set up match point and Nadal netted a backhand to finish it off in 59 minutes - 13 minutes less than Federer needed to blitz Roddick on Friday. Federer landed 83 per cent of his first serves. He ended up with 26 winners to 16 unforced errors and yielded only 11 points in his nine service games. In the earlier match, Ferrer, who had dropped only one set in four matches, was fresh, confident and sharp from the start, while Roddick seemed to be showing the effects of the 20-hour turnaround from his loss to Federer in the round-robin section of this tournament. Ferrer last played on Thursday. After Roddick held serve to start the match, Ferrer ran off six games in a row, with Roddick never managing a game point. Roddick&apos;s serve lost some of its usual zing and he got a massage on his lower back after being broken for the second time to trail 4-1. He won only 11 of his 26 service points in the first set. &apos;My range of motion was really bad,&apos; Roddick said of his back. &apos;Normally you&apos;re able to work your way into a match a little bit. With David, he comes out, makes balls right away. After I got some stuff on it, it loosened up pretty well for the second set.&apos; Nimble and quick at the baseline, Ferrer&apos;s defence was nearly flawless. He ripped winners from both sides on the run, and punished Roddick when he came in, sending groundstrokes past him or at his feet. Ferrer broke Roddick for the fourth time to pull ahead 4-2 in the second set, aided by a pair of seemingly impossible cross-court winners that left the American staring at him in disbelief.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Rafael Nadal", "Roger Federer"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-18T00:18:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/nov/20/saopaolo.brazil", "sentences": ["It&apos;s indicative of Sao Paulo&apos;s cultural status that it has its own version of the Gothamist \u2014 a hugely popular New York-based culture-and-comment blog franchise, whose only other wings outside of North America are in London and Shanghai."], "title": "Blog by blog guide to \u2026 Sao Paulo", "article": "Sao Paulo is a notoriously tough nut to crack \u2014 the cultural capital of Brazil with some of South America&apos;s best nightlife, hidden within a sprawling, concrete high-rise metropolis.

The Sampaist (Sampa is the local nickname for the city) is in Portuguese, but a few days before arriving in the city I emailed the team for their tips on the city.  Ana Carolina Monteiro, an English teacher, DJ, and club booker, is quick to reply. Ironically she&apos;s in London during my visit, but sends an email packed with recommendations. We decide to start at Vila Madalena, &quot;the hippie bohemian area. Brazilian live music at almost every bar, with hundreds of bars on every street&quot;.  The first surprise is that, unlike the rest of the city, nothing in Vila Madalena seems to rise higher than two storeys, with rows of pastel coloured townhouses aligned on a mesh of undulating streets. There are bars, bodegas and restaurants everywhere. Ana&apos;s specifically recommends Filial (rua Fidalga 254), and it&apos;s teeming. We squeeze on to stools at the bar. Waiters with untucked shirts and bow ties sporadically diving between us to pluck drinks from the back bar and whisk them to the punters packed around dozens of tables dotted over a black and white check floor. The crowd is well-heeled, but the hubbub overrides any airs and graces \u2014 it feels like a raucous Brazilian take on a Parisian brasserie. The wood-panelled walls are cropped halfway up by a double-barrelled liquor cabinet that spans the entire circumference of the room, housing over 660 varieties of Cacha\u00e7a, the Brazilian alcohol staple and base of a Caipirinha. But most people are drinking &quot;chopp&quot; \u2014 draught Brahma beer served from a tank behind the bar. To line the stomach, Ana recommends the &quot;bolinhos de arroz&quot;, cheesy risotto balls served with a squeeze of lime and a dash of Tabasco. Superb, but pipped by her next recommendation, a caiprinha de frutas vermelhas \u2014 Cacha\u00e7a with ice, crushed strawberries, grapes, starfruit and blackberries. Expensive for Brazil, working out at just under \u00a33. But my, it&apos;s worth every penny.  A few blocks down, we wander to Ana&apos;s club pick, Studio SP (Rua In\u00e1cio Pereira da Rocha 170) \u2014 innocuous entrance, small queue, huge bouncer. We clamber up metallic stairs and through the doors into a dark loft space, faintly doused in red, fans hanging from the rafters and Mr Big Stuff blasting through the speakers. A bohemian crowd packs the small dance floor and swells the bar where they present cards on which a tab is kept, to be settled on exit. A man and a woman, last seen gyrating on the dance floor, climb on-stage and play a live electro set, her singing, him mostly pouting.  Ana had given us a splurge of tips and, with Vila Madalena, we&apos;d taken the safe bet, deciding against Barra Funda. The email described it as &quot;Sao Paulo&apos;s Shoreditch area. It used to be dangerous (it still is a bit), industrial and empty, but now some trendy bars have started popping up. Most of the coolest bars are there at the moment&quot;. When we asked the receptionist at our hostel how to get there, she had baulked. We wimped out. But having got our bearings and asked around a bit, we decide to give it a go on the Saturday.  Slightly anxious, we boarded a taxi outside Barra Funda metro station. The driver has to stop to ask directions half way to Casa Belfiore (Rua Sousa Lima 67), Ana&apos;s first tip in the area. &quot;Shoreditch&quot; was generous. There seems to be nothing, anywhere, until we swing onto Rua Sousa Lima, where a single fa\u00e7ade is low lit with multicolored light bulbs. It&apos;s a tiny room with a red-tiled floor and dark red stucco walls, with eight tables and a dozen guests. Their style is scruffy, rockabilly trendy \u2014 beards and check shirts, girls in smocks flicking pennies into glasses by the bar, obscure Chinese prints and Bukowski posters on the wall.  And then the menu. Blimey. Through the Portuguese I can make out some kind of basil, pesto and parmesan combination, fig salad and parma ham, and Roquefort and carmelised something-or-other. I go for the latter, and a meticulously presented caramelised aubergine and Roquefort crostini emerges from the kitchen 20 minutes later, served by a waitress with a bull ring through her nose.  The final stop on Ana&apos;s tour is the Casa&apos;s big brother, Club Befiore (Rua Brigadeiro Galvao 871), a few blocks further into Barra Funda. The walk is murky \u2014 deserted streets, wobbling weirdoes, a lone dog barking. There is nothing to suggest that Sao Paulo&apos;s club du jour will be loitering around the corner. But there it is, set in a large hall sculpted out of some kind of warehouse, lit by a series or wan orbs hanging from a wooden ceiling and rammed with locals aimed towards a stage at the back.

Western novels and Chinese classics were condemned as equally evil. These works were seen as promoting bourgeois decadence, imperialism and old thinking. Like all good Maoists, Jiang knew his duty: he should turn the words into ashes. But the 21-year-old was torn. He was a political firebrand who loved chairman Mao Zedong, but he was also an art student with a passion for literature. Faced with this dilemma, he took another way out. While publicly following the mob, he squirreled away many of the novels, adding them to a secret collection he had bought and kept in two large trunks. You might call it stealing. But for him in that morally chaotic era, it was a case of saving the pages from the flames. Forty years on, the wheel has turned in typically dramatic Chinese fashion. The former book burner, book thief and book saviour is on the way to becoming one of the most celebrated and controversial Chinese novelists in the world: Jiang&apos;s first book, Wolf Totem, has not only escaped a ban since its publication three years ago, but has picked up almost a dozen major literary awards in China - and has now gained international recognition by winning the first Man Asia literary prize, created to highlight authors from the region who have yet to be published in English. It is part of a transformation that Jiang hopes could herald a new age of enlightenment in China. But he has seen too many upheavals in his 61 years not to hedge his bets. A former artist, shepherd, political prisoner, Maoist lecturer and democracy activist, he has experienced the spectacular ups and downs that form the epic backdrop to much modern Chinese art. &quot;It is a miracle that I am alive,&quot; he says. To protect himself in what he describes as &quot;the least liberal country in the world&quot;, he wrote Wolf Totem under a pen-name and carefully hid his real identity. Until the Man Asia winner was announced on November 10, few outside a small circle of friends knew what Jiang looked like. Critics dismissed this as a marketing gimmick. But for Jiang, it is a matter of survival. He does not want his book banned. He has given interviews, but never allowed his photograph to be taken. The Man Asia prize, a cousin to the English-language Man Booker prize, has stripped away a layer of this anonymity. After the result was announced, two portraits he submitted to the jury were published all over world, along with the author&apos;s real name, Lu Jiamin, and his background as a democracy activist who was jailed after the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations. Jiang is still reluctant to show his full colours, caution typical in a generation that has lived through several cycles of openness and oppression. But in his first face-to-face interview since the award, he says the climate has improved. &quot;When the book came out three years ago, it was controversial. Critics called me a liberal, a traitor, a fascist. They said the book was anti-communist, that it should be banned by the propaganda department because it has evil political aims, that it stands for liberalism and capitalism. That is why I thought it was wise to hide my identity at the time. But now things have changed. We have economic freedom, social freedom, literary freedom, internet freedom, even press freedom has improved quickly. The conditions for freedom in China have improved.&quot; Remaining anonymous has also become more difficult. When Wolf Totem came out, Jiang was an unknown first-time novelist. The first print run was a mere 20,000. Today, the book has sold more than two million copies in China along with an estimated 10 times that number of pirate versions, and a children&apos;s book. &quot;In the past three years, more and more people have come to know my identity through the internet, so it is difficult to hide now,&quot; he says. &quot;My circumstances are better too. I have a great deal of support from many people. University students, businessmen and government officials like my novel.&quot; The lure of such a prestigious award was also a factor. &quot;This prize is very meaningful,&quot; he says. Tracing Jiang&apos;s life is difficult. He is reluctant to talk publicly about many episodes beyond saying he has personally experienced all of the most tumultuous events in modern Chinese history. But dig into the past through friends, associates and clippings and a picture emerges, albeit a sketchy one. He was born in 1946 in Jiangsu province to a politically red-blooded family. His parents were former Red Army soldiers, heroes of the war against Japan. The author&apos;s biggest influence was his mother. In the 1920s and 30s, she had been an underground member of the communist party in Shanghai. After Mao took power in 1949, she moved into education, working for the women&apos;s federation and running the Jiangsu provincial nursery school. &quot;I have a liberal character by nature. It comes from my mother. She liked to travel and we moved house a lot - Shanghai, Wuxi, Nanjing and Beijing. She was exposed to western culture through the films she loved to watch. She took me to the movies every week. We saw Russian, Indian and western films. And she bought me lots of western children&apos;s books. We loved to read western novels.&quot; Among them were Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. That blissful childhood came to an end when his mother succumbed to cancer and war injuries at the age of 39. On a national level, too, it was the end of the communist honeymoon. This was in 1957, just as Mao launched a bloody anti-rightist purge of those who criticised him. The years that followed were a time of doubts, suspicions and hardships. The adolescent Jiang, studying at a middle school attached to the Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, grew up a rebel. In 1964, he wrote a poster criticising the latest political campaign. It was the first of four times in his life that he was to be condemned as &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;. When he walked in the street, people spat on him and threw stones. Worse was to come during the Cultural Revolution. Jiang&apos;s father - a bureau chief in the ministry of health - was denounced as a &quot;black gang capitalist-roader&quot;. Even though he was a disabled veteran who had fought the Japanese, his persecutors beat him so badly that he nearly died. &quot;People didn&apos;t care about the facts,&quot; says Jiang. &quot;They would just pick up something you did in speech or policy or action and use it against you. In every department, they had to knock down someone.&quot; Jiang fought back, turning his rebellious nature into an asset. He rounded on his accusers, joined the student Red Guard and rose to become deputy head of the revolutionary core group in his college. Didn&apos;t he feel torn, after what happened to his father? &quot;Yes, there was a confusion in my mind. But I thought things would improve,&quot; he says. &quot;There was a conflict within me between Mao&apos;s theories and western liberal theories.&quot; Compared to most people of his age, he is relatively candid about the Cultural Revolution. Tens of millions took part in the killings, beatings, burnings or public humiliations of that time, but most of those willing to talk about it now are the victims. It is rare to find anyone willing to admit to wrongdoing. &quot;There were plenty of bad things. I was against the beatings, the arson and seizures of possessions,&quot; Jiang recalls. &quot;I took part in some of them. But in the depths of my heart I was against violence and mob activity. It was against my character.&quot; When the Red Guard confiscated and started burning books, the contradictions kicked in. &quot;I wanted to collect all the major books in history and read them systematically.&quot; After a year, the Cultural Revolution collapsed into factional - and often deadly - infighting. To defuse the situation, Mao sent the students into the countryside to learn from the masses. Jiang was among the first to volunteer, taking his trunks of books off to East Ujimqin Banner in Inner Mongolia in 1967. The story after that is murkier. Jiang is reluctant to talk about the recent 30 years, perhaps because the closer you come to the present, the more politically sensitive the topics. There are reports that he was jailed for more than three years and narrowly escaped the death penalty for criticising communist party number two Lin Biao in 1970, that he founded the &quot;Beijing Spring&quot; reform publication during the Demo-cracy Wall protests in 1978 and that he played a prominent role in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, for which he spent another 18 months in prison. I ask if these stories are true. &quot;Yes,&quot; is all he is willing to answer. But there is no shortage of detail about the years he spent among nomads in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Wolf Totem is sold as a novel, but it has also been described as a sermon, an anthropological research paper, a nature study and a call for political freedom. Perhaps more than anything, though, it is an autobiography. From getting lost on the grasslands and finding himself terrified and alone among a pack of wolves, to tenderly raising a young wolf cub, Jiang says the events in the book are based on his life. The protagonist, Chen Zhen, is a Han Chinese who has left Beijing in disgust at the Cultural Revolution. He is assigned a job as a shepherd and given a tent among a family of Mongolian herders. He quickly grows to respect their freedom, natural wisdom and worship of the Wolf Totem. At the same time, in the novel and in our interview, Jiang repeatedly condemns his own ethnic group for their placid &quot;sheep-like&quot; obedience and ignorant destruction of nature. Towards the end of the novel, the rapacious modernity of the Han devastates the wolves&apos; habitat and turns the grasslands into desert. There are few bleaker visions of the ecological peril created by modern China&apos;s development. Jiang&apos;s wife says that during the six years her husband spent researching and writing the book, he became so obsessed that she worried he was growing sick. His health is only now recovering more than three years after completion. In publishing terms, the effort has been worthwhile. As well as selling millions of copies in China, Penguin paid $100,000 (\u00a350,000) - close to a record for a mainland-based author - for the English edition, which will come out next spring. It has been influential, too. Wolf Totem&apos;s carefully researched insights into hunting strategies and natural competition have been used to teach communist cadres, businessmen and soldiers. Students have written to Jiang to say they are inspired by his advocacy of freedom. The book&apos;s literary merits are fiercely debated, partly because it does not fit easily within any conventional genres. There is little poetry in the writing. Instead, it is a narrative, a polemic, held together with vivid description, and gripping accounts of the author&apos;s frightening and intimate encounters with wild wolves. Critics have accused Jiang of romanticising the grasslands, saying real nomads are more likely to shoot wolves than worship them. Others have expressed concern at the book&apos;s focus on race, the natural order and competition. One noted China expert lambasted Wolf Totem as &quot;fascist&quot;. A Chinese scholar said it placed too much emphasis on ethnicity. For Jiang, the book is above all &quot;about the spirit of freedom&quot;, he says. But China &quot;cannot just transplant western liberal ideas. We must nurture our own. Only then can we connect strongly with western ideals.&quot; Jiang sees the Man Asia award as part of that connection, which is why he considers it more important than any of the domestic prizes he has won. He plans to donate the $10,000 award to a grasslands activist, who is teaching Inner Mongolian nomads about their legal rights. Even here, however, he has been dogged by controversy. Nury Vittachi, the Hong Kong-based writer who claims to have had the original concept for the prize before being ousted from the judging panel, said Jiang Rong should not have been allowed to enter, let alone win. But Jiang is unlikely to get caught up in Asian literary politics. For all his &quot;stubborn liberalism&quot;, he is no longer a firebrand. A study of wolves has taught him strategy. Rather than push the pace of reform, he wants to guide the direction. Rather than influence the political surface, he concentrates on the cultural roots. &quot;If you don&apos;t change the base, then even if one form of despotism dies, another will emerge. I am trying to influence the cultural base of China. I think that is more important and effective than direct confrontation&quot; \u00b7", "tags": ["Chinese literature", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-22T23:53:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/23/china", "sentences": ["It was travelling from Shanghai to Lichuan city when the accident occurred."], "title": "29 feared dead in China landslide", "article": "Up to 29 people are today feared dead after a landslide sent tonnes of rubble crashing on to a bus in central China. Authorities say the tragedy was discovered three days after the event, when workers began moving rocks to clear the road. The landslide was reported to have caused a 50-metre gash across a mountainside on Tuesday morning. It heightened concern that the reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam, which is 120 miles away, was causing ecological havoc in the region. Today, workers clearing rubble from the landslide uncovered the wreckage of the bus, the government&apos;s Xinhua news agency reported. It was travelling from Shanghai to Lichuan city when the accident occurred. Records from a safety checkpoint it passed through showed there were 27 people on board, said Tang Mingyi, an official in Hubei province&apos;s Badong county. Two others, believed to be workers building a tunnel near the scene, are reported missing. &quot;There&apos;s little hope that they&apos;re still alive,&quot; said Tang, referring to those on the bus and the two missing workers. The accident happened at a time of growing debate over the ecological impact of the Three Gorges Dam, the world&apos;s largest hydropower project. More than four million people are expected to be moved from their homes over the next 10 to 12 years to make way for the \u00a311bn project. A government meeting in September warned about an increase in landslides and other seismic activity as the reservoir level of the dam was raised. It is feared that many slopes will become unstable as the water seeps into surrounding hillsides.

Back in the 1970s, the contest would have been overladen with political symbolism. It would have been a contest between ideologies, between capitalism and communism, between the free market and the command economy. It has been 12 years since America last prevailed when a team captained by Pete Sampras beat, naturally, Russia on clay in Moscow. The victory gave his nation a record 31st Davis Cup title, but was followed by a drought during which the Russians came to the fore. Five years ago they defeated France when Mikhail Youzhny won the final rubber from two sets down. And a year ago they defeated the United States in the semi-final (Dmitry Tursunov beating Andy Roddick 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 17-15 in the deciding match) before defeating Argentina in the final. The Defending Champions, Russia, against The Winningest Nation, America: as fine a dish as you could set before a political analyst, with added spice coming from a suspicion of skulduggery. Did the Russians really poison plucky (West) German Tommy Haas so they might triumph in their semi-final? And, if so, might they try to pull a similar stunt in Portland? Plenty there for the colour boys and conspiracy theorists. And all present and correct on Friday, but, although the back-story is as above, history has changed. The most highly charged and politically fraught contest in sport has been neutered by the collapse of the Soviet Union. The days of the Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky, Olympic confrontations and Rocky Balboa v Captain Ivan Drago are long gone. That&apos;s the problem with making friends with people, it&apos;s not so much fun beating them at sport. The failure of the event to ring out around the world - did you even know it was happening? - is partly due to the individualistic nature of tennis. &apos;Boris Becker is not associated with Germany, but is known just as Boris Becker,&apos; says Simon Anholt, creator of the Nation Brands Index and authority on how countries are perceived and how they can alter that perception. &apos;Roger Federer is not associated with Switzerland, but is known just as Roger Federer. No country is associated with tennis apart, perhaps, from Croatia, which is the only thing anyone knows about them, other than vague associations with ethnic cleansing.&apos; We were talking before Wednesday night&apos;s Euro 2008 qualifying game at Wembley. &apos;Tennis is not one of those national war substitutes like soccer.&apos; The Americans have sometimes found it very hard to untangle the substitute from the real thing. For instance, President Eisenhower, on the preponderance of Second World War generals having been former American footballers, declared: &apos;Personally I think this was more than coincidental. I believe that football, almost more than any other sport, tends to instil into men that feeling that victory comes through hard - almost slavish - work, team play, self-confidence and an enthusiasm that amounts to dedication.&apos; Or as an assistant athletic director of the US Naval Academy said: &apos;This great sport of ours has gone so far the pinkos can&apos;t touch it.&apos; The lack of interest in Friday&apos;s final is exacerbated by the Cold War growing ever more distant in the memory. &apos;People like to see real political scenarios played out in sport and that&apos;s what gives them their resonance,&apos; Anholt says. &apos;There is not much resonance between the US and Russia, but there is between the US and China.&apos; If China were playing, the world&apos;s press would be there. This is because the twin motivations of fear and greed would be in play. It would be hard to convince the people of Portland, Oregon, that they are under threat from Reds Under the Bed, but not so difficult to spin the potential danger posed by the Yellow Peril. As for greed, the Americans sense they may never have it so good again. &apos;While America took 200 years, China have gone from anonymous to overbearing in the space of about a year,&apos; Anholt says. &apos;Petro China is the first trillion-dollar company, which is twice as large as Exxon.&apos; This economic progress has had a social cost. &apos;The image of China is declining almost as quickly as its economy is rising,&apos; Anholt says. &apos;The Politburo is frantic for respect and talks endlessly about &quot;nation branding&quot;. They are establishing Confucius Centres, based on the British Council, in every major city. And they hope that the Olympics and the Shanghai Expo will be the centrepiece of their push for global admiration.&apos; The Olympics are where sport, politics and commerce cohere most vividly to form a heady, if often toxic, brew. It provided the bumpiest of playing fields on which the Soviet Union and its satellites competed against the US and its allies. It was the backdrop for the most brutal and epochal sporting confrontations between the two. The medal table would be seen, by those who could derive virility from such things, as an indicator of the efficacy of communism or capitalism. Who will forget the &apos;Miracle on Ice&apos; of a US team of amateur and collegiate players defeating the long-dominant Soviets at the Lake Placid Winter Games in 1980? Or the riotous finale to the Americans&apos; humiliating defeat at basketball at the Munich Games in 1972? It is at the Olympics in Beijing next year that the first major sporting stand-off between China and America will occur. For the past three Games, the US have headed the medal table, but it is long odds-on that China, with home advantage, will better them next time. One-nil to The Command Economy. Results, however, are not everything and Anholt believes it may &apos;do nothing to counteract their negative image from Tiananmen Square&apos; - a televisual event that remains so iconic, albeit blurred, that a startling number of Americans think Trafalgar Square is in China. &apos;Even if they put on a fantastic show,&apos; Anholt says, &apos;it will simply be interpreted according to whatever evil is ascribed to China at that moment. My guess is their image will plunge. There will be huge swathes of protesters because when you are letting so many people in it is impossible to keep the troublemakers out. And when propaganda and globalisation collide, propaganda cannot survive.&apos; London beware. The Olympics can damage the health of your brand as well as your wealth. &apos;Greece, when it hosted the Olympics and became European champions in the same year, had its biggest PR opportunity since the sack of Troy,&apos; Anholt says. &apos;But they basically blew it. They were so worried about terrorism that they forgot to say anything.&apos; China still has a way to go to be America&apos;s number-one sporting rival. &apos;When people are asked which country excels at sport the US comes top by a wide margin,&apos; Anholt says. &apos;Germany is second because of hosting the World Cup, which does a lot for a country&apos;s image, at least temporarily. Russia is third, Brazil fourth, and the UK [astonishingly] fifth, because of Manchester United and Chelsea.&apos; But China will soon catch up because Russia has built its position on the back of Olympic success. And when it does, it may well be that the USA is still playing American football while the Chinese are playing a new and altogether different game.", "tags": ["Sport"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-25T23:23:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/26/match.manchestercity", "sentences": ["Sven-Goran Eriksson, oiling the club&apos;s commercial wheels, spent time in Shanghai recently, a city with all the trappings of western capitalism within Communist-run China.", "In Shanghai all the lights in the commercial part of the city are switched off before midnight every night."], "title": "Football: Premier League: Manchester City 2-1 Reading", "article": "Sven-Goran Eriksson, oiling the club&apos;s commercial wheels, spent time in Shanghai recently, a city with all the trappings of western capitalism within Communist-run China.

Steve Coppell made his admiration for Eriksson and the quality of players he has brought to Eastlands abundantly clear on Saturday but, as he emphasised, and with no rancour even after having two points stolen in the last minute, &quot;without the finance it wouldn&apos;t have happened&quot;. There is, of course, no poverty at this level, simply different strata of wealth. After the riches that Thaksin Shinawatra has poured into the club the City fans remain in a state of suspended euphoria and, as such, their critical faculties have been dulled. In general terms this was a pretty rotten performance by the Blues, yet those supporters who had ripped into Stuart Pearce towards the end of his sorry term sat patiently with beatific smiles as passes went sideways and backwards. Third in the table and United losing at Bolton: life could scarcely be better. It is all very odd for a club where dissatisfaction had become a way of life. Coppell, referring to his team&apos;s performance once James Harper had equalised Martin Petrov&apos;s early goal, talked about a &quot;mentality to protect what you&apos;ve got&quot;. As yet, because they are so flabbergasted, City fans appear virtually bereft of expectation, though this will change as the truth sinks in that they really can compete with Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal. For the moment there remains a deeply rooted worry that it could all go horribly wrong. Should City and Shinawatra&apos;s multimillions not be parted, then it will be fascinating to observe how the club develops. They are no longer playing the corner shop to United&apos;s supermarket and this will mean change for everybody, some of which may be resented. There are former Reading fans who no longer support the club because it is &quot;not the fun it used to be&quot; although, unlike Reading, Manchester City, for all their self-deprecation, have always believed themselves to be a big club. And now they may become precisely that. Stephen Ireland has had a lively few weeks, falling out with his country and then being reprimanded by the FA for dropping his shorts, but Eriksson was unstinting in his praise: &quot;I am not sure what is his best position but he could become our second striker.&quot; The first will doubtless arrive through the January transfer window. The Swede was keen to emphasise that everybody at the club had feet on the ground. In Shanghai all the lights in the commercial part of the city are switched off before midnight every night. As a metaphor for the transience of success it is not one the City fans would want to ponder too closely.

An auction by Christie&apos;s in Hong Kong yesterday quadrupled its most generous target, taking $108m (matching the total worth of Asian contemporary art sold by both Sotheby&apos;s and Christie&apos;s in 2006). Meanwhile, Cai Guo-qiang established himself as the most expensive Chinese contemporary artist, with a set of his paintings fetching $9.5m. This puts Guo-qiang in the same bracket as artists such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst (as well as other Chinese artists including Liu Xiaodong) who can break the \u00a31m barrier with a single work of art. Just a year ago, Henry Howard-Sneyd, global head of Asian arts at Sotheby&apos;s, was claiming the boom in Chinese art had &quot;come out of nowhere&quot;.

In the short term, this sudden upsurge in interest can&apos;t be a bad thing, but there&apos;s a danger of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater. What makes the Chinese art scene so fresh and vital to western eyes is the unique approach to such traditional themes as &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;individuality&quot;. In a society where both are relatively new phenomena, there is an extra level of depth to be explored. Topics that can be seen as self-indulgent in the west are still fascinating subjects in China, as the hard-nosed world of consumerism crashes headfirst into an art community still finding its feet. Witness Liu Xiaodong&apos;s record of the displaced victims of the Three Gorges Project, or Wang Qinsong&apos;s reinterpretations of traditional Chinese tableaux with the symbols of western capitalism.  One only needs to look at the art scene centred around 798 Space in Beijing&apos;s Dashanzi district. Here, contemporary artists, musicians and bourgeois dealers still rub shoulders with workers amongst the factory buildings. How they react to such situations is what makes Chinese art so thrilling. But as the workers are priced out and more money men move in, there&apos;s a real danger that the art itself could become stymied. Does success ruin art? There&apos;s no reason why it should.

As artist John Ruskin, an early member of the club, famously put it: &quot;Mountains are the beginning and end of all mountain scenery . . . the cathedrals of the Earth.&quot;  The pleasure and intense enjoyment they got from mountains lives on - but the cathedrals are crumbling. Now, more than ever, mountains matter. They are the ultimate litmus test - the most immediate, graphic indicator of what is happening to the Earth&apos;s climate. By chance, the club&apos;s founding in the mid-19th century coincided with the greatest extent of alpine glaciation since the Middle Ages. By the time I was doing my first big alpine climbs, around 1975, that volume of ice had halved, hence those long weary plods up ladders to huts which, 75 years earlier, had been built conveniently level with the glaciers. But what is remarkable is the speed of melting since I started climbing. A further 25% of total ice melted between 1975 and 2000, and an even faster 10-15% in the first five years of this century. Subterranean glue Ice faces I climbed as a youth have virtually disappeared. More serious is the melting of permafrost, the subterranean glue that has cemented apparently solid structures for centuries. Walter Bonatti, arguably the greatest mountaineer of the last 50 years, has seen his finest rock climb - 3,000ft of soaring golden brown granite on the Aiguille du Dru - crash to the valley floor, leaving an ugly grey scar.  The shattering of our playground would not matter if it were not such a clear demonstration of bigger concerns - both the alarming speed of the current warming worldwide and the specific threat to mountain communities threatened by destabilised mountain slopes. Of course, mountain landscapes - particularly young mountain ranges such as the Alps, Himalayas and Andes - are inherently unstable, in a constant state of flux; but the instability threatens to become much more acute. In Nepal, the speeding retreat of glaciers is producing ever more menacing meltwater lakes, beguilingly beautiful turquoise pools, held in place by terminal moraines - the rocky remnants of what were once solid ice termini. In 1941, high in the Peruvian Andes, a similar boulder dam burst, allowing a tidal wave of meltwater to crash down into the valley, wiping out 6,000 people in the city of Huaraz. In the 19th century, something similar happened in the Karakoram mountains of Pakistan - in this case, the retreating of a glacier that had dammed a tributary of the Indus. The tributary was renamed Shyok, meaning river of death. Mountain people are used to natural disasters, but perhaps those disasters are going to become much more common. And even if they have avoided cataclysm so far, many mountain communities are already facing more insidious challenges. Take, for example, the remote arid kingdom of Zanskar, in northern Kashmir. One of the pleasures for us mountain tourists is seeing how ingeniously people live in these places. For centuries, the Zanskaris&apos; subsistence farming has relied each summer on the steady drip-feed of melting snow and ice into meticulously constructed irrigation channels. Now the pattern seems to be changing. Dwindling winter snow and shrinking glaciers are resulting in a slower flow. Not only that, but unprecedented summer rains are flushing destructively through the terraced fields and drenching flat earthen roofs designed for a cold-dry climate. It is the wrong kind of water at the wrong time.  The traditional drip-feed effect is why Rolf Weingartner, a hydrologist at Switzerland&apos;s Berne University, describes mountains as the Earth&apos;s &quot;water towers&quot;. His team discovered, for instance, that 44% of the total volume of the Rhine emanates from the Alps, although the mountains only account for 15% of the river&apos;s actual catchment area. In the case of some rivers, such as the Niger and Nile, about 90% of the flow derives from mountains. The Punjab - the bread bowl of northern India and Pakistan - is named after the five rivers that all rise in the Himalayas close to that extraordinary holy mountain, Kailash, so revered by Hindus and Buddhists. Precise figures are not yet available, but Bruno Messerli, a leading geographer from Berne, suggests that perhaps as many as 1.5 billion people in China and south-east Asia get their water from the Himalayan ranges. Tentative plans to divert water from the Ganges and Brahmaputra to central India could hugely increase that number.  Source of life The figures may be imprecise and the models mind-bogglingly complex, but the general implication is clear: mountains matter, not just as a place of escape, but as the very source of life. We have always tended, like the ancient Jewish psalmist looking up to the hills for comfort, to think of the mountains as permanent, unchanging. In the case of our own European mountains, the familiar silhouettes of Mont Blanc, Matterhorn and Jungfrau are a precious shared heritage, yet their very forms, sculpted by the thaw-freeze cycles of the millennia, are evidence of mutability. They have always been changing. I just wish that, right now, they were not changing so fast. \u00b7  Stephen Venables, president of the Alpine Club, was the first Briton to climb Everest without supplementary oxygen. His autobiography, Higher Than the Eagle Soars, is published by Hutchinson (\u00a318.99).

Details: http://www.cms.uhi.ac.uk/conferences/ac150/ac150.htm Ground down As the glaciers melt in the Earth&apos;s highest regions, fresh water being pumped out of underground aquifers is having dramatic effects on agriculture, drinking water and food supplies. According to the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, the phenomenon now seriously affects China, India, Pakistan, the US and Mexico.  Groundwater is the second largest reserve of fresh water, making up 40% of the fresh water used in the US alone. The Ogallala aquifer below the Great Plains, on which much of America&apos;s grain is grown, is being depleted fast because the recharging process cannot keep up with the withdrawal of water. At least 6% of the aquifer has already dropped so low that it can no longer be pumped. If irrigation continues at the same rate, a further 6% will be used up every 25 years. The problem is that no one knows how long the water supply will last. In Iran, villages are being evacuated because wells are running dry. One report suggested that the water table dropped in places by eight metres in 2001 alone. In Yemen, the tables have been falling on average two metres a year. It has been predicted that the water supply to Sana&apos;a, the capital of Yemen, will run out within the next 10 years.  The aquifer under the north China plain - which includes Beijing and some of the country&apos;s most fertile farm areas - has dropped 15 metres in the last 30 years. The whole region has seen an area of nearly 76,000 sq km of deep groundwater drop below sea level. In some provinces, it is now more than 40 metres lower than it was. It has left the Yellow river unable to reach the ocean for months at a time. Apart from needing increasingly more electricity to lift water, groundwater depletion leads to subsidence, which is causing widespread damage to buildings, roads and sewer systems. More than 50 cities in China have been affected over a 95,000 sq km area. Near Shanghai, the land has dropped nearly three metres. In response, cities are now trying to artificially lift the water table by diverting rivers from areas of higher rainfall. The situation is worse on coastlines. When the freshwater is pumped out of the aquifers, sea water enters, contaminating the fresh water supplies and degrading soils. More than 400,000 people living near Laizhou Bay, southern China, need water shipped in after 8,000 wells and 40,000 hectares (988,000 acres) of land became unusable. Land has subsided more than seven metres in Mexico City since 1900, and is still dropping up to 40 cm a year. Subsidence is damaging the sewer system, which could potentially cause the untreated sewage to mix with the fresh water in the aquifer.John Vidal", "tags": ["Environment", "Glaciers", "Climate change"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-28T23:43:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/29/astonmartin", "sentences": ["&quot;But it was vital that we found the right partner who not only understood Aston Martin&apos;s brand values but also the luxury market.&quot; The company has awarded its China franchise to GruppeM which will open two showrooms, the first in Shanghai and the second in Beijing."], "title": "Creating a bond", "article": "Luxury car maker Aston Martin is opening two showrooms in China, the company&apos;s first foray into the country in its 93-year history.

Writing in today&apos;s Guardian, Stern, who produced a high-profile review of the economics of climate change last year, says rich countries must show leadership at a UN conference in Bali next week and aim for 80% cuts in their own pollution by 2050. The meeting will aim to agree the scope and timescale of a treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012.  Stern writes: &quot;Ambitious targets for emissions reduction must be at the heart of that agreement, together with effective market mechanisms that encourage emission trading between countries, rich and poor. The problem of climate change involves a fundamental failure of markets: those who damage others by emitting greenhouse gases generally do not pay. &quot;We risk damages on a scale larger than the two world wars of the past century. The problem is global and the response must be a collaboration on a global scale.&quot; Stern says the response must pay more attention to the issue of equity. &quot;Our starting point is deeply inequitable, with poor countries certain to be hit earliest and hardest by climate change.&quot;  The average emissions a head must fall from seven tonnes to two to three tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2050, he says. US emissions a head are more than 20 tonnes each year, with European citizens producing 10-15 tonnes each. In China it is about five tonnes, in India about one, and in Africa less than one tonne each. Stern says the rich countries also need to provide public funding for three more key elements of a global deal: to combat deforestation, develop technology such as carbon capture and storage, and to help poor and vulnerable regions adapt to the consequences of climate change. British officials do not expect the conference to produce a significant breakthrough, but they hope countries will agree general principles and set the ground for detailed talks over the next two to three years. Observers say a treaty needs to be finished by 2009-10 to follow Kyoto and allow carbon markets to develop. Separately, business leaders from 150 global companies will today call for mandatory cuts in carbon to be agreed at Bali.

We&apos;re in the fifth year of a bull market in New York, London and Shanghai - the best of times. Yet we&apos;re contemplating the worst of times. Is the credit crunch and sub-prime mortgage fiasco ramping up? Is the Chinese equities bubble about to pop, and if so, will it puncture world prosperity? Are the economies of North America and Europe slowing down, or headed for deep recession? The question is how these uncertain times affect the timing of our plans. My answer: the worst of times are often the best of times in which to launch a product, start a company, or make a bold career move. Don&apos;t let risky times dull your appetite for taking risks. The companies and products that make it big don&apos;t succeed because their champions &quot;time the market&quot; well. They succeed because they believe so deeply in what they are doing that they plunge ahead, often despite the worst possible macroeconomic conditions. The American publishing legend Henry Luce launched his glossy, outrageously expensive Fortune magazine in February 1930, four months after the crash of 1929. Did he do it because consultants told him the time was right? Of course not. (It&apos;s never a positive indicator when your target readers are hurling themselves off skyscrapers.) He did it because he believed in Fortune, and would not let bad times stand in the way of a great idea. The Irish aviation pioneer Tony Ryan, who passed away in October, launched Ryanair in 1985 - not because the timing was right, but because he was flush with cash from other ventures and fuelled by a fresh perspective on how to compete in the skies. It took a lot of money and years, but Ryan and chief executive Michael O&apos;Leary eventually built one of the most valuable (albeit controversial) brands in the business. But don&apos;t rely on the track records of deceased moguls to steel your courage. Listen to young mavericks as well. In the course of researching our book, we had long talks with Netscape cofounder Marc Andreessen. Here&apos;s what he said about timing innovation: &quot;Big, established companies are really good at executing ideas that make a lot of sense. So if you&apos;re going to start a company, you better have an idea so radical that most people think it&apos;s crazy. Dell sounded crazy - a personal computer company started in the teeth of an enormous recession in the industry. Google sounded like a crazy idea - another search engine, started in 1998, growing right through the dotcom meltdown. It seemed like lunacy.&quot; I&apos;m not in favour of lunacy, but I am in favour of originality. If you start a company when everyone else thinks it&apos;s a great time to start a company, how is that an advantage? If you launch a product into a category into which everyone else is launching products, how does that help you stand out? Indeed, if you have a genuinely good idea, bad times are often a big plus. The battle for talent is less ferocious. Potential investors aren&apos;t wading through a sea of rival business plans. All sorts of costs, from office space to ad space, are lower.  So don&apos;t let tough times shake your commitment to innovation and change. Use tough times to toughen your resolve - and improve your chances of success.

But small company investors have fared much worse: the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index has shed almost 13 per cent, leaving it down by a fifth over the last year, while the All Share is still - just - showing a gain over the same period. James Henderson, manager of a quartet of Henderson funds including the Lowland and Law Debenture investment trusts, points out that this has effectively wiped out the benefit of four years in which the tiddlers outperformed the titans, and he fears there could be worse to come. That is not because small firms have started reporting collapsing profits; indeed, with the odd exception, results have been holding up reasonably well. Rather it is because the credit crunch has spooked investors, and the more nervous they feel, the more likely they are to sell off less easily tradable, higher-risk assets like small-company shares.  Henderson&apos;s funds are not dedicated small-company trusts but he does tend to favour them. In general, around a fifth of his portfolios are in small firms, substantially more than the 4 per cent or so they make up of the total market. He believes that is a key reason for his funds&apos; good performance - Lowland, for example, was up 24 per cent over the year to September, well ahead of the 12 per cent rise in its benchmark, and has doubled over the past five years - but, he says, the outperformance has not been &apos;tidy&apos;. There have been regular bouts of turbulence of the type seen in recent weeks. There are reasons to be pessimistic. Retailers, housebuilders and other economically sensitive stocks dominate the small-cap index while the FTSE 100 has more utilities, telecoms and oil companies, which are more likely to shrug off a global slowdown. And the private equity bidders that had been buoying the market are becoming much less active now that cheap borrowing has dried up.  But, says Harry Nimmo, who runs Standard Life&apos;s small-cap funds, it is not all doom and gloom. While he does think the indices could have further to fall, he believes this will prove a good time to buy, and he highlights a host of stocks - from oil services group Expro to online retailer ASOS - that are still doing well. Henderson is not completely pessimistic either. He points out that the high valuations that had been a feature of the mid- and small-cap markets have now disappeared. He expects there will be &apos;real pain&apos; among small companies before the downturn ends, but he is still starting to buy &apos;selectively&apos;.  Over the long term, small companies should do better than large: common sense suggests that it is easier to double sales when they are \u00a3100m a year than \u00a3100bn. Patient investors should certainly have some of these funds in their portfolios and both the Lowland trust and Nimmo&apos;s smaller companies investment trust are worth considering.  Yesterday&apos;s hero always ends up letting you down In 2005 it was Japan and Korea. Last year it was small companies and property. And in 1999 and 2000 it was technology stocks. These were the funds that topped the performance charts in those years, but they have something else in common: the following year, they were among the worst performers. Japan had a stellar 2005 but has been lacklustre since. Anyone who bought a tech fund at the top of the market will still be nursing huge losses. As discussed above, small firms have had a difficult time this year while property funds have also been falling. That underlines one of this column&apos;s most enduring pieces of advice: do not buy a fund because it was last year&apos;s best performer. Heartwood Wealth Management, an investment adviser based in Tunbridge Wells, goes one step further. It has analysed fund performance data produced by Lipper Hindsight for the five years ending in 2002 and concludes that, of the top 50 funds in that period, only one stayed in the top 50 for the subsequent five years - and that was an obscure Indian specialist, denominated in dollars and managed by HSBC, that was unlikely to be a mainstay of any retail portfolio.  Heartwood, not surprisingly, says such lack of persistency means it is vital investors get advice about maintaining a portfolio that will keep performing as markets change. They can do it themselves, but that requires both the investment skills to identify turning points and the time to analyse management data. That explains the growing popularity of funds-of-funds, where a specialist fund manager spends his time doing exactly that. Jupiter, New Star and Thames River all have a range of fund of funds to suit different risk appetites. This year&apos;s best performing funds so far, according to Lipper Hindsight, have been China specialists. That is as good an indication as any that the spectacular Shanghai surge could be about to come to an abrupt end.", "tags": ["Investments", "Money", "FTSE"], "publicationDate": "2007-12-02T09:46:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/dec/03/games", "sentences": ["In Shanghai, gangs pay gamers to amassmoney and weapons online which they sell on to Western players."], "title": "Computer game giant born in \u00a39bn deal", "article": "The French media conglomerate Vivendi is merging its computer games business with its US-based rival Activision in an $18.9bn (\u00a39.2bn) deal that will create the world&apos;s largest computer games company. The move brings together franchises including the world&apos;s most popular online game, World of Warcraft, developed by Vivendi&apos;s Blizzard Entertainment, with Activision hits such as Guitar Hero (below right), and the Call of Duty and Tony Hawk franchises. The two companies hope to create a &quot;next-generation digital entertainment company&quot; from a deal that will see Vivendi hold 52% to 68% of the new company Activision Blizzard, which will leapfrog the market leader Electronic Arts, home to The Sims and Medal of Honor games. While traditional media such as film, TV and music struggle to adapt to the digital environment, computer games are increasingly using the ability to connect devices to the internet. Advertisers have also become interested in using computer games for their products as game franchises become more popular among young consumers.  The global computer games market is estimated at more than $30bn. Development costs, however, are rising because of the proliferation of gaming consoles - the Xbox, Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii. Global sales of software for these next-generation consoles are forecast to reach $13.9bn by 2009. The merger comes as next-generation devices move video game consoles from their traditional home in teenagers&apos; bedrooms to the living room, with DVD players and internet connections making them the hub of the digital home. The surprise success of Nintendo&apos;s Wii, meanwhile, has greatly expanded the potential video game audience by boosting family gaming. Activision&apos;s chairman and chief executive, Robert Kotick, said: &quot;Consumer engagement [with games] has changed, whether it&apos;s the impact of social gaming, or the Wii, where the physical interface now invites an entirely new audience, or the type of community being built in World of Warcraft, that is much more of a social network experience. It is not really just a video games company any more, this is the next-generation digital entertainment company we are building.&quot; For instance, Activision&apos;s popular Guitar Hero series, in which players use a guitar-style plug-in to play music, could be expanded by using content from Vivendi&apos;s Universal Music catalogue, explained Vivendi Games&apos; chairman, Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9nisson. &quot;Just thinking about how Guitar Hero can develop: it has to go to downloadable content and when you say downloadable content you say online and you think Blizzard and the fact that we are dominating the online area. When you say content you speak about Universal Music, it is such an obvious area for growth,&quot; he said. The latest instalment - Guitar Hero 3, released in late October - managed sales of more than $115m, or more than a third of the company&apos;s second-quarter revenues, in its first week. The deal also gives Activision access to Vivendi&apos;s distribution and gaming network, not only in Europe but in the Asia-Pacific region, where its World of Warcraft game has been highly popular. &quot;We become the world&apos;s largest, most profitable pure-play video game publisher; we touch every geography,&quot; added Kotick. This year the new company, which will be listed on Nasdaq, will have combined revenues of $3.8bn. Just last week Activision raised its quarterly earnings outlook as a result of strong sales of Guitar Hero and Call of Duty. For Blizzard, the deal provides access to shares, which it can use as incentives in an increasingly competitive market for game developers, according to its chief executive, Mike Morhaime. &quot;From the Blizzard perspective, we are very excited about the partnership ... one thing the deal does for Blizzard that really was not available to us before is give us access to a public currency that will really help us out with attracting talent,&quot; he said. The mechanics of the deal have been complicated by the desire of management at Activision, which is listed on Nasdaq, to give shareholders the chance to sell at least half their holdings. Vivendi Games is being merged with Activision in return for 295.3m new Activision shares. Vivendi will also buy a further 62.9m shares at $27.50 each, giving it up to a 52% stake. After the deal, the new company will launch a $4bn share buyback at $27.50. That deal will be part-funded by Vivendi and if fully taken up, the French company will have a 68% stake. The deal is the latest consolidation in the industry. Last month Warner Bros Home Entertainment Group bought TT Games, one of the world&apos;s largest independent game developers, and TT Games Publishing, the UK-based game publisher. Explainer: Virtual guns, real-life gangs World of Warcraft , created by Vivendi unit Blizzard Entertainment, is the world&apos;s most popular massive multi-player online role playing game or MMORPG. Launched in late 2004 it sailed past the nine million users over the summer making it the largest virtual gaming world on the internet. Players pay a subscription to play and can then pick from a host of character races and types and start marauding around a vast online world, teaming up with other players on quests to gain experience, greater power and wealth, or just generally create havoc. The market for subscription-based MMORPGs is forecast to reach well over $1.5bn by 2011, according to Screen Digest. Other games include Runescape, Legend of Mir 3 and sci-fi adventure Eve. These worlds are generating money for entrepreneurs - sometimes criminal - in the real world. The offline sale of goods which players use online is estimated to be worth \u00a3750m a year. The desire to acquire virtual money or weapons without playing, has created a booming industry.

The researchers predict that in 2070 Miami will be the city most exposed to flood risk globally in terms of the value of assets that could be destroyed. Miami is followed by Guangzhou in China, New York, Kolkata in India and Shanghai, in descending order of risk. London is 27th on the list. The 2070 list is very different from the equivalent ranking for current flood exposure due to rapid economic development in Asian countries. Today&apos;s top 10 contains cities from just three developed countries: the US, Japan and the Netherlands.  &quot;The objective really was to try and pinpoint which cities are potentially most vulnerable to climate change and where mitigation efforts should be focused,&quot; said Dr Celine Herweijer from the consultancy firm Risk Management Solutions, who was part of the team that compiled the study. &quot;Adaptation is critical. It shouldn&apos;t be sidelined,&quot; added Herweijer. &quot;[We should] not wait for another New Orleans.&quot; More than one million inhabitants The report was commissioned by the OECD and will be presented next week at the UN&apos;s climate change summit in Bali. The team, which included researchers at Southampton University, focused on the 136 port cites around the world with more than one million inhabitants.  It analysed the impact of the kind of storm surge that happens once every 100 years and assumed there were no flood defences in place. Herweijer said there is no reliable database of flood defences for all the cities and that even where they exist they can fail, as happened when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005.  The analysis gave each city a ranking of exposure based on either the value of assets that would be destroyed or the number of people affected.  The team then revised their predictions for the situation in 2070. This involved incorporating a half metre of sea-level rise - a fairly conservative estimate - and changes in wind strength and patterns due to climate change. They also factored in projected economic growth and both natural and human-induced subsidence. Asian cities at greatest risk The new ranking suggests that Asian cities in particular will be much more exposed to property damage on a massive scale. The value of Asian assets in the firing line from a one-in-100-year flood in 2070 will be 18 times greater than now, and 13 of the top 20 cities that the team predicts are most at risk are in China, India, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam. London comes in at 27, although it would currently be protected by the Thames Barrier against the sort of flood event that the researchers considered. This is designed to withstand a one-in-1,000-year flood and is one of the most robust in the world. The levees in New Orleans were designed to withstand a one-in-200-year event, while greater New York is protected against a one-in-100-year flood. &quot;Even assuming that protection levels will be high in future, the large exposure in terms of population and assets is likely to translate into regular city-scale disasters at global scale,&quot; the authors write in the report. They say governments must plan for what happens if flood defences do fail - for example disaster response strategies as well as recovery and reconstruction.

If England are going to save this game, someone is going to have to conjur up the kind of backs-to-the-wall resistance shown here four years ago by Michael Vaughan, whose innings of 110 was largely responsible for the side surviving 140 overs for the draw. Today they will face a maximum of 98 overs with nine wickets in hand, although the arrival of bad light at 5.30ish local time should mean Sri Lanka struggle to complete their quota - unless Muttiah Muralitharan gets through his overs like a man possessed. For the record - and a record at this ground it will be - England need another 341 to win. Forget that: today is all about a rearguard. An email from a person not called Gary Naylor. &quot;Another fine morning,&quot; says Adam Rutland, who is obviously not in London&apos;s trendy Clerkenwell, where it&apos;s dark, wet and lonely. &quot;I expect nothing less than a dogged display from Vaughan, reminding us of just what a first-class Test batsman he is. Or something.&quot; Fighting talk abounds today among the emailers. &quot;Well, what a big day for the series,&quot; points out Tom Cox in Rome. &quot;In my humble opinion it is nigh on impossible to play catch up in a Test series in Sri Lanka, particularly if we are to be without the Hogster, and so this becomes the defining moment of the series. Come on Belly, come on Colly - let&apos;s dig in for the duration, and win some serious psychological battles over Murali and co.&quot; He&apos;s got to get through Jimmy Anderson first! Kevin Pietersen, by the way, will be able to bat in his usual position (well, at No5 rather than No4 because of Anderson&apos;s promotion as nightwatchman). He didn&apos;t field at all during Sri Lanka&apos;s second innings because of a cracked hand/little finger (depending on what you read), but the fact that it&apos;s an internal injury means he doesn&apos;t have to wait until the fall of the fifth wicket. A prediction England&apos;s tail to hold on in the gloom with men round the bat and Murali in search of a seventh wicket. Hey, an OBO writer can dream, can&apos;t he? After all, it&apos;s still the middle of the night here... 6th over: England 13-1 (Vaughan 1, Anderson 4) So, here we go. For England fans, it&apos;s a scenario that has become familiar enough over the years, which is what makes it strangely comforting. If the roles were reversed, we wouldn&apos;t know what to do with ourselves, would we? It&apos;s Lasith Malinga to Jimmy Anderson, who must regard this nightwatchman role as something of a promotion: Ryan Sidebottom might have been a more likely candidate, although Hoggard&apos;s back injury would have ruled him out. The fourth ball is a brute that goes through the top and clears Prasanna Jayawardene&apos;s outstretched glove behind the stumps: four byes, but a maiden. 7th over: England 18-1 (Vaughan 5, Anderson 4) Chaminda Vaas begins with a no-ball that cannons off Vaughan&apos;s inside edge and trickles to fine-leg for four. That one swung, which spells danger for England. When Vaas gets the ball to move into the right-handers, he can be a, er, right handful. &quot;I see Salman Butt managed 11 for 91 balls faced,&quot; says Max Mudrik. &quot;Perhaps a quick word from him on the concept of rearguard wouldn&apos;t go amiss in the England dressing room? They all are in the subcontinent, it ain&apos;t that big.&quot; Well, you say that... 8th over: England 18-1 (Vaughan 5, Anderson 4) Anderson is drawn to a ball outside off-stump from Malinga like a moth to a blowtorch, but he misses and survives. Two balls later, the ball almost shaves the outside edge again. Oohs and aahs. It would be a real plus for England if the nightwatchman could hang around for a bit. If he can do it, the others will be thinking, so can we. &quot;Anyone in the world (and yes, I&apos;m looking at you in particular, America) who assumes watching five days of Test cricket without getting a winner is boring should be made to watch today&apos;s play (and a replay of Old Trafford in the 2005 Ashes),&quot; says Will Sinclair in Sydney. &quot;It&apos;s gripping stuff. And, for an Aussie, a nice change from the inevitability of watching my own team play.&quot; 9th over: England 20-1 (Vaughan 5, Anderson 5) Anderson is drawn to a ball outside off-stump from Malinga like a moth to a blowtorch, but he misses and survives. Two balls later, the ball almost shaves the outside edge again. Oohs and aahs. It would be a real plus for England if the nightwatchman could hang around for a bit. If he can do it, the others will be thinking, so can we. He tucks a no-ball to square-leg - that would have been the last ball of the over - and Vaughan defends. &quot;Anyone in the world (and yes, I&apos;m looking at you in particular, America) who assumes watching five days of Test cricket without getting a winner is boring should be made to watch today&apos;s play (and a replay of Old Trafford in the 2005 Ashes),&quot; says Will Sinclair in Sydney. &quot;It&apos;s gripping stuff. And, for an Aussie, a nice change from the inevitability of watching my own team play.&quot; WICKET! Vaughan c P Jayawardene b Vaas 5 (22-2) England lose a wicket and it&apos;s not Anderson. Oh dear. Vaughan nibbles at a ball from Vaas that leaves him sufficiently to take the outside edge and that was a simple catch for Prasanna Jayawardene. The hero of Kandy 2003 is gone. 11th over: England 27-2 (Anderson 11, Bell 0) Apologies for the technical issues here, and I&apos;m not talking about Vaughan&apos;s nibble outside off. Anderson, living on his wits, edges Malinga along the ground and through the slips for four, then pinches a single into the covers like an old pro. &quot;Murali&apos;s world beating efforts are scorned upon due to the number of wickets against &apos;lesser&apos; teams.,&quot; says Gavin Mulcahy. &quot;That number is about to be increased, or do we really think that England are not to be included in that category?&quot; Well, they are currently ranked No2 in the world... WICKET! Anderson b Vaas 11 (27-3) It had to happen. Anderson, caught on the crease, is squared up by the excellent Vaas and the ball cannons into the top of off-stump. This is not going according to plan. &quot;Considering his dropped catch, it should be Bell&apos;s rearguard that gets a kick,&quot; chortles Amar Breckenridge. 12th over: England 37-3 (Bell 1, Pietersen 4) Bell gets off the mark with a stylish flick for one off Malinga to deep midwicket, and then Pietersen plays the kind of shot of which only he is capable: an off-drive on the up against a perfectly respectable delivery. Four runs. 13th over: England 37-3 (Bell 1, Pietersen 4) England need to think of this in terms of only having lost one wicket: Vaughan. Anderson hardly counts. So if these two can bat until lunch, they are still in a reasonable position. Granted, that&apos;s 1hr 50 mins away, but - hey! - you&apos;ve got to be positive. A Vaas no-ball is England&apos;s lot off that over. 14th over: England 41-3 (Bell 2, Pietersen 6) Dilhara Fernando replaces Malinga, and the goodish news on a bad morning for England is that Pietersen&apos;s finger injury seems to be bearing up. The plan at the moment, apparently, is to play him in Colombo - the second Test starts on Sunday.  15th over: England 46-3 (Bell 2, Pietersen 10) Apologies for the disappearance. The system decided it didn&apos;t want to work for a while. Anyway, we&apos;re back now and Vaas oversteps for the fifth time, but we&apos;re not going to hold that against a man who has taken 325 Test wickets and all three so far in this innings, are we? Pietersen certainly isn&apos;t: there&apos;s four runs through extra cover - lovely shot! &quot;Given England&apos;s current run rate we could be in with a shout of winning, with most coming in extras,&quot; quips Andy Turner. &quot;Going back to the complaint about Murali getting lots of his wickets against poor teams, I don&apos;t remember any Aussies complaining about Hayden breaking a world record against Zimbabwe...&quot; 16th over: England 55-3 (Bell 3, Pietersen 18) The camera focusses on an England fan dressed as Darth Vader, and Beefy&apos;s fuming. &quot;Not the most sensible attire in this heat,&quot; he rages as Darth props forward with his light sabre. Meanwhile, a sheet of tarpaulin blows off one of the stands and sends England fans scattering for safety. Undeterred, Pietersen drives Fernando down the ground for four, then hammers the next delivery on the up through cover. Classic KP - and equally classic is his attempt to make it three in three: that was an ugly hoick for none. &quot;Did you fall asleep at the computer?&quot; wonders Evelyn Williames (and 1,056 others). &quot;I am reduced to looking on Cricinfo which has just informed me that England are about to appoint their first fielding coach. Hope you overcome whatever technical problems you have soon - it&apos;s just not the same without you.&quot; Aw shucks. 17th over: England 55-3 (Bell 3, Pietersen 18) Bell&apos;s role here is not get sucked into any kind of battle with Pietersen, and that&apos;s a sensible maiden played out against Vaas. Robert Croft suggested in the Sky studio that Bell&apos;s change of approach in the first innings might have been caused by KP&apos;s presence at the other end. It was a fairly speculative theory, but not the most ridiculous one I&apos;ve ever heard. If Bell is going to take his game to the next level, today might just be the day to do it. Michael Anderson has other ideas. &quot;The key here is going to be how many balls it takes Prior to make his duck,&quot; he guffaws. &quot;If he can stretch it to 40+ we&apos;ll be doing well. Then all we need is a 350-ball half-century of ginger nurdles and we&apos;re home and dry. Easy.&quot; WICKET! Pietersen b Fernando 18 (55-4) England are doomed. Doomed, I tell ye. Fernando produces a ball that creeps along the ground and takes Pietersen&apos;s inside edge en route to off-stump. KP stands and stares at the crease as if it has just spilled his pint and that, surely, settles it. It&apos;s Will Sinclair: &quot;Re: Andy Turner&apos;s comment that he doesn&apos;t &quot;remember any Aussies complaining about Hayden breaking a world record against Zimbabwe...&quot; Why, exactly, would anyone complain about that? Apart, of course, from the Zimbabwe bowlers.&quot; 18th over: England 57-4 (Bell 3, Collingwood 2) Apart from anything, that mollygrubber deprives a tired OBO writer of the joys of watching a KP special, which is one of the few reasons to get up this early. Nick Knight is blaming himself - some superstitious drivel about the &quot;commentator&apos;s curse&quot; - but I blame me for banging on about Bell not getting sucked into a battle with Pietersen. Yes, it&apos;s all my fault. Paul Collingwood collects two through midwicket off Fernando with a very thick inside edge, but there&apos;s an air of hopelessness in England&apos;s approach now. 19th over: England 65-4 (Bell 11, Collingwood 2) There&apos;s that Bell cover-drive that encourages some of us to predict great things. It was a slightly wider one from Vaas, but he leant into it with the grace of the Tower of Pisa. And there&apos;s four more, this time off the back foot through the covers. Glorious. &quot;From your quote (16th over) I see Beefy has picked up the Goweresque predilection for the figure of speech leitotes,&quot; says classics scholar Ian Forth. &quot;Barely an over goes past without Gower explaining that Tendulkar is &quot;a batsman of no mean achievement&quot; or that Monty&apos;s attempt was &quot;not exactly the smartest piece of fielding you&apos;ll see this summer&quot;. Bumble, on the other hand, you sense, is ever on the edge of tmesis - &quot;unbloominglievable!&quot;&quot; Nice.  20th over: England 70-4 (Bell 11, Collingwood 7) That lesser-spotted beast: the Collingwood cover-drive. And very chunky it was too as Fernando overpitched. Colly follows the boundary with a tip-and-run for a single towards point. With the debutant Bopara next in, followed by Prior and the tail, these two are going to have to bat for the better part of two sessions. And we still haven&apos;t seen Murali. Does &quot;lost cause&quot; spring to mind? &quot;While not wishing for KP to get out, I&apos;m at least comforted by the fact that there&apos;s nothing for him to whine about in this dismissal,&quot; says Sunil X, with curious logic. &quot;No chance of him being recalled to the crease, for one thing!&quot; And that&apos;s a good thing? 21st over: England 75-4 (Bell 13, Collingwood 10) And here&apos;s Murali, who is cut for two by Collingwood and responds by beating him otuside off-stump with the doosra. He follows that with a single to square-leg, before Bell goes inside out to take two to deep cover. Neat shot. &quot;Why are they so soft?&quot; moans Matt Baden, sounding briefly like Baldrick in that episode of Blackadder Goes Forth when he is briefly enveloped by existential angst at the futility of it all. &quot;The only two with any heart are Bell and Collingwood, and Vaughan sometimes. You have to tough it out. English players like Pietersen etc only do well when the wicket is good for batting. When it isn&apos;t they just sh*t themselves like little girls. Not acceptable.&quot; I think that&apos;s complete rubbish, Matt, but there you have it.  22nd over: England 77-4 (Bell 14, Collingwood 11) At least these two aren&apos;t going quietly. Bell and Collingwood take a single apiece off Fernando, who then goes up for a decent-looking shout against the overbalancing Collingwood. Missing leg, I think. &quot;When we lose this series will we also lose our position as 2nd best team in the world?&quot; asks Matthew Price. &quot;Bearing in mind that Australia utterly crushed Sri Lank in the recent series in Oz.&quot; I think it might depend on whether India beat Pakistan, which is entirely possible given that they take a 1-0 lead into the final Test. But I&apos;m not certain. Also, I wouldn&apos;t compare Sri Lanka v England with Australia v Sri Lanka, for a whole host of reasons that a lack of time prevents me from outlining. 23rd over: England 82-4 (Bell 18, Collingwood 12) Bell sweeps Murali for a single and Collingwood pushes him for one into the covers. Murali responds to this double-slight by going round the wicket to Bell, but Bell&apos;s response is excellent - an inside-out steer through extra cover for two. That&apos;s the second time he&apos;s played that shot today and evidence, perhaps, of the influence Andy Flower is having on Bell&apos;s game against spin. A single to short third man follows and - whisper it - England are milking the greatest wicket-taker in the history of Test cricket. &quot;My logic is impeccable,&quot; says Sunil X (see over 20), &quot;given that I hate him and what he stands for.&quot; At the risk of getting all philosophical, doesn&apos;t hate preclude logic? 24th over: England 86-4 (Bell 19, Collingwood 14) Fernando beats Bell with one that grows big on him, although Bell did drop the hands and withdraw the bat at the last minute. He celebrates this smart work with a single to square-leg. A no-ball and Collingwood&apos;s back-foot force for two make it four off the over. &quot;Update the OBO, Vaughan is out,&quot; screams Shripad Deo. &quot;GONE. Not Anderson, but Vaughan. WOW!&quot; I feel like I&apos;m stuck in some awful time warp. 25th over: England 90-4 (Bell 21, Collingwood 16) Murali continues to be milked, the flash in the pan that he so obviously is. Most of the singles come through point as the two right-handers push forward to balls delivered from round the wicket. &quot;KP&apos;s dismissal was a bad thing overall,&quot; says Sunil X, conducting an inner dialogue. &quot;I&apos;m just glad that he doesn&apos;t get a chance to get recalled to the wicket or whinge, kvetch and moan about the unfairness of it.&quot; Why would he do that? Are you thinking of Lord&apos;s against India, when his team-mates encouraged him to stay put after Dhoni claimed a catch on the half-volley? WICKET! Collingwood c Sangakkara b Fernando 16 (90-5) A miserable shot from Collingwood who drives a half-volley straight to short extra cover. Mystifying. &quot;England aren&apos;t soft,&quot; says Robin Somethingorother which I can&apos;t read because it&apos;s one of those fancy signatures. &quot;We just don&apos;t have enough high-class players to create competition and therefore improvement in the international set-up. Pietersen could get six golden ducks in a row and still command a place, whereas in the Australian side the only batsman who is secure is Ponting. And yes, even Hussey would lose his place with a couple of bad matches.&quot; Are you sure about that?  26th over: England 90-5 (Bell 21, Bopara 0) Andy Bull walked in just as Collingwood was taking leave of his senses. It&apos;s fair to say the air turned a mild shade of blue.  27th over: England 90-5 (Bell 21, Bopara 0) Murali stays round the wicket to Bell as Bull brings me a cup of tea. Bill will be on later, but not if Ball gets there first. And don&apos;t get me started on Boll. &quot;I am really enjoying the commentary on England&apos;s batting collapse from my office in Sydney, it brings back so many great memories of England games in the recent past,&quot; bellows Peter Soutter, exchanging high fives with his colleagues for his annual show of wit. &quot;The rest of the world seems to think that all Australians think that Murali is a &apos;chucker&apos; - we don&apos;t but he&apos;s not considered a great here because he has not performed against Australia. Other modern greats like Lara, Tendulkar, Ambrose, Walsh, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, even Pieterson and Flintoff have all done it against Australia and are held in great affection here, some players are loved in Australia like Very Very Special Laxman but are ignored by the rest of the world. Not performing against the best damages a players right to be considered great - even Warne&apos;s status is damaged by his average against India.&quot; If Warne&apos;s status is damaged, where does that leave the hundreds of mere mortals who trail in his wake? Hmm? 28th over: England 95-5 (Bell 21, Bopara 5) Luck for Bopara who edges Fernando at catchable height between keeper and a wide first slip. That looked like a wicket from the moment it hit the bat, as they don&apos;t generally say, but the two Jayawardenes left it to each other. Ah well, I don&apos;t suppose the Sri Lankans will be rocking silently in their armchairs in 50 years&apos; time as they remember the one that got away. &quot;What would Sunil X make of Chris Broad&apos;s approach to being given out on the subcontinent?&quot; says Ian Forth. &quot;No kvetching, he just stood there, furious and/or incredulous, waiting for the next delivery, till Goochy gently persuaded him to leave the field.&quot; 29th over: England 107-5 (Bell 21, Bopara 17) Lovely shot from Bopara, who uses his feet to drive Murali through extra cover for four. Bold stuff in the circumstances. And then he cuts behind point for four with a lot of wrist - very unEnglish. A leg-glance for four completes a productive over. &quot;Re: robin somethingorother&apos;s point,&quot; says Amar Berckenridge. &quot;well, a lack of internal competition does produce softness - Australian cricketers are battle hardened because they know that each test is a competition between the opposing team, and those others who did not get selected. Infact in recent years one would argue that the latter form of competition has been the fiercer of the two. Internal competition is the Viagra that stops teams going soft (ho hum)&quot; 30th over: England 110-5 (Bell 22, Bopara 17) Bell averages nearly 60 in the first innings of a Test and 23 in the second, so here&apos;s a chance to put things right. Two leg-byes off Fernando&apos;s first ball keep the scoreboard ticking over - which is not to be sniffed at, five wickets or not - and Bell then tucks the fifth ball to deep square-leg for a single. Interesting that Mahela Jayawardene persists with so many men in the deep. It&apos;s a throwback to the unimaginative days of Hashan Tillekeratne. &quot;Can we have more from Sunil X please?&quot; begs Will Sinclair in Sydney. &quot;His one man crusade against KP&apos;s imagined sins is somehow inspiring in these days of popular apathy. Maintain the rage Sunil!&quot; 31st over: England 113-5 (Bell 22, Bopara 19) Malinga returns in place of Murali (6-1-28-0: surprisingly expensive) and tries to get Bell with the toecrusher. But it&apos;s heading down leg and Rauf signals a leg-bye. And, as Bopara pushes two to deep cover, Will Sinclair&apos;s wish is Sunil X&apos;s command. &quot;Indeed I was thinking of that instance at Lord&apos;s,&quot; he confirms. &quot;Oddly enough, no one has thought to mention that the Umpire&apos;s verdict is ***FINAL***. There was a similar instance concerning an Indian batsman in the following Test and he wasn&apos;t called back to the crease. Beyond that is the way that KP comports himself, as though any dismissal is somehow a continuation of a &quot;quota&quot; policy designed to repress him.&quot; These days, Sunil, the umpire&apos;s word is anything but final.  32nd over: England 113-5 (Bell 22, Bopara 19) Murali was just changing ends, so England&apos;s sighs of relief are put on hold. Bell has played him better than anyone in this match, and is watchful against the round-the-wicket mode of attack. A maiden. &quot;Peter Soutter lives in a part of Sydney I unfortunately can&apos;t recognize (or maybe it&apos;s just his high-fiving office),&quot; says Ian Forth. &quot;Where is this peculiar, possibly unique, enclave who hold the view that Murali isn&apos;t a chucker? Perhaps Sunrise (the morning show on Channel 7) could run a feature on it. They got hot under the collar last week when a survey concluded that Norway and Iceland were better places to live than Australia, so this should be right up their street.&quot; 32nd over: England 119-5 (Bell 22, Bopara 23) Bopara glances Malinga&apos;s first ball to the long-leg fence and a couple of extras make it six off the over. Fifteen minutes to go before lunch, after which Andy Bull will hold your hand. &quot;*R-A-G-E*&quot; seethes Sunil X. &quot;Seriously though. The umpire&apos;s decision is *Final*. Batsmen may stand and look askance, but eventually they have to trudge off. What is to come in future? Batsmen dawdling on way to Pavilion, not crossing with the incoming batsman until their mates have scrutinised the TV replays? Besides that one incident is a history of KP&apos;s cavilling. Monstrous ego!&quot; Hmm. That clearly separates him from the vast majority of other international sportsmen... 33rd over: England 120-5 (Bell 22, Bopara 24) Bopara is playing with nice touch and confidence here, tickling Murali&apos;s second ball to deep backward square for a single. This is his chance to show that his selection ahead of Owais Shah was merited.  34th over: England 123-5 (Bell 23, Bopara 25) Beefy Outrage Alert. &quot;If anyone&apos;s hoping for rain to save England,&quot; he thunders, &quot;I suggest they dream on.&quot; Malinga oversteps and Bopara tucks the offending delivery to midwicket for a single. Bell has gone into his shell, but no matter. If in some crazed parallel universe England hope to save this game, he will have to do most of the batting. His first run for five overs comes courtesy of a wide one which he toe-ends to deep cover. &quot;As another Aussie finds the whole Murali Chucking controversy distasteful I wanted to mention that in my office there was only one bloke who felt he had to rant about how &apos;he&apos;s a thrower and a disgrace&apos;, says Gus. &quot;He was opposed by three other Australians and no one backed him. Murali&apos;s and Warne&apos;s achievements are magnificent. It is as absorbing to argue about their merits as bowlers as it is puerile to slag them off for their perceived faults - Warne&apos;s undisciplined personal life, Murali&apos;s action. First time I saw him bowl I thought it was illegal, but I changed my mind about that when the evidence was presented.&quot;  35th over: England 124-5 (Bell 24, Bopara 25) Start sending your emails to andy.bull@theguardian.com please. He&apos;ll be in action from 7.30am GMT, or 10 minutes before the start of the afternoon session for those of you live a few miles outside Greenwich. Murali wants to change the ball, and well he might with figures of none for 29. I knew they&apos;d find him out sooner or later. Bell lingers dangerously in the crease and is lucky to get a single off a big inside edge. There will be time for one more over before the break. &quot;So going by Peter Soutter&apos;s logic (over 27), does that mean that most Indians regard Shane Warne as decidedly average, while Neil Foster is right up there in the pantheon of all-time greats?&quot; says Duncan Harte in Shanghai. &quot;And presumably most Australians would generally agree that Alan Mullally has the slight edge over Murali?&quot; I guess it&apos;s the only logical conclusion. 36th over: England 125-5 (Bell 25, Bopara 25) Sanath Jayasuriya enters the attack in his final Test. He currently has 97 wickets, and almost makes it 98 with his first ball, a beauty that passed Bell&apos;s defensive push and just missed off-stump. And that&apos;s lunch. &quot;I quite agree,&quot; says Norwegian Jon living in Reykjavik re over 32. &quot;Life is great here, although our national cricket team is yet to make the breakthrough to the world stage that was predicted a few years back.&quot; I must have missed that one.

The bank admitted yesterday that its profits were being dented by three factors - one of which is the $46m write-down caused by its investment in a sophisticated debt product known as a structured investment vehicle (SIV). Although its shares are listed in London and it is based in the capital, Standard Chartered generates its profits outside the UK, largely in emerging markets. While other London-listed banks have been knocked by the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, it has been largely unaffected. Richard Meddings, finance director, said: &quot;We are having an excellent year. It&apos;s a tale of two worlds. When we travel to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Dubai or Beijing the world feels a very different place from where we are sitting in London or New York.&quot; More usually regarded as a bet on risky emerging markets, Standard Chartered&apos;s shares are up on the year, against the 20% slump experienced by the rest of the banking sector, where confidence has been knocked by the near-collapse of Northern Rock. Standard Chartered&apos;s shares rose 46p to \u00a318.93 yesterday, although some analysts questioned the bank&apos;s ability to control costs. In a trading update, the bank said it was &quot;broadly comfortable&quot; with analysts&apos; forecasts for 2007 pre-tax operating profits of about $3.96bn, up from $3.18bn in 2006. Asian markets are yet to feel the chill caused by the sub-prime crisis but Meddings admitted a recession in the US could quickly spread to Asia. The impact on Standard Chartered so far is largely indirect. Its SIV, Whistlejacket, has fallen in value to $10.8bn from $18.2bn since the credit markets seized up in August. SIVs borrow short-term money and then invest it in longer term assets. The downturn in the debt markets means it can no longer borrow money on the same terms as in the past but is still sitting on assets.  Its rival bank HSBC admitted last month to problems with its SIVs and put $45bn of assets once held by the vehicles on to its own balance sheet. Standard Chartered has taken a slightly different approach and regards the $46m write-down as &quot;temporary&quot;. Meddings said income would be generated back to the group over the next three and a half years but that it also expected to take another hit, of a similar size, before the end of the year, when it takes more of its assets on to its books. The assets are largely loans issued to other major financial institutions although 5% are in risky CDOs - the collateralised debt obligations often created to hold sub-prime mortgages at the heart of the current market crisis. Another factor affecting Standard Chartered&apos;s 2007 profits is its operations in Korea, where it has conducted a number of securitisations of mortgages. Accounting policies mean that the bank will need to take a hit to income of $133m even though the deals are economically profitable. The third factor hitting profits is the delay in the sale of its Indian asset management business to UBS, which means $120m will not be included in this year&apos;s figures. The City is scrutinising trading statements from the major banks for evidence of the market turmoil&apos;s impact. Today the Royal Bank of Scotland is to update investors and could admit to a \u00a31.5bn-\u00a32bn write-off of sub-prime losses. Lloyds TSB and HBOS statements are due next week. Bank shares recovered some of the losses suffered on Tuesday when the Financial Services Authority warned the sector that conditions were likely to get worse. The regulator also acknowledged that market conditions may never return to those enjoyed before August.

After his elder brother, Lachlan, resigned from his executive roles with News Corp in 2005, James, 34, became Murdoch&apos;s only son working for the family stable. In 2003, he was hired by his father to steer the then loss-making BSkyB into clearer waters, something he has achieved this year, earning a reported \u00a34m bonus in the process. His appointment at Sky was dogged by controversy after Rupert Murdoch overlooked the more experienced Allan Leighton in his son&apos;s favour, prompting accusations of nepotism. The Harvard alumnus has repaid his father&apos;s trust by staying loyal to the family business, moving from chief executive of the Star Group, Murdoch&apos;s Asian satellite TV division, to Sky. But father and son have not always been on such close terms. James has something of a wild child reputation, ditching Harvard to set up a moderately successful record label. Despite the mixed success of that venture his father backed him for the Star TV job, where he made his name. Meanwhile, Les Hinton&apos;s meteoric rise from copy boy to one of Rupert Murdoch&apos;s most trusted lieutenants has been cemented over four decades of working with the News Corp boss. Well liked in media circles, the publicity-shy Liverpudlian is seen as the perfect foil to Murdoch, and was plucked from his adopted home in the US to run News Corp&apos;s UK interests.  He has offset his tabloid career by sitting as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission code committee, setting journalistic standards. Recently Hinton overcame an initial wariness about web publishing to lead the drive online at the Times and the Sun. Colleagues speak highly of Hinton. Doug Flynn, the Rentokil Initial head and Hinton&apos;s deputy for six years, said he is &quot;a good guy, a good journalist and a good judge of people.

In 2002, Murdoch gave Harding, then FT media editor, the rare honour of a face-to-face interview.  &quot;He&apos;s a very good reporter because he can get through doors,&quot; a former FT colleague recalls of Harding. &quot;But I can&apos;t think of an amazing splash that he had while at the FT.&quot;  Harding, dubbed a man about town by some in Fleet Street, wrote an amusing profile of Murdoch, who today promoted him to one of the most prestigious jobs in journalism.  The piece, a sparkling profile, is unlikely to come back to haunt him. &quot;Over a three-hour lunch, the News Corp chairman nursed only a glass of water, picked at pepper-encrusted tuna and politely but firmly told the company butler not to bring the pear and chocolate pudding anywhere near him.  &quot;The conversation offers a glimpse of the essential Rupert Murdoch: inseparable from his business, bored by royalty, borderless in his commercial appetite, indiscreet when it suits his purpose and never lost for a disparaging tale about one of his competitors.&quot; Today saw a muted atmosphere inside the Times House adjacent to the main Wapping complex.  Staff prepared the Saturday paper and awaited the long-expected announcement, while executives locked themselves away to prepare the press announcement released at 4pm.  Harding reportedly was in a good mood as he chaired what was his last morning section conference as business editor. Some Times staff see him as a fantastic front man and strategist for the paper.  &quot;He will bring a wonderful energy and be a great ambassador,&quot; said one. &quot;He will be great on TV. What will be interesting is how he will work internally. He is not hands on - he&apos;s no Paul Dacre.&quot; No one is in any doubt that the job represents an enormous step up for Harding - who has not even scored a place on the Sunday editing rota and lacks the management experience that Robert Thomson gained with the FT in America before he got the top job in 2002.  &quot;He&apos;s very smart, very talented, but has got less experience so he needs people around him to fill in the gaps,&quot; said a senior News International editorial executive. A major shakeup at the 222-year-old paper is inevitable. Most speculation centres around the future of deputy editor Ben Preston. Earlier this week some of Harding&apos;s team could not bring themselves to believe he was about to take over as editor, while executives at the Daily Telegraph appeared sure of the appointment weeks ago.  Harding is close friends with Telegraph editor-in-chief Will Lewis, another member of the FT diaspora.  &quot;He&apos;s probably a little bit smarter than Will, Will puts his foot in it,&quot; said a former FT colleague. However, Harding&apos;s journalistic career was nearly stillborn. After a first class history degree from Trinity College, Cambridge, he learnt Japanese and moved to Japan, landing a job as a speechwriter in the office of Koichi Kato, then Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary.  He then joined the European Commission, before interviewing for a job at the FT in 1994. It was nearly a disastrous start - he turned up very late for a job interview. Harding&apos;s excuse was that he had turned up at the nearby offices of a national tabloid by mistake.  Richard Lambert, the editor at the time, was far from impressed but sent off Harding to write a leader. It was so impressive that it appeared in the next day&apos;s paper. And Harding duly got the job.  It took him just two years to get a foreign posting: China. He learnt Chinese from scratch and was at the helm when the Times opened its Shanghai bureau - the first European newspaper to do so since the 1949 revolution.  Harding returned to the UK to be media editor in 1999 and was appointed Washington bureau chief in 2002, where he was central to the paper&apos;s expansion in north America, working with Lionel Barber.  Harding, who also speaks French and German, has been active beyond journalism, mentoring two secondary school children in the south London borough of Southwark. He also set up justdosomething.net with the Common Purpose civic action group, an online service that links professionals with non-executive positions in local schools, prisons, hospitals and national charities.  One close friend of Harding&apos;s said they were unsurprised by today&apos;s announcement.  &quot;He&apos;s charming, he has the ability to get on with people and he has incredible energy levels,&quot; the source added.  &quot;He gets on really well with the Murdochs. He&apos;s known them from the days when he set up the FT&apos;s Shanghai bureau.&quot; When the Times hired Harding, Thomson was moved to describe him as &quot;one of the most outstanding journalists of his generation&quot;.  A former FT colleague puts it slightly differently: &quot;He is very good at doing things well that he doesn&apos;t know anything about.&quot;  \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

The conclusions attributed to those quoted in the article are at odds with many distinguished colleagues working in science and engineering across British universities, and also with the UK&apos;s own research councils. Prof Ian Gow, who received an OBE in recognition of his considerable efforts to help us establish a world first - the University of Nottingham Ningbo China - may well have been reported out of context, but his views as published were unwarrantedly defensive. The manner in which they were presented does little justice to his previous achievement as foundation provost at our award-winning and successful China campus. Prof Gow, a social scientist, and the other contributors to the Agora thinktank paper, which was reported unchallenged, can be reassured that individual UK research councils, as well as the EU, are fostering collaborative research with China across medicine, science and engineering. They regard it as an important development in their thinking and their funding programmes. Recently a consortium of British universities, including Nottingham, King&apos;s College London and Southampton, and more than 20 universities in China, agreed to pool their expertise to bring joint innovation to the worldwide marketplace. Innovation China-UK is now supporting academic and business partners in funding proof-of-concept research, and in commercialising intellectual property. The University of Nottingham has, for several years, been undertaking tripartite plant genetics work with two distinguished Chinese institutions, Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Among our shared goals are combining the experience of all three universities in plant genetics. Happily, the venture is also promoting joint applications for international funding, and it is providing exciting training and exchange opportunities for research students and staff in both nations. This is just one example from a vast range across the sciences. It is extremely difficult to decipher in it, and countless research projects like it, any kind of &quot;threat&quot; to British scholarship or to the UK economy, and, fortunately, Research Councils UK and the British government agree. Globalisation means that our country cannot &quot;stay at home&quot;. Nor, to quote Prof Michael Shattock (with perhaps the most depressing view to have emerged from Agora&apos;s exercise), can UK universities &quot;stick to their knitting&quot;. The article claimed that Prof Gow &quot;called British institutions &apos;incredibly na\u00efve&apos; for handing over their research in key disciplines to get a foothold in China&quot;. In fact, he was cautioning emerging joint ventures, and not those already well established, but little matter. Leading international universities are very carefully managing the risks involved in any overseas venture to expand their sphere of influence. Research, like student exchanges with China, has to be two-way to be sustainable. The &quot;win-win&quot; situation we are being urged in undeservedly panicked tones to &quot;engineer&quot; is in fact already underway, on a fair and reciprocal basis, and it is flourishing.

His new job will see him working closely with Murdoch and Les Hinton, the News International executive who is also moving to New York to be the chief executive of Dow Jones. Rupert Murdoch said of Thomson: &quot;Robert&apos;s brilliant editorial instincts, combined with his keen sense of the marketplace, will be tremendously valuable at this critical stage in the expansion of the Wall Street Journal and the other Dow Jones properties.&quot; Thomson added: &quot;I have cherished my time at the Times. I now look forward to increasing the reach and influence of Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal, great brands destined to have an even greater future.&quot; Prior to joining the Times, Thomson was editor of the FT&apos;s US edition, spearheading the paper&apos;s drive into the American market. Before that, he was editor of the Weekend FT and assistant editor of the paper.

A Turkish orphan raised in Frankfurt, his missions have led him into parts of society where only an outcast can survive, and while getting down among the gangsters, hookers and barflies he has held up a mirror to contemporary Germany. In Kismet, that world is in violent flux, thanks to the Balkans conflict and the arrival of its warlords. Kayankaya sees their methods first-hand when his friend Romario&apos;s bar is targeted by a couple of trigger-happy blonde mutes calling themselves the Army of Reason. The bloody trail leads to a poisonous soup manufacturer, a cell of nationalist Croats and a grim hostel where Bosnian refugee Leila desperately needs help. Arjouni forges both a gripping caper and a haunting indictment of the madness of nationalism, illuminated by brilliant use of language: magnificent.Cathi Unsworth Boy A, by Jonathan Trigell (Serpent&apos;s Tail, \u00a37.99) Jonathan Trigell&apos;s story of a juvenile killer, which was originally published in 2004, has been reissued to accompany the recent Channel 4 film. As a 12-year-old, Jack (not his real name) was convicted of a murder which outraged the nation. Now in his early 20s, he is given a new identity and the chance of a fresh start as a driver&apos;s mate for a delivery firm in Manchester. Trigell brilliantly depicts the pressures of living with a terrible secret. An average night out with the lads spells disaster as a spiked drink breaches the terms of his probation. And as he&apos;s someone who has never known love, it&apos;s devastating to witness Jack&apos;s developing affection for a girl at the depot, when any relationship is inevitably doomed due to his strange amnesia and the unaccountable blanks in his biography. Above all, the hero emerges as someone who deserves better - there&apos;s a teasing ambiguity as to whether he&apos;s guilty or not - and it is written with a naive clarity which evokes the unfamiliar wonders of the outside world: telephone wires which &quot;drape like bunting&quot;; church pillars &quot;thick as God&apos;s thighs&quot;.Alfred Hickling The Political Prisoner, by Cesare Pavese, translated by WJ Strachan (Peter Owen, \u00a310.95) Cesare Pavese performed an invaluable service to the Italian reading public, making the first translations of Hemingway, Joyce and Melville before taking his own life in a Turin hotel room in 1950. He also wrote bleak, existential novels of which The Political Prisoner is one of the bleakest and most plotless. The narrative is based on the author&apos;s own experience as an opponent of Mussolini who was confined to house arrest in a remote Calabrian community. Here the hero whiles away the time contemplating the condition of exile and lusting after &quot;a lithe, goat-like servant girl&quot;, who he doesn&apos;t get to sleep with; and a &quot;pale, puffy faced widow&quot; with whom he does. The autobiographical aspect brings veracity to the atmosphere of listlessness and despair: &quot;He gradually grew restless and felt the urge to go out. Sometimes it would be as far as the sea shore, but this bathing naked and alone in the green Mediterranean depressed him and caused him to dress hurriedly in the already chilling air.&quot; Still, one can&apos;t help thinking that as political punishments go, there are worse places to be confined than an unspoiled fishing village in the south of Italy. AH  Lust, Caution, by Eileen Chang (Penguin, \u00a37.99) In this collection set in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, war and politics are almost peculiarly absent. The superficial politeness and discontent of a group of middle-aged patients are plotted with icy precision in &quot;In the Waiting Room&quot;, while the maid in &quot;Steamed Osmanthus Flower&quot; is both an unhappy participant and observer in the life of her stranded westerner employer, Mr Garter. Eileen Chang&apos;s interest is personal not political and her focus on &quot;trivial things between men and women&quot;, at a time when her contemporaries were more interested in fiction for ideological ends, earned her scorn though a large readership. Hers is a world of appearances: the sophistication and deceit of &quot;Lust, Caution&quot; are distilled into the black capes and flashy diamonds that are fashionable among Shanghai&apos;s society women. Castigated under communist rule for a &quot;banal boudoir realism&quot;, Chang creates amoral, ruthless characters turned defiantly away from the political upheavals around them, who now appear a truer reflection of their times than any banner-waving would-be hero.Isobel Montgomery Rhapsody, by Dorothy Edwards (Library of Wales, \u00a37.99) All too often, the protagonists - usually male - of Dorothy Edwards&apos;s unsettling stories appear to be on the cusp of connecting with the world around them. A journey or a holiday brings a bookish, isolated bachelor into contact with a woman who briefly ignites some romantic interest. Walks are taken, duets played (music functions as a recurrent symbol of intimacy), but there are few kisses and no romantic resolution. A third figure - a narrator husband, perhaps - or the end of the holiday intervenes to halt the expected denouement. Edwards published this collection in 1927 and a second the year after to brief acclaim but &quot;the brilliant Welsh authoress&quot; was already fading from view when she committed suicide, aged 31, in 1934. &quot;I am killing myself because I have never sincerely loved any human being all my life,&quot; she wrote in her suicide note. Her admission: &quot;I have accepted kindness and friendship, and even love, without gratitude and given nothing in return&quot; might read as a common key to many of the characters here. Despite the pessimism of their tone and an almost cultivated dispassion, these vignettes of failure are intensely felt.

Harding replaces Robert Thomson, another former FT journalist who will become publisher of Murdoch&apos;s latest acquisition, the Wall Street Journal, after four years in the editor&apos;s chair at Wapping. The multilingual Harding is close to James Murdoch, who is now his boss, having taken on a beefed-up role as chairman and chief executive of News Corp Europe and Asia.

But like all newspapers, the Times has come under pressure from changing media consumption habits. In November it sold an average of 636,946 copies according to official figures, down 2.57% year-on-year.

Rio has rejected an informal three-for-one share proposal from rival miner BHP, made at the beginning of November. Since then, Marius Kloppers, BHP chief executive, has been talking to Rio and BHP shareholders, stressing the synergies that could be achieved if the two groups got together. Most analysts have agreed that a lot of value could be realised from the merger. Kloppers has been sitting tight, intending to keep BHP&apos;s proposal at its current level and relying on shareholders to put pressure on Rio to come to the table. But Rio has so far refused to engage in talks with BHP, saying the proposal undervalues the company. Tom Albanese, chief executive of Rio, said his company could deliver as much value for shareholders if it stayed independent. Last week, he said BHP&apos;s proposal was &quot;dead in the water&quot;. It is thought the Panel could come up with a deadline date by the end of the week - it would be expected to fall around mid-January. If it does decide to set a deadline, BHP will have to table a formal offer, or walk away and not come back with a takeover proposal for six months. If it made an offer, there would be a firm timetable that both companies would have to stick to. Analysts said BHP would have to come back with a firm, higher offer, or one that includes a cash component, to get the approval of the Rio board. BHP is understood to be keen to agree a friendly merger, as a hostile bid will be complicated by Rio&apos;s dual-listed structure in the UK and Australia. Rio&apos;s decision to call on BHP to put up or shut up has puzzled investors, who say that last week&apos;s discussions with the company indicated it would not involve the Takeover Panel. But it is understood that Rio is keen to achieve some certainty, as well as a higher offer.  Charles Kernot, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: &quot;Maybe they are sensing that things have been going their way, and they just want to kick BHP Billiton into action.&quot; He added that it was possible that Rio Tinto might want to hurry BHP along because of other rumoured interests. There has been considerable opposition to a potential merger from steelmakers around the world, who fear that it would create a near-monopoly in iron ore and push up prices.  The Chinese have been particularly vocal in their opposition and there has been speculation that some of the country&apos;s steelmakers and funds could get together to bid for Rio, or buy a blocking stake in the company. Reports yesterday that Blackstone, the US private equity firm, was considering a break-up bid for Rio Tinto were denied. But news that Baosteel, China&apos;s largest steelmaker, was to be suspended from the Shanghai Stock Exchange today has alerted the investment community. Newspaper reports in the past few weeks have said Baosteel is considering a bid, although that has been denied by the company. Some industry observers are doubtful about China&apos;s ability to launch a bid for Rio Tinto, which would have to be valued at $150bn (\u00a375bn) or more. Baosteel has a market value of only about $40bn, and even if it managed to join forces with other companies and funds, such as CIC, China&apos;s sovereign fund, it would face the threat of protectionist moves from a number of other countries. Australia&apos;s Foreign Investment Review Board, for example, blocked Shell&apos;s proposed takeover of Woodside Petroleum in 2001. Analysts say it could be even more active if the Chinese were involved, as it would mean a lot of Australia&apos;s mining assets would come under Chinese control. Nevertheless, Sinosteel, another Chinese steel company, has made a $1.2bn offer for the Australian iron ore miner Midwest Corporation. Industry observers are watching this closely to see what the FIRB will decide. Rio, BHP and the Takeover Panel refused to comment.

Harry Potter obsessives try to track the locations populated by the teenage wizards. New Zealand sold itself to holidaymakers on the back of The Lord of the Rings. Hong Kong though, found a burgeoning market in cinematic sex tourism earlier this year, thanks to an arthouse film director. Ang Lee&apos;s latest movie, Lust, Caution, was released in China in an expurgated print, with its very graphic sex scenes removed. In Hong Kong, however, they remained, and Chinese film-lovers made the trek to the city to see the film as the director intended. It was a rapturously received smash in Hong Kong (and Taiwan). The story of a group of young dissidents in 30s and 40s China hatching a plot to kill a brutal politician, Lust, Caution might have been expected to bowl over audiences in the US, too. After all, Americans are used to sex on screen, and Lee&apos;s previous film, Brokeback Mountain, had been a critical hit in the States. This time, though, they&apos;ve been lukewarm, and the movie has taken just $4.2m (\u00a32.1m) at the US box office. Lee, though, had foreseen the problems Americans might have with it. The sex wasn&apos;t the problem. If anything, the destructive and violent love affair between student actor Wong Chia Chi (newcomer Tang Wei) and the politician Yee (Tony Leung) was the movie&apos;s main selling point, even if those scenes attracted the dreaded NC-17 certificate - a rating that scares off multiplexes. What American audiences really seemed to struggle with was the slow-burn narrative style, the near three-hour running time, and the probing, painstaking way in which it explored aspects of recent Chinese social and political history. I meet Lee in the ballroom of an old Venetian hotel. In late afternoon, the room is dark and shadowy. It makes a suitable backdrop for a discussion of a film as ambiguous and unsettling as Lust, Caution. The Taiwanese director is unapologetic about his film. &quot;The pacing relates to the information that is given,&quot; he says. &quot;We Chinese need to go back to the world we used to live in. &quot;It&apos;s a lot of fun for the Chinese to watch the first half, to remind us of our innocence and how things used to be. Then comes the real deal. But for non-Chinese, you don&apos;t get that benefit. I am sure the Chinese viewer will have a blast, but when the western viewer reads subtitles, it is very frustrating. You have that feeling: what the hell is going on. But I had to make the movie right for myself and for the Chinese audience.&quot; A complex espionage thriller set in Shanghai and Hong Kong during the late 1930s and early 40s, Lust, Caution is not - at least to American eyes - a crowdpleaser in the vein of Lee&apos;s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Instead of gravity-defying martial artistry, it consists mainly of characters talking. When there is violence - for example, when the students try to assassinate a man who has a Rasputin-like aversion to dying - it is realistic and dismaying. When they plunge a knife in the man&apos;s stomach, it bounces out. And, like the violence, the sex is dealt with equally frankly. &quot;They [historians] tell you about the glorious war, the fight. They don&apos;t tell you that it is very hard to kill someone. They tell you that the women spies seduced the men and killed them. They don&apos;t tell you about the sex.&quot; Lee laughs wearily as he explains his attempts in the film to look behind the official stories about Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Just as he did in Brokeback Mountain (when adapting Annie Proulx&apos;s story for the screen), Lee has taken a short piece of fiction and has fleshed it out, giving it an epic quality. Lust, Caution is based on a 28-page story by Eileen Chang. &quot;She writes about women&apos;s sexuality and feeling for love during the most macho war we have had. It is like - how dare she!&quot; Lee says. &quot;It is very gutsy work. That triggers me to investigate my own upbringing and patriotism.&quot; It quickly becomes apparent, for Lee himself, how personal and even autobiographical Lust, Caution is. For example, Yee&apos;s very specific gait is based on that of Lee&apos;s father. The director admits to a close identification with the spy played by Tang Wei, too. &quot;When we were doing the movie, I used to joke that I carry the head and purity of the idealistic student Kuang Yu Min, the heart of Wong Chia Chi and the balls of Mr Yee,&quot; Lee says. He then adds that Tony Leung has projected aspects of Lee&apos;s own character into Yee. A curious remark, certainly, given that Yee isn&apos;t a remotely sympathetic character. He is a quisling, collaborating with the Japanese and overseeing the torture and killing of Chinese rebels. Then again, it is Yee&apos;s personal and sexual life that intrigues him. &quot;I desire it but I cannot do it. I make it into a movie. He projects a lot of that part of myself. It is a romance I never really experienced that I was longing for. It is almost like a dream.&quot; Like the students, whose high-minded ideals are shaken when they get their hands dirty with plotting and assassination, Lee acknowledges that he has been &quot;shocked by reality, naive in some ways, not really knowing what to do in an adult world, like a big kid&quot;. As for Wong, he identifies with her because: &quot;it seems that only by pretending, by getting far away from reality, she can reach her true self ... to touch the real you that you try to cover up.&quot; Meanwhile, Lee relished the chance to recreate his parents&apos; era and their way of thinking. His preparation was exhaustive. For instance, he and his casting directors saw 10,000 actors before finally choosing Tang Wei. Actor Tony Leung testifies that Lee was a ferociously demanding director: always asking for that little bit more, the different way to do the scene, the extra detail. The scenes that were the hardest to shoot were, inevitably, the sex scenes. The director admits that he felt extremely uncomfortable filming them. He was conscious that he was first engineering some extremely raw and intimate moments, and then intruding on them. &quot;For this project, I had to strip down and get to the heart of the darkness in some way,&quot; he says. His instinct, he says, as he filmed Leung and Tang Wei making love was to look the other way. &quot;I don&apos;t make pornography, so when you get down to that, it is very painful to shoot. You fight with your moral sense. You are deeply confused. It is embarrassing to coach the actors through it - to verbalise and to give indications. You are revealing your secrets when you are shooting like that.&quot; The sex scenes were shot on a closed set with only four people present - the couple, the director and the cinematographer. Lee defends the sex scenes as being utterly integral to the film. Yes, it is inevitable that the scandal surrounding these scenes will dominate discussion of the movie. &quot;That bothers me. It gives me sleepless nights.&quot; He and his collaborators have done their utmost to make the best film they can and all the journalists want to talk about is the sex. At a press conference earlier in the day, he had fielded the sex questions patiently enough. Did they really do it? To Lee, that isn&apos;t the right question. What is important is that the audience has to believe in the scenes. Look at the eyes, not the bodies. In the end, though, Lee&apos;s real preoccupation isn&apos;t the sex. Nor is it the politics. Nor is it the chance to bring back to life an era in Chinese history that is in danger of being forgotten. Like Brokeback Mountain, it is an emotionally charged story of a forbidden love. Lust, Caution may begin as an espionage thriller in which the politics and social history are foregrounded. By the final reel, though, it has turned into a full-blown weepie. At its core, this is a film about romantic obsession - &quot;doomed, impossible romantic love&quot;. The middle-aged director, who is happily married, grounded and emotionally stable, just can&apos;t help but be drawn to tales of amour fou. &quot;After Brokeback and this one, I do believe deeply inside that I am a romantic,&quot; Lee admits. &quot;I was never romantic in real life. That is why I have to make movies about it.&quot; \u00b7 Lust, Caution is released on January 4", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Ang Lee"], "publicationDate": "2007-12-14T15:04:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/dec/14/portlandusa.restaurants", "sentences": ["Other fine dives to investigate: the Shanghai Tunnel (211, SW Ankeny), the Yamhill Pub (223 SW Yamhill St) and Joe&apos;s Cellar (1332 NW 21ST Ave)."], "title": "Top 10 diners in Portland, Oregon", "article": "The moment I knew that I really loved Portland happened standing in my local co-op grocery, when I realised that the hummus I was about to buy was not only locally made and organic, but that a percentage of its profits were donated to humanitarian charities.

Navarre My favourite Portland restaurant is out by the Laurelhurst Theater; small, friendly and delicious, it specialises in tapas-sized dishes such as rocket with candied fennel, carrots with herbs, trout baked in parchment, plus fabulous bread, an extensive wine list and a mind-boggling blackberry pie.  \u00b7 10 NE 28th Ave; +1 503.232.3555. 2. McMenamins Kennedy School McMenamins beer is something of a Portland mainstay, and out here in the north east of the city is the finest place to drink it: an old school house converted into a hotel, restaurant and bar, with a cinema, live music and a soaking pool. The food is the reliable, if predictable, selection of salads, burgers and fries, but the venue, and the ale \u2014 including Ruby, Black Rabbit Porter and seasonal varieties such as Firefly Kosch \u2014 makes it something special.  \u00b7 5736 N.E. 33rd Ave; +1 503 249 3983. 3. The Farm Just off the bustle of Burnside Avenue, the Farm is housed in a restored wooden building and specialises in all-local, all-organic fare such as grilled citrus halibut, herb-crusted tofu with masala gravy and an impressive selection of Oregon wines. Much is made of the restaurant&apos;s romantic vibe, but it also feels agreeably homey, with tables so snug it&apos;s akin to dining in someone&apos;s front room.  \u00b7 10 SE Seventh Ave; +1 503 736 3276 4. Blue Hour Portland&apos;s dining scene is famed for its Happy Hour \u2014 a time each day when the city&apos;s restaurants and bars offer cut-price food and booze. Nestled next to the Nike HQ, on the brink of the city&apos;s Pearl District, Blue Hour is one of the canniest ways to enjoy Happy Hour. This is a chic Mediterranean-style restaurant, with a grown-up menu that offers such delights as potato gnocchi with black truffle, swordfish carpaccio and bittersweet chocolate chestnut torte. During Happy Hour, expect the most astonishing pizza margherita, fried egg and pork loin sandwich, and the best caesar salad you&apos;ve ever tasted \u2014 not to mention sumptuous beverages at curtailed prices.  \u00b7 250 NW 13th Avenue at Everett Street 5. Stumptown Coffee No trip to Portland is complete without a visit to a Stumptown, the city&apos;s number one coffee emporium. These folks take their coffee seriously, and treat their business responsibly. Many restaurants serve their coffee, and naturally, you can buy it by the bag, but an authentically barrista-ed cup of Stumptown Hair Bender blend cannot be beat. Plus they stock another of Portland&apos;s culinary highlights, Voodoo Doughnuts \u00b7 Various outlets 6. Montage Montage is a late-night Portland institution, tucked away in the city&apos;s industrial quarter. It does serve good food, offering numerous variations on mac &apos;n&apos; cheese, along with jambalaya and rock shrimp linguini, but the crucial part is that it stays open, and stays raucous, till the wee small hours. Plus they make a mean red pepper martini.  \u00b7 301 SE Morrison; +1 503 2341324. 7. My Father&apos;s Place One of the diviest dives in town, My Father&apos;s Place is part of Portland&apos;s geological make-up. Grimey, dark, booze-sodden, the food is as you&apos;d expect: greasy bar fodder to perfectly complement the cheap beer, and sustain you while playing pool, but it&apos;s a wonderful way to while away a rainy northwestern afternoon. Other fine dives to investigate: the Shanghai Tunnel (211, SW Ankeny), the Yamhill Pub (223 SW Yamhill St) and Joe&apos;s Cellar (1332 NW 21ST Ave).  \u00b7 523 SE Grand Ave; +1 503 235 5494 8. Cava A relatively new addition to the Portland scene, Cava sits in the rapidly-evolving south east of the city, and its a smallish, simple-ish menu concentrates on perfectly-prepared dishes made with the best local ingredients \u2014 consider butternut squash soup with brown butter and fried sage or Moroccan spiced roast chicken with stewed onions, saffron and olives on cous cous, for example. The staff are super-friendly, and the desserts \u2014 classic pecan pie with chantilly cream, espresso br\u00fbl\u00e9e with cocoa nib shortbread \u2014 are magnificent.  \u00b7 5339 SE Foster Rd 9. Higgins  Higgins is a downtown bistro, and one of the city&apos;s best restaurants. Again the emphasis is fresh, local and seasonal, so the menu boasts such delights as roasted autumn vegetable and farro salad with maple-spiced hazelnuts and balsamic vinaigrette, Lookout Point oysters with a cucumber and jalapeno granite, Magret and confit of duck, with cheddar polenta, pinot noir-poached pear and braised greens, Caramel apple trifle with pecan spice cake and bourbon cream ... and a fabulous wine list.  \u00b7 1239 SW Broadway; +1 503 222 9070. 10. Groceries Oregon is famous for its agricultural bounty, and its groceries reflect this: the produce is cheap, varied, usually organic and always local, from blackberries to honey to homemade soap and artisan-made bread. I pretty much wept at the thought of returning to my paltry old Sainsbury&apos;s.  \u00b7 For the best selections visit City Market (735 NW 21st Ave), Alberta Street Co-Op and New Seasons. \u00b7 In tomorrow&apos;s Guardian Travel section: The Gossip&apos;s Beth Ditto plays tour guide in her home town of Portland.", "tags": ["Portland USA holidays", "Restaurants", "Travel", "United States holidays", "Bars and clubs", "Top 10s", "Restaurants", "Coffee", "Oregon"], "publicationDate": "2007-12-14T16:42:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/16/letters.theobserver", "sentences": ["Yet drive north from Shanghai and you will see that most new houses are fitted with solar collectors, and it&apos;s nearly impossible to buy an incandescent lamp."], "title": "Your Letters", "article": "The GMC is acting in the public interest Paediatrician Nigel Speight (&apos;The victimisation of David Southall is disastrous for abused children&apos;, Comment, last week) makes a number of allegations about how the GMC operates. Dr Speight says that the panel&apos;s decision will deter junior doctors from becoming paediatricians. He should consider the facts. It is extremely rare for a paediatrician to be referred to a fitness to practise panel in connection with their child protection work. Since 2004, fitness to practise panels have considered more than 600 cases. Only two have been about paediatricians involved in child protection work. Dr Speight questions the composition of panels. The model is simple. Panels listen to expert evidence which they can question and which is tested by both sides. The implication is that, without a paediatrician, the panel is insufficiently qualified to make a decision. A similar argument about the composition of GMC panels was considered in the High Court in 2006 and was comprehensively rejected. We agree it cannot be in the public interest if doctors are inhibited from acting to protect children, or deterred from giving evidence. But equally it cannot be in the public interest, or the interests of the profession, if the GMC does not act when doctors practise incompetently or inappropriately. Finlay Scott, chief executive General Medical Council London NW1  Beat climate change - eat local food Eating local food is probably the biggest single contribution we can all make to cutting climate change. In a year, a typical family of four will emit 4.2 tonnes of CO2 from their house, 4.4 tonnes from their car, and 8 tonnes from the production, processing, packaging and distribution of the food they eat. So it was disappointing to find no mention of local food in the &apos;Creating a low-carbon Britain&apos; supplement (last week). Disappointing but not surprising, given that it was &apos;sponsored by the Carbon Trust&apos; and contained an article by Terry Leahy of Tesco (key partner of the Carbon Trust). Tesco is, and will remain, part of the problem. Its business model is based on the globalisation of the food supply chain, and it cannot go green without dismantling itself. Richard Boden Wye, Kent  Let morris dancers be Jay Rayner (restaurant review, OM last week) states that, &apos;whenever I see morris dancers I assume a pogrom can&apos;t be far behind&apos;. There is no evidence that morris dance has roots in religious ritual; it was done as a begging dance, mainly by out-of-work men from rural areas. Most morris dancers are of liberal persuasion. If I thought that morris was an activity connected to ritual, or was a pseudo-Nazi front, I would not be doing it. Perhaps Mr Rayner should check his facts rather than rely on his misconceptions. Next he&apos;ll be saying that vegetarians are evil because he&apos;d heard the myth that Hitler was veggie. Mark Rogers Stroud, Gloucestershire  Techno-bullies rule, OK I fear Mariella Frostrup (Comment, last week) is correct in that soon it will be &apos;illegal not to own a mobile phone&apos; and also not to own a computer. From 2010, employers must file tax returns online. Our sports club has one employee. The treasurer, elected annually by a committee, handles the PAYE. Does this mean that from 2010 the treasurer must be certified &apos;online&apos; before being elected? Is this discrimination or just bullying? I asked the Inland Revenue helpline if any concessions would be made for cases such as ours. I was met with the equivalent of a telephone shrug. Chris Hinchcliffe Sheffield Drink-drive lawyer &apos;wrecks lives&apos; Jeanette Miller, the &apos;drink-drive lawyer&apos; (Observer Magazine, last week), feels very pleased with herself for defending a client &apos;so drunk he urinated on a table at the police station&apos;. &apos;We still got him off,&apos; she boasts. At her hourly rate of \u00a3250 she&apos;ll be doing very well this festive season, looking for loopholes in the law and encouraging more anti-social drivers to think they can drink, maim or kill and buy their way out of jail. While she&apos;s enjoying her immoral earnings this Christmas, she might like to ponder the wrecked lives of the victims of some of her clients. &apos;I love making a difference to people&apos;s lives,&apos; she says. She&apos;s sure doing that. Deborah Calland and Barry Millington London NW11 Cast your vote and strike it lucky I devised the &apos;lucky polling number draw&apos; (&apos;It could be you ... if you can be bothered to vote&apos;, News, last week) in 1969 after a council byelection which achieved a record turnout because PTA bingo was on in the school that housed the polling station. The then secretary of the Liberal party (Home Counties region) threatened me with dire retribution if I were to try it out. More recently, I developed the concept of an active citizens discount card and submitted it to a Today programme competition to promote a new law. They didn&apos;t give it air time. The principle is that, every December, the electoral register should be published with marks to show who voted when they last had the opportunity. In the following March these people would be issued with a card entitling them to a discount when paying for government services - TV licence, car tax etc. The same revenue would be raised by increasing the charges for those who hadn&apos;t voted. Every voter would be a winner. Keith Watts Whitchurch, Hampshire Climate change isn&apos;t China&apos;s fault Will Hutton (Comment, last week) blames China for climate change. Yet drive north from Shanghai and you will see that most new houses are fitted with solar collectors, and it&apos;s nearly impossible to buy an incandescent lamp. The same cannot be said of Britain, the US and most of Europe. The rapid expansion of the Chinese economy does produce frightening amounts of carbon dioxide but much of its industry is taken up with the production of cheap consumer goods sold in the West. We have used Chinese industry to control our inflation level and it ill behoves us to accuse China of being responsible for climate change. Mike Hamp Bishop Auckland Co. Durham Haw&apos;s right on the war Just as I am about to make a Christmas present out of his book on the disappearance of the political left, Nick Cohen (Opinion, last week) pulls the rug from under my feet in another swingeing attack on Brian Haw. I simply don&apos;t believe that Brian&apos;s apparent lack of concern for those who have been killed by non-Western bombs and bullets in Iraq is sustainable; nor, indeed, Cohen&apos;s obvious irritation at the &apos;bleak sight&apos; of the anti-war Parliament Square banners. At a time when every effort is being made to tidy protest neatly away out of sight, out of mind, Brian&apos;s reminder of all who have died in Iraq is nothing but commendable.

Six tennis personalities of the year 1) Roger Federer. Three more slam titles to take his total to 12, two behind Pete Sampras, and a first ever victory over Nadal on clay in Hamburg, although not the one he so badly wanted in the French Open final. 2) Fabrice Santoro. The 35-year-old little French maestro continued to demonstrate to everyone who cared to watch him that modern tennis need not be all biff and bash. 3) Serena and Venus Williams. Chalk and cheese as personalities, but both still capable of winning slam titles out of the blue when they set their minds to it. 4) Andy Roddick. Never mind that he can never beat Federer, or be anything other than a one-slam wonder, the American led the US to their first Davis Cup win since 1995, and rightly enjoyed every minute of it. 5) Marion Bartoli. Surprise French Wimbledon finalist, and proof positive that you do not need to be a 6ft-plus Amazon to make the breakthrough, though a domineering father may help. 6) Richard Gasquet. Reached his first slam semi-final at Wimbledon, and reminded the tennis world that a scintillating French backhand is not the sole prerogative of Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo. And six to watch in 2008 1) Marin Cilic. Yet another tall Croatian, and a special talent. 2) Agnieszka and Urzula Radwanska. Poland&apos;s answer to the Williams sisters. 3) Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro. An Argentinian teenager on the verge of a major breakthrough. 4) Ernests Gulbis. This 19-year-old Latvian hastened Henman&apos;s retirement with a straight sets first-round victory over him in the French Open. 5) The Wimbledon Centre Court.

China and Russia, two of the five permanent members of the United Nations security council, have moved to strengthen their economic ties with the Islamic Republic. Within days of the release of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iran by Washington, which declared that Tehran halted its nuclear military project in the autumn of 2003, the taciturn Chinese ambassador to the UN, Wang Guangya, spoke up. &quot;I think the [security] council members will all start from the presumption that now things have changed,&quot; he declared. Back in Beijing, a large Iranian oil and gas project in which the state-owned Sinopec group had expressed interest in 2004, suddenly came to life. On December 9, Sinopec finally signed a $2bn agreement to develop Iran&apos;s vast Yadavaran oil field. Yadavaran&apos;s hydrocarbons are to be shipped to China in the form of liquefied natural gas and petroleum at a cost of $100bn over 25 years. Despite the importance of the deal, the Sinopec group did not issue an official announcement. Its discretion was understandable. The shares of its publicly traded unit, China Petroleum &amp; Chemical, are listed on the stock exchanges of not only Shanghai and Hong Kong but also London and New York. With two sets of (fairly mild) UN security council sanctions against Iran still in force, the discreet Chinese company decided not to trumpet its latest deal with Tehran. By contrast, Iran&apos;s oil minister gave a bullish interview to the state-run Iranian radio network. &quot;If other countries intend to invest in our major oil and gas fields, they should not waste time&quot;, he said. &quot;Otherwise, they will surely lose investment opportunities in Iran.&quot; Four days later, Russia, the other non-western permanent member of the security council, followed in the footsteps of China. It settled its year-long dispute about payments for the nuclear power plant that the monopoly Atomstroyexport company is building near the Iranian port city of Bushehr. Alleging that Iran was falling behind its monthly payments in dollars for the project, Atomstroyexport slowed down its work at the plant. In reality, this was Moscow&apos;s way of pressuring Tehran to come clean about its nuclear programme before the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The settling of this dispute has now set the scene for a schedule to finish the $800m project, which started in 1995. Its completion will provide a rationale for Iran to enrich uranium for fuel rods, using an industrial-scale production process. Earlier, after much prevarication, Russia&apos;s president Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead for a the shipment of nuclear fuel for the Bushehr power plant. In late November, IAEA inspectors went to Russia&apos;s Novosibirsk chemical concentrate plant to verify and seal the nuclear fuel for Iran. That shipment has now taken place. In the light of these developments, oil and other companies in Europe can ill-afford to overlook investment opportunities available in Iran, which has the second largest reserves of not only petroleum but also natural gas.", "tags": ["Iran", "China", "Russia", "Middle East and North Africa", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2007-12-17T20:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/dec/18/chinesepublishergoestothe", "sentences": ["One of the China&apos;s largest media groups, Liaoning Publishing, is to list its shares on the Shanghai stock market."], "title": "Chinese publisher goes to the market", "article": "One of the China&apos;s largest media groups, Liaoning Publishing, is to list its shares on the Shanghai stock market.

Better seize the opportunity to stay at these intimate hotels before Bangkok comes to its senses and replaces them with mammoth towers.   1. Baan Chantra  A short walk from the tourist ghetto of Khao San Road, Baan Chantra might be marketed as a boutique hotel but it is really a more mature version of the area&apos;s famous guesthouses. The converted 1930s shophouse retains its original teak interiors with an informal atmosphere, perfect for folks who prefer the backpacker ideal of staying close to the local community but who also need some of life&apos;s mod cons. The hotel&apos;s four rooms range from standard, which is comfortable but modest, to deluxe, which is a slightly more boastful designation for a bigger room with an attached sun deck.  \u00b7 120 Samsen Road, Banglamphu; + 66 2628 6988; double 2,400THB (\u00a339) 2. Phranakorn Norn Len A guesthouse with style, Phranakorn Norn Len has an arty thrift-store aesthetic. The simple rooms are transformed from basic flops to quirky abodes with hand-painted floral wall patterns, hanging plants and quilted throw pillows. The shady garden and courtyard help promote the hotel&apos;s guiding principle for a stress free stay and the guests seem to truly appreciate the gesture. This do-good code infuses the morning meals, which are vegetarian and use locally grown ingredients.  \u00b7 46 Soi Thewet 1, Krung Kasem Road; + 66 2628-8188; double 2,200THB (\u00a336) 3. Old Bangkok Inn  A charming nod to the past, Old Bangkok Inn occupies the antique district once home to minor Siamese royalty and epitomises the city&apos;s revival of classically minded hotels. The 10 rooms, including lofts and suites, are individually decorated in Thai floral themes that evoke a romantic ambience, although the square footage is a little meager. The hotel goes beyond style with many eco-friendly measures, including solar water heating and energy efficient appliances.  \u00b7 609 Phra Sumen Road, Banglamphu; + 66 2629 1785; double 3,700THB (\u00a360) 4. Arun Residence       Until recently, Bangkok&apos;s most historic district of Ko Ratanakosin, filled with palaces and temples, closed down after dark. But this riverside inn, occupying an old Sino-Portuguese-style building, now provides a place to bed among nighttime vistas of the temple spires. Arun Residence bears simple but elegant period d\u00e9cor in its five rooms, mostly split-level lofts. The Arun suite has a private balcony with views of monumental Wat Arun. \u00b7 36-38 Soi Pratu Nok Yoong, Maharat Road, Ko Ratanakosin; + 66 2221 9158; double 3,100THB (\u00a350) 5. Ibrik Resort by the River Barely big enough to be called an &quot;inn&quot;, Ibrik feels more like a private residence with only three guest rooms and a non-commercial location in Thonburi, across the river from Bangkok. A small, understated sign marks the entrance from the pedestrian lane that winds past a local market, a renowned theatre school and a neighbourhood temple. The interior is crisp and modern and the River Room has a big picture window drinking in the adjacent Chao Phraya River (although the river traffic is as noisy as it is picturesque).  \u00b7 256 Soi Wat Rakang, Arunamrin Road, Thonburi; + 66 2848 9220; double 4,000THB (\u00a365) 6. Chakrabongse Villas  The Thai king may never offer you a spare room during your stay in the kingdom, but you can bunk like a royal at this former palace, just a brief stroll from the historic sites of Ko Ratanakosin. The riverside estate dates to 1908 when it was used for overnight visits by the 40th son of King Chulalongkorn. Today, three traditional-style apartments occupy the lush garden, soaking in private views of the river; the interiors boast rich hues of gleaming teak and earth-toned silks.  \u00b7 396 Maharat Road, Ko Ratanakosin; + 66 2622 3356;; double 10,000THB (\u00a3163) 7. Shanghai Inn  Although Chinatown is one of Bangkok&apos;s more intriguing neighbourhoods, the sleeping options are monopolised by hulking matrons dating from the gaudy days of pink vinyl and shag carpet. This hip hotel breaks the mould with retro Chinoiserie stylings. Pink and purple lanterns, bamboo floors and imperial-inspired furniture transform the hotel&apos;s 55 rooms into boudoirs evoking jazz-era Shanghai. \u00b7 479 Yaowarat Road, Chinatown; + 66 2221 2121; double 2,800THB (\u00a346) 8. La Residence Hotel  One of the city&apos;s first &quot;boutique&quot; hotels, La Residence is a petite player amid the high-rises of Bangkok&apos;s financial district. Each of the 26 rooms is individually decorated but without excessive fussiness or pretension. The staff are accessible and helpful with recommendations and general know-how. The drawback is that the location is a little lacklustre, surrounded by the ageing commercial buildings of Surawong Road. Despite this, it is just a short walk to Patpong and a Skytrain station, and slightly further to the riverside luxury hotels.  \u00b7 173/8-9 Surawong Road, Bangrak; + 66 2233 3301; double 2,000THB (\u00a333) 9. Eugenia       Now that travel is no longer an aristocratic sport, it is rare to find a new hotel that has modelled itself after the steamship-era grand dames. But this 19th-century manor house prefers a simplified Victorian sensibility to the prevailing club Zen look of modern hotels. The 12 sumptuous suites are decorated with canopy beds (and starched Belgian linens), hand-hammered tubs, and antique fixtures collected by the owners. Sip a draft of sophistication beside the pool or in the hunting lodge library.

Seven Oftentimes with minimalism there is no room for a sense of place (or a large suitcase, but that&apos;s another matter). Rather than blotting out the local landscape, this sleek boutique has ingeniously embraced its Thai character with a unique concept: its six guest rooms (and lobby makes seven) are decorated in the colour that Thais associate with each day of the week.

The role model appears to be Shanghai&apos;s maglev train, which links the Chinese city&apos;s underground with the international airport and runs at up to 268mph. Mumbai&apos;s railways were boycotted only last week by thousands of commuters because of the &quot;deadly&quot; overcrowding. Passenger groups say that on average every square metre of railway carriage accommodates 17 people on each trip. The situation is likely to worsen as Mumbai&apos;s population doubles in 10 years or so to 30 million people.

Maglev is a good start but we need more innovative thinking,&quot; said Hafeez Contractor, an architect who advised the government. Maglev trains, which are lifted by magnetism to leave a small gap between them and the elevated track, have a spotty record.

She has the twittering entourage and designer labels; her hair is groomed, her face painted. Except this is not her, she says, not really. In real life she&apos;s a tomboy; she&apos;s nothing like this, she usually wears jeans. And she gestures down at herself, as if marvelling at the thing that she&apos;s become. At 26, Tang Wei was plucked from a lineup of 10,000 unknowns to give the lead performance in Lust, Caution, a film that is itself about the art of performing. Ang Lee&apos;s wartime thriller plays out in Japanese-occupied Shanghai and focuses on the trials of a virginal student who is ordered to seduce and then assassinate a Japanese collaborator. It is an opaque and predatory picture, one that balances heavyweight acting with a number of startlingly explicit sex scenes. Except that the director has argued that these elements are not mutually exclusive. The sex scenes, he says, are &quot;the ultimate performance&quot;. They are what his story is all about. Credit where it&apos;s due, Beijing-born Wei has not quite sprung out of nowhere. She studied theatre directing at college, is a former Miss Universe finalist and once starred in a TV movie called Policewoman Yanzee, roaring through town on an oversized motorcycle. Even so, Lust, Caution marked a major step up. She was, in effect, asked to carry the picture, appearing on set for 114 days of the 118-day shoot and returning to her dressing room not merely exhausted but physically warped by the experience. &quot;I&apos;d stand and look in the mirror, and it&apos;s a different face,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t know what happened to my face. When I first read the script, I could not really imagine the character. But later it is all so different. She becomes more like me. Or I become more like her.&quot; She recalls shooting a scene in which her fellow students stab a government informer to death. The script called for her to stand outside, observing the murder through an open window. &quot;So for three days I stand there while they kill a man. And after a while it is like what&apos;s happening outside is not real. What is true is what is going on inside, the killing of a man.&quot; She laughs, a trifle nervously. &quot;That was not so nice.&quot; Lee says the film is a companion piece to Brokeback Mountain. &quot;That was about a lost paradise,&quot; he says, &quot;and this is more like hell.&quot; The production was gruelling, specifically designed to stretch the cast to their limits. Crucially, Lee chose to conceal the exact nature of the sex scenes from his stars, stringing them along until &quot;they were on the bed and the camera was there... They knew they had to go for it.&quot; Come to think of it, that doesn&apos;t sound so nice, either. Wei shrugs and says it was nothing like as brutal as that. &quot;And once I decided I wanted to do it, that was that. I just needed to overcome my shyness and stay focused.&quot; That said, she still has trouble watching herself on screen. &quot;So I sit there in the dark, counting the heads of the people in the audience,&quot; she explains. &quot;I&apos;d rather do that than look up and see my tits.&quot; Lust, Caution is a film that is overtly concerned with the nature of acting. It details the means by which an inexperienced girl is moulded by powerful men, forced into compromising situations in the name of the greater good. At times it&apos;s tempting to view the film&apos;s production in a similar way, with Wei as the puppet and Lee as her svengali. Again, Wei says, this is too harsh. She trusted Lee from the moment they met. &quot;In our first interview I told him all about myself, secrets I&apos;ve never told anyone. Right away I can feel that he really wants to know me. Other directors look at you as a piece of flesh and refuse to meet your eyes. But Ang looked into my eyes. It was like he wanted to know my heart.&quot; Fortunately this affection appears to cut both ways. &quot;As soon as she walked in, I had the sense that this was her story,&quot; Lee says. &quot;But then later, it struck me that here was also someone I identified with. Being sexy was not one of the elements I was attracted to; it was more her disposition. I think we are very similar people. And I know that sounds strange - because she is a girl and I am a man.&quot; At the end of the film, after all the glamour and poses, Wei&apos;s character makes a choice that will have far-reaching consequences. She abandons her role and reveals her true hand. In Lee&apos;s view, this decision is &quot;a horrible mistake&quot;. Yet Wei sees it differently. She knows the character, and has learned to live inside her skin. Tellingly, her explanation veers between the first and third person. &quot;I know why I make that choice. And it is what I want to do. She can find herself only through performance. Sometimes I feel the same way. There are so many lies. Everything is false. And yet through the performance we can arrive at the truth.&quot; She smiles and looks around her, perhaps reconnecting with the here and now. The suite, the clothes, the latest role she has to play. &quot;I think she knows exactly what she is doing,&quot; she says brightly. &quot;And I think that I do, too.&quot; \u00b7 \u00b7 Lust, Caution opens on January 4", "tags": ["Lust, Caution", "Film", "Life and style", "Culture", "Ang Lee"], "publicationDate": "2007-12-22T23:46:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/23/china.theobserver", "sentences": ["Li Jianhong, a Shanghai-based writer, was put under house arrest last week to block her from receiving an award at the Beijing ceremony organised by the Independent Chinese Pen Centre, said Liu Xiaobo, a political essayist and a former university professor."], "title": "World news in brief", "article": "Ducasse does dinner up the Eiffel Tower Two dissident Chinese writers have been detained as police tried to block China&apos;s branch of an authors&apos; group from holding an awards ceremony.

Separately, Italy&apos;s Fiat agreed to sell its 50% stake in its loss-making passenger car venture with Nanjing to the Chinese firm, ending a strained relationship. SAIC will pay 2.095bn yuan (\u00a3144m) for the vehicle and core auto parts operations of Nanjing, the Chinese firms&apos; parent companies said in a joint statement. Nanjing&apos;s parent company, Yuejin, will in return get 320m shares in SAIC, equal to 4.9% of the Shanghai-listed firm&apos;s total shares. &quot;Faced with global competition, we need to go down the path of mergers and consolidation,&quot; said Hu Maoyuan, SAIC&apos;s chairman. SAIC&apos;s ventures with General Motors and Volkswagen are China&apos;s biggest car sellers, with combined sales of 441,584 cars in the first half of 2007, or 14% of the market. The MG Rover facilities in England, acquired by Nanjing in 2005, will serve as a platform for tapping the European market, said Chen Hong, SAIC&apos;s president. Nanjing&apos;s Yuejin light trucks as well as Iveco light buses, made in another tie-up with Fiat, will be a welcome addition to SAIC&apos;s portfolio, which faces strong competition in the commercial vehicle segment from FAW Group and Dongfeng. Announcing the sale of its stake in the passenger car joint venture with Nanjing, Fiat said it would nevertheless keep working with the Chinese group in the commercial vehicle and components sectors. It had been openly concerned about its relationship with Nanjing since the Chinese carmaker began working on the relaunch of the MG brand.  Fiat believed the relaunch could distract Nanjing from its commitments to the joint venture.  China&apos;s fast-growing auto market, the world&apos;s second largest, is crowded with more than 100 manufacturers. Government officials in Beijing have said they want to see an industry centred on three or four auto groups that have the resources and technology to succeed globally. The tie-up between Nanjing and its much bigger rival will be held up as a model as regulators coerce small auto makers into mergers, analysts and executives said. &quot;We have seen that happening in the steel industry. Consolidation of the auto sector is also inevitable sooner or later,&quot; said a Beijing-based analyst.  SAIC sold 1.25m vehicles in the first 10 months of this year, dwarfing Nanjing&apos;s sales of 79,196, according to official figures.

What a lovely spring. In the absence of bespectacled boy wizards, the biggest literary thrill of 2008 may well be the return of a tuxedo-clad spy last seen in print in 1966. Bondmania, ignited by the tantalising form of Daniel Craig, is set to gather pace with the first official outing for 007 since Octopussy. To celebrate the centenary of creator Ian Fleming&apos;s birth, Sebastian Faulks has been commissioned to take up the tale. Devil May Care (Penguin, out in May) is a loving act of homage that pits the suave secret agent against all the usual Cold War suspects, not to mention the unwelcome spectres of loneliness and old age. If even Bond is feeling shaken and stirred, then it comes as no surprise to note that a chronic insecurity about the state of the world will permeate the fiction of the coming year. Things are about to fall apart, from nations to marriages, and a surprising number of this year&apos;s crop of novels chronicle the process of disintegration and destruction. But there should be a hopeful note to many of these tales of unravelling and a tenderness that suggests all is not lost for the inhabitants of the early 21st century. As ever, the family is the site of particular anxiety. In Peter Carey&apos;s His Illegal Self (Faber, February), the young son of radical activists becomes an outlaw, following in the footsteps of his missing parents. This affecting portrait of a child&apos;s first love takes eight-year-old Che from the Upper East Side to a ramshackle commune in the jungle of Queensland - settings that Carey tackles with customary relish. The eponymous hero of Kieron Smith, Boy by James Kelman (Hamish Hamilton, April) is also a child struggling for survival, though his trials take place in the rather more pedestrian setting of a housing estate on the outer edges of post-war Glasgow. Staying above the Watford Gap, The Northern Clemency by Philip Hensher (Fourth Estate, April) uses the changing fortunes of two Sheffield families as a springboard for an ambitious portrait of life in the north over three turbulent decades. Not all this year&apos;s reads are so parochial, and the unsettled global stage proves a persistent preoccupation. The events of 11 September and their fallout have inspired a contentious stream of responses from Martin Amis, and The Second Plane (Jonathan Cape, January) brings together for the first time Amis&apos;s journalism and short fiction written in the wake of the attack. His work engages with the central issues of our age and will inevitably cause controversy. Will Self&apos;s latest take on modern life is equally sharp witted and no less provocative. In The Butt (Bloomsbury, April), a world closely resembling our own topples into chaos when a holidaymaker casually flings a cigarette from a balcony. This satire has distinct echoes of the invasion of Iraq and proves as disturbing as it is assured. Machiavellian intrigues of international high politics are scarcely the preserve of our century alone and in Salman Rushdie&apos;s The Enchantress of Florence (Jonathan Cape, April), the original master of unscrupulous strategy takes a starring role. This seductive saga links the Mughal empire with the Renaissance by way of an Indian princess, Lady Black Eyes, who finds herself central to the power struggles of 16th-century Florence. A virtuoso feat of storytelling, Rushdie&apos;s novel also reflects on the dangers that come when fantasy and reality grow too intertwined. It&apos;s a problem that also emerges in A Partisan&apos;s Daughter by Louis de Bernieres (Harvill Secker, March). The daughter is Roza, a refugee from Tito&apos;s brutal reign, who has exchanged Yugoslavia for London&apos;s unexpectedly hostile streets. Like Scheherazade, she saves her life by spinning yarns, but trouble comes when they don&apos;t tally with the truth. Capturing an era through the backward-looking gaze of an ageing narrator is a device that appeals more than once. In Something to Tell You (Faber, March) by Hanif Kureishi, a successful psychoanalyst reflects on his initiation into the excesses of Seventies London, a period of sexual licence and political strife that Kureishi claimed as his own with The Buddha of Suburbia, his first novel, in 1990. An exuberant and engaging novel, it reflects seriously on whether the past can ever be laid to rest. The question is equally pertinent for the elderly Irish heroine of The Secret Scripture by Sebastian Barry (Faber, July). Roseanne McNulty has been an in-patient at a mental hospital for decades and her tangled reminiscences in the weeks leading up to the unit&apos;s closure serve to shed light on the troubled history of her island nation. Anne Enright, last year&apos;s Man Booker Prize winner, returns with Taking Pictures (Jonathan Cape, March), a visceral collection of short stories that captures women in a series of revealing moments: changing nappies, trapped in lifts, pursued by bees. Enright is fascinated by the shifting landscapes of desire and this elegant collection sees a once underrated writer at the top of her game. Women&apos;s issues are also the focus of Mad, Bad and Sad (Little, Brown, February) by Lisa Appignanesi, a scholarly study of mental illness and its treatment over the past 200 years. Virginia Woolf is a case study in this attempt to understand why mania, depression and hysteria tend to affect women far more than men. Having dispatched Newton, Turner and Chaucer, Peter Ackroyd continues his acclaimed series of literary biographies with Poe (Chatto &amp; Windus, February), an account of the writer&apos;s short life that opens with the mystery of his death. Ackroyd explores the effect of childhood poverty on Poe&apos;s hectic imagination, and picks up traces of his legacy everywhere from Surrealism to the humble detective story. The past revealed in JG Ballard&apos;s memoir, Miracles of Life (Fourth Estate, February), is no less eventful. Born in Shanghai, Ballard spent much of his childhood in a Japanese internment camp before returning to England in time for the unprecedented freedoms of the Sixties. A particular delight of this lyrical autobiography lies in spotting the landscapes and events that appear, subtly reconfigured, in Ballard&apos;s fiction. Though Julian Barnes claims Nothing to Be Frightened Of (Jonathan Cape, March) is not an autobiography, it&apos;s certainly the nearest he has come to recounting the story of his life. But don&apos;t expect a kiss and tell; instead, this beguiling and dexterous memoir sees the author grappling with God, death and art. Look out, too, for offerings by Observer journalists. Adam Mars-Jones&apos;s Pilcrow (Faber, April) tells the story of John Cromer, a man physically disadvantaged but fully endowed with spirit and pluck. And Uneasy Rider (Ebury, February) is a jaunty account of Mike Carter&apos;s solo road trip across Europe. Though it seems unlikely that any of 2008&apos;s crop of authors will approach the startling sales of JK Rowling, one thing is for sure: rumours of literature&apos;s death are decidedly premature.  That brave new world is here Robert McCrum Another new season, another inevitable surge of hype. After a quiet year, 2008 will see some of the biggest names in the business competing for attention across the English-speaking world. Never has the literary arena for new writing flourished on such a global scale. The Booker Prize, for example, which turns 40 this year, will have as much of a presence in Beijing as Barnsley. So the literary landscape is changing. For about 15 years the IT revolution has been transforming the world of books in incremental ways. Suddenly it seems as though all the elements of technological innovation are coming together in a perfect storm of change, the outcome of which is obscure to even the sharpest industry analysts. Never has William Goldman&apos;s famous dictum &apos;No one knows anything&apos; seemed more apt. On the surface, ours seems to be a golden age. For new books there&apos;s more exposure, and perhaps even more readers, in more formats, than ever before. If the Hollywood writers&apos; strike has any lessons for books, it is that no publisher or agent can afford to be casual about intellectual property. Behind the scenes there are darker mutterings. E-books, digitisation, graphic novels, online bookselling: are these threats or opportunities? Everyone has a different answer. One thing is certain: this is a moment of transition in which old names, old wisdom and old habits will go to the wall. Among the new names worth keeping an eye on, there&apos;s a first novel, a graphic artist, a thriller writer and a promising translation: Jennifer Cody Epstein&apos;s The Painter of Shanghai (Penguin), Hannah Berry&apos;s Britten and Brulightly (Cape), screenwriter Tom Rob Smith&apos;s Child 44 (Simon &amp; Schuster) and burlesque tragi-comedy How The Soldier Repairs the Gramophone by Bosnian prizewinner Sasa Stanisic (Orion). And then there&apos;s Nick Harkaway&apos;s The Gone Away World (Heinemann), a debut published under a pseudonym, perhaps because Nick Cornwell is really John le Carre&apos;s son. A happy marriage of old and new?

He continues: &apos;When I was thrown out, my mother, who was an emotionally highly strung woman, locked herself in the bathroom and took an overdose of mahjong tiles.&apos; These lines came back to me while watching Ang Lee&apos;s espionage drama, Lust, Caution - released on Friday - in which a group of Chinese housewives play endless rounds of mahjong. Lee&apos;s camera circles them as they chat politely and place tiles on the table, their gossip becoming more heated as winning hands approach. Baffled and a little bored, I soon realised that Lee is using the game as a metaphor - its tensions mirroring the wartime action outside the parlour in Japanese-occupied Shanghai. Yet despite the fact that Lee devotes more screen time to mahjong than he does to the film&apos;s lavish, 18-certificate sex scenes, the uninitiated viewer is more likely to pick up a new love-making position than any mahjong skills. Although no understanding of mahjong is necessary to watch Lust, Caution, it&apos;s yet another of those occasions in film where a game takes centre stage, risking utter boredom for viewers not partial to its intricacies. As one who is generally useless at games, this alienation is something I&apos;ve felt in films from The Sting to The Cincinnati Kid. Chess movies scare me; I rarely get films involving American football. Maybe it&apos;s time producers started handing out booklets of rules before we go in to the cinema. Otherwise, when it comes to games on screen, I&apos;ve overdosed, just like Woody&apos;s mum.", "tags": ["Lust, Caution", "Film", "Ang Lee", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2007-12-30T10:30:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/30/features.jamesrobinson", "sentences": ["Set in 1940s Shanghai, the film is ostensibly a spy thriller about wartime espionage at the height of China&apos;s bitter conflict with the country&apos;s Japanese occupiers, but like Brokeback Mountain, it explores themes of sexuality and desire."], "title": "The Observer profile: Ang Lee", "article": "Ang Lee returned to his native Taiwan earlier this month to pick up the best director prize for his new film Lust, Caution at the Golden Horse Awards, regarded by many as the Asian Oscars. Taking the podium to collect the last of seven gongs, he startled the assembled industry executives by ending his acceptance speech with the cry: &apos;Go Taiwanese film!&apos; It was a moment of uncharacteristic exuberance from the acclaimed 53-year-old director, a &apos;shy human being&apos; who left his homeland for America 30 years ago to pursue a career in cinema against the wishes of his disciplinarian parents. Since then, Lee has followed an unconventional path to the top of the Hollywood tree, making cult movies in Cantonese and English that weren&apos;t always well-received before stumbling into the mainstream with the most unusual of them all, the mystical martial arts film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, that won three Oscars in 2000 and made him a household name. He followed that with Hulk, a critical and commercial flop that was panned by critics; the New York Times described it as: &apos;Incredible, but only in a negative sense: incredibly long, incredibly tedious, incredibly turgid.&apos; But Lee&apos;s adaptation of Annie Proulx&apos;s novel Brokeback Mountain, released two years ago, restored his status as a director of global importance, as well as winning him three more Academy Awards, and that reputation could be cemented still further this week, when Lust, Caution, a two-and-a-half-hour epic, opens in the UK. Set in 1940s Shanghai, the film is ostensibly a spy thriller about wartime espionage at the height of China&apos;s bitter conflict with the country&apos;s Japanese occupiers, but like Brokeback Mountain, it explores themes of sexuality and desire. Against the dramatic backdrop of the city&apos;s imposing colonial architecture, it tells the story of Wong Chia Chi, a young woman recruited by the resistance to seduce a collaborator, Mr Yee, who finds herself dangerously attracted to her prey. The puzzle for the film&apos;s protagonist and for audiences is to figure out where the deception ends and the genuine passion begins. Like his unconventional western that scandalised much of conservative America with its honest portrayal of a gay love affair, Lust, Caution is a controversial movie. Rumours of its sexually explicit scenes began to emerge from the set months before its release, and US censors handed it an NC-17 certificate, the equivalent of the old &apos;X&apos; classification. But although that will limit its audience, and the amount of money it makes, it is unlikely to diminish its impact, if only because its three carefully choreographed sex scenes are realistic enough for some American critics to wonder whether they may even be real. Lee insists they are staged and has defended them as &apos;pivotal parts of the story&apos;, but he has also said they were the most difficult he has ever shot. &apos;I&apos;m a shy human being. After half a day, we had to stop, it was so exhausting. To verbalise the feelings and lead the actors through those acts and witness how much they devote to it, it&apos;s very painful. Usually, we don&apos;t go there. I don&apos;t intend to go there again.&apos; Critics are divided about the film, which opened in America to mixed reviews in October. &apos;Lee is a true master,&apos; said Rolling Stone, &apos;and his potently erotic and suspenseful film casts a spell you won&apos;t want to break.&apos; Variety declared: &apos;Too much caution and too little lust squeeze much of the dramatic juice out of a two-and-half-hour period drama that&apos;s a long haul for relatively few returns.&apos; The film&apos;s restrictive rating means its distribution will be limited, but, unusually, Universal Pictures didn&apos;t press for cuts to be made to secure a better classification and a wider audience. &apos;They kept saying this year we have other films that will make money,&apos; according to Lee, a comment that demonstrates the immense industry clout the Chinese director now wields from his home in New York, far removed from the politics and power games of Hollywood. Married with two sons, Lee lives a stubbornly conventional family life, despite his wealth. He owns a four-bedroom house in the affluent New York commuter town of Larchmont, where he has lived since 1986, but his backyard is home to a chicken coop rather than a swimming pool, his children do not attend private schools and he rarely socialises with his &apos;showbiz friends&apos;. His close collaborator, Tim Squyres, the Oscar-winning editor who has worked with him on 10 of his 11 films, describes Lee as &apos;a quiet man&apos; and &apos;a normal suburban dad. He&apos;s very amiable in a quiet sort of way. He doesn&apos;t throw temper tantrums; he&apos;s not needy. He&apos;s not high maintenance. He&apos;s not one of those big Hollywood personalities who throws big parties at home at the weekend.&apos; When the two men where editing Lust, Caution in New York, Lee would often drop his youngest son Mason at school before arriving for work. A decade of shooting films overseas has taken him away from his family for long periods and he has expressed regret about missing his children&apos;s formative years, telling one interviewer recently: &apos;I feel bad. I missed [eldest son] Haan in a fencing competition. I missed all his games. I missed most of his teenage years.&apos; Born in the agricultural south of Taiwan, Lee&apos;s upbringing was unremarkable and there was little to suggest he would one day become the country&apos;s most famous cultural export. One of four children born to teachers who fled the mainland after the nationalists were routed by Mao Tse-Tung&apos;s communists, he fell in love with the cinema as a teenager and began consuming American films voraciously. &apos;He knows more about American westerns from the 1930s to the 50s than I do,&apos; Squyres says. &apos;He doesn&apos;t come from a traditional Chinese film background at all. Even his Chinese films don&apos;t feel foreign to Westerners because he&apos;s so suffused with a Western cinema sensibility. He certainly doesn&apos;t think of himself as part of any movement or tradition. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s an Ang Lee style of film.&apos; Teenage Lee skipped university, to the disappointment of his parents, to attend Taiwan&apos;s National Arts School, arriving in America to study theatre in Chicago and film in New York after completing his national service in 1979. After graduating, it was six years before he managed to land his first film, Pushing Hands, and his young family spent the ensuing period living off the income of his wife Jane Lin, now an assistant professor of pathology at New York Medical College. The experience has imbued him with a work ethic that has seen him produce almost a film a year since then. Lee&apos;s approach to film-making is equally disciplined, although some who have worked closely with him have complained he can be demanding. He shot more than seven hours of footage for Lust, Caution&apos;s opening three-minute scene, and actors are rarely mollycoddled. &apos;I would not call him nurturing,&apos; says Squyres. &apos;His approach to actors is not to make everyone happy and comfortable. He creates a certain amount of tension and discomfort.&apos; Kate Winslet, who starred in Emma Thompson&apos;s adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, which Lee directed, claims he asked actors to write essays about their characters before filming began. Not every Hollywood star is a fan, although others are said to enjoy the intellectual rigour he demands of them. Lee&apos;s career so far has been characterised by an uncanny knack of defying box-office logic, but not always for the better. Brokeback Mountain, which may prove to be his masterpiece, was conceived as a small movie with an art-house sensibility, but became a global hit, and Crouching Tiger found an audience few subtitled films ever reach, becoming the biggest grossing &apos;foreign&apos; film in history. But the comic-book romp Hulk was a cinematic miss that should have been a hit. It is too early to say how Lust, Caution will fare critically or commercially, but however it is received, Lee&apos;s standing in the film world is unlikely to be diminished and his popularity in his homeland will prove enduring. Although his octogenarian mother still lives in Taiwan, Lee is an infrequent visitor and his appearance at the Asian Oscars marked a rare return to a country where he is feted and revered in equal measure. According to Squyres, who accompanied him on the Taiwan trip: &apos;He was followed everywhere by the paparazzi. He&apos;s like a rock star over there.&apos; Typically, that is attention Ang Lee doesn&apos;t covet, preferring the anonymity of suburban America. &apos;Here I can live a normal life. In Taiwan, I&apos;d be like Michael Jordan walking down the street.&apos; The Ang Lee lowdown Born Chaochou in rural Taiwan, one of four children. His father, Sheng Lee, who died in 2004 at the age of 91, was the head teacher at Tainan First Senior High School, and his mother, who still lives in Taiwan, was also a teacher. Met his wife Jane Lin, a microbiologist, after moving to American to study theatre and film. They married in 1983 and have two sons, Haan, 23, and Mason, 17.

There&apos;s not one single environment I can totally belong to. My cultural roots are something illusive.&apos; What others say &apos;I adore Ang Lee. I think he&apos;s a genius. So sweet, so humble and such a strong director at the same time as being such a gentle man.
