The vessel, the 90,000-tonne LT Cortesia, had suddenly changed course and become beached on the Varne Bank, nine miles off Dover. Three commercial tug boats took an hour to pull the vessel off the sandbank before towing it to an anchorage, where it will be inspected before resuming its voyage. A spokesperson for the Marine and Coastguard Agency said the ship appeared watertight and in good condition. An emergency coastguard tug, the Anglian Monarch, was sent to the spot to assess damage, warn other vessels of the container&apos;s presence and to try to help pull the ship off the sandbank. The Cortesia, which had left Thamesport in Kent, was en route to east Asia via the Suez Canal. The coastguard said there was some hazardous material on board, though it was not known exactly what, but the vessel was stable and its hull appeared to be intact. None of the containers slipped from the ship, as happened when the vessel the MSC Napoli was deliberately beached in Devon a year ago in terrible weather. There were astonishing scenes then as hundreds descended on Branscombe beach to scavenge goods ranging from BMW motorcycles to packs of dog food. A Dover coastguard spokesman said it was a mystery why the LT Cortesia ran aground. &quot;We haven&apos;t a clue why. The vessel had come down normally, made an alteration to its route and then went aground. &quot;The weather has been fine and its traffic pattern was OK until the last minute when it went aground. Until we get to speak to the people on board to find out what happened, we will not know.&quot; LT Cortesia is owned by the German group Conti Reederei, which has a fleet of 77 vessels. It operates on Evergreen Line&apos;s China-Europe-Mediterranean service. The first the coastguard knew of the incident was when radar monitoring of the traffic separation zone in the Dover Strait, which keeps ships apart, indicated that the vessel had come to a sudden stop at the Varne Bank. The coastguard contacted the vessel, which was carrying 27 crew members, and the skipper confirmed that it was stuck on the sandbank. The ship is loaded with 42,785 tonnes of cargo in containers, some holding private possessions, others consignments of goods. The four-year-old ship was the largest vessel to dock at Thamesport, a busy container port, when she made her first trip there in 2005. On this voyage she had stopped in Le Havre, Hamburg and Rotterdam before reaching Thamesport. Her next stop was to be Port Said in Egypt and then Malaysia, Taiwan, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Dire strait The Dover Strait has long been regarded as a maritime graveyard. Sandbanks lie in wait along one of the busiest seaways in the world, used by more than 500 vessels daily. Traffic lanes were imposed after 20 Italian sailors on board the Vittoria Claudia died following a collision in 1953, but the safety measures did not prevent the fishing vessel Ocean Hound from being run down in the Dover Strait in 1991 with the loss of five lives. Heavy seas have also tormented sailors in the Dover Strait. In 2002 a Norwegian freight tanker, the Tricolor, sank with a \u00a321m cargo of luxury cars. The crew were rescued.

What we have here is first a lot of caution, then an explosion of lust. Ang Lee has followed his magnificent version of E Annie Proulx&apos;s Brokeback Mountain with another love story - more explicit in many ways, though more complex and oblique - and it&apos;s a movie that showcases Lee&apos;s flair for period detail and genre stylisation. For his sheer muscular verve and ambition, Lee deserves a standing ovation. Orson Welles was described once as picking up a play with the confidence of a marksman picking up a rifle, and that is exactly how I felt Lee handles this source material: a short story by Eileen Chang. He has given Tony Leung a chance to shine with one of the most charismatic and memorable performances of his career, and in the twentysomething newcomer Tang Wei, he has made a tremendous discovery. Fiercely intelligent and hauntingly beautiful, she gives a passionate, courageous performance that deserves a shelf-full of awards; it&apos;s already made her an Asian movie-star to rival Zhang Ziyi. Lust, Caution is an erotic espionage drama, a little like Hitchcock&apos;s Notorious in its plot, set in Japanese-occupied China in the second world war. Tang Wei plays Wong Chia Chi, an unassuming young college student who in 1939 finds herself left behind in Hong Kong when her father flees to England. But Wong is to find her calling when she is invited to join a theatre troupe performing patriotic plays, the purpose of which is to raise cash for the homeland&apos;s defence. Her performances are electrifying, and the collection tins are chinking, but their leader Kuang (Wang Leehom) is impatient with mere play-acting. He wants to use their talents for more direct action: namely, an elaborate sting that will ensnare the hated collaborationist police chief Yee, played by Tony Leung. Wong will seduce him by pretending to be a bored married woman in search of adventure, and once Yee&apos;s guard is down, he will be assassinated. The plan ends in bloody catastrophe, and Yee gets away, reappearing in Shanghai in 1942, where Wong also fetches up and the official resistance contact her with a message: they were impressed with her amateur attempt and the plan is back on. She must begin the seduction anew, but this time both hunter and hunted are older and more careworn; idealism has become clouded with fear and exhaustion, and does each suspect what the other is up to? There is a whiff of sulphur in the air along with the whiff of sex. The conditions are in place for a love affair of intense eroticism, obsession and betrayal. The sex scenes have a glorious impact, all the more so for the long, burning fuse that precedes their detonation. Wong&apos;s sexual pre-history is made up of earlier, tragicomic scenes in which the poor innocent volunteers to be deflowered by a member of her resistance group, so that her virginal state will not give the game away. The spectacle of the young man doing his bit by doggedly thrusting away on top of Wong&apos;s tense, miserable body is horribly funny and un-erotic, a mirror image to the deadly serious sizzle of her later, passionate bedroom athletics with Yee. And whatever the ambiguity of her feelings for him, they assume a poignancy and even tragedy when we learn that Wong&apos;s emotions could have been engaged elsewhere, far earlier in the story. Arguably, the sex scenes do not have the subtlety and nuance of Wong and Yee&apos;s flirtatious dinner in Hong Kong and the tension of their automobile ride home together, wondering whether or not Wong would be inviting Yee in for coffee. The ferocious, destructive passion, however, confers a retrospective intensity on these moments, and a piquancy too: a sense that in those days their dangerous game had, if hardly innocence exactly, then a more manageable kind of pleasure. There is tremendous sweep and potency here; the streetscapes in Shanghai are spectacular and it&apos;s a wonderfully satisfying experience, though it has to be said that the film does not offer the same unmediated insight into the minds and hearts of its lovers that Brokeback Mountain did. Fundamentally, we all felt that we knew, really knew, what it felt like for the two cowboys to be in love; here the question is a little more difficult. Of course, it is a different sort of film, and this alienation and emotional occlusion is a central part of what Lust, Caution is about. It is another resounding success for Ang Lee, whose film-making has such mass and substance. His movies are like huge, exciting new buildings for us to gather round and wonder at.", "tags": ["Lust, Caution", "Film", "World cinema", "Drama", "Romance", "Thriller", "Ang Lee", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-04T14:45:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/04/china.humanrights", "sentences": ["Many are speculating that the former party boss of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, now under investigation for embezzling billions from the city&apos;s social security funds, could be the next."], "title": "China switches to lethal injection", "article": "China&apos;s executioners are planning to increase the use of lethal injections in order to make executions &quot;more humane&quot;, a senior court official told the state media yesterday.

The agreement was to keep on talking to try to reach a deal by 2010. It was a diplomatic triumph, achieved after rows and high dramas, but it leaves all nations a mighty hill to climb. There is no agreement on what emission cuts need to be made by when or by whom, and the US is still deeply reluctant to do anything. It is a roadmap with no signposts. Some were optimistic that a start had been made; some said that the earth&apos;s ecological situation was in a far more perilous state than had been thought. The iconic images of 2007 - polar bears stranded, glaciers melting in the Himalayas, forests coming down all over Africa and devastating floods and droughts from Bangladesh to Ghana - may be as nothing to what will happen if people do not take immediate action. But who are the people who can bring about change, the pioneers coming up with radical solutions? We can modify our lifestyles, but that will never be enough. Who are the politicians most able to force society and industry to do things differently? Where are the green shoots that will get us out of the global ecological mess? To come up with a list of the 50 people most able to prevent the continuing destruction of the planet, we consulted key people in the global environment debate. Our panel included scientists - former World Bank chief scientist and now the British government&apos;s scientific adviser on climate change, Bob Watson, Indian physicist and ecologist Vandana Shiva, Kenyan biologist and Nobel prize-winner Wangari Maathai; activists - Guardian columnist George Monbiot and head of Greenpeace International Gerd Leipold; politicians - Green party co-leader and MEP Caroline Lucas, and London mayor Ken Livingstone; sustainable development commissioner for the UK government Jonathon Porritt and novelist Philip Pullman. Then the Guardian&apos;s science, environment and economics correspondents met to add their own nominations and establish a final 50. Great names were argued over, and unknown ones surfaced. Should Al Gore be on the list? He may have put climate change on the rich countries&apos; agenda, but some felt his solution of trading emissions is not enough and no more than what all major businesses and western governments are now saying. But in the end he squeaked through. There was also debate over Leonardo DiCaprio. It would be easy to sniff at someone who seemed to have merely pledged to forgo private jets and made a couple of films about the environment, but we felt the Hollywood superstar who has grabbed the green agenda had to be included because of the worldwide influence he is expected to have. Thanks to his massive celebrity status DiCaprio could be a crucial figure in persuading and leading the next generation. Some people made it to the final 50 not just because of their work but because - like the man who has found a simple way to save energy in a refrigerator, or the boy who collects impressive amounts of money for the protection of tigers - they represented a significant grassroots technological or social movement. And some got on the list because they were considered the driving forces behind the decision-makers. One church leader, for example, made it largely because the world&apos;s religions have huge investments and are shifting the political landscape in the US and Europe. The final list includes an Indian peasant farmer, the world&apos;s leading geneticist, German and Chinese politicians, a novelist, a film director, a civil engineer, a seed collector and a scientist who has persuaded an African president to make a tenth of his country a national park. There are 19 nationalities represented. Nearly one in five of those listed comes from the US, and one in three is from a developing country, suggesting that grassroots resourcefulness will be as important as money and technology in the future. Nearly one in three of the people chosen has a scientific background, even if not all practice what they studied. It&apos;s not a definitive list and there are no rankings, but these 50 names give a sense of the vast well of people who represent the stirrings of a remarkable scientific and social revolution, and give us hope as we enter 2008.John Vidal Terry Tamminen Climate policy adviser Born in Australia, Terry Tamminen, 57, has been a sheep farmer, a sea captain, a property dealer and, until last year, environmental adviser to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Largely because of Tamminen&apos;s influence, Arnie greened up, passed a raft of groundbreaking environmental laws, put pressure on polluting industries and is now politically popular. The world&apos;s seventh largest economy now has targets and timetables to shame nearly every country in the world - a 25% cut in emissions by 2020 - and is hailed as a beacon of eco responsibility. Tamminen has moved on to run the state&apos;s climate plan and is working with other US states and cities to create a de facto national climate change policy, and in so doing forcing President Bush&apos;s hand. Tamminen argues that the 5% of the world population who live in the US are responsible not for 25% of the world&apos;s climate emissions, as the textbooks say, but for at least 50% of them if you include the energy needed to power the Chinese factories that are churning out plastic toys and other mass consumer goods for the voracious US market. Capt Paul WatsonMarine activist      Paul Watson, 57, is the man Japanese whalers, Canadian seal hunters and illegal fishermen everywhere fear the most. The ultimate direct action man, he co-founded Greenpeace in the 70s and now has two boats that patrol the world &apos;s oceans and confront anyone he has evidence of acting criminally. He is regularly denounced by governments as being an eco terrorist and a pirate after ramming and scuttling whalers, but Watson knows the law of the sea and has never been prosecuted. Now he is opening up a new role for environment groups. Last year the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society became an official law enforcement agency in Ecuador. Sea Shepherd partners the Ecuador police and can go on official patrols and make arrests in the Galapagos national maritime park. In one month last year he intercepted more than 19,000 shark fins and 92,000 sea cucumbers, and confiscated more than 35 miles of illegal longline. The idea of environmental activists becoming a new green police force may develop in years to come.  Vicki Buck Entrepreneur  As the world scrambles to find a fuel supply that doesn&apos;t exacerbate global warming, New Zealander Vicki Buck, 51, has emerged as the acceptable face of biofuels. She&apos;s one-third of Aquaflow, a small company that was one of the first to crack the technology needed to harvest wild algae from sewage ponds, then extract fuel from it suitable for cars and aircraft. Companies from Boeing to Virgin are now beating a path to her Christchurch door. They&apos;re excited by the fact that it&apos;s theoretically possible to produce 10,000 gallons of algae oil per acre, compared with 680 gallons per acre for palm oil. Moreover, Buck has form: she was mayor of Christchurch, set up top eco-website celsias.com, is a director of NZ Windfarms, and is now working on a start-up to reduce one major cause of climate change: the methane gas emitted from billions of animals which make up 49% of NZ&apos;s greenhouse gases - chiefly by changing their diet.  Elon Musk Entrepreneur  Elon Musk, 36, struck gold with PayPal (a system for paying bills online) during the 90s dot com boom and the South African wunderkind is now the major investor and chair of the board at Tesla Motors, a Silicon Valley electric car startup. The company plans to shake up the moribund US auto industry and dramatically curb CO2 emissions, ripping out the internal combustion engine and the petrol tank, and replacing both with a motor that boasts few moving parts and the sort of lithium batteries found in laptops. A limited-edition Tesla Roadster, a sports car that reaches 60 mph in less than four seconds, and can do 245 miles per charge, is due this year. Hollywood eco-stars such as George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio have bagged the first of a 600-car production run being built by Lotus in the UK. Next up, says Tesla, is a mass-market family sedan that could be fuelled by solar panels on the garage roof. Angela MerkelGerman chancellor      Angela Merkel, 53, has inherited Tony Blair&apos;s mantle as the politician forcing climate change the hardest on to the world stage, and she is a formidable advocate. The only major player left who helped hammer out the original global warming agreement at Kyoto in 1997, she is one of the very few with a grasp of what it means if humanity fails. But it&apos;s what Germany does at home that gives Merkel authority. A quantum chemistry researcher brought up by a Lutheran pastor in communist East Germany, she was made German environment minister in 1994. The country now leads the world in turning away from coal and oil, and setting the highest targets for renewables and emission cuts. She&apos;s not so popular with Greens, who accuse her of being a lackey to nuclear power and a friend of Bush, but they accept that she gets things done. Ten years ago, she shocked people when she said Germany should aim to raise the proportion of its electricity generated from renewable energy to 50% by 2050. It&apos;s now 12% - compare Britain&apos;s 3% - and is on track to be 20% in 12 years&apos; time. She asked Germans to believe her when she said renewables would provide more jobs. There are now nearly 250,000 people working in the sector. And at the UN meeting at Bali last month, she told the EU it had to stick together and be ambitious. It led the fight against President Bush. The speed at which Germany under Merkel is pursuing climate change policies is embarrassing the UK and other countries, which talk up the need for action, but deliver little. The UK aims to cut emissions by 60% by 2050 and argues that it needs nuclear power to do so. Germany, meanwhile, wants 40% cuts within 13 years without resort to nuclear power - something far harder. &quot;The faster industrialised countries cut their emissions, the more willing other countries will be to do their bit,&quot; Merkel says. &quot;An intelligent and fair regulation of CO2 reductions is in everyone&apos;s best interests.&quot; It&apos;s heady stuff for the world&apos;s energy watchers. German energy efficiency is to be improved by 3% a year for 20 years. The country expects to use 10% less electricity within a decade; all power stations are to be modernised; there&apos;s \u00a330bn for more renewables; railways will be further subsidised to lure people out of their cars and away from aeroplanes; plans for more wind turbines, photovoltaic electricity and biofuels will all be fast-forwarded; there is \u00a31,500m to reduce CO2 in existing buildings; and the solar market is growing by 40% a year. Few doubt that Germany is on track to achieve one of the greatest transformations in any country&apos;s use of power. Merkel is matter of fact about the costs. One leading thinktank recently calculated that climate change would cost Germany nearly \u00a3100bn a year by the middle of the century, so stumping up \u00a34bn over the next few years to avoid that is cheap, she reckons. &quot;The costs of reducing emissions should be seem as a sound investment,&quot; Merkel says. &quot;Unabated climate change will slash prosperity by between 5% and 25%. Rigorous climate protection will cost only 1% of this prosperity and makes economic sense.&quot; She is lucky in that Germany has a secret weapon in the battle against global warming: called the Renewable Energy Sources Act, it sets minimum prices for generating electricity. Anyone generating electricity from renewables now gets a guaranteed payment of up to three to four times the market rate, guaranteed for 20 years. This has not just kickstarted the whole German renewable industry beyond its wildest imaginings, it also reduces the payback time on such technologies and offers a high return on investment. The idea has since been adopted in many other countries, and was picked up by the Conservatives in Britain in mid-December. Germany is far from green. It has immense ecological problems and is still the world&apos;s sixth greatest polluter, but for now it has gone renewable-mad with farmers, householders and businesses competing with each other to profit the most. If under Merkel Germany doesn&apos;t meet UN and EU targets, then it&apos;s nowhere will.   Caroline Lucas Politician  Caroline Lucas, 47, is Green MEP for SE England and is likely to be elected the Greens&apos; first sole leader next year when members have a referendum (hitherto the party has had a joint leadership). She was nominated here by Jonathon Porritt: &quot;She is the most inspiring politician the Green party has had since its inception - honest, articulate, passionate.&quot; In the meantime, she is intensely disliked by EU commissioners and much of big industry after drafting laws to force airlines to pay the true environmental and social costs of flying, forcing a legal investigation into nuclear power, taking on chemical companies and harassing the commission at every opportunity on trade, GM crops, globalisation and animal diseases.  Bob Hertzberg Financier  Bob Hertzberg, 53, founder of venture capital firm Renewable Capital, is one of a new breed of financier piling unprecedented amounts of money into renewable technologies. He ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 2005, finishing in third place. Renewable Capital has holdings in electric car companies, solar electric firms and windfarms. He is also backing a company in Cardiff that produces solar cells that do not need direct sunlight to generate electricity. In a process similar to photosynthesis, it uses nano-sized titanium crystals to turn light into electricity.  Carlo Petrini Food activist  Carlo Petrini, 58, is the only anti-McDonald&apos;s activist who has been welcomed to the offices of David Cameron, David Miliband, Prince Charles, Al Gore and Barack Obama. The founder of the international Slow Food movement, nominated here by Vandana Shiva, is idolised by rich and leisured foodies for promoting high-quality, small-scale farming and organising a relaxed life around long lunches. But Petrini, an Italian leftie of the old school, has a far more serious purpose than saving the pilchard or Parma ham. The Slow Food movement has now expanded across 100 countries and is throwing poisoned darts at the whole fast food culture and the multinational food producers that between them have wrecked so much of the environment.  Tewolde EgziabherScientist Tewolde Egziabher, 67, a slight, Gandhian figure, is a UK-trained biologist who runs Ethiopia&apos;s environment protection agency and has proved himself an extraordinarily effective negotiator. At 2am at the 2002 Earth Summit , he made one of the most impassioned speeches heard at a global meeting. It had looked certain that the world&apos;s politicians would back a US proposal giving the World Trade Organisation the power to override international environment treaties, but he shamed the ministers into voting it down. No one could remember a personal intervention having such an impact, and his battles on behalf of developing countries to protect them from patents, unfettered free trade and GM crops are legendary. He was nominated by Vandana Shiva. Amory LovinsPhysicist Think of a world where cars burn no oil and emit drinking water - or nothing at all. Where central power stations are redundant and buildings and parked vehicles produce enough energy to drive factories. Where no house is built that cannot generate electricity for others. Where carbon emissions have long been declining, and industries no longer waste almost all their material. This is not a pipe dream, but an increasingly likely scenario, here within a generation or two; that is the prediction of Amory Lovins, 60, an experimental physicist turned energy reduction pioneer who has had as profound an influence on the way people use energy as any man alive. From a base in the Rockies, Lovins and his team of engineers and analysts show governments and large car, aviation and energy companies, as well as the likes of Walmart and Monsanto, how to profit from using less energy by applying knowledge of composite materials, engineering, design and energy storage. He says: &quot;Optimism beats fear or despair any time. There are excellent reasons to be encouraged. The global consciousness is higher at all levels. Revolutionary changes are taking place.&quot; The car industry is speeding towards solutions Lovins proposed nearly 20 years ago, when he developed the idea of a &quot;hyper car&quot; - a carbon fibre hybrid petrol- and electricity-run machine that weighs next to nothing, has far fewer parts than conventional cars, does 150-200mpg and emits practically nothing. Last November, Toyota unveiled just that: a four-door carbon fibre model the same size as its green Prius but about a quarter of the weight of some Minis. It emits only one third of the Prius&apos;s greenhouse gases and does more than 100mpg. Now most car makers, with one eye on $100 dollar a barrel oil prices and an understanding that there is a vast market for green, are playing catch-up with Lovins&apos; ideas. While at Oxford in the 70s, Lovins helped set up Friends of the Earth in Britain and stopped Rio Tinto digging up Snowdonia. By the age of 28, he had worked out that the US could phase out fossil fuels not at a cost, but at a profit. &quot;We stand here confronted by insurmountable opportunities,&quot; he wrote. Now the revolution he helped shape is coming, and Lovins says the US can eliminate all oil use by 2050, &quot;and know unprecedented prosperity&quot;. &quot;We&apos;re finding in the auto sector speed of change at a fundamental level,&quot; he says. &quot;Change is coming out of fear and the car makers are gazing into the abyss. It is widely understood that incremental change is a high-risk strategy. Those who take the opportunity to change will do very well. We can save half the oil we use and the rest we can save with advanced biofuels.&quot; He dismisses nuclear power as the fantasy of control and command states stuck in the 50s. &quot;New nuclear plants are so costly that spending the same on micropower can save two to 10 times more CO2, and sooner. In 2005, renewables produced one sixth of the world&apos;s total electricity and a third of new electricity. This revolution already happened - sorry if you missed it!&quot; Lovins works by seeking efficiency at every point. Take the most energy-efficient existing hybrid car, he says. Drive it carefully and you can double efficiency. Make it ultra-light, and you can redouble it. Run it on an advanced biofuel, and you can quadruple its oil efficiency again. If you then give it batteries that can be recharged by connecting a plug to an electric power source and have a good economic model to pay for the batteries, then you at least double efficiency again. Put all this together, and you can be down to about 3% of the oil per mile you started with. And Lovins says he has never known any company invest in energy and not make a profit. He&apos;s working with the Pentagon, which spends nearly a third of its vast budget on moving troops and equipment around. If it invested in really energy-efficient goals, in the same way as, say, it invested in the internet, GPS and chips, Lovins says it would shift the entire global energy landscape. The knock-on effect would transform civilian car, truck and plane industries, too. The cost? It&apos;s a $180bn investment, he reckons - or roughly what the UK spends on its health service in a year.   Madhav Subrmanian Schoolboy Madhav Subrmanian is the next generation&apos;s face of conservation, a 12-year-old Indian boy who goes round Mumbai collecting money for tiger conservation. With his friends Kirat Singh, Sahir Doshi and Suraj Bishnoi, he set up Kids For Tigers which works in hundreds of schools. He writes poems, sings on the streets, sells merchandise and has collected Rs500,000 (\u00a36,500) in two years. Conservation awareness is growing in middle-class India, largely through young activists like him.  Marina Silva Politician  Marina Silva, 49, is Brazil&apos;s environment minister. The daughter of a Brazilian rubber tapper, she spent her childhood collecting rubber from the Amazon forest and demonstrating against the destruction wrought by illegal loggers. In one of the great political journeys, she rose from being illiterate at 16 to become Brazil&apos;s youngest senator, and is now the woman most able to prevent the Amazon&apos;s wholesale ruin. Under her watch, deforestation has reduced by nearly 75% and millions of square miles of reserves have been given to traditional communities. Last year 1,500 companies were raided and one million cubic metres of illegally felled timber were confiscated. But the future, says Silva, is peril ous. The only way that long-term loss will be averted is with foreign help. &quot;We don&apos;t want charity, it&apos;s a question of ethics of solidarity,&quot; she says.  Robin Murray Industrial economist  Central government and local authorities in the UK turn to Robin Murray, 67, when they need to reduce waste. The author of three influential books, he came up with the phrase &quot;zero waste&quot; - the idea that people can mimic biology and produce, consume and recycle everything without throwing anything away. Instead of seeing waste as a problem, he argues that it can become a resource for someone else, and instead of thinking about recycling, he says it is more sensible to think about design so that products do not need to be recycled - instead they could be used repeatedly or composted. It may need an industrial revolution and a total makeover of the global economy to achieve Murray&apos;s truly wasteless society, but zero waste is now the goal of hundreds of local authorities and is spreading around the world, back ed by designers, planners and companies from San Francisco to Wellington in New Zealand.  Laurie David Activist  Laurie David, 49, is a powerhouse with some heavy-hitting connections even by Hollywood standards. Whether spreading the word about global warming on Oprah, writing a children&apos;s bestseller on the subject, producing Al Gore&apos;s breakthrough film, An Inconvenient Truth, or making the HBO documentary Too Hot Not To Handle, which shows what lies in store for the US if it does not reverse its policies on climate change, David has become a showbiz standard-bearer. She has reached across the US political chasm by co-founding the Stop Global Warming Virtual March with Robert Kennedy Jr and Senator John McCain, though her critics say her lifestyle leaves a hefty carbon footprint.  Patriarch Bartholomew Leader of the Orthodox Church  Patriarch Bartholomew I, Archbishop of Constantinople and New Rome, is the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians around the world. He&apos;s also extremely green, each year taking church leaders of all denominations to areas of the world beset with environmental problems - including the Amazon, the Arctic and the Danube. After announcing, on an island in the Aegean, that attacks on the environment should be considered sins , he called pollution of the world&apos;s waters &quot;a new Apocalypse&quot; and led global calls for &quot;creation care&quot;. Way ahead of his time, he has made the environment an increasingly powerful strand of Christian thinking in Britain - and latterly the US, where traditionally right wing churches have followed his lead and now openly counter President Bush&apos;s stance. Bartholomew, 67, is now heavily influencing the Pope and has shared a green stage with him several times in Rome. It all suggests institutional Christianity is greening up fast after centuries of ambivalence and outright hostility. Leonardo DiCaprioActor      Icebergs are becoming a recurring theme in the life of 33-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio. First, his acting career went stellar after playing the lead in Titanic. Now it is dramatic footage of icebergs and polar bears, both threatened by climate change, that is a striking feature of his documentary The 11th Hour (released in the UK next month), a powerful call to arms for our species to protect the environment a great deal better. Combining the diametrically opposed worlds of the A-list Hollywood star and the impassioned environmentalist is a fraught, sometimes contradictory process, but DiCaprio has pulled it off, becoming one of the world&apos;s most high-profile campaigners. His primary aim, he says, is to raise awareness, not to preach: &quot;It&apos;s not about imposing a certain belief system or a way of life on people in any economic background. It&apos;s about just being aware of this issue - that&apos;s the most important thing - and really trying to say, &apos;Next time I vote, next time I buy something, I&apos;m just going to be aware of what&apos;s really going on.&apos; &quot; The first campaigning steps were taken a decade ago after he found himself the target of angry environmentalists. During the filming of The Beach, the bestselling novel about backpackers seeking a shangri-la off the Thai coast, the production team was accused of damaging a pristine beach in a national marine park - in an attempt to make it look even more &quot;perfect&quot; for the cameras, some palm trees were temporarily planted and sand dunes moved. Despite the authorities giving the film-makers permission, their actions made headlines around the world. Evidently stung by the criticism, in 1998 DiCaprio established the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, which has since collaborated with the likes of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Oceana, the Natural Resources Defence Council and the Dian Fossey Foundation to raise awareness, particularly among children, of environmental issues. In 2000, he was the US chair of Earth Day, the annual celebration of the environment. &quot;Enough is enough,&quot; he told the crowd in Washington DC. &quot;We must set an example now and move environmentalism from being the philosophy of a passionate minority... to a way of life that automatically integrates ecology into governmental policy and normal living standards. We are entering an environmental age whether we like it or not.&quot; But it was his Earth Day interview with President Clinton on ABC News that caused the biggest ripples: ABC journalists were said to be furious that a young, heart-throb actor had been allowed to do such an important interview. The final edit of the interview itself was fairly soft in tone, but it did include questions that now seem ahead of their time - namely, about the science of climate change, the lobbying power of Big Oil, ways to decrease the use of SUVs and how vulnerable New Orleans was to sea-level rises. There was even a lengthy exchange about hybrid cars, long before they became the car du jour of Hollywood stars. As DiCaprio&apos;s acting career matured, he continued his parallel life as an environmental activist, speaking at colleges and campaigning on behalf of John Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaign. And for his new documentary, he has mustered the likes of Stephen Hawking, Bill McKibben, David Suzuki, Mikhail Gorbachev and Wangari Maathai (below) to take part. He limits his own appearance in the film - essentially a series of talking heads set against library footage - to that of host and narrator. Since its release in the US last year, it has been dubbed the unofficial sequel to Al Gore&apos;s The Inconvenient Truth. &quot;It was a learning process,&quot; says DiCaprio, &quot;and I wanted to play the role of investigator - from watching documentaries at a young age, from seeing films on rainforests in Brazil and really appreciating the beauty of our planet, and then learning more and more about human impact and wanting to do something about it.&quot; His next eco-project is already in production - he&apos;s a producer for a Discovery Channel show called Eco-Town, which records how a Kansas town devastated by a tornado in 2006 attempts to rebuild itself as a &quot;model of green living&quot;. Andrew Kimbrell Lawyer  Andrew Kimbrell, 51, was a concert pianist and music teacher in New York before he joined an emerging breed of activist lawyers forcing governments to take the environment much more seriously. Last year in the US Supreme Court, he defeated the Bush administration&apos;s policy of refusing to regulate global warming. It was a defining moment in the American debate and forced Bush to regulate carbon dioxide pollution from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. Kimbrell is now working with others to devise a new concept of &apos;natural law&apos; based on the idea that humans are just one part of a wider community of beings and that the welfare of each member of that community depends on the welfare of the earth as a whole. It sounds heretical now, but is traditional in many societies and one to watch in the west.  Ren\u00e9 Ngongo Biologist  Congo DRC is home to the world&apos;s second greatest stands of tropical forest after the Amazon, mainly because no timber company could work there during the decades of civil war and insurgency. Now that the war is over, European, Asian and US logging companies are piling in, with the help of the World Bank and international donors, to strip Congo of its most valuable wood. Potentially, it&apos;s an ecological and social disaster: more than 20 million people, not least the Pygmies, depend on the forest for their living. Ngongo, 36, is a biology academic from Goma, who has travelled the country investigating the corrupt timber industry and taken his findings to London, Washington and Brussels. He&apos;s the new face of environmentalism in the south and was nominated by the head of Greenpeace International, Gerd Leipold, as the kind of activist who will make waves in the next 20 years.  Zhengrong Shi Scientist  Dr Zhen grong Shi, 44, is living proof of the clich\u00e9 that every crisis presents an opportunity. China&apos;s search for alternative energy has made the solar cell scientist and businessman one of the country&apos;s richest men. The value of his company, Suntech Power, one of the world&apos;s 10 biggest manufacturers of solar panels, has risen above the $6bn mark since it became the first Chinese firm to list on the New York stock exchange. Dr Shi is a farmer&apos;s son from Jiangsu province, and was put up for adoption because his family were too poor to raise him. He set up Suntech in 2001 , and the company expects to grow far bigger, possibly helping China overtake Japan as the world&apos;s leading supplier of the technology. Shanghai plans to subsidise 100,000 solar panels for the city and the state is preparing to build the world&apos;s biggest solar generating facility in the Gobi desert.  Joss Garman Activist      Joss Garman, 22 and just out of university, has been a British environmental activist for eight years. Dubbed the &quot;new Swampy&quot;, he has been arrested more than 20 times and helped set up Plane Stupid, a direct action group which in its short-haul life has infuriated airline companies and airports, disrupted the transport select committee and shut down easyJet&apos;s London offices. BAA tried to stop Garman and others organising the climate change camp at Heathrow last summer, but the camp went ahead and Garman demonstrated elsewhere. He was nominated by George Monbiot and Philip Pullman as one of the activists of the future. &quot;He&apos;s now a campaigner at Greenpeace, though he&apos;s only about 12,&quot; Monbiot says. Craig VenterGeneticist Craig Venter is often referred to as a &quot;maverick&quot; scientist, with the implication that he is a rogue, a bad boy of biology. Yet it is the strict dictionary definition of the word that suits him best: a person of independent or unorthodox views. And when it comes to addressing the world&apos;s environmental problems, that may be just what we need. As the head of various firms and institutes, some public and some private, Venter has ambitious plans for the planet. By harnessing the power of microbes that his scientists have discovered deep in the sea and under the ground, he thinks we could revolutionise fuel production and bring down emissions. Venter has put his army of bugs to work on everything from renewable supplies of energy-rich gases such as methane, to advanced biofuels that don&apos;t threaten food production and could be used to fuel aeroplanes. One has the ability to turn the carbon dioxide into methane; it could be put to work converting CO2 captured from coal power plants and stored underground. &quot;You could pump the CO2 down, convert it into methane and burn it all over again,&quot; he says. Another turns coal into natural gas, speeding up what is essentially a natural process and reducing both the energy needed to extract the fossil fuel and the amount of pollution caused when it is burned. &quot;Theoretically, there&apos;s no limit to what we&apos;re doing,&quot; Venter says. &quot;Most people working on these problems talk about linear progress. I like to think in terms of exponential patterns of change.&quot; He talks of hundreds of thousands of biological refineries spread across nations, each churning out green replacements for fossil fuels. &quot;It&apos;s the sheer volume we&apos;re talking about with oil, gas and coal that makes the problem so large. But what I&apos;ve made work really well is massively parallel processes [a system of linked computers tackling problems on a super scale]. Now I would like to apply that to fuel production.&quot; A former high-school drop-out, surf bum and Vietnam veteran, Venter earned his reputation for working outside the boundaries of conventional science with his efforts earlier this decade to decode the entire human genetic code, the genome. At the time, scientists believed that deciphering this alphabet soup of genes would unleash a revolution in medicine. Venter agreed, and saw commercial as well as medical gain. He envisaged a giant DNA database that drugs companies would pay to search through, and led a company aiming to do just that. His vision clashed with a publicly funded scientific initiative to sequence the genome and make the information available for free, led by numerous Nobel prize-winners. The acrimonious race that ensued was eventually declared a draw, though Venter&apos;s notoriety was complete when he subsequently revealed that most of the DNA his team had decoded was, in fact, his own. Venter is not giving up his human genomics work, but says that he is now drawn to environmental problems by their urgency - and by the rapidity with which he thinks he can find solutions. Rather than the two decades or so it can take to bring a drug to market, he envisages his modified micro-organisms producing commercial fuels within just a few years. Recently, Venter has spent much of his time cruising the world&apos;s oceans, sifting them for useful microbes, and was distressed by what he found. &quot;Not a day went by when we didn&apos;t see huge amounts of plastic trash in the water. We&apos;re treating the planet as our toilet and we think when we flush the chain the problems disappear, but they don&apos;t. We have to find ways to change.&quot; One of Venter&apos;s more controversial suggestions for tackling environmental problems involves a synthetic lifeform. Not content with setting existing microbes to work, he wants to create an artificial bacterium, with genes, traits and abilities introduced from beyond nature&apos;s catalogue. He hopes to announce its creation next year, a step forward that will place him firmly back in the spotlight. &quot;We need advances in every field,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re not going to come up with a miracle solution - we&apos;ll need thousands or tens of thousands of solutions.&quot;  Henry Saragih Union leader and farmer  Henry Saragih is a small farmer who has hardly seen his wife and children in 15 years since taking on the Indonesian government and the palm oil barons of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Companies with links to government are devastating vast areas of Indonesia and southeast Asia to grow palm oil to supply Europe&apos;s cars and kitchens with biofuel and cooking oils, and Saragih is one of the few people standing in their path. Not only does he lead a union of several million agitated Indonesian peasants, but he also heads Via Campesina, the global movement of increasingly militant peasant farmers which campaigns for land reform in 80 countries. Saragih and his colleagues are lobbying the UN and the World Trade Organisation. How this struggle plays out in the next 20 years will determine whether there is any rainforest left intact south-east Asia in 50 years&apos; time, and possibly the political future of many developing countries.  Eric Rey Bioscientist  Eric Rey is not a natural ally of the broad green movement, at least in Europe. He leads a biotechnology company, Arcadia, that develops GM crops. One of his biggest customers is Monsanto. Yet Arcadia&apos;s GM technology could help the fight against climate change. Its plants are engineered to require less nitrogen fertiliser, so lowering emissions of nitrous oxide - a greenhouse gas some 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. World agriculture accounts for 17% of industrial greenhouse gas emissions, more than the transport sector. Arcadia&apos;s first commercial crop could be rice. Swapping global rice supply to the GM version, the company says, would save the equivalent of 50 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.  Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg Statistician      Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, 42, has become an essential check and balance to runaway environmental excitement. In 2004, the Dane made his name as a green contrarian with his bestselling book The Skeptical Environmentalist, and outraged scientists and green groups around the world by arguing that many claims about global warming, overpopulation, energy resources, deforestation, species loss and water shortages are not supported by analysis. He was accused of scientific dishonesty, but cleared his name. He doesn&apos;t dispute the science of climate change, but questions the priority it is given. He may look increasingly out of step, but Lomborg is one of the few academics prepared to challenge the consensus with credible data. Gavin Schmidt Climatologist  Gavin Schmidt, 38 and British, is a climate modeller at the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. He founded RealClimate.org with colleagues in 2004. Offering &quot;climate science from climate scientists&quot;, the site has quickly become a must-read for interested amateurs, and a perfect foil to both the climate sceptic misinformation that saturates sections of the web and the overexcitement of the claims of some environmentalists. Unapologetically combative, technical and high-brow, the site and its contributors - essentially blogging in their spare time - nail the myth that scientists struggle to communicate their work. Whenever a major flaw is pointed out in the global consensus on climate change, or new evidence is discovered to blame it on the sun, it is always worth checking RealClimate. The site has a policy of not getting dragged into the political or economic aspects of science, but it&apos;s fairly easy to guess which side it&apos;s on. Rajendra SinghWater conservationist In 1984 Dr Rajendra Singh, now 49, was working in the semi-desert Indian state of Rajastan. He planned to set up health clinics in the rural villages, but was shocked when he went to a place called Gopalpura. &quot;This area was devastated and people were fleeing, leaving their children, women and older people behind,&quot; Singh says. &quot;It was then an old man told me that they needed neither medicines nor food. He said all they needed was water. &quot;It moved me so much and I started finding out ways to help. But the region was arid, all the rivers were dry and the land was parched. The only source of water was rainwater, but that was scarce and there was not nearly enough for all the needs of the region.&quot; A mix of modern technology and villagers simply neglecting traditional ways of conserving water had led to an ecological disaster. Singh found that the villages no longer used small earth dams - or johads - to collect surface water but instead now relied on &quot;modern&quot; tube wells. As they bored their wells deeper and deeper into the ground and sucked out ever more underground water, so the water table had dropped alarmingly and ever deeper wells were required. Lower water levels meant that the wells were not full, the forests and trees were dying off, and erosion was worsening. It was a vicious circle. With less irrigation water, farming declined and men migrated to cities for work. Women and children then had to spend up to 10 hours a day fetching firewood and water, and the shrinking labour force sapped people&apos;s will to maintain the old johads. The whole region faced disaster. Singh and his colleagues began digging out an old johad pond in Gopalpura. Seven months later, it was, almost miraculously, nearly five feet full of water. And once the rains eventually came, not only did it fill to the brim, but a nearby long-dry well began flowing again. The following year, the village joined in to rebuild a second dam, and by 1996 Gopalpurans had recreated nine johads that between them held millions of litres of water. Meanwhile, the groundwater level had risen to 6.7m, up from an average of 14m below the ground. The village wells were full again. &quot;It was only due to political reasons that the [johad] system fell apart,&quot; Singh says. &quot;We worked for four years in Gopalpura and slowly a huge area turned green. People came back, they started farming again and the visual impact was so impressive that people from adjoining areas started calling us for help.&quot; Singh is now known as the Rain Man of Rajastan, having brought water back to more than 1,000 villages and got water to flow again in all five major rivers in Rajastan. He has so far helped to build more than 8,600 johads and other structures to collect water for the dry seasons. The forest cover has increased by a third because the water table has risen, and antelope and leopard have returned to the region. It has also been one of the cheapest regenerations of a region ever known - in Rajastan, villages have been brought back to life sometimes for just a few hundred pounds, far less than the cost of the single borehole that almost destroyed them. &quot;See the earth like a bank,&quot; Singh says. &quot;If you make regular deposits of water, you&apos;ll always have some to withdraw. If you are just taking, you will have nothing in your account.&quot; Erratic rains and longer droughts are becoming more frequent around the world with changing weather patterns and climate change, and the lessons taught by Singh in Rajastan are now being applied all over India and Africa. In the next 30 years, water &quot;harvesting&quot; is expected to become an essential way to save water everywhere from England to Uganda and Arizona. In south-east England, there is barely enough rainfall now, let alone for the expected population within 20 years. Procedures likely to be introduced will include gadgets that ensure you can&apos;t leave a running tap, baths that hold less water, gutters that collect water, systems for using waste water for gardens. &quot;It&apos;s the same principle everywhere, but we all have to learn it,&quot; Singh says.  Ken Livingstone London mayor     Ken Livingstone. Photograph: Michael Stephens/PA    Ken Livingstone, 62, has dragged the capital to the top of the major world cities&apos; environment league. He shocked the more timid Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when he set an ambitious 60% CO2 reduction target by 2025 - and now he is championing renewables, energy from waste, heat and power systems, and ways Londoners can adapt their homes. The capital has seen a huge increase in cycling, and from this month most of the city&apos;s public buildings will be &quot;retrofitted&quot; to save energy. It&apos;s beginning to work, he says: four years ago, more than one in three Londoners used their cars every day; now few er than one in five do. But he can do little about airports. Almost one-third of London emissions come from City airport and Heathrow, and there are plans for both to nearly double in size. He was nominated by Jonathan Porritt. Ken Yeang Architect  Ken Yeang, 59, is the world&apos;s leading green skyscraper architect. In the tropics especially, high-rises are traditionally the most unecological of all buildings, often wasting up to 30% more energy than lower structures built with the same materials. Yeang uses walls of plants, photo voltaics, scallop-shaped sunshades, advanced ventilation and whatever he can to collect water and breezes. The idea is to make buildings run as complete ecosystems with little external energy supply. He&apos;s not there yet, but the possibility of the green skyscraper is developing fast as ecological imperatives filter into the consciousness of the startlingly backward world of international architecture.  Massoumeh Ebtekar Politician  Appointed Iran&apos;s first woman vice-president by President Khatami in 1997, Massoumeh Ebtekar, 47, later became an inspired environment minister. She made a name for herself in 1979 as the 19-year-old revolutionary student who became chief interpreter in the 444-day US embassy siege in Tehran. She left government office in 2005, is now a Tehran city councillor and heads the Centre for Peace and the Environment. Anything green has taken a back seat since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took power, and Iran&apos;s cities are choked with incredible pollution - but because of Ebtekar there are now thousands of environment groups led by women seeking change. &apos;We need to put spiritual and ethical values into the political arena... You don&apos;t see the power of love, you don&apos;t see the power of the spirit, and as long as that goes on, the environment is going to be degraded and women are going to be in very difficult circumstances,&quot; she says.  Rebecca Hosking Camera operator  Rebecca Hosking, 33, is the young BBC camerawoman who went to an atoll in Hawaii, found wildlife dead or dying after ingesting bits of plastic, and returned to the small town of Modbury in Devon with a fine film, and a desire to try to ban plastic bags. In May 2007, the town became the first in Europe to go plasticfree and since then at least 80 other places have decided to follow suit. London Councils, the umbrella group for 33 local authorities, aims to reduce the 4bn plastic bags sent to landfill from the capital each year and has proposed a law that would force shoppers to use their own bags or buy reusable ones at the tills. Hosking has clearly tapped into a new public mood and has found that there is no need to wait for governments to effect change. Just do it yourself. Wangari MaathaiEnvironmentalist      No one can doubt the persuasive powers of Wangari Maathai, Nobel peace prize-winner and 67-year-old former assistant minister of the environment in Kenya. It is she who has coaxed the Mexican army, Japanese geishas, French celebrities, 10,000 Malaysian schools, the president of Turkmenistan and children in Rotherham to roll up their sleeves, dig a hole and plant a tree. It was an off-the-cuff remark of hers in 2006 that led to this far-flung initiative. She was in the US accepting an award when a businessman told her that his company was planning to plant a million trees. Jokingly, Maathai, who has spent most of a lifetime planting saplings, responded, &quot;That&apos;s great. But what we really need is to plant one billion trees.&quot; The UN - and the Green Belt Movement Maathai founded among African women - picked up the challenge. In just over a year, in one of the largest mobilisations of people for a cause since the Asian tsunami, 1.5bn trees have been planted in nearly 50 countries, and a further billion more are pledged. Countries have fallen over themselves to plant the most and be linked with Maathai: Indonesia planted 79m in a day; Turkey says it has planted 500m, Mexico 250m, and India says that it will replant six million hectares of degraded forest. Many of these saplings may not survive more than a few weeks, and the numbers are not to be trusted, but the billion tree campaign shows that Maathai - a professor of biology and mother of three children - has gone from being almost unknown in 2003 to a global treasure in just a few years. There is now barely a president or prime minister in Europe, Asia or Africa who has not invited Maathai to endorse their plans or tried to sign her up as a goodwill ambassador to show off their newfound enthusiasm for the environment. She has addressed the UN general assembly, carried the flag at the Olympic games, and received sackfuls of citations and awards. Maathai has succeeded in putting deforestation high on the agenda in developing countries, just as Al Gore made people in rich countries aware of climate change. She has made tree planting an act of transformation in which everyone can engage. &quot;The planting of trees is the planting of ideas,&quot; Maathai says. &quot;By starting with the simple step of digging a hole and planting a tree, we plant hope for ourselves and for future generations. &quot;The first steps were really to talk to women,&quot; she explains, &quot;and to convince them that we could do something about their environment. They didn&apos;t have firewood, they didn&apos;t have clean drinking water and they didn&apos;t have adequate food. A tree brings transformation.&quot; Maathai has also made it a political act. Like many others in developing countries, she has been beaten up, arrested and imprisoned for speaking out against environmental destruction, government oppression and abuse of human rights. &quot;When we were beaten up, it was because we were telling the government not to interfere with the forests,&quot; she says. &quot;We were confronted by armed police and guards who physically removed us from the forests as we sought to protect these green spaces from commercial exploitation.&quot; While Maathai is feted abroad as the first African woman Nobel laureate, she has always had a rocky time at home with party politics. She tried to stand for president in 1997, but her party withdrew her candidacy. She was finally elected an MP in 2002 with a 98% vote, but just before Christmas she failed to win even a nomination from the ruling party for the end-of-year election. Maathai&apos;s strength now lies in what she stands for. &quot;If I have learned one thing,&quot; she says, &quot;it is that humans are only part of this ecosystem - when we destroy the ecosystem, we destroy ourselves, for on its survival depends our own.&quot;  Peter Garrett Politician      Peter Garrett, 54, is the former punk lead singer of the disbanded Australian rock group Midnight Oil, who continued his weird journey from radical muso to establishment politician when he was appointed Australia&apos;s environment minister in November. He began with gigs outside Exxon offices and protests at the Sydney Olympics about Aboriginal rights, and found himself labelled a turncoat by some at the election. However, he was nominated here by Jonathon Porritt, for being &quot;instrumental in shaping the Australian Labour party&apos;s climate change and environment policies&quot;. Within days of his taking office, Australia signed up to the Kyoto climate change treaty, and has broken with the obstructivist policies of President Bush. Jockin Arputham Urban activist  Jockin Arputham, 60, has lived in a slum outside Mumbai since 1963. As president of the National Slum Dwellers Association and Slum Dwellers International, he is rallying the world&apos;s poorest city dwellers to improve their environment. Urban squalor is one of the biggest problems of the age, and by 2030 the number of slum dwellers is projected to reach two billion - a recipe for poverty, disease and political instability. Arputham has pioneered a way to help the poor negotiate with city authorities to secure land ownership - the greatest barrier to improving slums. Dozens of other new urban groups are working in 70 countries and hundreds of thousands of people have benefited. Global urbanisation is inevitable, and these new federations will have more and more ecological influence.  Hermann Scheer Politician  Hermann Scheer, 43, is the MP who persuaded the German government to get rid of nuclear power and invest heavily in renewables such as wind and solar power. As a result, in less than 10 years, Germany is heading towards selfsufficiency in energy. His greatest success has been a &quot;feed in tariff law&quot;. This forces power companies to buy electricity generated by the public at more than triple market prices; 300,000 homeowners, farmers and small businesses have leapt in and started selling. Nearly 3% of Germany&apos;s electricity now comes from the sun. Spain, Portugal, Greece, France and Italy are all now introducing their version of Scheer&apos;s law and pressure is building in Britain and other countries.  Mohammed Valli Moosa Civil servant  Mohammed Valli Moosa, 50, was South Africa&apos;s environment minister from 1999 to 2004. He has campaigned for transnational African &quot;Peace Parks&quot; for wildlife and pushed for reduced use of plastic bags. But he may play a much greater role in the global environment debate as chairman of Eskom, the state-owned power company that runs South Africa&apos;s only nuclear plant and, starting in 2008, is hoping to build dozens of fourth-generation small-scale nuclear stations. Known as pebble bed modular reactors, these are smaller, cheaper and reportedly safer than other designs and Valli Moosa says they could be the base of the 21st eco-economy - ideally for desalination plants and creating the raw material for the heralded but slow to appear hydrogen economy. South Africa has some of the world&apos;s greatest reserves of uranium: put them with the technology and it could start looking like a superpower. Aubrey MeyerMusician and activist Can a 60-year-old South African violinist living in a flat in Willesden, north London, actually change the world? It&apos;s a serious question because the odds are increasing that over the next two years rich and poor countries will come round to Aubrey Meyer&apos;s way of thinking if they are to negotiate a half-decent global deal to reduce climate change emissions. Nearly 20 years ago, Meyer devised what he believed was the only logical way through the political morass dividing rich and poor countries on climate change. After a letter from him was published in the Guardian, he gave up playing professional music to set up the tiny Global Commons Institute in his bedroom. There he developed the idea that not only did everyone on earth have an equal right to emit CO2, but that all countries should agree to an annual per capita ration or quota of greenhouse gases. That was the easy bit. But then the musician, who had played with the LPO and had written for the Royal Ballet, went further. Meyer proposed that each country move progressively to the same allocation per inhabitant by an agreed date. This meant that rich countries would have steadily to cut back their emissions, while poor ones would be allowed steadily to grow theirs, with everyone eventually meeting in the middle at a point where science said the global maximum level of emissions should be set. He called it &quot;contraction and convergence&quot; (C&amp;C). Meyer is nothing if not determined. Since 1990, earning next to nothing and sometimes practically begging for money so he could lobby international meetings, he has pressed C&amp;C at every level of global government. Early opposition came from British civil servants, who said it was akin to communism, and major environmental groups, which were ideologically opposed to any kind of trading emissions. For many years the US government had no interest in any such deal. But the climate stakes have risen with every new scientific report, and the politicians and environment groups have moved on. As the urgency for a global agreement has grown, so C&amp;C has emerged as one of the favourites to break the international impasse. &quot;Its advantage is that it is far simpler and fairer than the Kyoto agreement, which applied only to a few rich countries,&quot; Meyer says. It also allows science to set the optimum level of emissions; it gets round long-standing US objections that poor countries should be part of a global agreement; and it is inherently pro-business, because it encourages rich and poor countries to trade emissions between themselves. The long years of single-minded lobbying mean that Meyer&apos;s idea now has some powerful backers, including, in Britain, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution; 180 MPs have supported it in an early day motion, and the government, equivocal so far, is moving towards a version of it. It has become official policy in India, China and most African countries. Germany and India are expected to run with it in UN meetings. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has backed C&amp;C publicly. Other proposals are emerging and it will take two more years to thrash out a system that will please everyone. But few have the elegance of C&amp;C. &quot;It&apos;s the least unfair of all the proposals that have been put forward,&quot; Meyer says. &quot;It secures survival by correcting both fatal poverty and fatal climate change in the same arrangement.&quot; Writing music and calculating emissions have a lot in common, he says. &quot;Look at a sheet of music and you would not know what it was. But when you hear it played, then it&apos;s beautiful. Equally, when you read the calculations on countries&apos; gases, they mean nothing. But when you work out how you can reduce them, it&apos;s clear that it&apos;s the best thing for humanity.&quot; Meyer still plays the violin every day, but seldom with an orchestra. &quot;I just did not realise that it would take quite so long to change the world,&quot; he says.  Monica Howe Bike activist  Monica Howe, 31, is the sharp end of the grassroots debate in Los Angeles, the global car culture&apos;s smog- choked, road-raged, increasingly grid locked spiritual home. Her Bicycling Coalition group is remapping the megalopolis&apos;s mean and potholed streets by forging bike routes, organising cycle rallies, helping fledgling cyclists overcome traffic fears, and challenging the mindset at City Hall, where cyclists tend to be greeted with disbelief. Howe says membership is rising, and cyclists are pedalling into the cityscape as public attitudes, swayed by concerns about air quality, traffic congestion and global warming, begin to shift. She&apos;s no Al Gore, but she is winning the battle for American hearts and minds, despite the overwhelming odds.  Al Gore Politician      More force of nature than wooden presidential candidate now, Al Gore&apos;s reinvention as Mr Climate Change is based on a long-standing passion for the environment. As a boy he worked on his family&apos;s farm, as a young congressman in the 70s he held the first hearings on greenhouse gases, and shortly before becoming Bill Clinton&apos;s vice-president in 1992, he wrote a bestselling clarion call - Earth In The Balance. And despite or because of the hanging chads debacle in 2000, he is still beating the drum. It was his Oscar-winning slideshow-cum-documentary An Inconvenient Truth, that helped gain him a half-share in the 2007 Nobel peace prize, and he can be heard tirelessly lecturing around the world (at a reported $100,000 a throw). His latest book, The Assault On Reason, takes swipes at the media, cowardly politicians and the Bush administration. But his speech last month at Bali, where he managed to criticise the US without saying it should commit to anything, shows that, at 59, he remains a politician at heart. Chris Tuppen Businessman Chris Tuppen, BT&apos;s head of sustainable development, wrote the company&apos;s first environmental report in 1992. Since then his lead has been followed by thousands of other companies, yet BT has managed to stay one step ahead. It was a pioneer in buying electricity from renewable sources and has cut down on travel. Last year the company announced it would build its own windfarms to help meet its mammoth demand for electricity, and published a set of ambitious targets which include reductions in the carbon footprints of its employees. Chief is a pledge to slash its greenhouse gas emissions within a decade to 80% below what they were in 1996. BT is an example of how being green pays: the company says its efforts have saved more than \u00a3119m in power bills since 1991.  Dieter Salomon Mayor of Freiburg  Freiburg in southern Germany is the most ecologically-aware town in Europe and possibly the rich world. The city of 250,000 people dubs itself a &quot;solar region&quot; and gathers nearly as much power from the sun as is collected in all of Britain. It&apos;s stacked with research establishments and its solar firms employ thousands of people. It is also the playground of architect Rolf Disch, who builds houses that need to be heated for only a week each year and whose cost is paid for by the electricity generated by the panels on their roofs. Salomon, 47, says that by 2010, at least 10% of all the energy consumed in Freiburg will come from renewables. To attain this, a huge area of the city centre has been turned into a pedestrian zone and there are 500km of bike paths. More than a third of all journeys are made by bike, and there are fewer than 200 parking places for cars in the centre compar ed with 5,000 for bikes. The snag? The quality of life is so good in Freiburg that too many people want to live there and it&apos;s hard for anyone to buy a house. Bija DeviFarm manager Bija Devi saves seeds for future generations. She already has in her &quot;bank&quot; 1,342 types of cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables, though she has no idea of their scientific names. She has worked as a farmer since the age of seven, never went to school and has never heard the words &quot;wheat&quot; or &quot;turnip&quot;. Yet she now heads a worldwide movement of women trying to rescue and conserve crops and plants that are being pushed to extinction in the rush to modernise farming. And in so doing she is helping rejuvenate Indian culture. Apart from collecting and storing seeds from all over the country, Devi is teaching farmers, distributing seeds and experimenting with them. It&apos;s called the Navdanya (Nine Seeds) movement because it was inspired by a southern Indian custom of planting nine seeds in a pot on the first day of the year. Women would take the pots to the river nine days later to compare and exchange seeds so that each family could plant the best seeds, thus optimising food supplies. Today, Devi has farmers queueing up for seeds at her project&apos;s base, a 40-acre farm in the foothills of the Himalayas in Dehradun. When she started 14 years ago, with ecologist Vandana Shiva, she had to plead with the farmers to accept that ecological security was of fundamental importance, and that there were advantages to sowing older, indigenous seeds rather than the newer, high-yielding &quot;hybrid&quot; or GM seeds. These give larger crops but require considerable input of pesticides and fertilisers, and more water. Women are responsible for sowing, harvesting and storing food, while it is up to the men to prepare the soil. &quot;There was no tangible benefit for them in using our seeds,&quot; Devi says. &quot;But over time they realised how the soil was retaining its fertility, how the crop was free from diseases and pests. Now they come to us on their own.&quot; She now has 380 varieties of rice seeds alone. There are something like 200,000 people benefiting from 34 similar community seed banks set up in 13 states across the country. The banks are seen as an insurance against changing conditions, such as climate, new pests or consumer demand. People who receive the seeds pay nothing for them, and in return pledge to continue to save and share them. &quot;Indiscriminate use of chemicals has harmed the soil to an enormous extent,&quot; Devi says, &quot;but we can still restore fertility and conserve water if we act now.&quot; The work is backed by Dr Debal Deb, an ecologist who has established the only gene bank of indigenous rice in India. The Green Revolution was environmentally disastrous in India, he says: &quot;In the 80s, the drastic erosion of the genetic diversity of rice and other crops was irreversible. Thousands of rice varieties no longer exist in the farms where they evolved over centuries. They are extinct for good and not even accessed in the national and international gene banks.&quot; This, he says, translates into a threat to the country&apos;s food security. Collecting seeds from a large and diverse country such as India is no easy task. &quot;I depend on the traditional knowledge of the farmers and go to different corners in the region in search of new varieties,&quot; Devi says. &quot;The farmers explain the qualities of a particular strain and how to cultivate them. We then collect the seed, cultivate it on an experimental basis and note down the results. If it is satisfactory, we distribute it among the other farmers. We also need to sow the seeds regularly to continue with the strain. Today, traditional knowledge is almost lost in the euphoria over new varieties.&quot; Pan YueEnvironmental adviser Arguably, the best news of 2007 was a promise by China, the world&apos;s biggest polluter, to blaze a greener path of development rather than follow in our filthy footsteps. One of the worst was the attempted sidelining of the man who has done more than anyone to secure that promise. Pan Yue, 47, deputy director of the state environmental protection administration, has become a hero for his willingness to stand up to corporations and local governments that jeopardise public health in the rush for economic growth. In so doing, he has won the ear of the PM and president, whose political mantra of &quot;scientific development&quot; emphasises the need for sustainable, not just rapid, growth, and has helped set ambitious energy efficiency and pollution controls targets. All this has made him some powerful enemies, particularly in energy, steel and construction, who seemed to have won a victory over Pan late last year at the 17th Communist Party Congress where more business-oriented cadres were promoted, but Pan was left a deputy director and must now fight for his political life. Even so, Pan&apos;s warnings that the economic miracle will end soon because the environment can no longer keep pace have goaded China&apos;s leadership into action. He has also warned that 26% of the water in the seven biggest river systems is so polluted that it has &quot;lost the capacity for basic ecological function&quot;. The International Energy Agency estimates that China will overtake the US as the world&apos;s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by the end of next year - some say it&apos;s already done so. In November, China belatedly released a five-year plan for environmental protection, for the first time mentioning the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but it gave no targets or deadlines for doing so. &quot;Currently the conflicts between China&apos;s economic and social development and its limited environmental resources are getting more and more serious each day,&quot; the paper said. Pan Yue is on the frontline of that conflict. Given its global importance, the world - as well as China - needs him to succeed.  Ma Jun Writer and activist      Ma Jun, 39, became an environmentalist in 1997 after hearing Chinese engineers boast that the Yellow River was a model of water management, even though he knew it was so over-dammed and exploited that it failed to reach the sea on more than 200 days each year. Now he is one of a growing number of people challenging the Chinese culture of official secrecy and saving face. His website names and shames companies and local governments that violate environmental standards, and the former journalist has called to account corporate executives and Communist party cadres with pollution maps. Ma Jun set up the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, which cooperates with the central government in a non-confrontational - but highly pragmatic - campaign strategy. Despite the tight controls imposed on independent organisations by the Communist party, there are now 3,000 registered green NGOs, up from fewer than 50 five years ago. Michael Fay Conservationist  In 1999 Michael Fay, an American, set off on a 15-month 2,000-mile expedition to cross the forests of Gabon. He returned with an extraordinary set of pictures and visited President Bongo of Gabon in his New York hotel room. &quot;I showed him pictures of surfing hippos, gorillas in clearings, elephants in the forest and gorillas and chimpanzees caressing their young. The president was transported into the computer. He was there. You could see right away that he was completely blown away by what he saw. He kept asking his foreign minister, &apos;How come I don&apos;t know about these things? We must act quickly.&apos; He said, &apos;We&apos;re going to do something dramatic.&apos; &quot; Bongo set up 13 new national parks, covering more than 10,000 sq miles, thus immediately protecting 10% of the country. Fay, 51, continues to press for conservation in central Africa.  Guy Lamstaes Inventor  Guy Lamstaes and colleagues have invented a way to make fridges far more energy-efficient. Barely a few inches across and made of wax, his device had little impact until last year, when it was reinvented as a simple way to reduce household and industrial emissions. Now called the eCube, the box has taken sectors of British industry by storm, and is now doing the same in the US. It won&apos;t save the planet, but it offers a perfect example of the simple steps that can make a difference. The cube mimics food and fits around a fridge&apos;s sensor, which usually measures the temperature of the circulating air. Because air heats up more quickly than yoghurt, milk or whatever else is stored inside, this makes the fridge work harder than necessary. With the cube fitted, the fridge responds only to the food temperature, which means it turns on and off less often as the door is open and closed.  Jia Zhangke Actor/director  Jia Zhangke, 37, is among the most prominent artists raising awareness about the environment. His film Still Life, which won the 2006 Golden Lion award at Venice, is a tale of social upheaval and ecological destruction set against the backdrop of the Three Gorges Dam in China - one of the world&apos;s biggest hydroelectric projects which has forced millions of people to move. It tells the story of a man and a woman who are searching for their spouses in a town that has been flooded by the rising waters of the mighty reservoir behind the barrier. The film was passed by the Chinese censors despite its portrayal of official corruption, land seizures and thuggish violence. This is the best-known cinematic critique of the ecological destruction in China, but many other artists and film-makers are now addressing the problems of the country&apos;s breakneck race for economic growth.  Bunker Roy Educationalist  Bunker Roy, 62, set up the Barefoot College in India, the only school in the world known to be open only to people without any formal education. Roy&apos;s idea is that India and Africa are full of people with skills, traditional knowledge and practical resourcefulness who are not recognised as engineers, architects or water experts but who can bring more to communities than governments or big businesses. The college trains the poor to combine local knowledge with new green technologies : 15,000 people have learned to become &quot;barefoot&quot; water and solar engineers, architects and teachers. It has helped hundreds of communities across India - and now in seven other countries - install water supplies and solar voltaic lighting systems, develop bicycles that can cross rivers and design buildings that collect every drop of water.  Olav K\u00e5rstad Chemical Engineer  Olav K\u00e5rstad, 59, is the world&apos;s leading collector and storer of carbon dioxide. He works for Norwegian oil company Statoil which, rather than pay a carbon tax on the 1m tonnes of CO2 it produces a year, has learned to compress it into liquid form, transport it by pipeline out to sea and then inject it into deep, porous rocks, instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The plan now is to collect the exhaust gases of power stations. This could save 90% of CO2 emissions, but the snag is that it costs hundreds of millions of pounds for every station and it uses as much as 35% more energy to collect the gas, transport it and bury it. But many oil and power companies, as well as the UK, US and Australian governments, are now plunging billions of dollars into the technology which they hope will provide them with a carbon &quot;get out of jail&quot; card within 10 years.  Cormac McCarthy Writer  The Road, by the 74-year-old American writer Cormac McCarthy, imagines a father and his son trudging south through a landscape where nature and civilisation are in their death throes. It&apos;s oppressive, horrifying and poetic, and is widely seen as both a parable and the logical extension of the earth&apos;s physical degeneration. His predictions may be scientifically fanciful, but the book, published last year, may have far more influence in the next 30 years than any number of statistics and fro nt line reports. It was nominated by George Monbiot, who says, &quot;It could be the most important environmental book ever. It is a thought experiment that imagines a world without a biosphere, and shows that everything we value depends on the ecosystem.&quot; Peter HeadCivil engineer Peter Head, 60, is an unlikely man to be leading a cultural revolution. The soft-spoken Englishman, a director of Arup and one of the world&apos;s leading bridge builders, is now the master planner of the world&apos;s first true eco city. His brief from the Shanghai city authorities may have been simple, but in building and design terms it was the equivalent of a moonshot: to build on an island at the mouth of the Yangtze a city for 500,000 people that can lead the world&apos;s fastest growing economy out of the industrial age into the ecological one. Dongtan will cost $50bn or more, and be a prototype for 400 or more similar Chinese cities over the next 30 years. Nothing like this has been tried before, Head says. &quot;It&apos;s a complete paradigm shift. It is to be three, four or five times an ecological improvement on anything that exists. China is trying to use ecological efficiency to detach resource use from economic growth, the traditional development path. It&apos;s a different way of thinking. They believe a new economic model will come out of it.&quot; Dongtan will be all but self-sufficient, powered by wind, wood and sun. Its cars will be electric or hydrogen-fuelled, and its buildings will be mini power stations. There will be no landfill sites and 80% of waste will be recycled. Enough local food will be grown to supply much of the city&apos;s needs. Turf-covered rooftops will collect, filter and store water, and solar panels will heat it; wind turbines will provide nearly 20% of its energy needs. &quot;China came to us with the idea. I was shocked by the scale of their ambition but they&apos;re deadly serious. Every province in China is building a demonstration eco city like this.&quot; Other countries are catching up, too, and Head sees a 21st-century revolution gathering pace: &quot;We will look back on Dongtan and say it was a pretty crude effort, but it will be seen as a first step. It&apos;s significant but it&apos;s nothing like the answer. What will develop over the coming years is an &apos;ecological systems approach&apos; to cities, one that uses nature to get us out of the mess we&apos;re in.&quot; \u0095 Words by John Vidal, David Adam, Peter Huck, Jonathan Watts, Leo Hickman, Philip Oltermann, Ian Sample and Aditya Ghosh \u00b7 The following clarification was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday January 26 2008. George Monbiot has asked us to point out that he was one of those who was invited to submit nominations for 50 people who could save the planet, but was not a member of the adjudicating panel, contrary to the impression given in the introduction to the list.", "tags": ["Activism", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Polar regions"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-05T12:55:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/05/features16.theguide", "sentences": ["This is a sensual spy thriller set in occupied 1930s/40s Shanghai, but one that doesn&apos;t shy away from the sex."], "title": "In cinemas this weekend: Jan 05", "article": "PS I Love You (12A) (Richard LaGravenese, 2007, US) Hilary Swank, Gerard Butler, Gina Gershon, Lisa Kudrow. 126 mins. Butler plays the perfect boyfriend here. Admittedly he dies, but before he does so, he leaves a trail of letters and instructions to help his grieving ex (Swank) start a new life. Thus, Swank goes through a series of chick-flick adventures instigated from beyond the grave - fishing in Ireland, karaoke, new men. This is clearly not comfortable territory for Swank, but then the light blend of slapstick and schmaltz is not all that comfortable for the viewer either. If anyone did what Butler does in real life, you&apos;d dismiss him as a disturbed narcissist. Half Moon (NC) (Bahman Ghobadi, 2006, Aus/Fra/Iran/Iraq) Golshifteh Farahani, Ismail Ghaffari, Hedye Tehrani. 114 mins. Another unique movie from Ghobadi (Turtles Can Fly), following a Kurdish singer who&apos;s determined to cross the border into post-Saddam Iraq to perform a concert, with his 10 sons, despite a prophecy that he will come to harm. As with Gobadi&apos;s previous films, it&apos;s an accomplished exercise in magic realism, obliquely political but with Emir Kusturica-like moments of fantasy and wonder - such as a village populated by 1,334 exiled female singers. El Violin (NC) (Francisco Vargas, 2005, Mexico) Angel Tavira, Gerardo Taracena. 98 mins. Another film about an elderly musician, this one shot in black and white, and making the most of its lead actor&apos;s craggy face. Tavira won best actor at Cannes a couple of years ago for his portrayal of an aged one-armed travelling musician caught up in an unspecified civil war. When the marauding army close in on his home village, he bravely charms their captain with his fiddle in order to retrieve weapons stored on his land. There&apos;s little in the way of action, but plenty of suspense in the high-stakes cat-and-mouse games. Alice In The Cities (NC) (Wim Wenders, 1974, Ger) R\u00fcdiger Vogler, Yella Rottl\u00e4nder. 110 mins. Vintage Wenders exploring what are now his familiar themes: a blocked writer on a road trip with a nine-year-old girl, via New York, Amsterdam and Germany - all to a classic rock&apos;n&apos;roll soundtrack. Lust, Caution (18) (Ang Lee, 2007, US/Chi/Tai/HK) Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Tang Wei, Joan Chen. 157 mins. After Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, another courageous, unpredictable move from Ang Lee. This is a sensual spy thriller set in occupied 1930s/40s Shanghai, but one that doesn&apos;t shy away from the sex. Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s the type of sex critics complain you never see in movies: realistic, unsanitised and revealing about the characters, which makes this respectable viewing rather than seedy art porn. It&apos;s mostly a slow, stylised affair following an inexperienced resistance member (newcomer Tang Wei) on her mission to seduce a powerful Chinese collaborator (Tony Leung Chiu-wai). Inevitably, she develops feelings for him and compromises the plan. The pace is really too languorous to qualify this as a thriller, but there&apos;s plenty going on beneath the surface, or occasionally, in the bedroom scenes, right out in the open.

Two years later, his Lust, Caution, which has heterosexual scenes of almost unparalleled frankness for a mainstream picture, is the first major film to open in Britain in 2008. Like Brokeback Mountain, it will certainly end up on many lists of the year&apos;s 10 best. The Taiwanese-born Lee is a true auteur. While moving from genre to genre, period to period (and most of his films are set in the recent or distant past), he never appears to repeat himself, yet he constantly pursues personal themes and his films contribute to a distinctive oeuvre. One of his recurrent concerns is with people facing crises, often in changing times. Another is the generational conflict between fathers and children. The most interesting, however, is of characters forced to adopt masks, to dissemble, to conceal their true nature. This can be homosexuality (Brokeback Mountain, The Wedding Banquet), political allegiances (the superb Civil War western Ride With the Devil) or, in its most extreme form, Hulk (generally regarded as his only real failure), where the comic-book hero attempts to suppress the destructive green monster that lurks inside him. These themes come together in different ways in Lust, Caution, which, like Brokeback Mountain, is expanded from a short story by a woman writer, in this case by Chinese author Eileen Chang, who died in California 12 years ago at the age of 74. Set in Shanghai and Hong Kong between 1937 and 1942, it&apos;s a moody espionage thriller much influenced by the Hollywood film noir, particularly Alfred Hitchcock and exotic melodramas of Oriental intrigue. But events are seen entirely from the point of view of Westernised, middle-class Chinese men and women and taking place within that community. This is not the China of Pearl Buck or JG Ballard&apos;s Empire of the Sun The film&apos;s central character is Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei) who we first meet in 1942 Shanghai, posing as the sophisticated Mrs Mak Tai Tai from Hong Kong in the circle of the well-off, mahjong-playing wives of top-level Chinese collaborators living within the protected Japanese enclave. They&apos;re like the pampered wives of Nazi leaders and quislings in occupied Europe who don&apos;t inquire too closely into their husbands&apos; activities and avert their eyes from the atrocities around them. The horrors and humiliations of street life in Shanghai are as convincingly re-created as the cosmopolitan suavity that managed to carry on in wartime. We realise, however, that Wong doesn&apos;t quite belong to this milieu and that she has a covert relationship with Mr Yee (Hong Kong star Tony Leung), the local secret police chief, rooting out opponents of Wang Jingwei&apos;s collaborationist government. In a suspenseful scene, dressed in Western clothes and a hat that Sylvia Sidney would have worn in a movie of that time, she takes a taxi to a German restaurant and makes a clandestine, clearly coded phone call which we immediately recognise as a message designed to trigger off an assassination. At this exciting juncture, Lee interrupts the narrative for a flashback, lasting nearly two hours, to Shanghai four years earlier before the Japanese have established their stranglehold. Wong is now an innocent university student who&apos;s been left behind when her father left for England with her brother. Passionate about the theatre, she&apos;s invited to join a theatrical troupe run by the handsome nationalist Kuang Yu Min (Wang Leehom). Her first suggestion is that she play Nora in A Doll&apos;s House, but he insists upon staging patriotic, fund-raising plays with her as a rousing peasant heroine. She dazzles audiences, they cough up for the cause and she&apos;s on her way to a sort of stardom. But Kuang and the other leaders have a different future for her. They form an independent cell of the resistance movement and move to Hong Kong, casting her as a seductress, a honey trap for the treacherous Mr Yee, a symbolic target protected by several bodyguards. To prepare her for the role, she must lose her virginity to one of her comrades, a dislikable womaniser, though she really loves the dedicated zealot Kuang. This is essentially the plot of Hitchcock&apos;s Notorious, one of the Master&apos;s subtlest works, in which US intelligence agent Cary Grant plays on traitor&apos;s daughter Ingrid Bergman&apos;s guilt and buried patriotism to manipulate her into marrying a German spy in Rio. (Lee alerts us to this by showing Wong watching Bergman in her first Hollywood movie, Escape to Happiness.) Wong attracts the attention of Mr Yee, but before the group of inexperienced terrorists can corner its victim, its plans are rumbled. To protect themselves, they&apos;re forced into their first act of violence and there ensues an extremely messy, dragged-out murder in which these amateur conspirators discover just how difficult it can be to kill a man. In real life, we think of the protracted death of Rasputin. In movie terms, Lee would be thinking of Paul Newman trying to kill the Stasi thug in Hitchcock&apos;s Torn Curtain Wong flees from the scene only to discover, three years later, that she has an appointment with destiny in Shanghai. Kuang, now a seasoned member of the official resistance movement, draws her back into politics. Once again, she is forced into the company of the vindictive, ruthless Yee to lure him to his death. But now their relationship is consummated in ferocious sexual encounters. These acts of fearsome sadomasochistic abandon are his way of seeking oblivion, a respite from the guilt instilled by his treachery, his torture of his own people, and the certain knowledge that America&apos;s entry into the war means the defeat of Japan and his own destruction. But he also loves her. In acting out a role, the morally and emotionally involved Wong becomes, partly through their transgressive sexual intimacy, a participant in his personal tragedy. The consequences prove to be more complex and troubling than those in Notorious Lust, Caution is an excellent thriller. It is also for Lee an important inquiry into the divided lives of his parents&apos; generation. The script by Wang Hui Ling and James Schamus, Lee&apos;s American collaborator as writer and producer, is a fine piece of work. Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, whose films include Amores Perros and Brokeback Mountain, and production designer Pan Lai have given the film a mood and appearance of cool, exotic menace. The score by French composer Alexandre Desplat, who wrote the music for The Painted Veil and The Queen, is a subtle blending of East and West with neat samplings of Hoagy Carmichael&apos;s &apos;Stardust&apos; and Elgar&apos;s Enigma Variations.

The sportfest is 215 days away and for Xiang, his country&apos;s first track Olympic champion, commercial life could hardly be better. The 24-year-old can be seen racing animals in Visa commercials, popping Nutrilite dietary supplements with 100m world record holder Asafa Powell and advertising Nike trainers. Xiang is also a spokesman for Coca-Cola, one of the elite Olympic sponsors. Go anywhere in China and billboard ads from the likes of Samsung, Omega and Johnson &amp; Johnson all feature the most famous hoops in the world. Excitement at what will be China&apos;s coming out party on the world stage is mounting. The stakes are high as the business world ensures that Beijing will be the most lucrative games ever. In sports marketing it is usually for the football World Cup that multinationals sign cheques worth tens of millions, but this time, the Olympics have eclipsed it. Dan Parr, a sports marketing expert at Brand Rapport, based in Hong Kong, said: &apos;The biggest brands see this as an unparalleled opportunity to get access to one of the word&apos;s biggest marketplaces. The elite sponsors such as Coca-Cola and McDonald&apos;s see this as an opportunity to really drive home an advantage by being in the Olympics.&apos; Elite sponsors who pay more than \u00a3100m in deals structured over two or three Olympiads signed up years ago to ensure they were part of the Chinese games. They get the right to use the Olympic logo both in China and overseas for marketing purposes. A survey by Ipsos Mori showed that sponsors generate major sales uplifts compared with rivals in the year of an Olympics. The fact that north American television advertising rates rival sought-after events such as the Oscars and the Superbowl, but over a far longer period, appears to back this up. The next tier down are local sponsors and in Beijing they fall into two categories - international businesses that want to establish a better foothold in the country, such as VW or Adidas, and Chinese firms such as Sinopec, China Mobile and Bank of China. Despite the fact that local sponsors only get to use the logo in China, they still believe the games will act as a global showcase.  Sponsorship deals usually only allow one slot per sector, which is why McDonald&apos;s is the only fast-food sponsor. But Beijing has broken this protocol by allowing three beer sponsors, Budweiser, Tsingtao and Yanjing. The reason, according to the Beijing organisers, who have had praise heaped on them for maximising sponsorship revenue streams, is that the country is much too populous for one sponsor to monopolise.  Another benefit is allowing sponsors to illustrate their social or environmental credentials. Six months ago, global conservation organisation WWF and Coca-Cola announced collaboration on a new worldwide initiative to conserve water resources and replace the water used to produce its drinks in China. The move is seen as a way of addressing criticism the beverage giant has faced in India, where communities near some of its bottling plants complain that Coca-Cola depletes and pollutes their water supplies. Some tie-ups, though, have attracted concern. Several US firms, such as Honeywell, GE and IBM, have helped the authoritarian Chinese government to design and install hi-tech surveillance systems ahead of the games and the World Expo in Shanghai two years later.  With Beijing set to be the most lucrative commercial games ever, attention is now focusing on London in 2012. The capital needs to raise roughly \u00a3650m in sponsorship and has so far signed up LloydsTSB, EDF and Adidas, with Deloitte&apos;s as a second-tier sponsor, in deals totalling \u00a3230m. Some senior sports sponsorship insiders believe that London is struggling to attract the same interest as Beijing, but this is totally rejected by London&apos;s organisers. &apos;There is absolutely no question that either the domestic or international sponsorship programmes for London 2012 are going slowly or are in any way behind schedule,&apos; said a spokeswoman for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog). &apos;No other organising committee has had as many partners signed up four-and-a-half years before the games as we have.&apos; It is understood that there is a bidding war between two telecom firms over who will be a top-tier London partner. Locog will soon sign up an energy firm, thought to be BP.  The Olympics is meant to be the event in which commercial interests are banished. There is no perimeter advertising, no banner logos on sports clothing and interviews with athletes are conducted against backdrops where corporate identities are conspicuous by their absence. Despite this, competition to set business records is as strong as that for the conventional medals tables.", "tags": ["Business", "Olympic Games 2012", "Marketing & PR", "Olympics 2008", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-06T23:40:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/06/law", "sentences": ["He oversaw a number of big City deals such as the merger of Grand Metropolitan and Guinness, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank&apos;s takeover of Midland and the privatisation of British Steel."], "title": "The show's over: time to sell to the world", "article": "It is tempting to think of the Lord Mayor of London&apos;s job as pomp and circumstance and little else. The title holder is conspicuous for his flowing robes during the Lord Mayor&apos;s show and occasionally in the limelight when shaking hands with dignitaries at Mansion House, his residence near Bank tube station. He is, many argue, a mini-monarch whose realm is the City of London, and, like the Queen, is a figurehead without substantive power or influence. But David Lewis, a former senior partner at law firm Norton Rose who also hails from a long line of Welsh tenant farmers, bridles at the suggestion: &apos;Hopefully, mine is an office that can help to open doors and generate business. Only the other day, we met Lou Jiwei, head of the new Chinese sovereign wealth fund, an arm of the Chinese state with $200bn to invest.&apos; During that meeting, at Lewis&apos;s palatial offices, former governor of the Bank of England Eddie George was on hand to and answer questions from the Chinese officials accompanying Jiwei.  Lewis says: &apos;London is the world&apos;s pre-eminent financial services centre - and don&apos;t the Chinese know it. We were their first port of call.&apos;  But what does Britain get out of Jiwei&apos;s visit? &apos;In time, the Chinese will open offices in London, employing bankers, accountants and lawyers from across the capital. They will use our expertise and take advice on how to ensure that their accounts are transparent and their operations open to regulatory scrutiny, where appropriate.&apos; It is apt that Lewis is busy opening doors for the Chinese as he was born in Hong Kong in 1947, his father having fled Britain in search of work after graduating from Oxford in the year of the General Strike. Lewis senior became a colonial civil servant involved in education, working throughout the Far East. Lewis, who was 60 last month, is supportive of Chinese investment in Britain &apos;as long as it conforms to codes of best practice and is undertaken in a spirit of openness and fairness. But, unlike others, we aren&apos;t hung up about where people come from.&apos;  As Lord Mayor, Lewis is the standard bearer of the UK financial services industry which employs 1.3 million people, 200,000 of whom do not hold British passports. &apos;People come here to train and work, not least because we are an international hub for trade and can offer expertise to newly emerging economies which are rapidly industrialising. &apos;A big Indian company embarking on a major project on the subcontinent will often mandate people in London to raise capital, provide financial or audit advice and draw up contracts that apply English legal principles.&apos; Lewis gets into his stride when he points out that financial services, predominantly the City, &apos;furnish the Exchequer with 25 per cent of all corporation tax receipts and \u00a325bn towards the UK&apos;s trade balance&apos;. One of the biggest surprises of the job, which Lewis has held for two months, is how much hard work it is: &apos;I&apos;m often in the office by 7am and don&apos;t leave until midnight. I give about 900 speeches a year, while a third of my 12-month tenure is spent out of the country, selling London to the world at large, visiting places as far away as Mumbai and Sao Paulo.&apos; On the whole, this is a busier, more frenetic pace of life than when he was at Norton Rose, where he specialised in corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and flotations. He oversaw a number of big City deals such as the merger of Grand Metropolitan and Guinness, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank&apos;s takeover of Midland and the privatisation of British Steel. &apos;Working in the City, you follow a certain set of rules, broadly laid out by the Stock Exchange and, of course, you sometimes work nights and weekends when there are deals to be done,&apos; he says. &apos;But as Lord Mayor you are turning your hand from one thing to the other at a rate of knots: one moment I am talking to Korean businessmen about the merits of investing in the City, then a speech about regulation to bankers at Canary Wharf, followed by a question-and-answer session with budding entrepreneurs at one of the Square Mile&apos;s many livery halls.&apos; The position of Lord Mayor is unpaid, which means the incumbent must have savings to fall back on, although Lewis stresses that you don&apos;t have to be super-rich. Trips abroad are paid out of a special fund, partly financed by City banks. So what made Lewis want to become Lord Mayor? Not least, it was something to do when he retired from being senior partner at Norton Rose in 2003: &apos;I was 55, too young to hang up my boots; becoming Lord Mayor seemed like a good way to make a contribution.&apos;  The mayoral electoral process is somewhat laborious and steeped in ancient tradition. The first step was to become an alderman, which in Lewis&apos;s case was to be elected by around 300 people who lived in his ward around Broad Street. &apos;It meant walking into cafes and sweet shops and explaining what I was about. The Lord Mayor - unlike the mayor of the whole city, Ken Livingstone - isn&apos;t affiliated to a political party. So the pitch is quite personal, explaining what I thought I could do for the City.&apos; After a term as an alderman, an aspiring Lord Mayor must become a sheriff, a role with its roots in the eighth century, which means being elected by the City&apos;s livery companies, originally trade guilds set up in medieval times. A committee of aldermen then makes known its preferred candidate. The committee has two outside members at the moment: Sir David Clementi, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Sir Brian Williamson, former head of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. At the start of 2008, Lewis - only the eighth Welshman to hold the post in 800 years - has a big job on his hands: the credit crunch is still with us and fears are growing of a sharp economic slowdown, or even a recession. He has already been quizzed byinternational audiences about the implications of the run on Northern Rock last autumn, the first occurence in 140 years. He says: &apos;Northern Rock has been a problem, but I must stress that there are no systemic issues. The three regulators [the Treasury, Bank of England and Financial Services Authority] haven&apos;t been liaising as effectively as they should, but a great deal has been done to put things right.&apos; Lewis does not accept that the City suffers from a poor image, a place where financial excess and avarice are rampant. He is worried that ministers are moving in the wrong direction by being caught up in the backlash against the super-rich. For instance, he believes that the crackdown aimed at forcing non-UK domiciled residents to pay more tax is wrong. &apos;We don&apos;t want Greek ship owners or foreign insurance company executives to move out of London. These people bring jobs and prosperity in their wake. It would be pointless to shoot ourselves in the foot.&apos; The CV Name David Lewis Born 1947, Hong Kong Education Dragon School, St Edward&apos;s School, Oxford, and Jesus College, Oxford (MA Jurisprudence) Career 1969: articled at Norton Rose; 1979-82: managing partner at Norton Rose&apos;s Hong Kong office; 1997-2003: chairman and senior partner; Lord Mayor of London from November 2007 Family Married to Theresa; son Tom and daughter Suzannah Interests Education, Welsh rugby, travel, keeping fit and sheep farming", "tags": ["Business", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-06T23:40:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/jan/07/fitforpurpose", "sentences": ["The scheme has proved a major success with 45% of adults now taking part in exercise in Shanghai - compared to 21% in the UK."], "title": "Fit for purpose?", "article": "No doubt Gordon Brown wasn&apos;t too thrilled about David Cameron&apos;s attempt to push the Conservatives as &quot;the party of the NHS&quot;.  But there is more than a hint of deja vu about the prime minister&apos;s pledge today to make renewal of the NHS his &quot;biggest priority&quot;. The overall message of today&apos;s announcement - personalisation of care and a greater emphasis on people taking responsibility for their own health - echoes a mantra regularly bandied about by ministers in the later years of the Blair premiership. However, the major new national health screening programme announced today appears to add substance to the soundbites. The programme, which will identify patients at risk of heart disease and circulatory problems, appears to be a significant step towards turning the NHS from a service that treats the sick into one that works to improve the nation&apos;s health. Whether this is enough to save the NHS is another matter. A report by government health adviser Sir Derek Wanless, published last year, warned that the NHS budget will need to rise to \u00a3161bn by 2022 unless efficiency is improved and ill health is reduced. The signs are not looking good. It is predicted that 33% of men, 28% of women and a fifth of children will be obese by 2010 - reducing the government&apos;s chances of being able to cut health spending. With more and more studies showing Britons are overworked, stressed out and eating more fast food, more radical solutions are clearly needed. In China, rather than telling people to go to the gym, officials have brought gyms to the people. As part of a national fitness campaign prior to this year&apos;s Olympics, China now has more than 37m square metres of outdoor gyms. The scheme has proved a major success with 45% of adults now taking part in exercise in Shanghai - compared to 21% in the UK. So far there&apos;s just one scheme in the UK - in Newham, east London, where people can freely use gym equipment in the open air. The equipment is much sturdier than that found in traditional gyms, which should hopefully make it resistant to vandalism. But perhaps the British weather, fear of embarrassment - and antisocial behaviour - may hinder the expansion of &quot;playgrounds for adults&quot; over here.", "tags": ["Health", "Society", "Fitness", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-07T12:36:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/07/advertising.mediabusiness", "sentences": ["BBH, which has offices in London, Singapore, Sao Paulo, New York, Shanghai and Toyko, is expanding into India later this year."], "title": "Senior staff shuffle at ad agency BBH", "article": "Nigel Bogle, co-founder and group chief executive of BBH, is to move into a group chairman role as part of a senior management rejig at the 25-year-old agency.

The winners will be announced at the annual ceremony at the Royal Opera House in a month&apos;s time, but the appearance of the Joe Wright-directed Atonement in every category in which it could be given an award is, to say the least, striking. It could come away with nothing, although that is unlikely, and its appearance in longlists does not mean it will make the cut in shortlists revealed next Wednesday. The film, which stars Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, also has seven nominations in this weekend&apos;s Golden Globes - the traditional guide to which way the Oscar wind is blowing. The other notable winner in the longlists is a film British audiences have yet to see: Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s There Will Be Blood, with its titanic central performance from Daniel Day Lewis and its memorable original score by Radiohead&apos;s Jonny Greenwood, features 13 times. Tim Burton&apos;s Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, another film we will see soon, was described by one critic as the best ever musical film. Surprisingly, it has not been listed in the best film category, but it has got nine other nominations, including for its leads Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter. Control, the Joy Division biopic which was top of many people&apos;s lists of British film of the year, features 10 times, including nominations for its lead Sam Riley and director Anton Corbijn. Hollywood action blockbusters are led by Paul Greengrass&apos;s spy thriller The Bourne Ultimatum, which has eight nominations. Many people&apos;s money for surprise success will be on Ang Lee&apos;s Lust, Caution, which was released at the weekend. Set in Japanese-occupied Shanghai and Hong Kong during the second world war it is a long and beautiful movie. It has 10 nominations, including one for the newcomer Tang Wei in the leading actress category. The longlist is good news for Britain&apos;s most successful film production company Working Title, which gets 31 nominations. As well as being behind Atonement, it was responsible for Elizabeth: The Golden Age, with 13 nominations, and Hot Fuzz, which is nominated in the best original screenplay category. One of the most fiercely-contested categories may be best supporting actress, a list of 15 which features four stars from Atonement: Brenda Blethyn, Romola Garai, Saoirse Ronan and Vanessa Redgrave. Tim Bevan, co-chairman of Working Title, said they were delighted by the nominations. &quot;With such strong British contenders ... in all categories, it is looking like a great year for British film and the British film industry.&quot;", "tags": ["UK news", "Film", "Baftas 2008", "Culture", "Baftas", "Joe Wright", "Film adaptations", "Books", "Atonement"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-08T10:57:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/09/yearofthechinamodel", "sentences": ["Exciting new buildings, designed by the world&apos;s most famous architects, will make Beijing and Shanghai look like models of 21st century modernity."], "title": "Year of the 'China model'", "article": "It will be China&apos;s year in 2008. The Olympic games - no doubt perfectly organised, without a protester, homeless person, religious dissenter, or any other kind of spoilsport in sight - will probably bolster China&apos;s global prestige. While the American economy gets dragged down further in a swamp of bad property debts, China will continue to boom. Exciting new buildings, designed by the world&apos;s most famous architects, will make Beijing and Shanghai look like models of 21st century modernity. More Chinese will be featured in annual lists of the world&apos;s richest people. And Chinese artists will command prices at international art auctions that others can only dream of. To come back from near destitution and bloody tyranny in one generation is a great feat, and China should be saluted for it. But China&apos;s success story is also the most serious challenge that liberal democracy has faced since fascism in the 1930s. This is not because China poses a great military threat - war with the United States, or even Japan, is only a fantasy in the minds of a few ultra-nationalist cranks and paranoiacs. It is in the realm of ideas that China&apos;s political-economic model, regardless of its environmental consequences, is scoring victories and looking like an attractive alternative to liberal democratic capitalism. And it is a real alternative. Contrary to what some pundits say, Chinese capitalism is not like 19th-century European capitalism. True, the European working class, not to mention women, did not have voting rights 200 years ago. But even during the most ruthless phases of western capitalism, civil society in Europe and the US was made up of a huge network of organisations independent of the state - churches, clubs, parties, societies, and associations that were available to all social classes. In China, by contrast, while individuals have regained many personal freedoms since the death of Maoism, they are not free to organise anything that is not controlled by the Communist Party. Despite communism&apos;s ideological bankruptcy, China has not changed in this regard. The China model is sometimes described in traditional terms, as though modern Chinese politics were an updated version of Confucianism. But a society where the elite&apos;s pursuit of money is elevated above all other human endeavours is a far cry from any kind of Confucianism that may have existed in the past. Still, it&apos;s hard to argue with success. If anything has been laid to rest by China&apos;s rising wealth, it is the comforting idea that capitalism, and the growth of a prosperous bourgeoisie, will inevitably lead to liberal democracy. On the contrary, it is precisely the middle class, bought off by promises of ever-greater material gains, that hopes to conserve the current political order. It may be a Faustian bargain - prosperity in exchange for political obedience - but so far it has worked. The China model is attractive not only to the country&apos;s new coastal elites, but has global appeal. African dictators - indeed, dictators everywhere - who walk the plush red carpets laid out for them in Beijing - love it. For the model is non-western, and the Chinese do not preach to others about democracy. It is also a source of vast amounts of money, much of which will end up in the tyrants&apos; pockets. By proving that authoritarianism can be successful, China is an example to autocrats everywhere, from Moscow to Dubai, from Islamabad to Khartoum. China&apos;s appeal is growing in the western world as well. Businessmen, media moguls, and architects all flock there. Could there be a better place to do business, build stadiums and skyscrapers, or sell information technology and media networks than a country without independent trade unions or any form of organised protest that could lower profits? Meanwhile, concern for human or civic rights is denigrated as outmoded, or an arrogant expression of western imperialism. There is, however, a fly in the ointment. No economy keeps growing at the same pace forever. Crises occur. What if the bargain struck between the Chinese middle classes and the one-party state were to fall apart, owing to a pause, or even a setback, in the race for material wealth? This has happened before. The closest thing, in some ways, to the China model is 19th-century Germany, with its industrial strength, its cultivated but politically neutered middle class, and its tendency toward aggressive nationalism. Nationalism became lethal when the economy crashed, and social unrest threatened to upset the political order. The same thing could happen in China, where national pride constantly teeters on the edge of belligerence towards Japan, Taiwan, and ultimately the west. Aggressive Chinese nationalism could turn lethal, too, if its economy were to falter. This would not be in anyone&apos;s interest, so we should wish China well in 2008, while sparing a thought for all the dissidents, democrats, and free spirits languishing in labour camps and prisons. We should hope that they will live to see the day when the Chinese, too, will be a free people. It might be a distant dream, but dreaming is what a New Year is all about.

There are high expectations here, with the British No1 hoping to reach his first grand slam quarter-final. The good news for Murray is that the extreme heat of the past few days, brought about by strong northerly winds blowing out of Australia&apos;s heartlands, and sparking bushfires in Victoria, appears likely to be banished by a cool front. That said, Murray, who put himself through a punishing off-season regime, looks to be one of the fittest of those beginning the new season, and that usually plays big dividends here, as Andre Agassi so often proved. Tsonga, 22, is a fine athlete with a big serve and powerful ground-strokes. However, the Frenchman has had only limited success at this level, and the variety of Murray&apos;s game should swing the match in the Scot&apos;s favour. After that the No9 seed could meet Argentinian players in successive rounds, while his possible fourth-round opponent is another Frenchman, Richard Gasquet, seeded one place higher than Murray at No8. It was Gasquet who beat Murray in Paris late last year to end his hopes of reaching the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. If Murray were to reach his first slam quarter-final, his seeded opponent would be Russia&apos;s Nikolay Davydenko, whom he beat in Doha and holds an overall 3-2 lead, having won their past three meetings. Murray spent December either punishing himself on court for hour upon hour in the Florida sunshine or sweating in the gym or the yoga studio. No wonder he feels ready - not just to reach the latter stages at Melbourne Park but to kick on to enjoy the sort of season he would have had in 2007 had he not been sidelined for nearly four months with a wrist injury. &quot;This is by far the best preparation I&apos;ve had for a season, no question,&quot; he said. &quot;I had longer than I ever had before, I did more fitness work and I had a fitness trainer with me all the time when I was training. It&apos;s definitely the longest and the hardest I&apos;ve ever prepared for a season.&quot; All that hard work shone through yesterday on the sort of day which finds out undercooked players, though overcooked might have been nearer the mark given that the temperature reached 41C (106F) in downtown Melbourne. Goodness knows what it was on court when Murray took on Ivan Ljubicic at the Kooyong Classic yesterday but the Scot showed no signs of distress. If anything he seemed to relish the chance to play three sweltering sets on Kooyong&apos;s brutally exposed show court before he has to do it for real next week. In fact Murray will never have to face anything like that sort of heat once the Australian Open gets under way, for the tournament&apos;s extreme heat policy dictates that the referee can pull players off court as soon as he decides it is too hot to play. On his say-so they go indoors - some to play under roofs on the two main showcourts, others to the air-conditioned sanctuary of the locker room to wait until the cool change blows through. There was no cool change yesterday, just unremitting heat. Though results at Kooyong are largely irrelevant, he had enough confidence in his ability to withstand the conditions that he came from a set and 0-3 down to win a meaningless match 6-7, 6-4, 6-2 against Ljubicic. Murray said: &quot;A lot of the time when you go out into a tournament with ranking points and prize money, you set your tactics on how you&apos;re going to play your opponent. Whereas for me, in a tournament like this, I go out with a goal of what I want to work on. It&apos;s not so much about deciding how you are going to beat your opponent; it&apos;s about how you are going to get your game 100% ready for next week.&quot;", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Australian Open 2008", "Australian Open", "Andy Murray", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-11T03:05:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/13/fashion.features4", "sentences": ["At school in California, Zhukova met Kristina Tang, daughter of the Shanghai Tang mogul, David Tang, and her future business partner."], "title": "How Russia's new super rich are buying cool", "article": "Meet Dasha Zhukova. Young, gorgeous, ridiculously wealthy in her own right (thanks to her father&apos;s massive fortune) and the girlfriend of one of the wealthiest men in the world, the owner of Chelsea FC, Roman Abramovich. Zhukova, 26, is something else, too: a major force in the fashion world. Her label, Kova &amp; T, sells in over 70 stores around the world and Zhukova rides the vanguard of a new style revolution - post-Soviet glamazons with a mission to prove that Russians are the biggest and best luxury consumers on the planet. Russians don&apos;t do things by halves. In the mid-1990s Russia&apos;s nouveaux riches gained a reputation for their fascination with diamonds, logos and head-to-toe &apos;total-look&apos; designer dressing. Fast forward a decade: sick and tired of its vulgar reputation, Russia&apos;s elite wants a makeover. Tom Ford approves. &apos;Russia is a country with a long history for a great appreciation of luxury and in a sense it&apos;s just been put away for a while,&apos; he said recently. &apos;It is something that&apos;s in the hard drive of Russian people, in the same way that it is for Italians.&apos; So Russian style is being redefined and Dasha Zhukova is leading the backlash against post-Soviet flashiness. Her label (the Kova is from Zhukova, the T is from Dasha&apos;s design partner, Kristina Tang) is the &apos;casual luxury&apos; brand that took the US by storm in 2006. It went on sale here, at Harvey Nichols, at the end of last year. Zhukova is proud to be Russian but is adamant that she&apos;s &apos;not a stereotypical Russian living in London&apos; - because that&apos;s still a negative, vulgar thing to be. Based in London, but constantly travelling through Miami, LA, New York, Paris and Moscow, she speaks perfect English with a transatlantic drawl. &apos;Moscow is in a state where it&apos;s transforming from the overly put-together look to something a bit more casual,&apos; she says. &apos;That&apos;s why my line has done so well in Russia. People just want to wear a T-shirt and a pair of jeans instead of buying the whole look from Gucci&apos;s latest collection.&apos; Zhukova is typical of a new breed of international young Russian entrepreneurs. She has power and influence and a celebrity draw: Camilla Fayed is a friend, Drew Barrymore and the Olsen twins are devotees of her clothing line, Razorlight played at her latest party. She left the USSR in 1990 at the age of nine when her mother Elena, a microbiologist, was offered a job at UCLA in Los Angeles. Her parents split when she was three. Her billionaire father Alexander Zhukov, an associate of Abramovich, continued to manage his property empire between London and Moscow. At school in California, Zhukova met Kristina Tang, daughter of the Shanghai Tang mogul, David Tang, and her future business partner. The pair launched Kova &amp; T in 2005. The label - which includes jeans, T-shirts, miniskirts, leather shorts and strapless dresses - was picked up by more than 50 stores in the US, including Henri Bendel in New York. Last November Kova &amp; T launched in London and will be stocked by Harrods from this coming May. Zhukova fell into fashion by accident: &apos;It was the summer after I graduated from university in the US and I started spending time in Russia. The idea for Kova &amp; T came as a result of us doing a charity fashion show in Moscow in 2003. We were trying to find a &quot;clean&quot; pair of jeans we could embellish. We couldn&apos;t find any jeans without a very big logo. Once we got into the process it turned out to be very complicated so we thought, &quot;Why don&apos;t we try to sell this?&quot;&apos; Dasha Skinny jeans at \u00a3100 are a sell-out in Moscow and Kova &amp; T&apos;s \u00a380 black leggings have already been re-ordered at Harvey Nichols. Zhukova has replaced rags-to-riches supermodel Natalia Vodianova as every Russian girl&apos;s fashion idol. &apos;Lots of young girls come in and say, &quot;We just want to look like Dasha&quot;,&apos; says Moscow&apos;s boutique queen Aizel Trudel, 29. These girls are desperate to feature on Moscow&apos;s best-dressed list, alongside such women as Lidia Aleksandrova, the owner of several designer stores, with a penchant for Lanvin and Alexander McQueen; fitness diva Olga Sloutsker, who runs a chain of gyms; Gorbachev&apos;s socialite daughter Irina Virganskaya and granddaughter Ksenya; and Polina Deripaska, wife of \u00a38 billion aluminium baron Oleg Deripaska. A new arrival on the scene is Svetlana Medvedeva, Russia&apos;s first lady-in-waiting (husband Dmitry is tipped to win the presidential election in March). Medvedeva is a close friend of society designer Valentin Yudashkin and an ardent supporter of flamboyant Russian haute couture. Many young Russian girls dream of becoming socialites, oligarchs&apos; wives or fashion designers. Kira Plastinina has achieved two of these three ambitions - but at 15 she is a bit young to be married. Her father Sergei Plastinin owns Russia&apos;s biggest dairy and juice company and has amassed a fortune of \u00a3350 million. Plastinina - dubbed the leading light of the new &apos;spoilt bratski&apos; generation - opened a chain of shops last year with a gift of \u00a350 million from her father. She is now the official designer for the hugely popular TV show, Star Factory, Russia&apos;s X Factor. With prices from around \u00a350, Kira Plastinina&apos;s clothes are aimed at the burgeoning middle class, who shop in Moscow&apos;s evolving high street at branches of Topshop, Mango and Zara. Obviously, most of Russia is poor: the average salary is \u00a36,500 a year, according to Russian state figures, but a growing number of young people in the capital earn far more than this. (According to the World Bank, real incomes in Russia have grown by 65 per cent in the past 10 years - but they put the average national income at closer to \u00a32,000.) Young Moscow, however, has a high disposable income: \u00a320,000 a year is considered a respectable salary for a young middle-class professional in their 20s or 30s. Those working for international companies will earn far more. In real terms a salary like this in Moscow goes further than a Western salary of the same amount because many families still own property from the Soviet era and don&apos;t pay rent or mortgages. In this climate Kira Plastinina already sells over 40,000 items a month in her 15 Moscow stores and outlets in 12 other cities across Russia. Her father recently paid Paris Hilton \u00a31 million to attend his daughter&apos;s Moscow catwalk show. The company now has its eye on the US and has been watching the progress of Kova &amp; T across the globe with interest. Meanwhile, in Moscow&apos;s shopping malls, Russia&apos;s love affair with luxury expands beyond all expectations. &apos;Until 1997 there was hardly anyone to build a business on,&apos; says Olga Mamonova, vice president of JamilCo, which runs Herm\u00e8s, Burberry, Ferragamo, Chaumet and Escada in Russia. &apos;Then our client base was in the hundreds. Now it&apos;s in the thousands. But it&apos;s not just about money. To buy an Herm\u00e8s scarf you don&apos;t need to be a millionaire. You just need to understand that it is a beautiful thing to own. That is real luxury. Not the price of the item.&apos; Mamonova is a feisty, beautifully groomed 46-year-old single mother of a 25-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son. She is elegant and understated in a black Burberry tunic dress and fringed cashmere Herm\u00e8s coat. Over tea in Moscow&apos;s Herm\u00e8s store (served on Herm\u00e8s china), she explains that she was an English teacher in the Soviet era. Her golden opportunity came when she was approached by a businessman who wanted to set up a consultancy with international connections and needed her language skills. &apos;Doctors and teachers were working in retail, selling things. My generation was lucky - we were old enough to have specialist knowledge that was in demand but not too old to change our mentality. You could sit and do nothing and wait for someone to do something for you. Or you could do something for yourself. It is not in my character to sit and wait.&apos; The company morphed into Russia&apos;s first importer of Levi&apos;s. &apos;I was just in the right place at the right time. As far as the state was concerned, two or three kinds of bread was enough choice for everyone. No one knew what &quot;brands&quot; were. Levi&apos;s were too expensive for the state and didn&apos;t correspond to their priorities. They were not interested in stupid things like jeans.&apos; Mamonova&apos;s company&apos;s experience during perestroika with Levi&apos;s and Swatch meant that the big brand names came to them in the mid-1990s. While the luxury market is expanding rapidly, so is middle-class interest in more affordable labels. Last month James, one of Moscow&apos;s first multi-brand designer stores, owned by Mamonova&apos;s company JamilCo, hosted a catwalk show for Levi&apos;s Blue. You Nguyen, designer for Levi&apos;s Europe, was there: &apos;There is a misconception that people are into bling-bling here. They&apos;re not any more. Before, it was all about adding rhinestones and gold thread - but that is the old market here. Now it&apos;s about quality, luxury, craftsmanship. Brand name is not enough for Russians any more.&apos; This is a typical attitude in today&apos;s Russia: that Russians deserve and appreciate the finer things in life. Women are at the forefront of this. Olga Mamonova has a fascinating theory about why Russian women - rich and poor alike - are so impossibly glamorous. There is a huge demographic crisis in Russia: 10 million more women in the population than men. This is a longstanding problem: many men died in the Soviet purges and in the Second World War. Now, because of a low birth rate and rampant alcoholism, life expectancy for Russian men is 59. For women, it&apos;s 72. &apos;Women really want men to notice them, to stand out,&apos; says Mamonova. It&apos;s women who reclaimed &apos;roskosh&apos;, the old Russian word for luxury, emblazoned across the cover of this month&apos;s Russian Vogue. Aliona Doletskaya is editor of Russian Vogue. We meet in her offices near Red Square. She&apos;s wearing a black sweater by - who else? - Kova &amp; T. Zhukova is a good friend of hers. (As I wait to talk to Dolestskaya, she is on the phone to another oligarch about a dinner she is hosting, &apos;Yes, darling, of course Dasha and Roman will be there.&apos;) So where is all the money coming from to fund Russia&apos;s never-ending shopping spree? &apos;It&apos;s simple,&apos; she says. &apos;Oil has got a good price at the moment. There are more jobs for young people on Western salaries now. And they choose to spend their money on luxury: they are quite happy to live in a one-room, 14-metre-square apartment but drive a Lexus.&apos; Russian&apos;s elite is not trashy any more, she claims, &apos;but they don&apos;t like deliberate modesty either - you must know that from the Russians living in London.&apos; The Dasha Zhukova look is the future of Russian fashion. &apos;Her brand is unpretentious and trend- setting. It&apos;s an example for every young Russian who sees that there is an opportunity to go international.&apos; Although it&apos;s much easier for Dasha to pull strings internationally because she grew up abroad, she adds. &apos;She&apos;s young and enthusiastic and she knows how to work the PR mechanisms.&apos; Others, however, are watching carefully and learning fast. Doletskaya is also wearing a pair of stunning high-waisted black trousers by Igor Chapurin, another hotly tipped Russian designer. Suzy Menkes is a fan, praising his &apos;modern simplicity&apos;. Holding court in his shop on the banks of the river Moscow, Chapurin, 39, is softly spoken, elegantly coiffed and lightly tanned. Many believe he will be the first Russian couturier to break into the west in the way Japanese designers like Yohji Yamamoto did in the 1980s. &apos;There is a paradox here,&apos; he smiles. &apos;The whole world is trying to break into Russia and I&apos;m trying to break out of it.&apos; His look is a relaxed version of Tom Ford: dark Levi&apos;s and Lanvin patent baseball boots with an artfully unbuttoned white shirt. He has shown in Paris for the past five seasons and hopes to open a shop there later this year. Recently there came a breakthrough: a phone call from one Tina Knowles - mother and stylist to Beyonc\u00e9. Someone in Camp Beyonc\u00e9 had spotted Chapurin&apos;s outrageous molten-gold catsuit at the Paris shows. The singer wore it last year for her US tour. In Russia, he says, his clients are self-made working women who can afford to spend \u00a32,000 on an outfit: bankers, lawyers, TV presenters, actresses, opera singers, media figures. Dubbed the Russian Armani, Chapurin&apos;s clothes are fabulous by any standards. There is a Roland Mouret feel to his sculpted dresses. But he does clever affordable accessories, too: silk corsages and velvet headbands for around \u00a350, long wool scarves for \u00a380. Chapurin sells in Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo and has showrooms in Paris and Milan. His mission, he says, is to make Russia famous for creativity and style, rather than caviar and vodka: &apos;I want to show the Russia that belongs to Chagall and Kandinsky.&apos; There&apos;s a palpable nostalgia for Russia&apos;s pre-Soviet greatness in Moscow. The central shopping area around Tverskaya (Moscow&apos;s Oxford Street) and Red Square has been in flux for years, with dozens of designer brands buying up prime real estate. Luxury shopping streets like Stoleshnikov Lane (Herm\u00e8s, Louis Vuitton, Agent Provocateur) and Tretyakovsky Passage (Prada, Gucci, D&amp;G) have sprung up. Until recently you could always find cheaper shops alongside these places. In the past year, however, a half-mile radius in central Moscow has become some sort of opulent, luxury-only zone. GUM, the department store on Red Square, used to sell ordinary things as well as designer labels: there were little supermarkets, tourist stalls, chemists and fast-food outlets in the building. Now all this has gone and GUM is 100 per cent designer: La Perla has replaced Accessorize and the chemist that used to have a massive selection of cheap shampoos and lipsticks has been replaced by Jo Malone. Much of this is down to the influence of one woman, Moscow&apos;s original queen of luxury. Alla Verber is, according to Cond\u00e9 Nast&apos;s editorial director Anna Harvey, &apos;the most important buyer in the world right now&apos;. Verber is vice president of Mercury, the first to import Prada, Gucci and Dolce &amp; Gabbana in the mid-1990s, and now the owners of Moscow&apos;s most fabulous department store TsUM, which opened in 2005. Verber is in her late forties and on her third marriage: she has a daughter, Katya, in her early twenties (who turns up later - a mini-me with a sheet of satin black hair and an enormous fur coat). Verber&apos;s office next to the Bolshoi Theatre overlooks the snow-topped golden domes and red-star-tipped turrets of the Kremlin. A mahogany desk is inlaid with huge gold angels, Lalique figurines and vases are perched on tables and on the floor. She shares the space with a nervous assistant wearing a black felt skating outfit with a puffball skirt and fur-trimmed boots. A lady in a powder-blue French maid&apos;s uniform serves green tea (fashionable Moscow&apos;s current detox drink of choice). This time the china is Faberg\u00e9. Alla Verber sweeps in three hours late, having been held up in traffic in her Bentley (Mercury also own Moscow&apos;s Bentley and Ferrari showrooms). Everything about her oozes stealth wealth: well-worn Bottega Veneta boots, a Ralph Lauren cashmere dress sprinkled with cat hair, creased Herm\u00e8s scarf, a solitary gigantic Chopard ring. Verber was born in St Petersburg. She grew up, she purrs, in a house opposite the Mariinsky Theatre in a &apos;very happy, beautiful, aristocratic family&apos;. From her bedroom window in the 1960s and 1970s she used to watch foreign theatregoers turning up for the opera and the ballet in their finery, and prided herself on guessing their nationality: &apos;I loved the Italians best - all the women dressed like Sophia Loren.&apos; The only access to fashion in her childhood was through dog-eared German mail-order catalogues from friends abroad. She would buy things from tourists for herself or to sell on. &apos;I remember a pair of button-down jeans and platform shoes,&apos; she sighs. In 1976 the family&apos;s Jewish heritage meant emigration was a possibility. Although the family was once wealthy and influential, this had all been removed after 1917: her paternal grandfather spent 14 years in the camps under Stalin. By the 1970s Verber&apos;s father just wanted her to become a dentist like him. &apos;Our life was comfortable in Soviet times - we had more than most people. But my grandfather wanted us to take the chance to leave.&apos; Verber was sent to Italy to await her Israeli visa: she was offered a job in a shop in Rome and ended up staying. &apos;I couldn&apos;t speak English or Italian but I did know how to dress people.&apos; She saved up and bought her first ever handbag from Gucci. &apos;All my life I never wanted to buy anything unless it was luxury,&apos; she says. Her second bag came from Louis Vuitton, the third from Herm\u00e8s. She later moved to Toronto and worked as a buyer. In the late 1980s US and Canadian companies began looking to Russia as a market: Verber was drafted in as the only Russian speaker around. In 1993 she joined Mercury, returned to the motherland and threw herself into bringing luxury to Russia. Her target audience is increasingly shopping on home territory in Moscow, she says. &apos;Before, people felt they didn&apos;t have any choice but to shop in London. Now we&apos;ve proved we have everything here - and more. Year after year I hear people saying, &quot;I went to Milan and couldn&apos;t get the right size - then I came back to Moscow and found exactly what I wanted.&quot; We are more expensive here - because of taxes and shipping - but if you have to take a plane to go shopping that costs more anyway.&apos; A few floors down from her office in TsUM a mother and daughter in matching floor-length fox-fur coats are hovering between Pucci and Malene Birger. The daughter makes a dash for a \u00a32,000 marabou shrug from Brazilian label Daslu and the two caress it approvingly. Downstairs in the beauty hall - the largest in Russia - a Viggo Mortensen lookalike in a Ralph Lauren beanie is scrutinising limited-edition aftershaves. Increasingly Moscow stores like this have designer one-offs not available anywhere else in the world. Tom Ford plans to open two Moscow stores next year, featuring items like \u00a32,500 custom-made suits only available for the Russian market. Manolo Blahnik creates shoes with higher heels specifically for his Moscow clients. On Tretyakovsky Passage the branches of Prada and Gucci have a bigger selection of bags and shoes than in Milan. Around the corner from TsUM, snapping at Mercury&apos;s heels, is an emporium belonging to the terrifyingly ambitious Aizel Trudel. She struts into the store that bears her name wearing sky-high zip-up Louboutin shoe boots, a fur coat falling off her shoulders which a minion struggles to catch. She set up her own shop four years ago, at the age of 25, after persuading her cousin&apos;s husband, a banker, that it was a good idea to lend her $5 million. She repaid the loan with interest within a year. She now owns three stores under her own name as well as running outlets for Agent Provocateur and J Mendel. Born in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, her father was a diplomat and she grew up abroad. &apos;When I decided to start out on my own, money was not the biggest problem. Of course you have to have friends with connections. My university - the Moscow State Institute of Foreign Affairs - was like Harvard: it gave you good connections.&apos; She now lives mostly in London with her new husband Louis Trudel, 34, a Canadian architect and property developer who designed the Moscow stores. Her empire celebrates Moscow&apos;s new style ethic: &apos;Foreigners don&apos;t understand what it used to be like here. Fifteen years ago there was nothing but Versace. Now the taste level is changing tremendously - I sell Libertine, Proenza Schouler, Peter Som - before, nobody here knew them and nobody would wear them. A few years ago it was all about &quot;total look&quot; - that has changed.&apos; Russian society girls mix Alaia with Oscar de la Renta. She says. &apos;Over here it&apos;s the young people who have money. Not people my mum&apos;s age. It&apos;s the 18-year-old students who have young money because they have rich parents or husbands.&apos; At Trudel&apos;s store I bump into Shakhri Amirkhanova, the exotic new editor of Russian Tatler which launches in April. She has just popped out in her lunch hour to pick up a few new pieces. She is a typical customer: international lifestyle (educated at Central St Martin&apos;s in London), young (28), pared-down modern style (she is buying a Prada tunic and a Vera Wang LBD). The new &apos;tasteful&apos; look doesn&apos;t come cheap, though, and Trudel&apos;s store is a masterclass in stealth wealth: a \u00a314,000 Loewe leather jacket, a \u00a37,000 Vera Wang crocodile miniskirt, Stella McCartney knits for \u00a31,600. In the short term, opulence at any cost remains a Russian tradition, says Olga Mamonova. &apos;People don&apos;t think about tomorrow. They want everything today. It&apos;s not because we&apos;re materialistic. It&apos;s because we&apos;re romantics and idealists. If a Russian woman asks a man to give her expensive presents, it&apos;s not because she&apos;s materialistic, it&apos;s about reassurance and wanting to feel loved. In Russia that&apos;s genetic. And it won&apos;t change for two or three generations. There were so many boundaries in the Soviet era and once they were removed, people went completely over the top - and that hunger is not quite sated yet.&apos; It&apos;s just becoming a little less brash and a little more cool.", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "Dasha Zhukova"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-13T11:57:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2008/jan/13/featuresreview.review11", "sentences": ["Lust, Caution (18)  Versatile Ang Lee moves from a homoerotic western in 1960s Wyoming to a straight erotic thriller in Japanese-occupied Shanghai."], "title": "Three to see: Film", "article": "Lust, Caution (18)  Versatile Ang Lee moves from a homoerotic western in 1960s Wyoming to a straight erotic thriller in Japanese-occupied Shanghai.

But the group behind the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week is trying to demonstrate that technology may be about saving the environment rather than damaging it.  With ecological concerns playing an increasing part in the decisions made by shoppers, plenty of the 2,700 companies showing off their latest technologies seemed desperate to claim any sort of green credentials. However, some companies at CES really were attempting to produce innovative technologies to reduce damage to the environment. Fujitsu Biblo Later this year the Japanese manufacturer will launch a laptop in its home market which is moving away from plastic: instead, the Biblo PC has a case made partially from corn oil. According to the company this means it is biodegradable, although scientists have questioned whether it will make any difference since the corn-based plastic is mixed with a petroleum-based material. Using corn reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during its creation by 15%, but it does nothing to minimise the toxicity of the computer&apos;s internal workings. Fujitsu says the development is a response to consumer demand.

The tiny pockets of material inside the screen produce their own light. Although OLED screens are small due to the difficulty of making them, Korean manufacturer Samsung showed off a 32-inch model at CES and says it will go into full production by 2010. Japanese rival Sony has an 11-inch model on the market - but it costs $2,500 (\u00a31,276).

Photo: Robyn Beck/AFP    Nokia The world&apos;s largest phone maker is trying hard to improve the image of the mobile phone industry, which is responsible for a large portion of the mountain of gadgets discarded every year. Its latest drive is to encourage people to buy a phone made from recycled and reused parts - the Nokia 3100 Evolve. Built from renewable material and packing a charger which claims much better efficiency than some of its rivals, it is available in Europe. The company also showed off an Eco Sensor Phone, which is able to analyse the owner&apos;s health, environmental changes and local weather patterns.     The Nokia 3100 Evolve is made from 50% renewable biomaterials. In addition, its charger uses 95% less power    Green Plug Part of Nokia&apos;s approach is based on research which shows that huge amounts of energy is wasted because people do not switch off their mobile phone chargers after charging. Although the Finnish company is working on its own technology to stop this, one of the big stories of the conference has been the Green Plug. The device promises to help the environment by using software that lets your gadget talk to its power supply. If no more charge is needed, the plug will switch itself off.  Horizon fuel cells Alternative energy sources were in limited evidence at CES this year, despite technologies using hydrogen and ethanol to create no-emissions power having been heavily promoted in the past. Shanghai-based Horizon, however, was displaying what it says will be some of the world&apos;s first commercially available fuel cell products, including a generator which needs only water. Pouring liquid into a container the size of a large can of drink is enough to cause a fuel cell reaction with a chemical compound inside to generate power. One canister is enough to power 10 laptops, and they should be available to buy this year.", "tags": ["Gadgets", "Climate change", "CES", "Technology", "Corporate social responsibility", "Energy efficiency", "Renewable energy", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-14T10:52:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/16/europe", "sentences": ["Late last year he went to Shanghai and Beijing to cajole and caution the Chinese over their trade surplus with the EU (overtaking that of the US) and unfair and even unsafe trading practices, with the emphasis on trying to strike a deal."], "title": "Nestl\u00e9's source of frustration", "article": "Never far from controversy, Nestl\u00e9 has run into a spot of bother over its famous bottled water Perrier. The Swiss food and drinks group is enraged that the commune of Verg\u00e8ze, in the Gard, a French department renowned for its stubborn Protestant and communist culture, has rebaptised the water&apos;s place of origin, Source Perrier-Les Bouillens. The municipality, with its population of 3,900, is trying to prevent Nestl\u00e9 from relocating Perrier production to somewhere else - as it has threatened to do before, notably in 2004 when 350 union members in Verg\u00e8ze initially rejected the group&apos;s early retirement plans for around 1,000 of its 4,000-strong French workforce. Nestl\u00e9, which bought Perrier in 1992, sees this as an affront to its entrepreneurial freedom and to its plans to expand the brand&apos;s reach, perhaps by moving into still water or producing variants elsewhere. &quot;All at once, our development is limited to this place,&quot; its lawyer has said. The group is to appeal against a decision last Friday by the administrative tribunal in Nimes, the departmental capital, to uphold the municipality&apos;s renaming. But it remains uncertain about the scope of its appeal as, according to Fabio Brusa, the Nestl\u00e9 Waters spokesman in France, the court has so far withheld the grounds behind its decision - the second time it has backed the Verg\u00e8ze mairie. The local council says through its lawyer that its move is entirely symbolic: &quot;All we&apos;ve done is change an address.&quot; The mayor, Ren\u00e9 Balana, told Le Figaro: &quot;We&apos;re not trying to appropriate an economic product but make the source&apos;s authenticity official.&quot; The source, Les Bouillens, was bought by a local doctor and spa owner, Louis Perrier, in 1898 and later sold to Sir St John Harmsworth, brother of Lord Northcliffe, the Daily Mail&apos;s founder. Nestl\u00e9 claims it is private property and the mairie has no right to change its name. The opposition retorts: &quot;Like it or not, Perrier water runs in Verg\u00e8ze, not Vezey [Nestl\u00e9&apos;s Swiss HQ].&quot; The Swiss group says it has achieved a 20% productivity improvement at Perrier and is investing \u20ac80m in the site, but is facing an uphill legal battle. This one could go all the way to the European court of justice.... Down in the dumpsSomeone else never far from controversy or a spot of bother is Peter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner. A free trader by instinct, he has been forced, by pressure from the more protectionist-minded member states, to take measures to limit imports of clothing and shoes - and, ironically, low-energy lightbulbs - from China and has begun an investigation into whether the Chinese are dumping steel in the EU. In 2006 he began a review of the EU&apos;s anti-dumping rules (trade defence instruments) in an effort to modernise them to reflect the globalised economy which sees some European producers invest heavily in low-cost emerging markets such as China and India and others import components and semi-finished goods from them. The aim was not to scrap them but to refine them. Now Mandelson, whose attempts to resuscitate the Doha round of trade liberalisation talks have so far foundered, perhaps terminally, has been forced to put the review on hold - despite arguing that his draft proposals are balanced, reflect the middle ground and do not undermine the commitment to tackle unfair trade. But, he says, the issue &quot;is politically sensitive and continues to attract vigorous debate and some disagreement among governments and economic operators.&quot; By the latter he means firms. Like Osram, the lightbulb manufacturer owned by Siemens that labelled Dutch rival virtually non-European because it imported the bulk of its low-energy bulbs from its Chinese units/partners. Citing an &quot;uneasy&quot; political environment, Mandelson says he will bring forward proposals only when a greater consensus exists - which might, given the head of steam building up around the equally contentious issue of sovereign wealth funds investing in or taking over European businesses, outlast his stay in Brussels. (He quits next year). Late last year he went to Shanghai and Beijing to cajole and caution the Chinese over their trade surplus with the EU (overtaking that of the US) and unfair and even unsafe trading practices, with the emphasis on trying to strike a deal. Now he is summoning attempts in the Doha talks to make it easier to apply anti-dumping rules under WTO rules. This cuts no ice with the Foreign Trade Association, a retailers lobby that fought against duties on imports of Chinese clothing. Jan Eggert, its secretary general, said this week it had given Mandelson &quot;substantial, legitimate and above all reasonable&quot; ways to reform the anti-dumping rules. &quot;It is therefore very disappointing to see that the commission appears to have let the more protectionist voices drown out the voices of reason.&quot; He claimed that more countries favoured modernisation than opposed it. Ouch. Bahn botherSomeone else in trouble is Hartmut Mehdorn, the head of Deutsche Bahn, who has just concluded, after a year of tortuous negotiations and sporadic strikes, a two-stage 11% deal with the GDL union (Germany&apos;s Aslef). Now he has brought the wrath of the government, other unions and consumers on his head for angrily proclaiming that the freshly written deal will cost the railways more than \u20ac1bn, bring job cuts and site closures - and higher fares. &quot;Rubbish!&quot; was the collective response. Exaggerated nonsense. While Mehdorn said the deal was bad for Germany, Wolfgang Tiefensee, the transport minister, said it was good and talk of job losses and fare rises was out of place. Another politician said it would cost DB at most \u20ac50m a year - compared with the \u20ac2.5bn operating profit it made in 2006 and the &quot;excellent financial performance&quot; even Mehdorn is predicting for 2007. Of course, these are abnormal times for Europe&apos;s biggest economy which grew at 2.5% last year but faces a slowdown in 2008, a &quot;mega wage year&quot; for the unions which, after years of effective pay cuts and job losses, are lodging claims of between 5 and 8%. And they are getting backing from politicians - in a &quot;mini election year&quot; - who say they deserve to see their purchasing power go up.

Today there are more than 300. Chinese authors, living through a period of change so rapid that six months seems to be enough to change everyone&apos;s way of life, are presented with unprecedented opportunities for wealth, and faced with a population which has little time to engage with serious literature. But the struggle for readers and the demands of the market are not the only difficulties faced by Chinese writers. There is also, according to the London-based Chinese poet Yang Lian, the continued pressure of government censorship, which is &quot;even stricter than before&quot;. &quot;Before there were some subjects everyone knew you weren&apos;t allowed to touch, such as criticising Mao Zedong,&quot; he explains. &quot;Now the government says to the outside world that they want to build a harmonious society, but internally they&apos;ve made a list of taboo subjects. That&apos;s actually worse than in the 1980s.&quot; It&apos;s a bleak assessment shared by the acting director of English PEN&apos;s Writers in Prison programme, Ophelia Field. &quot;China is still one of the worst violators of writers&apos; rights for freedom of expression in the world,&quot; she says. Untouchable subjects include the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Falun Gong movement and Tibetan and Uighur cultural rights. &quot;Any time somebody crosses the line to write about any of these issues,&quot; says Field, &quot;they&apos;re putting themselves at enormous risk.&quot; The explosive growth of the Chinese publishing industry has combined with more tolerant attitudes to sexual material to make it possible to publish books that might have been banned in the past - but the dangers are still there. &quot;Censorship&apos;s not quite the blunt instrument it used to be,&quot; says the Beijing-based journalist and translator Eric Abrahamsen. &quot;Writers can publish books, but then there&apos;s pressure exerted on publishers not to reprint them, or media organisations not to cover them.&quot; These economic threats create a climate of fear where writers are afraid to write, he adds. &quot;Self-censorship is a far bigger problem than government censorship.&quot; For the translator Nicky Harman, censorship is at once a danger and a temptation. Writing which flirts with taboo subjects is popular both within China and outside it. &quot;Having a book banned can be very good for business,&quot; she says, but the risks are acute, particularly for poets. &quot;Poetry has a long tradition of being the voice of dissidence in China,&quot; she explains, and trades in ambiguities and rich expression &quot;so if the authorities don&apos;t understand exactly what&apos;s going on, they&apos;ll ban it.&quot; Writers from China&apos;s ethnic minorities also face particular pressure, working under intense scrutiny. Uighurs, a primarily Muslim minority living in the northwest of the country, are a case in point. &quot;In general, purely academic, non-political writing does get published,&quot; says Radio Free Asia&apos;s Sarah Jackson-Han, &quot;and in the realm of literature, anything that doesn&apos;t contain overt political commentary or criticism of the authorities may also be published. Dissident writers must express themselves obliquely, through vehicles such as allegory, fantasy, and fable.&quot; But there is no guarantee of safety, even for writers who deal in parable and allusion. Uighur poet Nurmuhemmet Yasin is serving a 10-year sentence for &quot;inciting Uighur separatism&quot; after publishing a short story about a pigeon who flies off in search of a new home, is caught by humans and finally commits suicide. Considered by the Chinese authorities to be a criticism of their government&apos;s presence in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, he is currently held in Urumqi No 1 Jail, and has been denied visitors since his arrest in 2005. &quot;Political consequences can be dire,&quot; says Jackson-Han, &quot;for anyone suspected of taking aim at the system.&quot; Those hoping for an improvement in human rights in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics have been sorely disappointed. &quot;The promises made by the regime on freedom of expression have turned out to be completely hollow,&quot; says Field. &quot;In the past 12 months there&apos;s been an increase in house arrests and travel bans, which we expect to see continuing as the games approach.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s universal disappointment among human rights advocates that the Chinese have missed this historic opportunity to show the world they&apos;re serious about improving their record on human rights and becoming an open society,&quot; she continues. Authors remain in prison for writing about sensitive subjects, and remain at risk of unfair trials, long-term imprisonment and &quot;re-education through labour&quot;. &quot;The authorities have shown no signs of re-examining any of the forty-plus cases of concern involving writers and journalists that the international community has brought to their attention.&quot; Whether western pressure will have any effect on the Chinese government is a moot point. China&apos;s increasing engagement with the outside world as a marketplace brings other contacts as an inevitable corollary - social, academic and literary - but the effects on Chinese society are never straightforward. &quot;Many writers have had an enormous influence on contemporary Chinese writing,&quot; says the Nanjing-based poet and novelist Han Dong. &quot;In fact, you could say that the latter began with Chinese writers reading translated works.&quot; The influx of western art and literature which followed Deng Xiaoping&apos;s reforms in the 1980s encouraged and inspired a generation of writers, he continues. &quot;They began by imitating the west, and this then evolved into a new emphasis on Chinese tradition, as an inevitable consequence of growing anxieties about the impact of western influence. As with the economy and politics, acceptance and resistance collide in the literary domain too. &quot;The Chinese can never find peace of mind because they realise they must measure themselves against the west. It is not possible to avoid measuring ourselves, yet measuring ourselves against the west feels like treachery.&quot; It is too early for Chinese writers to have moved beyond this conflict, he continues. &quot;For example Kafka and Cao Xueqin, [the author of Dream of the Red Chamber], George Eliot and [the Tang dynasty poet] Li Bai ... how are contemporary Chinese writers to find their own way, when surrounded by such completely different influences?&quot; According to Harman, many are responding to this complicated literary heritage and the pressures of the market with a &quot;verbose, florid&quot; prose style. &quot;A lot of modern writers tend to write in a way which seems overblown to us,&quot; she says, &quot;and is certainly very difficult to translate.&quot; Translators sometimes have to make difficult decisions about whether to pare down or tone down the original text to make it read better in English. Jiang Rong&apos;s Man Asian award-winning Wolf Totem, which sold more than 2m copies in China and is due to be published in the UK after a series of delays this March, is full of elaborate description which slows the pace and &quot;never uses a sentence instead of a paragraph, never uses a paragraph instead of a page, never uses a page instead of a chapter&quot;. For Han, the &quot;over-the top, exaggerated writing of many writers today&quot;, which he rejects, is &quot;consistent with the environment within which we live in China, where we are surrounded by a craving for success&quot;. &quot;In the universal scramble for fame and fortune, everything is taken to extremes,&quot; he says, &quot;so it&apos;s not surprising we see that sort of writing. Personally, I did not make a conscious decision to write more simply - I just try to express myself directly and precisely. This only becomes unusual when set against a scenario where the &apos;abnormal&apos; has taken over.&quot; Han is pessimistic about prospects for literature in China, though perhaps not as pessimistic as Abrahamsen, who judges that &quot;the most interesting thing about the Chinese literary scene at the moment is the western interest in it&quot;. Not that the western interest is of a large enough scale to affect Chinese culture as a whole. &quot;Right now there&apos;s a lot of interest,&quot; he continues, &quot;but not yet a lot of actual book buying.&quot; Those who despair at the current situation in China - the lack of appetite for serious literature, the pressures of market and censorship on writers to stop writing - should look to the writers brave enough and smart enough for these challenging times. &quot;I feel that hope lies with a small number of writers,&quot; says Han, &quot;who, just because they are so desperately under pressure, are really single-minded and may produce work of high quality.&quot;   Read the first part of the report here", "tags": ["Chinese literature", "Fiction", "Books", "Publishing", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-17T10:04:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/18/northernexposure", "sentences": ["Think Washington, New York, Los Angeles; Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong; Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay; Moscow, St Petersburg; Berlin, Frankfurt; Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague; Glasgow, Edinburgh; Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne - other examples come readily to mind."], "title": "Northern exposure", "article": "Sheffield city council&apos;s development body, Creative Sheffield, has launched an imaginative and highly interesting idea about creating a second major UK hub by achieving real connectivity between Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield itself, chiefly by means of fast and affordable transport links between them. The resulting catchment would equal London in population, providing the kind of scale in commercial and cultural terms that could compete with any major world city. The idea is to provide the basis for achieving this not by filling the space between the three cities with buildings, but to improve train and bus services: connectivity not merely propinquity is the key. All three city centres lie within 35 miles of each other (about the diameter of London) and yet, as Creative Sheffield&apos;s director Ian Bromley pointed out, it takes an hour to get from Manchester to Sheffield whereas it takes only 20 minutes to get from Reading to the centre of London, the same distance. It is an excellent idea, which by creating a second UK centre on an international scale - at present London and the south-east absorb far too much of the UK&apos;s economic and cultural oxygen - would be of overall benefit not just to the region but the entire country. Perhaps what should be further suggested is moving parliament and the major ministerial headquarters to the Sheffield-Manchester-Leeds area too. The idea of moving the capital has been debated before, most recently and notably in Prospect magazine, and the benefits are manifold: such a move would lessen the crushing burden London experiences by having absolutely everything in it (think property prices, congestion, schools, health services, transport), while serving as a major boost for the Sheffield-Manchester-Leeds hub and therefore the country generally. Successive governments have moved departments and parts of departments to the regions for commendable reasons; communications technology makes physical distance an irrelevance for many administrative purposes. But parliament and main ministries still need a habitation, and senior officials and ministers have to sit together to discuss. By doing this in London they drag in lobbyists, the press, embassies, and much else that would have to disperse at least part of their activities to a new capital, involving investment there while providing relief to the crumbling London infrastructure. Many stand to gain much by such a change. It is interesting to observe that whereas a single world city in a country has a distorting effect, as in the UK and France, in countries where there are two or more centres that can each claim international status for at least one of the three standard reasons (economic, political or cultural), many benefits flow. Think Washington, New York, Los Angeles; Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong; Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay; Moscow, St Petersburg; Berlin, Frankfurt; Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague; Glasgow, Edinburgh; Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne - other examples come readily to mind. They all follow the multi-centre model to their benefit. London and Paris, by contrast, are national obesities that make everything roll uncomfortably in upon them by virtue of the dent they make.

As Alistair Darling prepares to unveil the plan to MPs on Monday, Branson used his place on the prime minister&apos;s high profile Far East trip to intensify his campaign to assume control of the bank. &quot;I personally believe [our bid] is the best bid on the table, it&apos;s the best option for Northern Rock,&quot; Branson said in Shanghai soon after he discussed the rescue plan with Brown on the second day of his visit to China. &quot;I believe it&apos;s the best option because we would re-brand it the Virgin Bank, which is a very strong brand ... We feel we have a winnable package.&quot; Branson&apos;s decision to step up his campaign to win control of Northern Rock during an overseas prime ministerial trade mission may raise eyebrows among some of the rival bidders for the bank. But Branson and Brown both downplayed their discussions about Northern Rock. The prime minister said: &quot;I haven&apos;t spoken in any detail to Richard Branson. The commercial decisions are not a matter for me.&quot; It is understood that Brown told Branson that Darling will make a statement to MPs on Monday. Darling will announce that the government will back a rescue plan drawn up by the Treasury&apos;s City advisers, Goldman Sachs. Under this plan Northern Rock would convert up \u00a330bn of its loans from the Bank of England into bonds that would be backed by a government guarantee. Potential bidders could use the funding arrangement to clinch a buyout of the bank, with the hope of nursing it back to health. Branson&apos;s Virgin Money is competing with the Olivant consortium, led by banker Luqman Arnold. The Rock&apos;s current chairman, Bryan Sanderson, has suggested a third option, under which the current management would remain in charge. As Northern Rock&apos;s borrowers pay back their mortgages over the next few years, the bank would use the money to pay back bondholders. But if anything goes wrong, the Treasury would have to foot the bill instead. The bonds would be more attractive to investors nervous of lending more money to the tainted bank. The scheme avoids the politically controversial option of full-blown nationalisation, which the Tories have said they would deem a &quot;major failure&quot;. Downing Street hopes Monday&apos;s announcement will ease the pressure on the government after the ignominy of presiding over the first run on a British bank since the 1860s when Northern Rock had to turn to the Bank of England as a &quot;lender of last resort&quot; in September when it was unable to borrow funds from other banks because of the &quot;credit crunch&quot;. It is estimated the Bank has loaned Northern Rock close to \u00a325bn over the last four months. The package is a half way house that would enable Brown to avoid the political humiliation of revisiting ghosts from Labour&apos;s troubled past. David Cameron had hoped that nationalisation would become Brown&apos;s Black Wednesday - a reference to the day when John Major&apos;s economic credibility was shot to pieces after Britain was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992. But the Tories admitted tonight that the government appears to to have avoided nationalisation. George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, said: &quot;One moment Gordon Brown is talking up nationalisation and now he is in full retreat. From the beginning his dithering has contributed to the government&apos;s incompetent handling of Northern Rock. Now he appears to be planning to entrench the taxpayer&apos;s exposure and shatter his own debt rule.&quot; Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, criticised the new plan as a &quot;cop out&quot;. He warned that the taxpayer would still foot the bill if the Rock goes bust, without reaping the benefits if it recovers. &quot;Nationalisation would be more honest and transparent; and it would also mean that any subsequent improvement in Northern Rock&apos;s fortunes would go to the taxpayer,&quot; Cable said. &quot;Giving a private company a free seat at the roulette wheel to gamble in a game it can&apos;t lose at the expense of the taxpayer is surely a recipe for disaster. If Gordon Brown&apos;s mate Richard Branson is going to become the private buyer, he will be laughing all the way to the Bank of England.&quot; Four months after the Bank first stepped in to bailout the beleaguered lender, efforts to find private sector backers for a takeover bid had stalled. Northern Rock will have to pay the Treasury a fee for guaranteeing the bonds, so that Darling make the case to Brussels that he is not providing unfair &quot;state aid&quot;. Officials from the Treasury and Bank of England have been in constant contact with Goldman in the past week, working on the details of the arrangement.

It is thought Woolas&apos;s criticism of the Indian approach to climate change, including its reluctance to accept binding target cuts, is shared by other Whitehall departments including the Foreign Office. By contrast Britain believes the Chinese government, shortly due to become the largest carbon emitter in the world, does understand the need to act. Brown is on a four-day visit to China and India, arriving in New Delhi tomorrow. Woolas also revealed that the government is lobbying the US presidential candidates in an attempt to ensure President Bush&apos;s successor engages with UN-led international talks on climate change. In Beijing yesterday Britain and China agreed to expand trade to $60bn (\u00a330.6bn) by 2010, and sealed a memorandum of understanding to encourage British firms to help build a new breed of sustainable cities in China. Today Brown will endorse plans for an eco-city near Shanghai built by British firms and a low-carbon fossil fuel power station partly financed by the UK, as he makes the environment the theme of the day. Britain is undertaking international lobbying to secure a world wide agreement within two years on cutting carbon emissions for implementation in 2012. Contrasting the attitude of China and India, Woolas said: &quot;The Chinese central government is part of the solution and not part of the problem. &quot;India is more difficult. Although it now recognises the reality of man made climate change, it does not put its shoulder to the wheel. Its basic attitude and its public statements are that western governments created the problem so the western governments must solve it. &quot;They point out that if you look at emissions per capita they are not a major emitter. The counter argument is that it is the total amount of emissions that actually matter. Because India is growing so fast - particularly in car transport and electricity generation from fossil fuels - then it is increasingly becoming a major emitter&quot;. Indian emissions are well below the world average on a per capita basis - at about 1.1 tonnes per head, so providing the Indian government a fig leaf for its apparent reluctance to act. Experts argue that the Indian government is shifting, but faced with what seems like a choice between growth and climate change, it is still choosing growth. The environment minister said he accepted that the west had largely caused the current threats to the climate, but argued that there would still be a problem even if the G8 nations all stopped producing any emissions tomorrow. &quot;We all have to be involved. Climate change is the latest example of mutually assured destruction since the nuclear arms race. We cannot act in isolation&quot;. Woolas argued the sums required to build clean technologies will only come from cap and trade schemes, a form of tax on carbon. The environment minister said Britain is already planning for a post Bush America by seeking to influence the climate change policies of the candidates in the presidential race. &quot;Our policy towards the US elections is to be open and transparent to try to influence all the candidates by providing information on UK and EU policy including scientific views. At the moment the environment issue is high up the agenda. He pointed out that Hillary Clinton has ranked climate change as the third of her priorities behind the economy. On the Republican side, he said &quot;John McCain is making some good noises and the others are lagging behind.&quot; He added: &quot;Our approach is we are going to have work with the new presidency during the UN process. We want the policy of the next president to be as close as possible to the EU as it can be.&quot; But with Bush due to convene a further meeting of his major emitter group in Honolulu at the end of the month Woolas admitted everyone is having to assess the motives of the president. &quot;The tightrope we are trying to walk is that on the one hand we welcome the US involvement and on the other we don&apos;t want the American agenda to usurp the UN agenda. Their interpretation is that you asked for leadership and we are providing it. The EU interpretation is that you can only lead if you are prepared to compromise&quot;. At a Beijing trade forum attended by the 250 British business leaders and university vice-chancellors travelling with Brown, and a similar number of Chinese delegates, Brown rattled the numbers off: 6,000 UK projects in China worth $14bn; 100 flights between Britain and China every week; 10 times as many people watch Premier League football on TV in China than in Britain; more Bentleys in Beijing than in any other city in the world. Brown said: &quot;While we all know that the next stage of economic change will bring insecurities and challenges, I also believe that great possibilities for an even greater prosperity are there for Britain and China, and together we can make the most of them in cooperation and partnership. For where others may see risk, I see the rise of globalisation and of China not as a threat but as an opportunity.&quot; This non-protectionist message got through, with Brown moving to exploit US and European concern about Chinese state-funded investment in major western companies. Brown said he welcomed so-called sovereign wealth funds and won an in-principle endorsement from Chinese premier Wen Jiabao that the China Investment Corp could set up its first overseas office in London. British officials were pleasantly surprised by Wen&apos;s promise that it would be to make them accountable and transparent and his insistence that it was &quot;entirely commercial&quot;. Britain expects a move soon, almost as a partner to the unveiling in Beijing yesterday of the first office there for the London Stock Exchange.

The wedding speeches didn&apos;t have much to say about the bride or groom, but there was a good deal of comment on the quality of the tea.&quot; I like that kind of insistence on the decencies of life. I&apos;ve always had a thing about tea. It&apos;s more of a warm, cosy relationship than a torrid passion, but it has its moments. To be honest, I wasn&apos;t a China tea man - they were too refined and challenging for my clodhopping tastebuds. That was until I met Henrietta Lovell, aka the Stickler, for reasons that will become clear. I first met her at the BBC Good Food Show in London, dragged along to her stand by Mark Hix, late of the Ivy, Le Caprice, Scott&apos;s etc, and a bold champion of sound British produce and producers. And before I knew it, Lovell had poured me a cup of Silver Tip tea all the way from the &quot;high mountain tea gardens of Fujian province&quot; in China, and was batting me about the ears with the health-giving qualities of white teas, how green tea should be made only with whole leaves, and something about the fermentation of oolong, which, frankly, I rather missed because I was carried away on a delicate, shimmering, perfumed cloud of tea. Eventually crashing back to earth, I got something of her life story - the tea part, anyway. Lovell used to be a project manager for a printing company, and looked after its interests in the far east. &quot;Very dull,&quot; she said, but it took her to some interesting places, China being one, and there she came across China tea and its teashops. &quot;These were wonderful places, like old-fashioned wine merchants, where the Chinese would spend hours discussing and tasting teas, and spend incredible sums of money on them. Did you know that the Chinese spend a higher percentage of their disposable incomes on tea than we do on alcohol?&quot; Anyway, Lovell came back looking for teas of the quality she&apos;d come across in China, and couldn&apos;t find them. &quot;There were beautifully labelled, very expensive teas, but they didn&apos;t match up to what I&apos;d tasted out there.&quot; So she took herself back to China to learn about the craft, and set about sourcing and importing tiptop teas. There&apos;s rather more about tea in China than there is space to go into here, so let&apos;s stick with Silver Tip, also known as Silver Needle, because it is the simplest and most exquisite. And most expensive, naturally (although it still works out at only about 27p for a small pot). True, finest white tea Silver Tip must be made with the spring buds of what Lovell calls the &quot;big white variety&quot; of the tea bush, Camellia sinensis. It&apos;s what&apos;s known as first flush - that is, the first new growth of the picking season, which begins in April. The buds - there are no leaves in Silver Tip - must be picked very early in the morning, before the sun&apos;s rays have had time to fall, by the most experienced pickers. The day has to be clear, too, because the buds then spend a day drying gently in the fresh air, being turned very carefully from time to time. On no account must the drying tip be broken, or they will be useless. Finally, they are vacuum-packed in very small quantities. Of course, Lovell doesn&apos;t deal only in Silver Tip. The Rare Tea Company lists white, green, black and oolong teas of similar pedigree. She is very proud of her jasmine-scented white tea, and even lists a few teas from Darjeeling as well. But it&apos;s that image of Lovell battling her way to the &quot;high mountain tea gardens of Fujian province&quot; and haggling with the gnarled Chinese tea masters that appeals to my romantic imagination. And I&apos;m sure it adds a lustre to every cup.", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-19T23:46:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jan/20/golf.news", "sentences": ["The Worksop player, a winner 18 times on the European Tour, was in a worse situation at November&apos;s HSBC Champions event in Shanghai where he faced a double-figure deficit to world number two Phil Mickelson in the middle of the final round.", "&apos;You saw in Shanghai when Mickelson and Ross Fisher came back to the pack."], "title": "Golf: Abu Dhabi Championship", "article": "Lee Westwood will be hoping that lightning strikes twice today as he begins the final round of the Abu Dhabi Championship.

It is no good waiting for people to come back to you; you have to put some pressure on yourself. A 65 might do that. &apos;The nearer the finishing post comes for Martin, the harder it will get. It is not an easy golf course and if you start missing fairways it becomes very difficult.&apos; Westwood reached the turn in 34 and came home in a magnificent five-under 31. &apos;It is the example of all the hard work I put in through the winter,&apos; said the Englishman, currently second in the Order of Merit. &apos;I had a lot of top 10s towards the end of last year and I really started to feel very confident. I didn&apos;t drive the ball well around the front nine, but I got it out in a couple under. Then I started to hit a lot more fairways on the back nine and shot five under, which was good.&apos; The unfaltering Kaymer, the 2007 rookie of the year, shot a third-round 68. His closest challenger is Wall at 11 under with Stenson a further shot adrift. Northern Ireland prodigy Rory McIlroy failed to build on his flying start to his round. After reaching the turn in 33 he was forced to settle for a 69, putting him alongside Open champion Padraig Harrington on three under. Harrington received treatment on a long-standing back and shoulder problem during play but made a strong start with two birdies at the beginning of his round. However, the Irishman was only able to pick up another shot at the last. Darren Clarke, on a high after recording back-to-back top-four finishes, failed to recover from four bogeys in his opening four holes and dropped down to two over after a 74. Colin Montgomerie carded a 68, which helped the Scot&apos;s chances of breaking back into the world&apos;s top 50 to secure his place at the Masters in April. The world No 61 has targeted a top-10 finish as he attempts to avoid missing a trip to Augusta for only the second time in 16 years. Nick Dougherty and Oliver Fisher, who both carded third-round 69s, and Simon Dyson, a 68, join Montgomerie at four-under overall. Robert Gamez birdied the final two holes to snatch a one-shot lead after three rounds of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. Gamez shot a five-under-par 67 to move to 18-under 198, one stroke clear of DJ Trahan and Justin Leonard. Boo Weekley carded a tournament-best 10-under 62 to jump from 34th to fourth.", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "Martin Kaymer"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-20T00:14:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/20/northernrock.economy", "sentences": ["&apos;I believe [our bid] is the best on the table; it&apos;s the best option for Northern Rock,&apos; Branson said in Shanghai on the second day of the Brown-led trade mission to China."], "title": "Branson ups stakes in his bid  for Rock", "article": "Sir Richard Branson boasted yesterday that his Virgin empire has created a &apos;winnable package&apos; to take control of Northern Rock, hours after he discussed a government-backed \u00a330bn rescue strategy for the struggling bank with Gordon Brown in China. As Downing Street braced itself for a political battle over its plans - the Tories and the Liberal Democrats both poured scorn on the scheme yesterday - Branson used his place on the Prime Minister&apos;s high-profile Far East trip to intensify his campaign to assume control of the bank. &apos;I believe [our bid] is the best on the table; it&apos;s the best option for Northern Rock,&apos; Branson said in Shanghai on the second day of the Brown-led trade mission to China. &apos;I believe it&apos;s the best option because we would rebrand it the Virgin Bank, which is a very strong brand. We feel we have a winnable package.&apos; Branson&apos;s decision to step up his campaign to win control of Northern Rock during a prime ministerial trade mission - and 48 hours before the Chancellor Alistair Darling unveils the rescue package to MPs tomorrow - may raise eyebrows among some rival bidders. Branson and Brown both played down their discussions. The Prime Minister said: &apos;I haven&apos;t spoken in any detail to Richard Branson. The commercial decisions are not a matter for me.&apos; In his Commons statement, Darling will announce that the government will back a rescue plan drawn up by the Treasury&apos;s City advisers, Goldman Sachs, under which Northern Rock would convert up to \u00a330bn of its loans from the Bank of England into bonds that would be backed by a government guarantee. Downing Street hopes the announcement will ease the pressure on the government after the ignominy of presiding over the first run on a British bank since the 1860s. Northern Rock had to turn to the Bank of England as a &apos;lender of last resort&apos; in September when it was unable to borrow funds from other banks because of the &apos;credit crunch&apos;. It is estimated that the Bank has loaned Northern Rock close to \u00a325bn over the past four months. The package stops short of full nationalisation, enabling Brown to avoid the political humiliation of revisiting ghosts from Labour&apos;s troubled past. David Cameron had hoped nationalisation would become Brown&apos;s Black Wednesday, the day John Major&apos;s economic credibility was shot to pieces after Britain was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992. The Tories admitted last night that the government will not nationalise the bank, but signalled they were spoiling for a fight. George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, said: &apos;One moment Gordon Brown is talking up nationalisation, now he is in full retreat. From the beginning his dithering has contributed to the government&apos;s incompetent handling of Northern Rock. Now he appears to be planning to entrench the taxpayer&apos;s exposure and shatter his own debt rule.&apos; Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, criticised the new plan as a &apos;cop out&apos;. He warned that the taxpayer would still foot the bill if the Rock went bust, without reaping the benefits if it recovered. &apos;Nationalisation would be more honest and transparent, and would also mean that any subsequent improvement in Northern Rock&apos;s fortunes would go to the taxpayer,&apos; he added. &apos;Giving a private company a free seat at the roulette wheel to gamble in a game it can&apos;t lose, at the expense of the taxpayer, is surely a recipe for disaster. If Gordon Brown&apos;s mate Richard Branson is going to become the private buyer, he will be laughing all the way to the Bank of England.&apos; Under the rescue scheme, potential bidders could use the funding arrangement to clinch a buyout, with the hope of nursing Northern Rock back to health. Branson&apos;s Virgin Money is competing with the Olivant consortium, led by banker Luqman Arnold. As Northern Rock&apos;s borrowers pay back their mortgages over the next few years, the bank would use the money to repay bondholders. But if anything went wrong, the Treasury would have to foot the bill. The bonds would be more attractive to investors nervous of lending more money to the tainted bank. The scheme avoids nationalisation. Four months after the Bank stepped in to bail out the beleaguered lender, efforts to find private backers for a takeover bid have stalled. Northern Rock will have to pay the Treasury a fee for guaranteeing the bonds, meaning Darling can make the case to Brussels that he is not providing unfair &apos;state aid&apos;. Treasury and Bank of England officials have been in constant contact with Goldman Sachs working on the details. On Friday, the government recommended the proposals to Northern Rock&apos;s board, which is expected to make an announcement to the Stock Exchange tomorrow.", "tags": ["Northern Rock", "Economic policy", "Virgin Group", "Credit crunch", "Banking", "Business", "Richard Branson"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-20T00:48:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/20/china", "sentences": ["Growth in China has been spectacular but it has also been unbalanced and has created staggering inequality; the US magazine Forbes identified 66 billionaires on its China rich list last year, their coffers swelled by soaring share prices on the Shanghai exchange."], "title": "By all means welcome the Chinese, but not too warmly", "article": "Whatever you associate with Wigan - for Northern Soul fans the Casino nightclub, for Orwell enthusiasts the road to the pier - it is unlikely to spring to mind as a mecca for Chinese investment. However, the local council is in talks that could see a 55-acre site transformed into a European export hub for Chinese textile companies, creating 1,000 jobs. Exactly the sort of thing Gordon Brown had in mind on his visit to China this weekend, when he and Premier Wen Jiabao set out new targets to raise trade to \u00a330bn by 2010 and to attract more inward investment. Brown is selling the UK to the Chinese as a relaxed, open alternative to the US, where protectionism was in full cry, at least until the Wall Street banks had to go cap in hand for capital. Our government welcomed the Chinese as saviours of MG Rover - it would love them to do the same for Northern Rock - and Brown is touting London as the ideal place for an overseas office for Beijing&apos;s controversial sovereign wealth fund.  His openness to China is broadly sensible. The big question is how the rapidly growing Chinese economy can be integrated into the international system without tripping over itself and everyone else, and raising the protectionist drawbridge is not the answer. Growth in China has been spectacular but it has also been unbalanced and has created staggering inequality; the US magazine Forbes identified 66 billionaires on its China rich list last year, their coffers swelled by soaring share prices on the Shanghai exchange.  Neither Donald Trump nor Steven Spielberg is rich enough make it onto a table of the top 10 wealthiest Chinese, but most people are still desperately poor, and the Beijing government is worried that rampant food price inflation will lead to serious unrest. Huge internal migration is adding to the strain as people flood into cities from impoverished rural areas. The Beijing Olympics has stoked the frenzy in the capital, feeding a house price boom. A fall to earth could be very painful indeed. While the UK and US are debtor economies, China has accumulated government, corporate and private savings at a startling rate - the household savings ratio is about 23 per cent, compared with a paltry 3.4 per cent here - and it has a gargantuan trade surplus of nearly $250bn. The Chinese know they need to contain the trade surplus, which is causing ill-will abroad and fuelling asset price rises at home. They want to repitch the economy so that there is more environmental awareness, more emphasis on services and more consumer spending. These are not things that can be achieved overnight. The shift from heavy industry to services took several difficult decades in the UK, and Chinese families will carry on saving so long as their welfare state remains rudimentary. A powerful body of opinion in Washington is fixated on the notion that China has pegged its currency deliberately low to promote its exports, but there is little chance that it will revalue to an extent that would pacify these critics. A more constructive line would be to make the G8 the G10, giving China and India a seat at the top table of economic talks. The West&apos;s response to sovereign funds needs to be finely calibrated. They should be made welcome, but only if they are transparent, independently audited and run along recognised commercial lines. Their financial power is such that they could destabilise companies, sectors and even whole countries; industries such as banking, defence and utilities must be protected in the national interest. We should also accept that we are in no position to deliver lectures from on high. The credit crunch and the implosion of Wall Street&apos;s finest do make it a tad harder for us to convince the Chinese of the virtues of unbridled capitalism.

Now, nightlife has become the lifeblood of many hotels; some guests actually book into London&apos;s St Martin&apos;s Lane hotel only to try to secure entry to Bungalow 8, housed within its walls. And it&apos;s no surprise that the owner of Gramercy Park Hotel, currently New York&apos;s hottest nightspot, is former Studio 54 nightclub owner, Ian Schrager.  Now some nightclubs are joining the fray from the other direction and adding rooms, creating groovy 24-hour clubbing experiences for discerning partygoers.  For example, Mark Fuller, owner of London club Embassy, is soon to open Sanctum, a nightclub and 70-seat restaurant with rooms above in Soho, while Jonathan Downey, owner of the Milk &amp; Honey club in London, has been making a roaring success of The Clubhouse in Chamonix since 2005.  In Paris, Kube typifies the new breed of hybrid hotel. There is no conventional check-in, reception area, lobby or breakfast room. To get to your bedroom, you sneak out of a door on the side of the bar and club - easy enough in the day, but it&apos;s a lot harder to fumble to the lift in the inky blackness of night, with pounding dance music rebounding off the walls, strobe lighting to confuse you and waif-like models covering every surface. On the upside, it&apos;s not far to stumble at 3am when your disco-ed out legs can&apos;t carry you through yet another floor-filling remix of a cult Eighties Phil Collins track - the French are into some ironic sounds right now!  The advantage of the nightclub-with-rooms is that you don&apos;t have to worry about queuing for cabs in the cold - in fact, you don&apos;t even have to worry about wearing a coat. Best of all, you&apos;re guaranteed entry to the club itself. And when you&apos;re ready to crash, you can just escape to your own private chill-out room - it&apos;s the ultimate in VIP clubbing.  But there are downsides. Breakfasting in the bowels of a nightclub the morning after, as underlings clean up the cigarette butts from under your feet, feels less salubrious, however delicious the posh pastries and freshly squeezed OJ.  And while one night is fun, anything more than a weekend and you&apos;ll be praying for silence. At the Murano Oriental Resort in La Palmeraie near Marrakech, music floats across the resort, around the swimming pool and over your bedroom balcony for around 20 hours a day. The sounds change, from funked-up jazz in the mornings, to pool party anthems in the afternoon and the latest in French house at night - and it works while you&apos;re there. But by the time the driver inserted the Murano&apos;s house CD into the car&apos;s player on the way to the airport, my head was throbbing and what had started out as my reason for loving the place (the music) was now like torture. I slowly turned down the volume dial.  Here is our pick of the hottest new hybrids of hotel and nightclub. Print Liverpool&apos;s latest nightclub hotel has musical roots: this converted former printworks was once the recording studio of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The basement houses Ink, a nightclub open until 3am; the Print Bar and Cafe on the ground floor doubles as the reception area. On the first floor there&apos;s a sleek brasserie with oak flooring, velvet armchairs and low lighting, while the second floor is occupied by Cyan, a private members&apos; bar where the city&apos;s movers and shakers meet, work and play. The top two floors house four loft suites and two penthouse duplex apartments, which look set to be the most stylish hotel rooms in the city. \u00b7 56-58 Stanley St, Liverpool. 0870 033 4450; www.theprinthotel.co.uk.

The scent of neroli wafts across from the main bar and restaurant building, which overlooks the 22-hectare estate. Long white leather sofas and an enormous white Murano chandelier set the vibe. The Sunday brunch pool party, where the tanned, toned and beautiful descend on the red-tiled pool while a DJ spins sun-drenched rhythms, is creating a buzz not yet seen in Marrakech. As for the rooms, traditional Moroccan design meets urban cool. Magenta lounge chairs from Italy and a dramatic black marble bathroom add a shot of modern colour to the white walls. It&apos;s all very hip and the music (which is not for everyone) changes to reflect the mood throughout the day. \u00b7 Douar Abiad, La Palmeraie, Marrakech. 00 212 2432 7000; www.muranoresort.com.

There is a typically cosmopolitan cross-section of the city&apos;s well-to-do youth: part expat, part Chinese, all fashionable. Among them is Maxime, a Parisian who runs Logo, a low-key bar straight out of Hoxton, known for its array of experimental DJs, Anita and Sebastian, two promoters of Micro, a monthly micro-house and minimal techno party, and Reggie - an Australian expat better known locally as DJ Vulvatron. Reggie, who also produces deft Nine Inch Nails-style electronic music under the moniker R3, is the co-founder (along with his partner, Yen) of STD, Shanghai&apos;s fastest growing independent rock and dance party. &apos;There are two types of parties in Shanghai,&apos; he says. &apos;There are the big glamorous Bund parties overlooking the river where rich foreigners prance around with rich locals while pouring champagne on each other and snorting copious amounts of coke. Then there are the underground alternative parties that independent promoters arrange to push for the sake of the music itself. There is definitely a shift in terms of where people are going to party. Last year there would be, say, one alternative party on a Saturday. Now there are two or three and all of them have a good turnout regardless of what else is going on.&apos;  The VIP Room has hosted parties that fall into both categories, and Adam Freeland&apos;s audience is truly a mix of both: a crew of German models and their escorts pushing their way to the front of the dancefloor, fashion-forward, beautiful locals, and indie kids, Chinese and otherwise, just there for a dance. Though the club&apos;s entrance is unassuming, the interior of the VIP Room is where the supercomputer in the film Tron meets Saturday Night Fever. There are low tunnels leading to the main room and private rooms, all lined in shining chrome-finished plastic and glowing red, yellow and blue lights. The dancefloor is small and packed, the crowd sweaty, and the experience oddly alienating, due to frequent, blinding blasts from eye-level fog machines. Through the mist, it is also apparent that Chinese clubs do not operate under the same fire codes as their counterparts in the West: sparklers seem to be everywhere, brought to tables whenever a bottle of champagne is ordered. The pyrotechnical main event, however, takes place when a few club staffers start juggling what seem like roadside flares at the bar.  In the VIP lounges above the dancefloor, octagonal black-tinted windows face the action while white plastic honeycomb walls perforated with LED lights slowly change their hue from purple to blue to pink to white again. It&apos;s the past&apos;s vision of the future - and appropriately so: this is the new China, where prosperity has lent the People&apos;s Republic an economic and cultural boom akin to the internet-driven gold rush that buoyed America in the Nineties. As the superclub paradigm dominant in Western clubland for the past 10 years, since the heyday of Twilo and Cream, draws to a close, it is dawning rosy red in China.  The music industry had a dim 2007: record sales continued to plunge as piracy online and otherwise bit more into meagre profits, leaving bands and labels scrounging for new sources of income. One of the largest turned out to be China. The country was formerly closed to foreign music altogether, but the government has slowly loosened restrictions, and Western acts have taken advantage of a slice of the 1.3 billion population. This past year everyone from Nine Inch Nails to the Yeah Yeah Yeah&apos;s, from Beyonce to Linkin Park, have gone East. These acts are late to the party, however. DJs and electronic music acts have been tapping into the growing cross-section of young, wealthy Chinese ready to be entertained for years, and this ever-growing fanbase has led to the rise of a club circuit worthy of international note. Combining luxurious decor, top-notch technology and cosmopolitan clientele, China has quickly become host to some of the best clubs in the world.  Traditionally, clubs in China have not been aesthetically pleasing, featuring too much catering-hall Chinese red and gold with a dim sum palace feel, and rarely having a proper sound system. The new superclubs are a different animal altogether. Clubs such as Tang and Babyface (in Shanghai and Hong Kong), as well as Angel and Tang in Beijing, are becoming national brands known for their private rooms and the best in sound and vision. These clubs are all over-the-top, as if the People&apos;s Republic is out to show its citizens - and the rest of the world - that it is not only building modern dance emporiums but building them better, stronger, faster. With the Olympics coming, international crowds are sure to notice.  In many ways, China&apos;s club owners are indeed surpassing their Western counterparts at their own game; but as pan-global as they are, in key ways they are still very Chinese. The VIP rooms in Shanghai&apos;s VIP Room, for example, feature a quality karaoke system with a massive flatscreen TV - a switch determines whether the patrons listen to the sound from the club or the sound of singalongs. Dancefloors do not serve the same function here either. There is no mass of grooving bodies; instead there is a cramped pack of asymmetrical dance styles bobbing among a minefield of cocktail tables. The floor in front of the DJ is prime real estate for Chinese patrons to sit and drink - indeed, to play a dice-based drinking game that doubles as an entree for patrons rich enough to afford a table (about \u00a360) and a few bottles of Scotch (about \u00a330 each) to meet women by inviting them to play. The prevalent drink may be the least universal element of all: Chivas Regal and sweetened green tea is the Chinese version of vodka and Red Bull.  &apos;Adam Freeland niu bi!&apos; the crowd shouts as Freeland makes his way to the DJ booth at the 1+1 Club in Jinan. They are pointing at him, shouting, losing their minds. &apos;Niu bi! Adam Freeland niu bi!&apos;  &apos;I wasn&apos;t sure quite what they were on about,&apos; says Freeland, &apos;so I asked my Chinese friends.&apos; Niu bi is slang among Chinese rock fans for something like &apos;fucking great!&apos; The literal translation is altogether something else, however. &apos;It quite literally means &quot;the cow&apos;s cunt,&quot;&apos; Freeland says. &apos;I liked it so much more when I learned that. They are shouting &quot;Adam Freeland is the cow&apos;s cunt!&quot; It&apos;s like being called the dog&apos;s bollocks!&apos;  Almost 10 years ago, Freeland became one of the first Western DJs to play China, and so now, as a veteran of the circuit, he has seen the nature of the beast evolve first-hand. &apos;When I first played Beijing, there weren&apos;t even street lamps on every road. I arrived at night and every street we drove down was lined by these long strings of red paper lanterns lit with candles that shopkeepers put out.&apos; Freeland, a 33-year-old from Brighton who now calls Los Angeles home, reckons that he was the second Western DJ to play China, after &apos;some French techno guy&apos;. Back then the clubs were fairly dreadful and, though the crowds were curious and appreciative, Freeland&apos;s first gigs were a bit lost in translation, though worth the effort considering his healthy Chinese fanbase today.  When he tours, Freeland has made a habit of adding cities that he&apos;s never been to rather than following the same old route. And so, on a journey that has seen him through Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Singapore and which will, in China, take him to Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong before he heads off to Dubai, Freeland has opted to add Jinan, a city of nearly six million off the beaten path between Shanghai and Beijing. Jinan, formerly a textile and agricultural hub, has become a centre for the technology industry and has the evidence to prove it: landing by plane there involves a descent through two cloud layers, the first white and natural, the second black, dank and man-made. The hour-long ride from the airport is similarly treacherous, as trucks traverse lanes haphazardly next to old men on bicycles. The streets are littered with garbage and remaining in Jinan for any length of time will leave visitors with a scratchiness in the back of their throat.  Against this backdrop, however, is what Freeland calls &apos;one of the most pristine clubs I&apos;ve ever seen&apos;. The 1+1 features Allen and Heath Xone mixers and Nexo sound systems on each of its four levels as well as in the many VIP rooms. Lush, clean, modern design and a staff of absolutely stunning Chinese dancers, who undergo three costume changes (lingerie to camo shorts and tube tops to B-girl Adidas attire) during Freeland&apos;s set, round out the scene. An enormous poster of Freeland adorns the entrance of the club.  The love of pyro is even greater here in Jinan: there are more sparklers going round than in Shanghai and around the middle of the night, two entertainers hop onto the bar to breathe fire. As they spit flames not high enough above the patrons below them for my liking, the crowd goes absolutely mental for Freeland&apos;s mix of up-to-the-minute electro, snare-happy techno and spin-doctored rock&apos;n&apos;roll. The English language is not a strong suit among the locals, though enthusiasm for all things Western is: more than a few girls quite aggressively (and drunkenly) grab at my shoulder to engage in conversation. Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t get much further than a slurred greeting: &apos;Nee how?&apos; (the most basic form of hello). Perhaps since homosexuality is illegal in China, Jinan locals who, to the naked eye, clearly seem to lean that way, also appear more comfortable coming on to Westerners, even the uninterested, like myself, than they do to each other.  As Freeland test-drives cuts from his forthcoming album, How to Fake Your Own Life, due in the spring (&apos;It&apos;s the best thing I&apos;ve ever done,&apos; he says), the crowd eats up every beat, despite the tracks&apos; aggressive genre-hopping. Freeland has never played this city before and next to no one here or anywhere has even heard these songs, but the enthusiasm for his style is tangible, perhaps in part due to the efforts of the club&apos;s in-house DJ (and opener that night). Over a very traditional three-hour Chinese dinner with the club&apos;s owner, whose father made his fortune importing Japanese air conditioners, the opening act explained to Freeland that his classic remix of the Doors&apos; &apos;Hello, I Love You&apos; is a big local hit. &apos;We then discussed the pros and cons of minimal techno,&apos; Freeland says. &apos;Through an interpreter.&apos;  The club&apos;s owner, who was educated in America, is proud of the emerging club business in China and sees it as the wave of the future; an economic and cultural bridge between East and West. So, too, does George Hai, the promoter of Freeland&apos;s tour and perhaps the most well-known dance music promoter in China. A former radio DJ and journalist, Hai was the first person to play rock&apos;n&apos;roll on Chinese radio in 1992 and he began throwing raves with his partner, DJ Spark Lam, in Beijing about a decade ago. &apos;The government was against dance music because of what is associated with it - ecstasy, drugs,&apos; Hai says. &apos;But since the clubs are mainly full of people with money the government now cooperates because clubs create jobs. They allow people to come in from the countryside to find work.&apos; Unlike elsewhere, drugs are not prevalent in the clubs, but not necessarily for fear of the law. A drug arrest usually results in a one-month rehab programme, rather than jail time. &apos;But the rehab is not so popular,&apos; Hai says. &apos;You must wake up at 6am and exercise, like you would in the army, then spend the day learning all about what the drugs do to your body and brain.&apos;  Hai and his partner are responsible for importing a slew of Western talent; everyone from Carl Cox to Deep Dish, from Sasha to Nick Warren. He will continue to do so in 2008, not only because they&apos;re the best in the world, but also because there is no local Chinese dance scene to support. &apos;There are some artists making dance music here,&apos; he says. &apos;It&apos;s just not very good. It&apos;s too much of a copy and never original, so why not have the real thing? This type of music is not based in the Chinese musical tradition.&apos; Though electronic music is gaining new fans, it won&apos;t be blaring from Chinese radio any time soon. &apos;I would estimate that 10 per cent or less of our population listens to or even knows about this type of music,&apos; Hai says. &apos;But 10 per cent of 1.3 billion is still quite a lot.&apos; If the clubbers&apos; response to Freeland&apos;s deft mixes of Digitalism and Justice tracks are any indication, that number may have already increased.  Sometime in the late 1990s, The Face magazine started sending reporters to developing countries to report on their nightclub scenes. The same wide-eyed, most likely drug-fuelled, enthusiasm was maintained, with the writer claiming that although bombs might be dropping 50 miles away, Syria had an incredible rave scene! Today, yesterday&apos;s Third World is tomorrow&apos;s First.  In China at least, despite the tremendous increase in quality, the cost of clubbing remains competitive: five-star hotels can be pounds 80-100 a night, dinner in a top restaurant is about one-tenth of the cost of London, and the shopping and street fashion is among the best anywhere. Perhaps the greatest perk of all is a Chinese cultural institution tailor-made for clubbers: the 24-hour spa. Where else, after a night of dancing, can you enjoy a full range of massage and body treatments for roughly \u00a3 20-40?  That is precisely Adam Freeland&apos;s plan for his post-gig comedown in Beijing. &apos;The Oriental Pearl, right here in Beijing, is my favourite spa in all of China,&apos; he says. &apos;The buffet and the services, however you choose to go, are all excellent.&apos; Before he gets there, though, Freeland has a crowd to entertain. If Shanghai is the Chinese capital of electronic music, Beijing, with its sizeable student population, is known for rock and live music. Clubbing of the dance variety has been on the rise, however, and when the city hosts the 2008 Olympics its taste for the international is sure to expand further. The city is doing its part to make Beijing as worthy a world player as possible, including restriction on traffic, smoking, and spitting in an effort to clean up a typically dirty Chinese metropolis.  When the international hordes begin to arrive, Club Angel is sure to appeal to the jet set. Occupying a massive building in the Chaoyang district, Angel features a hard house room and a hip hop room in addition to the main room, which hosts a rotating roster of global talent. The decor is utterly opulent: tucked away rooms, plush ambient lighting, a plethora of glittering, hi-tech surfaces on the walls and floors, a stained glass ceiling above the dancefloor, backlit bars and tables and floor to ceiling glassed in coolers displaying bottles of vintage Chivas Regal.  As Freeland works the decks, a line of young men forms at the front of the DJ booth, which is at their eye level, to watch him work. Most are curious, but three stand abreast with crossed arms and a vaguely threatening glare. &apos;Those guys were staring me down like gang members would,&apos; Freeland says. &apos;Then midway into the set, I caught them smile at each other and get into it. But a moment later, they got back to glaring. I&apos;ve no idea at all what that was all about.&apos; As I watch the action from the dancefloor, I&apos;m approached by a young woman who later informs me that she works in a mobile phone factory. &apos;Nee-how!&apos; she says. &apos;You handsome! You best dancer in club!&apos; After a brief chat she&apos;s off to the loo. A moment or two later, I&apos;m tapped on the shoulder by a different young woman, this one a student. &apos;Nee-how!&apos; she says. &apos;You handsome! You best dancer in club!&apos;  Although quite the cosmopolitan city, Hong Kong lags behind its mainland counterparts in one crucial facet: its promoters. &apos;They are completely unreliable and untrustworthy,&apos; says George Hai. &apos;When my partner Spark and I promote in Hong Kong, we usually take a loss because we have to chase these local promoters for money. There are also not many good venues, so the choice is limited of who you are forced to work with.&apos; If Freeland&apos;s Hong Kong gig is any indication, Hai is correct: though posters of Freeland are noticeable everywhere in town, much less noticeable are the photocopied pieces of paper taped to each of them instructing fans that the venue has changed - a mere five hours before the gig.  Regardless, a huge crowd awaits the DJ as he enters the subterranean lounge of the Regal Hotel. Of all of the clubs on his Chinese tour, this is the least well-appointed. Aside from a few closed-off side rooms occupied by what appear to be Triad gang members, the club is more typical of an intimate, low-key Western venue - just an elevated DJ booth, some U-shaped banquettes, a huge bar and an open dancefloor. The crowd is more universally clubland here as well: for the first time, there are club kids in androgynous face make-up, and an abundance of dancers going for it in every conceivable style. Two of them are so moved by Freeland&apos;s mix of Rage Against the Machine&apos;s &apos;Killing in the Name&apos; that they stagedive - twice. &apos;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had that happen before in a club,&apos; he says. &apos;When they got up on the front of the booth I thought they were trying to grab a record or something.&apos; When I ask a very enthusiastic dancer how she likes Freeland&apos;s set, she gets on the tips of her toes (and I&apos;m just 5&apos;8&quot;) to say &apos;he great!&apos; A moment later she has something to add: &apos;I so drunk!&apos;.  China is in the midst of an expansion and both the Olympics and the government&apos;s increasing embrace - or simply its allowance - of an infusion of Western culture is sure to broaden an already accelerated scene. &apos;Three years ago, clubbing in China was a bit roguish, but now you&apos;re seeing nicer venues, specifically in places like Shanghai and Beijing, where you have an international crowd that&apos;s gravitating towards those cities,&apos; says Arash Shirazi of Bullit Bookings, whose clients include US house duo Deep Dish. &apos;I think you will see high-profile DJs spending more and more time there in coming years, particularly as competition will bring greater choice to the market.&apos;  Another factor that will drive the scene in Shanghai and Beijing at least is the influx of Europeans and Americans living there solely to soak up the moment. &apos;A lot of them are here to discover if Shanghai really is the Ibiza of Asia,&apos; says London/Hong Kong native Lin Lin, founder of multi-disciplinary design studio Jellymon. &apos;Thankfully, that&apos;s not true quite yet. Our city does, however, boast the highest unemployment rate among Westerners in all of Asia.&apos;  What is most interesting of all is the burgeoning underground scene. It is already dynamic, and still evolving. &apos;A great addition to Shanghai is the Shelter run by Gary Wang,&apos; says Lin Lin. &apos;Gary is known as the godfather of Chinese hip hop and his club is an old bomb shelter that&apos;s unlike anywhere else in the world, but still more about sharing music with an anything-goes approach than any kind of attitude.&apos; Though there are no local Chinese DJs or producers of international note at present, one thing is for certain: if China&apos;s overhaul of the superclub (not to mention industrial manufacturing, electronics, technology and science) is any indication of where they&apos;re going, then homegrown talent can&apos;t be far behind. Where to go: five top Chinese clubs Shanghai The VIP Room - 459 Wulumuqi Bei Road, Shanghai. Boasting truly futuristic design, VIP is the nightclub equivalent of the sci-fi Shanghai skyline. The Shelter - 5 Yongfu Road, Shanghai. Located in a former bomb shelter, Shelter&apos;s diverse musical line-up brings together the best of Shanghai&apos;s underground scene. Beijing Angel and Tang - No. 6 Gongti Xi Lu, ChaoYang District, Beijing. A true Chinese superclub, with various rooms catering to different musical taste. Enough Chivas Regal for all the green tea in China. Jinan 1 + 1 Club A superclub located in the Chinese equivalent of the middle-of-nowhere Midlands. Top notch sound and luxurious decor. Hong Kong Halo - 10-12 Stanley Street, Central, Hong Kong. Blade Runner meets bling. A private lounge/club that uses face-recognition technology to get in the door. Pharrel Williams and Bathing Ape&apos;s Nigo threw their local launch party here. \u00b7 Additional reporting by Matt Diehl", "tags": ["Electronic music", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-20T23:51:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jan/21/golf.sport", "sentences": ["Westwood secured his second top-two finish of the season after carding a closing 70, failing to fulfil his prediction that he could chase down Kaymer, 23, who began the day eight strokes ahead, in similar style to his stunning performance over the last nine holes of the HSBC Champions event in Shanghai in November."], "title": "Golf: Young German defies Westwood for first victory", "article": "Lee Westwood was delighted to leave the Middle East at the top of the Order of Merit and well on the way to securing a Ryder Cup place but rued a slow start to the Abu Dhabi championship.

Photograph: Liu Jin/AFP Looking for the true spirit of punk rock in 2008? Look no further than gig poster art. I never thought I would say this, but my current obsession is gazing at gig poster art. So all-engulfing is my infatuation that 11pm struck on the imaginary grandfather clock yesterday and, after 14 hours of solid gazing, I realised I&apos;d forgotten to brush my teeth, eat, or even walk the dog. With apologies to my cocker spaniel, I&apos;d reached nirvana without going to the trouble of snuffing it - that&apos;s how astonishingly great gig poster art is right now. Until recently, the idea that I would have been so utterly hooked by such a far-flung fetish would have been unthinkable. To me, gig poster art meant the lysergic images that emerged from San Francisco&apos;s Haight-Ashbury district in the late-60s, advertising shows by such genuine musical horrors as Grateful Dead and New Riders Of The Purple Sage. This was the kind of excuse for art that could only be properly appreciated, or indeed deciphered, with a fistful of magic mushrooms inside you. The gig poster experienced an energised rebirth in 1976/78, during which time it was nigh on impossible to pass a lamppost that hadn&apos;t been happy-slapped by some deliberately artless hand-made flyer advertising something as unmissable as &quot;Tonight at the Cirrhosis Arms, the Twats supported by Belch Fuel. Entrance 20p ONO.&quot; Then came rave culture where the artistic quality of the flyers and posters remained much the same, that&apos;s to say extremely shoddy, only difference being that different drugs were to blame for enticing revellers to fields in Hampshire where important parts of their brains were mislaid. It&apos;s hard to pinpoint the exact origins of the current revolution in gig poster art. Some would argue that it had its first stirrings as early as grunge. Most would agree that the emergence of the Post Neo Explosionism movement out of Seattle in 2002 was pivotal. Among PNE&apos;s alumni was the hugely talented Emek who made his name with high impact silkscreens for Flaming Lips and Weezer, and is probably most famous for his punchy design for Erykah Badu&apos;s 2005 tour, one that raised the bar high for gig art. Emek is one of 7,000 artists whose work is showcased on the user-friendly GigPosters.com site which offers up more than 82,000 poster designs, updated daily, and sufficiently defined so as to look truly spectacular when dropped into your iTunes to add visual oomph to your song collection. As their best, the new generation of gig poster artists create images that transcend commercial purpose and graphic design, attaining the status of true art. A few of the artists represented (Rob Jones, Dan Stiles, Jay Ryan and Scrojo) are so in-demand they&apos;ve become the unofficial stars of the poster scene. But GigPosters.com is dominated by the work of inspired amateurs who operate in smash-and-grab fashion, contacting bands directly and offering homemade designs for upcoming shows. The punk rock ethos extends to the subversive wit of much of the work displayed on the site. If you&apos;re looking for a place to start, why not check out my own favourite poster designer, Rob Jones whose work excites and inspires me like nothing since Anarchy In The UK was first let out of its cage.

Following steep sell-offs in Asian stock markets overnight, the FTSE 100 plunged more than 200 points within minutes of the open, adding to a sharp fall the previous session. With traders continuing to talk of a &quot;bloodbath&quot; in London and predicting &quot;carnage&quot; on Wall Street, the FTSE only tentatively clambered into positive territory. Property firms drove some short-lived gains for the index on talk that the market mayhem could prompt rate cuts sooner rather than later both in Britain and elsewhere. In choppy trade, the FTSE 100 was up just a few points at midday and then slipped back to be 5.6 points lower, or down 0.1%, at 5.572.6 by 12.05pm.

The US markets were closed yesterday for a public holiday and futures markets indicate traders could return from their long weekend to more gloom. The Dow is seen heading sharply lower at the opening bell, adding to the steep losses at the end of last week. Any fall is likely to intensify selling pressure in other markets. &quot;After being closed for the long holiday weekend, US indices are heading for carnage on the open,&quot; said Martin Slaney, head of derivatives at GFT Global Markets. &quot;There are all sorts of rumours flying around, particularly surrounding the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting rates today, ahead of the scheduled meeting next week, or even of coordinated action between the US, UK and European central banks. &quot;Any such action will depend on the severity of losses we see in the US today.&quot; Bargain hunting boosted some shares in London this morning as stocks that were hardest hit in yesterday&apos;s plunge were snapped up early on. Asset manager Schroders and building materials firm Wolseley were among the biggest risers. Financial Times publisher Pearson was also higher as it promised the City it would report a stellar 2007. The stock market dives around the world have been driven by fears that the US, the world&apos;s biggest economy, is headed into recession. Worries about property market prospects, demand for raw materials, consumer spending and turmoil in financial markets have knocked investor confidence across all sectors. &quot;With market nerves tested relentlessly by concerns that a sliding US economy could drag down global growth, risk aversion is spiking higher, causing equity prices to plunge,&quot; says Astrid Smit, head of investment strategy at ABN Amro Asset Management. &quot;It is too early to say that the worst has been priced in. But it would seem reasonable to assume that as recessions go, this downturn is likely to be short and mild.&quot; In the UK the ongoing woes of mortgage lender Northern Rock have added to the gloomy sentiment. Its troubles stem from gridlock in money markets - the credit crunch - which itself began with problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market - risky loans to borrowers with poor credit histories. Many of those loans have now gone bad. Troubles that started in America have spread around the world and stock markets in Asia have been particularly hard hit in recent days.  In Asia overnight, major stock markets fell heavily. Japan&apos;s Nikkei ended down 5.7% at its lowest level in more than two years. Shanghai&apos;s Composite index fell more than 7% to a five-month low. In Hong Kong, leading shares were down more than 8%. India&apos;s Sensex index plunged more than 12% at one point as panicky investors dumped shares. Sharp falls earlier prompted the market to be temporarily suspended. The fresh plunge for Asian stocks follows a grim Monday around the world for equity markets. Yesterday, the FTSE 100 ended down 323.5 points, or 5.5%, at 5,578.2. Almost \u00a377bn was wiped off the value of leading shares. It was the FTSE 100&apos;s biggest one-day fall in history in points terms. In percentage terms it was the sharpest one-day fall since September 11 2001, when the index shed 5.71%. &quot;It was carnage yesterday,&quot; said David Buik of Cantor Index. &quot;Apart from the US, where Martin Luther King Day was a public holiday, global markets fell around their ears. It was a bloodbath across the spectrum.&quot; The FTSE 100 is now down more than 13% since the start of the year. Monday&apos;s fall was driven by a torrid day for the miners, sharp falls for banks and pressure on energy stocks as fears intensified over the US economic outlook and the potential blow to demand for commodities from metals to fuel. This morning US crude slid below $87 a barrel, London Brent fell through $86.

Well, maybe you would if it were held in a BNP bastion (if they possess anywhere that might be so called). But surely not in Cadogan Hall, just off Sloane Square, home to some of the best-bred, most expensively educated people in Britain: Boris Johnson country. Boris was on the panel at the event, which had been put together by the London Evening Standard. So was I, and so was Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. And it was towards her that this particular volley of abuse was fired after, in response to a question from a saner member of the audience, she had had the temerity to suggest that there might, in certain circumstances, be a case for affirmative action to be employed. The crowd seemed to get even more upset when I agreed with Yasmin. And I went further, to say that Britain had actually been practising positive discrimination for decades, but that the beneficiaries had, by and large, been white men; so why shouldn&apos;t we level the playing field? The audience calmed down for a while we discussed transport and crime, and then, when I challenged Boris over the offensive remarks he made in the now-infamous article he wrote describing African children as &quot;picaninnies&quot; and their parents as having &quot;watermelon smiles&quot;, they went mad. Cadogan Hall was engulfed by a cacophony of boos, jeers, some &quot;shut ups&quot; and a few &quot;sit downs; and a couple of the normal people in the crowd told me later some more colourful language had also been spat my way: the sort of emigration advice Yasmin had been given earlier - which was pretty ironic seeing as I was the only London-born panellist. Where was I supposed to eff off back to? The other side of the river, I can only presume. Boris made what I&apos;m sure he thought was an apology &quot;if what I have said has offended anybody&quot;, but only succeeded in sounding sorry for himself. Rather oddly, the incandescent Sloane Square massive, oblivious to such sensitivities, cheered. But it seemed they were so blinded by fury that their hero could have insulted their mothers and they would have whooped and hollered in support. The mayoral candidate probably shouldn&apos;t have bothered saying anything: chances are Londoners, black and white, will judge him on the views he expressed before he wanted something from us. And I suspect some of the things he has said about the Chinese community are yet to come back to haunt him - possibly in a far bigger way, considering the importance of Shanghai to London in business terms. The evening&apos;s real eye-opener was the behaviour of Boris&apos;s fans. David Cameron and his troops are making an effort to distance themselves from their reputation for being the party that provides succour to the sort of racists who called John Taylor a &quot;bloody nigger&quot; in Cheltenham 18 years ago.

The Sierra Nevada is now largely safe and the government is keen to promote the Tayrona National Park to overseas tourists. Last year arrivals to the country grew by 15 per cent in the first seven months, fuelled by the government of President Alvaro Uribe, who has defanged many of the paramilitary and guerrilla groups. Cities and highways across Colombia are now much safer, domestic tourism has risen dramatically with holidaymakers flocking from the chilly, high-altitude cities of Bogot\u00e1 and Medellin to both the Caribbean and Atlantic coasts. Foreign investment is also flowing in at a record pace and the economy is booming.  This optimistic vibe is already coming across in the resort town of Cartagena, the country&apos;s main gateway to the Caribbean coast. It held its annual Hay Literary Festival late this January along its pastel coloured streets. Here writers and literary luvvies were talking about the film Love in the Time of Cholera adopted from Gabriel Garcia Marquez&apos;s book. The movie by British director Mike Newell looks set to further boost interest in Colombia when it is released this March.  Nine years ago the Nieto&apos;s switched from ranching cattle to charming tourists. Now Playa Koralia is a small property of 17 painted bungalows or caba\u00f1as with doors you can&apos;t lock. Yet safety here goes hand in hand with isolation. You are unlikely to see a soul as you walk along the miles of driftwood strewn beaches. And only a handful of houses ply the road on the incoming drive through the Parque National Tayrona - one of Colombia&apos;s most popular and biologically diverse national parks. The only thing that is likely to enter your room is a plate-sized moth.  &quot;We want everything to be natural here and for people to relax. There are no televisions, internet access or newspapers; we even confiscate people&apos;s laptops,&quot; says Nieto. Their organic fruit farm feeds the menu and there&apos;s also been no rush to clear the vast swathes of palm trees. This gives each caba\u00f1a a sense of privacy. The only thing that&apos;s loud around here is his sister&apos;s artwork. Patricia&apos;s vibrant and quirky ethnic designs from Latin America and Asia abound every surface from the toilets - no paper please - to the hammock strewn porches, with themes such as Shanghai and Nirvana.  The chilled out atmosphere is one of the reasons why Playa Koralia is growing in popularity with Colombian celebrities. It is over two hours by road from the bustling city of Barranquilla and one hour from Santa Marta, the oldest town in Colombia. Tired of being followed by paparazzi, singer Shakira has even booked in here.  It is also fashionable with overseas visitors from Spain and France, not to mention British ornithologists who come to twitch at the vast array of indigenous birds and yoga conventions that try to align themselves with the cosmic forces, which supposedly radiate at this spot. One entry in the guest book by someone called Gabriela - &quot;Un refugio deliciosa y calido!&quot; A deliciously warm refuge - really sums up Playa Koralia.

Figures released by the Civil Affairs Department revealed about 1.4 million couples divorced last year, up 18.2% from 2006. The number of divorces has been steadily rising since 1980 when the figure was just 341,000. The China Daily said the number of divorces could be far greater than the 1.4m figure as the official report did not include court-sanctioned divorces. However, marriages also increased in 2007, reaching 9.5m, up nearly 12% on 2006. Sociologists believe the rise in divorce can be linked to the one-child policy because the lone children resulting from the policy are said to be unable to sustain relationships, having grown up as little emperors and empresses in their own homes. Previous generations frowned on divorce, but the now-adult children can take advantage of a law passed four years ago that allowed couples to divorce in a day at a cost of just 10 yuan (70p). Xu Anqi, from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told The Global Times that frequent migration and longer working hours could also threaten relationships. The changing role of women in Chinese society is also a major factor in the rising divorce rate. Chen Xinxin, from the Women&apos;s Studies Institute of China, told Shanghai Daily that more Chinese women were financially independent so could easily become single. &quot;But the increase in break-ups does not mean that Chinese are losing faith in marriage,&quot; she said. &quot;They are looking for marriages of higher quality.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-01-25T12:35:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/25/comment.economics", "sentences": ["That contrarian instinct was reinforced this week by the way that Asian stock markets, including those in Mumbai, Shanghai and Hong Kong, reacted to markets in America and Europe by going through wild gyrations of their own.", "So sub-prime losses in America, bank fraud in France and panic in London are irrelevant to developers in Beijing or Shanghai."], "title": "Bill Emmott: We must not ignore the wild gyrations of Asia's traders", "article": "It is so nice when a consensus forms among economic commentators. There is going to be a recession in America, the pack says, and probably in Britain too, for we have both sinned with our debt, our deficits and our soaring house prices. But the world as a whole won&apos;t suffer, as the great emerging economies of Asia - China and India - will carry on booming regardless. News that China&apos;s output expanded by an extraordinary 11.4% last year, its fastest rate for 13 years, only strengthened this view. When a consensus is so clear, it is always time to wonder whether it might be wrong. That contrarian instinct was reinforced this week by the way that Asian stock markets, including those in Mumbai, Shanghai and Hong Kong, reacted to markets in America and Europe by going through wild gyrations of their own. A widely followed measure of such shares, the MCSI Emerging Asia Index, was at one point this week down 25% from its October high. Why should that be, if Asia is just going to boom on regardless? The answer is, in part, that stock market traders are wild, emotional creatures, and we risk going mad if we try to understand their every move. But another part of the answer is that the sanguine consensus is likely to be only half right. The half that is wrong offers good reasons for concern about Asia. The half of the consensus view that looks right is the half that says that China, India and the surrounding countries are no longer dependent on exports to the US, and neither are they dependent on foreign capital. Exports to America account for about 8% of China&apos;s gross domestic product and only 2% of India&apos;s, so while a big drop in those exports would have some effect, it is not going to be crippling. Moreover, it has already been happening: exports to the US from China have been declining for several months now, but overall growth keeps barrelling on. The reason is that capital is abundant, and it is being spent on new buildings, roads, stadiums, bridges, airports - you name it. In economic crises of old, the developing countries got hit twice over: by the loss of their export markets in the west, and by the withdrawal of capital by panicky international bankers and investors. In the past decade, the tables have been turned: China, other Asian economies (though not India) and the Arab oil producers have been the providers of capital to the west, not the receivers of it. One of the most extraordinary statistics about the Chinese economy is that capital investment accounts for 45% of GDP - the equivalent for the US and western Europe is 15% to 20%. That investment is being financed by China&apos;s own savings. So sub-prime losses in America, bank fraud in France and panic in London are irrelevant to developers in Beijing or Shanghai. As long as those developers keep on investing in new roads and buildings, the Chinese economy will keep on growing. Perhaps declining exports to America and Europe could reduce China&apos;s growth rate from 11.4% to, say, 9%. But that is still pretty good, and would still mean that China offers a strong market for its Asian neighbours. That is the correctly judged half of the consensus. It doesn&apos;t really apply to rich Japan, for its domestic economy is weak and so the loss of exports to the US will injure it more. Things are a bit different in India, which does need to import capital - unlike China it runs a deficit, but it too has an investment boom, and so far its companies have been finding it easier to raise capital since the credit dramas began last August, as investors desert the loss-making markets of the west. Where the consensus is likely to be wrong, however, is in its implicit assumption that these Asian economies are not going to be facing problems of their own - problems that do have some link to the difficulties facing America and Europe. Chief among those problems is inflation. Rising prices for food, energy and other commodities, partly caused by strong Asian demand, lie behind the high interest rates and inflation worries that were spooking the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and, until its big interest cut this week, the US Federal Reserve. They are also a big worry for India and, even more so, China. In recent years China has followed a policy of keeping its currency cheap against the dollar in order to help exports. To do that, its central bank has had to focus its monetary policy on the currency and not domestic inflation, building up vast foreign exchange reserves (today, at $1.4 trillion, the world&apos;s largest) and allowing credit inside China to be ultra-cheap. Hence all that investment in buildings and, by speculators, in Chinese share markets. But hence, too, rising inflation. Now, consumer-price inflation has topped 6%. Wages are also rising rapidly. The last time inflation got badly out of control in China was in 1988-89, which encouraged workers to join the student protests in Tiananmen Square. To avoid any repeat of that, government policy is beginning to change. The currency is being allowed to appreciate more rapidly against the dollar, thus reducing import prices. Interest rates are being raised. The revaluation is likely to accelerate, the clampdown on credit growth to get tighter. The danger is that China&apos;s investment bubble could then burst. The best parallel for China today is Japan in 1970. At that time, Japan had been using a cheap yen to boost exports, cheap capital encouraged an investment boom and environmental degradation prompted popular protests (remember Minamata disease - actually mercury poisoning?). Then, in 1971, Japan was forced by Richard Nixon to revalue the yen, and in 1973 the global oil shock brought inflation. The result? Not in fact a disaster for Japan, but a wrenching change: revaluation and rising industrial costs forced the economy to shift from the era of the motorcycle to that of the microchip. China faces the same sort of pressures now: currency revaluation, inflation, environmental damage. It now needs to move its economy sharply upmarket. As Japan showed during the 1970s, it can be done. But it won&apos;t be easy. Which is why those stock market traders in Asia were right to turn a bit wild and emotional this week.

And how is Ralph Herndon, a retired car assembly-line worker from Otisville, Michigan, connected to Mr Yu, who runs a handbag factory in Guangdong? It is the financial world&apos;s version of six degrees of separation, the current economic crisis has revealed the close connections and interdependencies between the US, the world&apos;s biggest capitalist economy, and communist China.  The huge glut of savings built up in Hu Jintao&apos;s China allowed that nation to lend billions of dollars to the US, which meant American consumers could embark on a borrowing and spending spree. But too many of those loans went bad, banks racked up huge losses, and CEOs like Chuck Prince paid with their jobs. When the stock market caught on to what was happening, shares tanked on fears that the US would fall into recession. That prompted Ben Bernanke to slash US interest rates by an extraordinary three quarters of a per cent last Tuesday. As the US economy has shifted away from traditional manufacturing to service industries, car plants like the one where Ralph Herndon worked have closed, because of cheaper competition from lower-waged economies like China. The Americans now hope that China, and other emerging countries with cash reserves, will bail out troubled banks and the world economy. But as Mr Yu has found to his cost, Guangdong is not immune to US troubles - 70 per cent of his American and Canadian customers are not paying their bills on time. The current crisis has raised fundamental questions about the merits of the American model. For many years, the US has lived beyond its means: borrowing heavily to gobble up cheap Chinese consumer goods; splashing out the proceeds of a decade-long housing boom; and preaching the benefits of liberated markets. Now the rest of the world is anxiously glancing eastward, in the hope that as America slides towards recession, the rising economic powers of Asia - in particular, China - will help to forestall a full-blown global crisis. But as Mr Yu would attest, the hope that the Chinese dragon can slay the American bear is a pretty vain one. A few decades ago, looking to China as the driver of global growth would have been unthinkable. Henry Kissinger, Nixon&apos;s Secretary of State, who was instrumental in opening up the channels of communication with China in the early 1970s, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week that he had no idea at the time that Beijing could emerge as an economic competitor. In Otisville, Herndon and his former colleagues at General Motors know all too well what it feels like to be on the sharp end of competition from China. Flying into Detroit, 70 miles away, planes soar above mile after mile of rusting cars, girders and industrial scrap in what looks like the biggest junkyard on earth. Herndon, who worked for GM for 30 years, says he was struck by a realisation last year. &apos;I thought to myself, they are paying these guys in China $3 a day to do what I have done all my life. No matter what cutbacks we offered the management, there is no way we can match that. I guess we are finished.&apos; Now it is the turn of the banks to feel the growing muscle of the Chinese. There could have been no more potent symbol of the shift of global power than the spectacle of America&apos;s mightiest banks begging for cash from government-backed sovereign wealth funds from China and the Middle East to cover the vast losses they have clocked up through reckless lending. But America has relied on Asian cash for years, locked in a bizarre financial embrace with the country that has become the world&apos;s factory, and in many ways its banker. Like many nations with a strong export sector, China has earned more than it could spend and has accumulated vast savings in the past decade.  Much of this cash has been sucked into the US, as Beijing opted for the dollar as the safest currency in which to keep its reserves. In effect, it has been lending billions of dollars to the American government. This wall of Asian cash has helped to keep the cost of borrowing down throughout the rich world and contributed to a series of asset price bubbles, in housing and in shares. The enthusiasm of sovereign wealth funds for buying up chunks of US banks - and a range of other companies - is the latest manifestation of this phenomenon. But economists have become increasingly nervous that the world is out of kilter, with some countries borrowing and spending too much, and others too little. Optimists argue this will not matter, because over the past decade there has been a beneficial &apos;decoupling&apos; in the global economic train: America is no longer the sole engine of international growth.  In its assessment of the economic prospects for 2008 this month, the World Bank set out a rosy scenario in which emerging markets would continue to expand strongly, despite the credit crunch and the slowdown already under way in the US. China, it predicted, would slow almost imperceptibly, from 11.3 per cent GDP growth in 2007 to 10.8 per cent this year. But the worldwide stock market rout at the beginning of last week, which spread through Asian markets and back to the US and Europe, suggested investors, at least, are not convinced that &apos;decoupling&apos; is really here. The idea of &apos;recoupling&apos; is suddenly in vogue. Although China has begun to generate expanding consumer demand of its own, its decade of 10 per cent annual growth has been largely on the back of an explosion in exports, so it is vulnerable to downturns elsewhere.  As he contemplates the future over a working lunch, Li Xihao, senior manager at garment manufacturer Shanghai Eswell, which exported $10m of its garments last year, is hoping that US troubles will not have knock-on effects in Sydney and Melbourne. &apos;We are worried about the American economy and it&apos;s very difficult to tell what the outlook is,&apos; he says. &apos;At the moment our major market is Australia and that still looks OK, so hopefully the business will not be affected. &apos; Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at consultancy Global Insight, expects US consumer spending growth to halve, from 3 per cent in 2007 to 1.5 per cent this year - and warns that China will be unable to escape completely unscathed. &apos;The US is too big not to be having an effect on the rest of the world.&apos; Yu in Guangdong would agree. More than 1,000 miles north, shoppers are snapping up clothes and accessories in Beijing&apos;s department stores. But his factory has thrived by aggressively marketing exports and has little to gain from the purchases of its compatriots. &apos;American economic problems have a very big influence on our business,&apos; he laments. &apos;We export mainly to America and Canada and because of the economic crises about 60 to 70 per cent of our bills haven&apos;t been paid in time. Even our old customers have all kinds of excuses. The exchange rate is dropping as the lending rate is going up and the salary for workers has also been increased, so it is getting more and more difficult to earn money. Many small factories have closed already and I guess I need to look for another job after spring festival [New Year].&apos; Stephen Green, an economist with Standard Chartered specialising in China, agrees that prospects are clouded in the short term. &apos;Inflation in China hasn&apos;t got better and the US situation is looking serious, so there&apos;s going to be a hit. But China is going to continue growing. We see it slowing from 11.5 per cent growth last year to 9.5 this year and 8.2 per cent next year. A large part of that is from the trade side.&apos; But the linkages of international trade are not the only mechanism for propagating the crisis. When rumours emerged that the People&apos;s Bank of China would have to write off a quarter of its $7.95bn of sub-prime securities last week, it underlined the importance of global financial markets in transmitting woes around the world . &apos;When people talk about decoupling, they&apos;re talking trade, but the linkages are very strong in finance,&apos; says Behravesh. &apos;It came as a big surprise to people that sub-prime manifested itself so fast in Europe and elsewhere.&apos; Hugh Young, MD of Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, warns that foreign investors nursing losses are likely to respond by taking a more cautious approach and bringing their cash home. That could exacerbate the stock market plunge in Asia, and make it harder for companies there to raise cash: &apos;We have no idea how much might be repatriated and by the time you start talking about it, it might already have happened. The Asian investor could take up the slack, but I don&apos;t know at what price.&apos; Even if China continues growing rapidly this year and the world escapes all-out recession, the speed at which the sub-prime fallout was amplified and spread has raised fundamental questions about the Anglo-Saxon economic orthodoxy of liberated financial markets. Since the radical financial liberalisation of the Thatcher and Reagan years, reining in the world&apos;s banks has become a taboo. But the damage wrought on ordinary borrowers and businesses by reckless lending could be felt for years. &apos;Beneath it all is this philosophy for regulators which says the markets are generally right,&apos; says Professor Avinash Persaud, of consultancy Intelligence Capital. &apos;But the reason we have financial regulation is that we have market failures.&apos; Philip Augur, a former investment banker and author of The Greed Merchants, which looked at the banks&apos; role during the dotcom crash, believes it is time for financial institutions to be more firmly controlled: &apos;Deregulation seems to have become &quot;unregulation&quot;. Financial services institutions are too large and powerful to be left to their own devices. Governments have had to intervene to save the world economy from significant instability. A different, more prudent approach will be needed in the future.&apos; Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel prize-winner and former chief economist at the World Bank, says: &apos;This is the third crisis for American financial markets in 20 years, and that should tell us something. The sub-prime issue is about predatory lending, but it has gone badly wrong. The situation has been created by financial institutions that have run amok.&apos; According to Stiglitz, the banks &apos;talked up&apos; their ability to manage risk, but the liquidity squeeze shows &apos;they didn&apos;t know what they were talking about&apos;. He adds: &apos;The banks&apos; incentive schemes need looking at. We thought these structures were about maximising corporate profits, but it seems they were more about maximising the profits of senior bankers and chief executives. There is an ideology that says the markets can solve all problems, but they don&apos;t.&apos; The UK, which under Gordon Brown&apos;s chancellorship deliberately mimicked the US approach, looks particularly vulnerable to both prongs of the current crisis - the comeuppance of consumers and governments living beyond their means; and the retrenchment of an over-mighty financial sector. &apos;The UK economy benefited disproportionately from the growth of the financial sector, so I would say it&apos;s more vulnerable than most, because this sector of the economy is going to contract ,&apos; says Russell Jones, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. &apos;I think the UK is quite vulnerable: you have a financial crunch, and it dominates the London economy, and in that sense the UK economy. Separately, we have the housing situation,&apos; says Behravesh. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has long talked about the &apos;rebalancing&apos; he would like to see in the UK economy, and he made clear in a speech last week that he believes a period of pain is necessary. &apos;Tighter credit conditions mean that, as a nation, we are likely to save more of our income this year than in the recent past. In the short run, that will slow economic activity, possibly quite sharply,&apos; he told his audience in Bristol. &apos;The adjustment which not only the British but the world economy is experiencing is necessary as the imbalances, between spending and saving and between domestic demand and trade, unwind.&apos; The unwinding King hopes for has been postponed many times as central banks have stepped in to kick-start the borrowing binge just as a reckoning seemed in order. In Davos, Stephen Roach, the bearish Asian president of Morgan Stanley, criticised Alan Greenspan for failing to rein in the boom several years ago: &apos;The Fed&apos;s attitude is that it is here to clean up after bubbles burst, not prevent them from happening... this is a dangerous, irresponsible and reckless way to run the world&apos;s largest economy.&apos;  When the cash taps have been turned on so long, it can be hard to turn them off. As Graham Turner, of consultancy GFC Economics, says: &apos;We caused this problem by having runaway credit growth, now we&apos;re trying to solve it by cutting interest rates. It&apos;s rather like a heroin addict: you can say they shouldn&apos;t have got addicted, but once someone is addicted, you don&apos;t take away their drugs overnight.&apos; The big question now is whether the US - and the UK - will finally have to go cold turkey. Diary of a fund manager: &apos;Monday felt like capitulation&apos; Ted Scott manages more than \u00a32.5bn of equities at F&amp;C Asset Management, including the F&amp;C UK Growth &amp; Income Fund. He also manages the Stewardship Growth and Stewardship Income funds, the oldest and largest ethical funds. Monday I came into work feeling pretty apprehensive. I had to see a client in the morning and I tried my best to reassure them about the stock-market falls. At lunchtime I went to the gym and had a session with my personal trainer, which relieved some stress. It did feel a bit like capitulation on Monday. I just stood back and didn&apos;t do any dealing.  The markets have lost confidence in the whole theory of decoupling - the idea that Asian markets could be immune to an American recession. Tuesday I bought some shares in Tui Travel, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Legal &amp; General, adding to our existing holdings. I was having lunch at my desk when Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, made an emergency rate cut. The market rallied, but then it came off, because it seemed to confirm that the American economy really did have very deep problems.  Wednesday Today and Thursday we are doing a roadshow and I have to make a series of presentations to investors. People are wondering why the stock market has fallen so much in the last couple of weeks. In retrospect, the markets were too sanguine earlier on.  In the evening we took the investors out to the Albert Hall to see the latest Cirque du Soleil, so I had a very late night and was a bit tired.  Thursday The story about the French rogue trader at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, was seen almost as good news. If he was responsible for the market fall on Monday, then it is a specific issue relating to one bank - and that is a much more palatable explanation than broader fears. I was very busy with the roadshows, but I managed to have a brief swim - just half an hour. Friday I did a few trades, including taking a substantial profit in Tui Travel, which I bought earlier in the week. I bought a couple more defensive shares. If we avoid a UK recession, then now is a good time to buy things like banks or housebuilders. Personally, I think we might have a recession, but it will be a shallow one.  Weekend I&apos;m playing golf on Saturday for the first time in three months; I haven&apos;t had time because of my two young children.  On Sunday we are going to see my parents. I won&apos;t be thinking about the markets, but I will be hoping for a better week starting on Monday.

Barclays lost 1% on the day, while Royal Bank of Scotland was down nearly 3% by the close, while Barratt Developments slid by 6.3%. Tokyo had momentarily been buoyed by last week&apos;s cut in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve, but a drop on Wall Street on Friday reawakened caution among Japanese investors. Today&apos;s losses all but cancelled out the 4.1% gain made in Tokyo on Friday. The plunge came amid warnings that Japan had already entered a recession or would do so in the first half of this year. Tetsufumi Yamakawa, chief economist at Goldman Sachs Japan, said five of 11 main business performance indicators had deteriorated. If the number of failing components reaches six, it indicates a recession. &quot;A recession, which was nothing more than a risk scenario six months ago, is now turning into our main scenario,&quot; due to a slowdown in exports to and stagnation in the domestic housing market, Yamakawa said. Among the biggest losers were Nippon Steel, the world&apos;s second-biggest steel maker, which lost 7.7%. The firm said its pre-tax profit for the nine months to December had fallen 0.7% The strengthening yen put further pressure on Japanese exporters, with Toyota falling 4.1%, Canon 4.9% and Sony 4.5%.

Renewed evidence of the depths of the housing slump in the US left Wall Street convinced that the US central bank would follow last week&apos;s 0.75 percentage point reduction in its base lending rate with another half-point cut tomorrow night. The prospect of a fifth cut in US interest rates since September put downward pressure on the dollar and pushed investors into the safe haven of gold, which rose to a record level of $929.20 an ounce during London trading yesterday.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was 100 points higher, with traders convinced that the Fed had no choice but to cut rates to 3% in view of data showing new home sales down by more than a third on a year earlier. Dimitry Fleming, an economist at ING Financial Markets, said: &quot;No matter which way you look at it, the December new home-sales report is simply awful.&quot; In December, demand for new homes dropped 4.7% month on month to an annual rate of 604,000 - the lowest level since February 1995. He added that in the three months to December, new home sales fell at an annualised rate of 35% and for 2007 as a whole were down 26% on 2006 - the weakest performance since official figures were first collected in 1963. The biggest declines were in the south and west - regions unaffected by the bad weather in the east and the mid-west.

The UK group has invested \u00a341m alongside Guangzhou Pharmaceutical with the aim of cashing in on China&apos;s fast-growing demand for Western drugs. China is currently the ninth largest market for pharmaceuticals in the world, with sales of \u00a313.8bn last year, and is forecast to be the sixth biggest within two years. Western medicines currently account for 75% of the market, with most sales coming through hospitals. However, the Chinese government has signalled it wants to shift to a more western model of retail pharmacies. State-owned Guangzhou Pharmacaeuticals is the fourth largest drugs wholesaler in China, with shares listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai. It has 3% of the Chinese market, but has 16% of the market in its home province of Guangdong, which has a population of 80 million, rapid economic growth and a fast-rising per capita income.  GP operates eight depots and has 2,000 employees. Last year 85% of its sales were Western medicines. The new business will report to Ornella Barra, Alliance Boots&apos; commercial director. The UK group is making its investment through Alliance BMP, a British based investment vehicle 80% owned by Alliance Boots and 20% by Beijing Med-Pharm, a US-listed drugs marketing and distribution company that operates in China. The joint venture deal is the first the group has done since leaving the Stock Exchange last summer. Stefano Pessina, the listed company&apos;s former deputy chairman who masterminded the buyout alongside private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, said at the time of the buyout that small deals in emerging markets such as this were vital to build the business for the future. He insisted that the group&apos;s stockmarket listing, and investors&apos; demands for rapid results, would make such deals difficult. Pessina said the Guangzhou deal could be the first of many: &quot;Bringing together the experience of Alliance Boots with GP Corp&apos;s excellent local knowledge and market position will make GP Corp a powerful business, well placed to benefit from both the rapid expansion of the Chinese healthcare market and further consolidation opportunities as they arise.&quot; The Alliance Boots buyout was the first time private equity had targeted a FTSE 100 company and is now seen as the high-water mark for the private equity business.

Tony Blair&apos;s retirement earnings since June 27 vary by several million pounds depending on what newspaper you read. But no one seems to dispute that the former Labour party chairman, Ian McCartney, is being paid as much as \u00a3100,000 to advise a large US multinational, the Fluor Corporation. That&apos;s because it&apos;s true. The interesting bit is the &quot;why?&quot; McCartney still calls himself &quot;the socialist MP for Makerfield&quot; on his Lancashire constituency notepaper. He rang to explain - as he will in greater detail tomorrow when he gives evidence to the Commons public administration select committee (Pasc)&apos;s investigation into lobbying. The way the tenacious MP tells it (at just 5ft1in tall you have to be tenacious) is that he will not get a penny for his personal - or family - use, but that he needs the money to do his job as well as he sees fit.  Nor will he lobby government ministers, civil servants or fellow-MPs on behalf of Fluor, let alone about its interest in Sellafield clean-up contracts. What he provides the Americans (with their 3,000 UK employees) is advice and explanation of government policy, what the Queen&apos;s speech or employment law means to an overseas firm, how to tackle union relations properly, even the impact of the Bali climate summit. As a minister or shadow minister for 20 years, he knows his stuff. All legitimate; it&apos;s been cleared by the advisory committee on business appointments, chaired by the Tory peer, Paddy Mayhew QC, who stood up to Margaret Thatcher as attorney general in the Westland affair. But why does he want the money if he doesn&apos;t need it? Because he has plans. Like many MPs McCartney has used his allowances - the ones that got Derek Conway into trouble - to establish his parliamentary back-up team in his Wigan constituency, not at Westminster. He calls it a skills centre, a community room, a drop-in centre for constituents in an old industrial area. He seems quite proud of it. All legit too. So the Fluor money, he will tell the Pasc committee tomorrow, will be used to finance a proper office with paid staff (with pension contributions too, not the unpaid interns some MPs use) at Westminster. That and his projects. Back in 2006 this Prescott ally and former manual worker told Gordon Brown he wanted to leave government when Blair went: &quot;It doesn&apos;t leave you any life of your own.&quot; He was not persuaded then or later to change his mind. He had some serious heart surgery a while back and had to lose four stone, a lot for a small frame to bear. But at 56 his backbench ambitions remain large. He has become president of the Money for Advice Trust, which tries to give individuals and small businesses face-to-face advice that will keep them away from loan sharks. As a former trade minister he&apos;s keen to promote UK-China trade ahead of the 2010 world expo in Shanghai, whose UK commissioner-general (whatever that is) he has become. He&apos;s keen on global workers rights. Asbestos is another of his sidelines. McCartney has an interest in promoting better safety for fireworks and furniture - with the fire service and manufacturers - and wants to improve floods policy, including to spread the insurance risk arising from flood damage. In old mining areas like his there are particular problems, often several times a year.  Flooding is sometimes a euphemism for sewage, but I don&apos;t detect any here. McCartney - who will give evidence tomorrow with Tory John Greenaway and Lib Dem Nick Harvey - believes the UK lobbying industry should be much more transparent and more formally regulated.  HAVE I  been sold a hard-luck story by an MP whose motives were maligned in the press? Possibly, but I doubt it. Plenty of other MPs in all parties lead quietly virtuous lives doing good, just like Dorothea Brooks in Middlemarch. Even rascals do good too sometimes. Saints can be ineffectual. Derek Conway&apos;s fate may now rest on whether or not the good people of Old Bexley and Sidcup rate him as their local member. It is an iron rule that if constituents like you they will put up with quite a lot, whatever the party bosses or Fleet Street think. With Rudy Giuliani&apos;s defeat in the Florida Republican primary, realism seems to be taking its inevitable grip on the US presidential race. He&apos;s an Italian New Yorker, his name ends in a vowel, he&apos;s been much-married, photographed in drag, is soft on gays and abortion... I don&apos;t think the former mayor ever had much chance in middle America, however well he did on 9/11.  Why? I did live link-up between Radio 2 and a drive-time radio show in Chicago the night after 9/11. Twenty-four hours after the disaster a smart radio host 1,500 miles west of New York wondered why we all sounded so glum. Because of the Twin Towers, we answered. But we did that yesterday, he told our own BBC host, Fi Glover, and a startled panel in London. We&apos;re trying to be more cheerful; only two or three bodies have been found, he countered. That&apos;s because the other 10,000 may have been vaporised, one of us gently explained. He reluctantly took the point. All right, it was only 3,000 dead in the end, but Chicago is a great world city. If they didn&apos;t get it there, don&apos;t bet on Alabama.

That may be accurate, but it&apos;s only one of the effects the world&apos;s leading player can extract from it: Wu Man&apos;s pipa can crack jokes, sing sweetly, caress, howl or roar - sounds you&apos;d scarcely dream it was possible to produce with 10 fingernails and four strings over a shallow rosewood box. I first encountered Wu on a gruelling central Asian tour with Yo-Yo Ma and his Silk Road Ensemble in 2004. At every stop she produced a winning combination of virtuosity and glamour, and Ma clearly regarded her as his prize performer. But her fan club goes wider than that. Ryuichi Sakamoto drafted her in for the soundtrack of The Last Emperor; Ang Lee used her music in his first two directorial hits, The Wedding Banquet and Eat Drink Man Woman; and Bill Clinton made her the first Chinese musician to play at the White House. She has performed with some of the world&apos;s best symphony orchestras, and made records with musicians from the unlikeliest backgrounds, including the Bollywood diva Asha Bhosle. Composers who have written for her include Lou Harrison, Philip Glass, Tan Dun, and Terry Riley, in whose extraordinary The Cusp of Magic she plays and sings alongside her regular collaborators, the Kronos Quartet. Not bad for someone who arrived in New York penniless and speaking no English 17 years ago, carrying an instrument no westerner had heard of. To discover how it all happened, I catch Wu after a chamber recital in Paris where she gave a multimedia performance of a new piece by Chen Yi, and more than held her own against a flamboyant percussionist. Born in 1963 in a town near Shanghai, Wu describes herself as &quot;a child of the Cultural Revolution&quot;. Her artist father was banished to the countryside, a punishment that marked them both deeply. But she loved the marching bands and Madame Mao&apos;s Eight Model Operas. It was a song from one of them that a neighbour heard her sing while she was working in the communal laundry, aged eight. &quot;He was so surprised by my musicality,&quot; she recalls, &quot;that he told my parents I should study music. Another neighbour saw me dance, and suggested I study that.&quot; She began to take lessons on a miniature version of the pipa called a liu qin, became fanatical about practising, and was soon launched into orbit, triumphing first in local auditions, then in national ones for the Beijing Conservatoire. At 13 she was crowned the top junior pipa player in China. At the end of her conservatoire stint, she again passed out top, and was made a professor. There are 10 key pieces in the traditional pipa repertoire, and every professional player has to know them. They are as important to the tradition as Bach&apos;s 48 Fugues and Preludes are to the western piano canon. &quot;People said to me, you are the rising star, the next pipa master,&quot; says Wu. &quot;But I couldn&apos;t limit myself to the 10 big traditional pieces all my life - that would have been a prison. So I thought, what&apos;s next?&quot; Fleeing the unnatural silence that fell on the streets of Beijing after the Tiananmen Square massacre - &quot;We didn&apos;t even dare to practise in private&quot; - she took her pipa (plus four other string instruments) to New York, where she was welcomed with open arms by an expat Chinese ensemble. Performing with them in churches, hospitals and libraries, she began to build a reputation without realising it. The turning point came with a phone call from David Harrington, leader of the Kronos Quartet, who had seen a video of her performing a piece by her fellow expat Zhou Long. Harrington says seeing that video was like hearing, say, Jascha Heifetz, the Lithuanian-born virtuoso violinist, for the first time. But Wu was blissfully unaware of what his call might mean: &quot;I didn&apos;t know who the Kronos Quartet were, until a friend told me.&quot; What it meant was the start of a creative partnership which has led to several others. When Wu and Kronos premiered Tan Dun&apos;s Ghost Opera in 1995, Terry Riley happened to be in the audience: thus began another partnership, with Riley accompanying her by singing and playing the tanpura drone instrument. &quot;I loved her openness, her vulnerability to new ideas,&quot; he says. &quot;I realised that her nuances on the pipa, what happens between the notes, were very similar to the way they are in Indian classical music.&quot; Considering these collaborations, and parallel ones with the Romanian Gypsy group Taraf de Ha\u00efdouks and the Azerbaijani mugham singer Alim Qasimov, Wu comes out with a sudden declaration: &quot;I don&apos;t want to be thought of as a world-music specialist. I am simply a musician.&quot; Yet her first allegiance is still to her homeland, and to the music the Maos failed to stamp out. Last summer she researched the music of Shaanxi province: &quot;It was fascinating, with storytellers and puppet shows, and local opera and folk songs, and Taoist priests chanting. My hope is to bring some of those groups to the west, and to play with them.&quot; The Chinese government is beginning to see the point of preserving this music, and also of capitalising on Wu - she has been invited to help open the Special Olympics in Shanghai. &quot;They are happy for me to give masterclasses to students, but though I&apos;m respected in Chinese musical circles - and have pipa followers, who play the pieces I have premiered - I&apos;m not famous like Lang Lang.&quot; Quite so. In China the piano has now eclipsed the pipa, to a point where the Chinese instrument&apos;s future probably lies more with enthusiasts in the west. But with avant gardists leaping on Wu&apos;s bandwagon, while she adds to the mix by also using the pipa for jazz, we shouldn&apos;t forget the traditional repertoire of the versatile instrument, which carries within it the sounds of the guitar, banjo, koto and cimbalom. The titles of medieval pieces indicate its original aesthetic purpose, which was to evoke both &quot;wen&quot; (pacific) and &quot;wu&quot; (martial) moods, echoing the Taoist &quot;yin yang&quot; as the ideal balance. Thus The Speckled Dove Crosses the River, A Lady Grooming and the wonderful Too Lazy to Paint Eyebrows would be countered by the thunderous The Tyrant Removes His Armour. To do these justice, you need a technique like Wu&apos;s, with its brilliant finger-picking, machine-gun tremolos and ferocious strumming. Wu now lives in San Diego with her Chinese husband and young son, but her relationship with her pipa is clearly just as important. How would she sum up her feelings for it? &quot;My instrument is my child, my lover, the other half of me.&quot; She lays an affectionate hand on its closed box. &quot;We&apos;ve been through so many things together, in the last 30 years.&quot;  \u00b7 Terry Riley&apos;s The Cusp of Magic, with the Kronos Quartet and Wu Man, is released on February 4 by Nonesuch", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-01T00:13:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/feb/01/buildingbiggerisnotalways", "sentences": ["Such Shanghai-meets-Las Vegas towers can be exciting and if they are like Foster&apos;s Swiss Re, we do them well."], "title": "Building bigger is not always better", "article": "Two carbuncles and a Gherkin ...

These aggressive &quot;icons&quot;, as all big new buildings are called today, are the 4x4s of the architectural world. Priapic, energy-gobbling, wind and shadow-inducing, they are symbols of the financial might of the City; and each makes the old City, its lanes, alleys, courts, its lovely necklace of surviving churches by Wren and Hawksmoor, look puny, insignificant and very much beneath them; about 600-ft beneath them as it happens. Such Shanghai-meets-Las Vegas towers can be exciting and if they are like Foster&apos;s Swiss Re, we do them well. Yet pretty much every one of the latest proposals is better suited to developments outside the City, such as Canary Wharf, if at all. If we are going to build new towers in the City they have to be very much better designed than the latest crop of proposals. These air-conditioned, global-style towers will place a huge onus on the City. Of course the City, like the shark it is, has to move forward to survive, but why not have both things: a pin-striped old City, as it were, and a dress-down Friday kind of City to its east?

An owl was hooting from the deep forest and the farmer&apos;s water buffalo was munching noisily on dry corn stalks. We were snacking on home-grown persimmons and walnuts while supper was being prepared on a bio-gas stove. This cannot be, I was thinking. China is a new coal-fired power station every week, 49 extra petrol stations per day, and one million cars leaving the forecourts every two months. It&apos;s a typhoon of scary statistics swirling us all off to hell, not this rural idyll. I was a guest of the family of Lily Zhang, a dynamic young woman from the Naxi (pronounced Nashi) minority of Yunnan. With assistance from the American charity Nature Conservancy, her family and 23 others, all peasant farmers, have clubbed together to create an ecotourism company, Xintuo Ecotourism. They offer treks through the stunning mountains around Yunnan&apos;s famed Jade Dragon Snow mountain, home-stays with Naxi families and visits to other ethnic minorities. Most of all, they offer the chance for the visitor to see a side of China that rarely gets exposure in the western media: one that cares about its environment and culture.  Nothing in Nanyao, Lily&apos;s village, quite squared with anything I had expected. Where were the pesticide-drenched crops, the dead rivers and the fumes? How come there were young people who wanted to stay and farm, not head off to the bright lights of Guangzhou? How come there were solar water heaters on the pantiled roofs, and plenty of trees on the hillsides? &quot;From about two years ago people started installing solar power, and bio-gas,&quot; Lily explained next morning when we walked around the village. &quot;It means less wood-cutting for charcoal - our traditional fuel. There is a lot of concern here about global warming and our environment.&quot; In fact, Lily&apos;s brother was busy helping a neighbour put the finishing touches to a bio-gas plant - a large underground tank that fills up with pig muck, then produces methane gas which is piped to a two-burner hob in the kitchen. &quot;My father built a greenhouse over our tank,&quot; said Lily. &quot;The extra warmth means we get a longer strawberry season.&quot; We strolled on around the village, a place well-stocked for winter, judging by the racks of drying turnips and corn, the hams hanging in smoky barns, and the vast stooks of pine needles that are used as animal bedding. Down in the centre, old people in Mao caps were tucking into a breakfast of steamed bread and honey. Most of the ladies wore traditional Naxi dress, a kind of tasselled apron worn over blouse and trousers. Younger folk were already out working in the fields: the plum blossom had just opened, scenting the air with a delicate perfume, and now the trees had to be irrigated by diverting icy mountain streams into the groves above the village. I was on a week-long hike out of the nearby main city of Lijiang, a place that suffered a devastating earthquake in 1996 and was subsequently rebuilt in traditional style. Day One had been a stiff climb up to Wenhai lake at 10,000ft. There, the local Naxi community have built a visitors&apos; lodge, a delightful traditional wooden house with stirring views up the valley to Jade Dragon Snow mountain. Wenhai was once a station on the Tea Horse Road, a mule track that led from the tea fields of southern Yunnan up through the mountains into Tibet. On Day Two we followed the old trade route again, climbing over a 12,000ft pass, then dropping down through forests of azaleas, rhododendrons, pines and oaks (April-May is best for flowers). Lunchtime brought us into a village of the Yee people, a hill tribe minority who live by herding sheep and cattle along high trails. The women wear a bizarre head-dress, a sort of medieval Guinevere outfit that rises from the nape of the neck in a huge black triangle. &quot;We do get blown over by the wind sometimes,&quot; one old lady admitted to me, after we had been invited in to warm ourselves around the communal fire. There is no chimney in Yee houses, handy for smoking the hams and sausages strung up in the roof beams. &quot;We are White Yee,&quot; the old lady explained. &quot;We came here from Sichuan in the days before Chairman Mao to escape from slavers of the Black Yee tribe.&quot; Another old lady showed me the hand and arm tattoos she had, done as a child to deter the slavers. Two days before, I had been in ultra-modern Shanghai; now, I felt I was plunging into a more ancient China, the one Marco Polo knew when he passed through Yunnan seven centuries ago. From outside, I could hear the raised voices of two Yee women bartering with a trader. She had arrived on foot, bearing a basket on her back, and was offering to exchange socks for balls of human hair. Around the fire, everyone agreed that life was much better now, even if a fistful of hair was only worth two pairs of socks. Food was certainly plenty: they had slaughtered a pig the day before and now we were treated to a feast, steaming piles of meat ladled from the cookpot over the fire. Once that was dealt with, the old ladies leaned back, filled their pipes and started discussing where human beings had originally come from. Some argued we were the descendants of monkeys, but one old lady assured me it had been frogs. Tea was served in jam jars; children and dogs romped on the floor; everyone talked and laughed at the same time. Lily was quick to point out how being a guide had altered her own attitudes to people like the Yee. &quot;You know, I had never been inside a Yee house before. I was a bit afraid of them. They live close to us Naxi, but have a very different way of life. I didn&apos;t want to know them!&quot; &quot;And now?&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve learned they are very special. They don&apos;t have much money, but they help each other a lot, and enjoy life. I&apos;ve made a lot of friends with them.&quot; Lily&apos;s experience is matched by that of her other guides. All come from ethnic minorities, none have travelled outside Yunnan, and all can speak authoritatively on the life of farming and herding - they have all done it. For anyone used to the slick patter of tour guides, they are a breath of fresh air, quite likely to present you with armfuls of fruit from their orchard, or to burst into song at the beauty of a mountain scene.     Kevin Rushby on Thousand Tortoise Mountain. Photograph: Sophie Carr    Shwei Mae, my guide for the second half of the week, was a case in point. Climbing up what is known as Thousand Tortoise mountain we caught a glimpse of a breathtaking vista of forested mountains and a rock pinnacle split down the middle. Seeing it, Shwei Mae (literally Snow Plum) started singing a Naxi ballad, the one about two doomed lovers. Hiking in China is in the early stages of development - the stage when most people consider it a form of lunacy. &quot;My friends don&apos;t understand at all,&quot; Shwei Mae told me, &quot;but I love being out in the mountains.&quot; This lack of interest does mean that an area like that around Thousand Tortoise mountain, a protected park, is almost unexplored by hikers, despite being on a visual par with a world-class site like Yosemite in California. All around us were deep romantic chasms and soaring peaks. In a few places, clearings in the trees denoted settlements of the Lisu tribe, but mostly this is uninhabited territory close to the point where Burma, Tibet and China meet. My final two days were spent trekking the high-level trail up Tiger-Leaping gorge, the geological marvel created by the Yangtze river burrowing its way between two 18,000ft snow-clad mountain ranges. Recently saved from flooding by a hydro-project, it is now inundated with western backpackers and Chinese tour buses. The high trail views are still magnificent, but judging by the rate of development in the trailside villages, I think it will not be long before some travellers find this place overcrowded. I was lucky to be there in winter: July and August are particularly busy. &quot;It&apos;s hard for a small company like ours,&quot; Lily told me over a last-night supper in Lijiang&apos;s old town. &quot;Chinese tourists don&apos;t yet understand the concept of ecotourism. They like modern hotels with plenty of TV channels, not a Naxi village with chickens running around. They want access by road, not on foot.&quot;  Outside the window, groups of Chinese tourists were wandering down the cobbled lanes in search of souvenir stalls staffed by girls in pristine traditional Naxi outfits. The government&apos;s recreation of Lijiang&apos;s old town may lack authenticity for some purists, but the combination of lantern-lit restaurants and pan-tiled teahouses is a brave stab at pleasing both sides of the Chinese visitor market - domestic and international. &quot;Are there many similar ventures to yours - farmer cooperative travel companies?&quot; &quot;No, I think we are the first - I know lots of other villages are watching to see if we succeed.&quot; If I needed proof of how close to the land this travel company is, I got it next morning when I was leaving. Lily pushed some fruit in my hand. &quot;You&apos;ll need this for the journey.&quot; We said goodbye, then she dashed away to the market to meet her mother. &quot;She&apos;s coming down to sell some things - I don&apos;t know what - a basket of walnuts, a pig, maybe some honey.&quot; Watching Lily walk away, I saw her look up and see the distant glimmer of ice on Jade Dragon Snow mountain. Then she started singing.

Here&apos;s how the swindle unfolded. Asking directions just off Tiananmen Square on our first evening in Beijing, my wife and I were approached by two Chinese &quot;students&quot; who offered to take us on a tour of the hutong, the labyrinth of medieval back streets that encircle the city.  Along the way, a dainty traditional teahouse materialised out of the darkness, complete with carved wooden booths and walls decked with scroll paintings of mountains and dragons. There was even a monk in the corner, intently practising his calligraphy.  On cue, a beautiful young waitress - whose name, we were told, was Fairy-Angel! - wafted in and announced that a tea ceremony was about to begin. She produced a tray of different teas and served up some delectable numerology: seven for friendship, eight for wealth and - my choice - nine for long life. She then brewed up each tea in a glass pot before serving them in thimble-sized cups. All had restorative properties and were accompanied by intricate tales involving the tea-loving Emperor Qianlong, who frequented Beijing&apos;s teahouses in disguise, causing his entourage to kowtow in code using their fingers on the table-top. But most captivating aspect was the teas themselves; the most delicious little cuppas I&apos;d ever tasted. One was brewed not from leaves but from what looked like fine aromatic gravel and tasted like sweet, sooty ginger. Another fluttered magically in the pot and was phenomenally bitter and bracing. Soon, our booth had descended into an orgy of titanic tea-tasting. And then it came, like a grenade lobbed into the festivities: the wallet-busting bill, the Yuan equivalent of an eye-popping \u00a3200. Even after an extended bout of haggling, the amount was still enough to cover a year&apos;s supply of tea anywhere in the world. But once the shock had subsided, we couldn&apos;t help feeling strangely elated. As our first big test, the tea ceremony couldn&apos;t have been a more a staggering illustration of the whole purpose of our mission in China. Our brief for the trip was disarmingly simple. Received wisdom dictates that China should only be tackled in the regimented ranks of a hermetically sealed, full-service tour. The Chinese Embassy reinforces this by tying up independent travellers in visa red tape. However, our long-held dream of travelling through this vast country didn&apos;t featured being bused around, plugged into each sanitised sight, shackled to a claustrophobic band of foreigners. We were determined to make our own sweet, unchaperoned way across the entire length of China, using only local transport, from Beijing to the Terracotta Army in Xian, from the inhospitable deserts of the northwest to the holy mountain of Emei Shan and along the Yangtze before crossing the finish line in Hong Kong. Everyone - particularly those who had found five-star tours gruelling - told us that the idea was sheer lunacy. Many hotels are still not authorised to accept foreigners. Train tickets are snapped up faster than a Led Zeppelin reunion concert. China veterans warned of everything from being gawked at like pop stars to spitting in public to partition-less toilets that allow users to &quot;squat and chat&quot;. After our tea ceremony misadventure, we wondered if the doom-mongers had a point. But, next morning, we dusted ourselves down and headed back out into the field. We kicked off with the exhilarating expanse of Tiananmen Square and marvelled at its inhuman scale, borne down on one side by the gargantuan, colonnaded Great Hall of the People and on the other by the embalmed spectacle of Mao in his glittering crystal coffin. We then plunged fearlessly into the Imperial splendour of the Forbidden City, the epitome of Ming dynasty China with its sweeping courtyards, blood-red walls and palaces, and clusters of yellow-tiled roofs, their curly upturned eaves breaking against the blue sky like golden waves. All around, sullen tour groups were herded along by Chinese guides yelling through miniature megaphones. By comparison, we spent hours ambling through the Imperial Gardens and dawdling by the Hall of Supreme Harmony, soaking up the peace and serenity. On our second day, we headed off with breathless anticipation for the most formidable obstacle on our Chinese assault course: the Great Wall. Once we&apos;d scrummed our way past the souvenir sellers, we were amazed to find the wall itself practically deserted. We spent a sublime afternoon, hiking along the ramparts and watchtowers, witnessing the world&apos;s greatest structure unfurl before us like a gigantic stone ribbon, fluttering all the way to the distant, hazy grey mountain tops. After another day spent scooting through Beijing on rented bikes, taking in every pagoda and bell tower, we reckoned we were doing relatively well. But we still had to face our first real test of independent locomotion: the night train to Datong, just over 300km west. In the station concourse, crowds of Chinese huddled round to watch us perform such astonishing feats as buying water for the journey and using a payphone. Our &quot;hard sleeper&quot; carriage turned out to be a dorm on rails. It wasn&apos;t the most comfortable ride, but it fizzed with bleak communist-era romanticism. Datong served up two of China&apos;s lesser-known treasures: the Yungang caves, where gigantic, 17m droopy-lobed Buddhas peer serenely through huge holes punched in the rock-face; and the Hanging Temple, a precarious wooden network of walkways and altars clinging lichen-like half way up a terrifying sheer cliff. That evening, we toasted our open-road brief with Chinese beer and a feast of spicy donkey, Datong&apos;s culinary speciality (think Spam, but more gristly). We ended Phase I of our trip with another of China&apos;s stellar attractions: the Terracotta Warriors in Xian. The radiance of the figures - created to guard the tomb of first emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century BC and only discovered in 1974 by peasants sinking a well - was among our main motivations for visiting China. Despite being incarcerated in a phenomenally ugly concrete hangar, they didn&apos;t disappoint - over 8,000 foot soldiers, cavalry and generals, all modelled on real members of Qin&apos;s army, marching sombrely out of the ferrous earth. By now, we&apos;d cut our teeth on China&apos;s major sights, and were beginning to enjoy the white-knuckle ride. Difficulties persisted: the Datong donkey triggered days of intestinal grief, complicated by the open-plan loos; and nothing could prepare for the symphonic levels of hawking and spitting. Also, none of the hotels I&apos;d reserved from the UK had actually recorded our booking when we arrived. But we&apos;d managed so far to avoid camping in a Chinese alleyway and were relishing the prospect of moving up a gear in Phase II, a detour that few organised tours would ever consider. We were heading out to China&apos;s arid extremity in the far northwest: the Uighur autonomous region of Xinjiang. As we flew into the regional capital of Urumqi, China seemed to undergo a jolting transformation; the terraced rice fields evaporated into a blinding infinity of flat, featureless desert. Swarthy Uighurs, a rebellious Turkic people, supplanted the Han Chinese. After catching our breath overnight in the oasis town of Turpan, we hired a car and weaved out along a lonely highway through the sands as far as the ancient ruins of Jiaohe, a thriving market city on the Silk Road until it was sacked by the Mongols in the 13th century. Today, it&apos;s an earthen skeleton half-submerged in the dunes.  We moved on, swerving through the fiery peaks of Flaming Mountain, mythical inferno-red ridges rising out of the blanched sand. Eventually, we reached the even more remote ghost city of Gaochang, and took a juddery ride by mule to its furthest point; here the fortifications are now just faint silty indentations. We might have left it at that, but we had heard that it was possible to continue beyond the sanctuary of the oasis belt and right out into the Taklamakan desert - a quarter of a million square kilometres of wasteland whose name translates as: &quot;enter and you will never leave!&quot;  We asked our driver to continue, arriving in pitch dark at our stopover, an Uighur guesthouse decked with sumptuous tapestries. With a band of Chinese adventurers also staying at the inn, we rose at 5am and tramped out over the dark freezing dunes. Each was taller than the last, and for a time, we feared that we were going to miss the moment of sunrise. We finally clawed to the top of a mountain of sand shortly before the sun peeked over the horizon and the entire expanse of Taklamakan was lit up in an intense burst of incandescent orange. We all sat transfixed. It was one of those transcendent moments that burns into the memory and lingers for a lifetime. We could have stayed weeks longer in Xinjiang and only reluctantly returned to central China, flying back to Chengdu in the Sichuan heartlands, before busing it south for the pilgrimage up the holy Buddhist peak of Emei Shan. Strewn with over 20 active Buddhist monasteries and furrowed by hundreds of kilometres of precipitous stone stairways, it&apos;s one of the China&apos;s great devotional wonders.     Sitting on the fence ... a resident of the holy mountain of Emei Shan    In preparation for the climb, we took a room in the magnificent 16th-century Baoguo monastery at the foot of the mountain, a complex of fluttering rooftops, shadowy courtyards and gleaming golden shrines, all lit by banks of prayer candles and shrouded in thick incense. We were woken at 4.30am by the gentle incantation of the monks, and after a breakfast of rice porridge, we set off. It was relatively gentle at first, but soon the pathways soared upwards. To make matters worse, we were periodically attacked by bands of aggressive monkeys snatching at our packs with teeth bared. Our reward came at the monastery pit-stops when the cedar forests drew aside to reveal the most ravishing mountain vista, peaks bucking and rearing into the distance.  Near the top, the oxygen thinned, making the last sections a breathless ordeal. A descending mist stole away the view but gave the Golden Summit a giddy sense of mystery. The giant 30 metre elephant that sits at the top seemed like a gilded spirit etched into the fog. The heady mix of oxygen deprivation and the immense sense of achievement brought tears to our eyes. By now, we had almost forgotten about the independent travel challenge. The tea ceremony was a distant memory, and the desert and Emei Shan had been triumphs. We were convinced that the notion that China couldn&apos;t be travelled independently was a myth.  But that was all about to change. To begin with, the bus to our next destination, to the Yangtze river port of Chongqing, was a shuddering boneshaker, hurling us around like a cruel fairground ride. A Chinese family boarded carrying sackfuls of live chickens, their scrawny necks protruding, and for the eight-hour journey, we endured clucking, dropping and malicious pecking. Our ferry - the Long Moon - turned out to be a rusty old junk with &quot;first class&quot; berths boasting only two bare beds and a pungent squat toilet. On the first night, I was awoken by a gangly silhouette creeping through the window. I sprung up and for a moment was staring into startled eyes just inches from my own. He instantly disappeared, cart-wheeling back out through the window, then acrobatically back-flipping up the side of the boat before vanishing through a window in the upper decks. I stood guard for the rest of the night, brandishing my camera tripod and watching the figure scuttle up and down the side of the boat, diving into other cabins before flitting away, a limber outline in the light of the moon. When the sun came up, we&apos;d finally hit the Three Gorges, slices of bare rock soaring up on each side of the river. They were astonishingly beautiful, but we were now unnerved and jittery. We tried to regain momentum at our final stopover, a nature reserve called Jiangjaijie, recommended ecstatically by every Chinese we&apos;d met, with shard-like karst rock formations soaring thousands of feet in the air. But it turned out to be as crowded as the Beijing metro, so we fled after just one day. As we finally crossed the frontier to Hong Kong, the yelling, tooting and mayhem all ebbed away, and we realised that we were experiencing something we&apos;d almost forgotten existed in the previous month: relaxation. So, for the final verdict: can China be successfully travelled outside the confines of a tour? Well, on a very basic level, we&apos;d proved that it can be done. But the journey was enormously taxing and, at times, downright dangerous. Sometimes we felt we were viewed merely as curiosities or prey. But even taking into account the hairiest moments, our experiences in the Taklamakan desert and on Emei Shan - and our encounters on ferries and in tea-houses - are likely to stay with us forever. Ultimately, if you&apos;re looking for a hassle-free, chill-out holiday, then China may not be the best choice - regardless of whether you take a tour or not. But if you&apos;re ready for a wild, stimulating adventure that will bring you into contact with the unreconstructed lawlessness of China, in all its horn-tooting, phlegm-hacking, scintillating reality, then taking on this unruly country independently is the only way to go.

Beijing (literally &quot;northern capital&quot;) has been the political centre for over 600 years, but has only recently acknowledged its heritage; traditional buildings from the pre-communist past, once dismissed as imperialist embarrassments, have been renovated to lure tourist dollars and the Forbidden City recently lost its Starbucks: a modernist step too far. Beijing residents who lived through the tumultuous 20th century are often baffled by foreigners&apos; interest in it - the wide-open space of Tiananmen Square, the ghoulish piety of Mao&apos;s Mausoleum and the dank, dripping shadows of the Underground City fallout shelters are all popular with out-of-towners.  Beijing food has echoes of the city&apos;s multicultural past, with noodles or dumplings preferred to rice. Don&apos;t miss the chance to check out the last remaining hutongs. A few of these old-style Manchu enclaves survived Mao-era demolition, but might still fall victim to Olympic hotel bulldozers. Shanghai (meaning &quot;on the sea&quot;) has long been a centre of river and maritime commerce, as reflected in its sweet seafood dishes. But there is also a sense of rivalry with the capital and it regards itself as a hub for fashion, fads and food. The future is writ large in many of the city&apos;s attractions, starting with the Transrapid Maglev train that catapults new arrivals into town at 430kph. The rocket-shaped Oriental Pearl Tower, prominent among the many space-age skyscrapers of the Pudong district, has become Shanghai&apos;s most recognisable modern landmark, supplanting the 1920s architecture of the Bund across the river, where European emigres once hobnobbed with spivs, spies and flappers.  Shanghai is also convenient for a look at an ethnic Chinese past distinct from the Mongol and Manchu influences of Beijing. In less than two hours, trains from Shanghai can reach three other major sites: Nanjing and Hangzhou, former capitals of China, and beautiful Suzhou. This makes Shanghai an ideal centre for a dedicated holiday of its own, for those who want something more sedate than a rushed 24 hours on the traditional fortnight&apos;s China scramble. \u00b7  Jonathan Clements is author of Beijing: The Biography of a City, published on February 7 by Sutton Publishing at \u00a312.99. Beijing  Where to stay High style has finally hit Beijing with the opening of Hotel Kapok (+10 6525 9988, hotelkapok.com, from about \u00a394 per night), right next to the Forbidden City. Its translucent lattice shell is a shocking contrast to its venerable neighbour but subtly evokes traditional Chinese windows and lanterns. For a bed with real history, try the exquisite Hotel C\u00f4t\u00e9 Cour SL (+10 6512 8020, hotelcotecoursl.com, from \u00a394), a courtyard that 500 years ago served as the imperial musicians&apos; living and rehearsal spaces. Located in a protected hutong area and decorated in contemporary chic and classic Ming, the 14 suites are a peaceful sanctuary, complete with lily pond. A more affordable (and less slick) hutong experience can be found at the L\u00fcsongyuan Hotel (+10 6404 0436, 22 Banchang Hutong, from \u00a357) - once part of a general&apos;s mansion. In the shadow of Guozijian, the serene grounds of the Imperial College established in 1287, the Swiss Road Hotel (+10 8409 0922, swissroad.com.cn, from \u00a347) is another courtyard gem. Its red-gated facade hides an ultra-modern lobby and the owner&apos;s collection of contemporary Chinese art.  Where to eat In the early 19th century, travellers from Hubei Province in central-southern China feasted at Huguang Huiguan (3 Hufang Lu, Xuanwu District, +10 6351 8284), a lovely guild house that has retained its original courtyards and a Peking Opera theatre that is still performing. Today it serves classic Beijing appetisers such as yundao gao (a light pastry of kidney bean flour wrapped around tart hawthorn berries) or yuanmeng shaobing (small naan stuffed with spiced ground mutton). But its Hubei entrees take centre stage - lizhi feiniu (tender beef braised with lychees), sanxian doupi (golden fried egg crepe stuffed with sticky rice, mushrooms and sausage) and hanlu zhengya (steamed duck). Spareribs stewed with lotus root is hearty and warming.  The exotic southwestern fare at Yunteng Shifu (7 Donghuashi Beili Dongqu, Chongwen District, +10 6711 3322 ext 7105) - inside the Yunnan provincial government office - makes a change from the stir-fries more emblematic of Chinese cuisine. Try the lemongrass-braised fish, succulent fried cheese, spicy mint salad, or a prosciutto-like cured ham. Wash it down with a metre-high bamboo pitcher of sweet rice wine.  The mellow decor of foliage, tropical colours, warm lighting and playful carved idols make No Name Restaurant (1 Dajinsi Hutong, Xicheng District, +10 6618 6061), another Yunnan restaurant, one of the most relaxing and beautiful places in town. Cool down from a spicy meal with sweet bolo fan (pineapple rice).   For adventurous foodies, Jiumen Xiaochi (1 Xiaoyou Hutong, Xicheng District, +10 6402 5858) is a must. Just off the north bank of Houhai, several of Beijing&apos;s most-renowned family-run speciality snack stands have earned a second life in a restored courtyard residence. A stroll down the indoor alley is a time-capsule tour of Beijing gastronomy. Sample Muslim milk pudding, flash-boiled tripe, golden-fried meat pies, mutton liver stew and dou zhi, the sickly-sour fermented green bean juice - accustoming oneself to its particular odour is a rite of passage for Beijingers.  Where to drink  Beijing&apos;s best cocktail is found on the breezy rooftop terrace of Q Bar (top floor of Eastern Inn Hotel, Sanlitun Nanlu, Chaoyang District, +10 6595 9239), where George and Echo mix signature martinis and capture the spirit of the classics in a stylish, relaxed atmosphere.  For a taste of the good old days, before Beijing&apos;s infamous bar street was destroyed seven years ago, visit the strip behind the 3.3 Market on Sanlitun North Street. There in the Tongli Studio, a windowless four-storey building packed with bars and dance-spots, a band of Turkic-Chinese Uighurs called the Tribesmen play a polyglot set of flamenco-style jams and hometown hits at Cheers (+135 2044 6062) around midnight.  The best beer in town is at Beijing Okhotsk (7 Business Street, Phoenix City, Shuguang Xili, +10 5866 8552), a microbrewery-restaurant with a Russian name, German decor, a Japanese owner and Italian food. Okhotsk&apos;s food is just passable, but it&apos;s worth it for the pilsner, weisen, stout and ale, all served in steins.  The spartan underground disco White Rabbit (C2 Haoyun Jie, Maizidian, +133 2112 3678) holds regular drum&apos;n&apos;bass events, an alternative to the thriving big-brand laser-lit discos at the west gate of the Workers&apos; Stadium.  What to see  While it&apos;s hard to enjoy a moment free from tour groups at the Temple of Heaven and the Lama Temple, all prayers for tranquillity will be answered at sleepy Zhihua Temple on Lumicang hutong. Musicians perform Ming-dynasty court music even for audiences of one - you may well be the only visitor - and the wooden Buddhas are wonderfully serene. A curvaceous white stupa graces the Tibetan Baita Temple, on Fuchengmen Neidajie, and five more can be found at Wuta Temple, just north of Purple Bamboo Park. Visit Beijing&apos;s oldest temple for a glimpse of monastic life - monks go about their daily business within the lush grounds of Fayuan, southeast of Niujie on Nanheng Xijie.  Few stretches of the Great Wall can compare in sheer majesty with the precipitous ruins of Simatai. A four-hour hike along the wall ends at Jinshanling, past incomparable views of battlements strung along mountain spines. Hire a taxi for the three-hour drive out (about \u00a330); hikers can ask for pick-up at Jinshanling. What to do Stray off the main drags for a glimpse of Beijing&apos;s hutongs. Albeit haphazardly protected, they offer a glimpse into a slow-paced life, where it&apos;s OK to go out in pyjamas and play chess on the street.  The rapidly gentrifying Nanluoguxiang area has reached a premium level of hutong hipness. Plastered T-shirts (plasteredtshirts.com) appropriates Beijing&apos;s kitsch icons for their witty line of apparel. Pick up handmade, brightly patterned notebooks at Xingmu, or ethno-chic clothing and knick-knacks at an array of shops. Time has literally stopped at Sandglass Cafe, where it&apos;s always 8.08pm. For a more potent kick, try Salud&apos;s heady homemade spice-infused rum.  Factory 798 (Dashanzi art district, 4 Jiuxianqiao Lu, Chaoyang District, 798space.com), a former industrial site transformed into an art disctrict, is the nerve centre for modern Chinese art. Ullens Center of Contemporary Art (ullens-center.org), which exhibits many of the Chinese avant-garde movement&apos;s early stars, is a good place to get your bearings before plunging deeper into 798&apos;s maze of galleries.  Factory 798&apos;s grittier northern neighbour, Caochangdi Village, is usually braved only by the serious art lover, but don&apos;t let the scattered galleries daunt you. Check out Korean-owned doArt Beijing (doartchina.com), Ai Weiwei&apos;s China Art Archives &amp; Warehouse (archivesandwarehouse.com), Galerie Urs Meile (galerie-meile.ch), and the outstanding Three Shadows Photography Center (threeshadows.cn) - China&apos;s first major gallery dedicated to contemporary photography, with a library, an extensive collection and working spaces to boot. Shanghai  Where to stay     Starck design ... Jia Shanghai    Jia Shanghai (+21 6217 9000, jiashanghai.com, around \u00a3135) is the first sibling of the Philippe Starck-designed Jia in Hong Kong. The neoclassical building on the main thoroughfare of Nanjing Lu has 55 bedrooms blending low-key modern design with quirky Asian features. In a beautifully restored French Concession villa once owned by infamous gangster boss Du Yuesheng, the 32-room Mansion Hotel (+21 5403 9888, chinamansionhotel.com, around \u00a3135) oozes 1930s Shanghai opulence, with 15ft ceilings, gas fireplaces and stone balconies. The 26-room Urbn (+21 5153 4600, urbnhotels.com, around \u00a3150) near Jing&apos;an temple is the newest boutique on the block, and also claims to be China&apos;s first carbon-neutral hotel. The contemporary Asian rooms come with futons, sunken lounges and open bathtubs.  More affordable is the Old House Inn (+21 6248 6118, oldhouse.cn, around \u00a360), a B&amp;B on a residential alley. The 12 guestrooms are connected by creaking stairs and rickety corridors but come adorned with Ming-style furniture.  Where to eat Fu 1088 (375 Zhenning Lu, by Yuyuan Lu, +21 5239 7878) is too new for the guidebooks, but it may well be the city&apos;s best Shanghainese restaurant. This opulent three-storey mansion serves modern but undeniably Shanghainese food: slightly oily and sweet, with delicate flavours. Try the crystal shrimp with fresh peas and the delicate xiaolongbao filled dumplings. For a mid-priced alternative, try Yuan Yuan (201 Xingguo Lu, by Taian Lu, +21 6433 9123). Central China&apos;s Hunan province is renowned for its repertoire of heavy, sour, hot and salty flavours. Authentic Hunanese food is rarely found outside China, so be sure to try it while you are here. In Shanghai, Di Shui Dong (56 Maoming Nan Lu, by Changle Lu, +21 6253 2689) is an excellent, inexpensive place to try mouthwatering, tongue-numbing favourites like cumin spareribs and spiced bullfrog. But don&apos;t expect pristine surroundings or proper etiquette; this is a bustling local-style restaurant. Southern Barbarian (Area E, 2/F Ju&apos;Roshine Life Arts Space, 56 Maoming Nan Lu, by Change Le Lu, +21 5157 5510) claims to be the most authentic Yunnan restaurant in Shanghai, although the lighter fare at Lost Heaven (38 Gaoyou Lu, by Fuxing Xi Lu, +21 6433 5126) may be better suited to western palates.  Where to drink Tourists are often drawn to Bund strongholds like Bar Rouge (18 Zhongshan Dong Yi Lu, by Nanjing Dong Lu, +21 6339 1199) or Glamour Bar (5 Guangdong Lu, by Zhongshan Dong Yi Lu, +21 6329 3751). That&apos;s fine, but don&apos;t stay long - Shanghai&apos;s real nightlife takes place well beyond the over-hyped waterfront. For classic cocktails, head to Constellation Bar (86 Xinle Lu, by Xiangyang Bei Lu) where the owner, Jin Zhonglei, was apprenticed to a master Japanese bartender, which explains his impeccable attention to detail.  If you are looking to find Shanghai&apos;s DJ pulse, skip the mega-clubs and go underground - literally. Veteran DJs and promoters Gary Wang and Gareth Williams recently opened The Shelter (5 Yongfu Lu, by Fuxing Lu, +21 6437 0400) - a former bomb shelter - to showcase emerging rock, hip-hop, house and experimental acts. Finally, spend an evening at Kong Yi Ji (36 Xuegong Jie, by Wenmiao Lu) to glimpse a side of Shanghai rarely seen by tourists. This gritty local establishment offers up brimming carafes of huangjiu grain wine and Shaoxing snack foods like anise-flavoured beans and the notoriously pungent stinky tofu. Where to shop You can get a bespoke wardrobe at the South Bund Fabric Market (399 Lujiabang Lu, +21 6377 2232). Bring your favourite clothes - or even a clipping from a magazine - and have Shanghai&apos;s legendary (and incredibly cheap) tailors whip up made-to-measure replicas in just a few days.      Streetwise Shanghai...INSH    The best place for souvenirs with style is around  Taikang Lu, where the grungy warehouses and tangle of alleys are now home to fashion, furniture and lifestyle boutiques, craft workshops, advertising companies and courtyard cafes. At INSH (200 Taikang Lu, +21 6466 5249, insh.com.cn), young Tokyo-trained Shanghainese designer Helen Lee creates modern, streetwise fashions.

I was so relieved to be diagnosed with something other than stress that I accepted this without a second thought. It was only later I began to have doubts. Farting worms in my brain seemed so implausible.&quot;  Many doctors and four years later, Mike Robins&apos; progressively severe tremor was diagnosed as Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD). While hospitalised for an emergency appendectomy in Shanghai, he became friends with a neurologist, teaching her English as he recovered, and she realised what was wrong.  Back in the UK, Robins was referred to Tipu Aziz, an Oxford neurosurgeon, who offered a technique he had pioneered called deep brain stimulation (DBS). This alleviates PD symptoms by implanting electrodes into the brain, powered by a &quot;pacemaker&quot; in the chest. Aziz claims to have used about 30 monkeys over 20 years to develop this work and related techniques, and believes 40,000 people worldwide have benefited. Robins says DBS has revolutionised his life, a certainty that took him recently to Brussels to make an impassioned plea to MEPs wrangling about the importance of research involving primates.  Probably the most controversial area within the highly charged debate surrounding the use of animals in medical research, testing on primates is rising up the agenda as Directive 86/609/EC, which sets out how animal research is regulated, grinds its way slowly through EU parliamentary revision.  While the scientific establishment has repeatedly concluded that primate work remains invaluable to medical progress, most recently with the so-called &quot;Weatherall Report&quot; (after Sir David Weatherall, the doctor who chaired it) into &quot;The use of non-human primates in research&quot;, some MEPs and campaigners are calling for a ban on primate research to be enshrined in the revised directive.  Indeed, 433 MEPs - a record number on an animal protection measure \u2013 signed a written declaration championed by Animal Defenders International (ADI), a UK-based animal welfare group calling, in part, for a timetable to be established for totally replacing primates in scientific experiments.  While this number of signatories (over half of all MEPs) led to the declaration being &quot;adopted&quot; last September, whether a majority of MEPs would vote to ban primate research remains unclear and it is believed any such proposal would be resisted by the European Commission and Council, both of which, together with the Parliament, would need to support a ban. Energetic lobbying from both sides of the debate is under way, and there is certain amount of confusion. Many MEPs have supposedly signed this declaration, but are also calling for more research into cancer, AIDS and other diseases, for which primate research is fundamental.  But even for those who can accept the use of animals in medical research (opinion polls show that most of us do) primate work presents extra challenges.  The RSPCA, which has a division focusing exclusively on research animals, calls primate research &quot;a matter of extreme concern&quot;. Its arguments against it are compelling, centring on the well-accepted fact that primates are highly intelligent, social animals, biologically very close to humans and able to experience a range of emotions, from anxiety, fear and distress to interest, happiness and excitement.  While great apes, considered to be at the top of this tree of sentience and experience, are not used in medical research in the EU, there is little doubt that any work involving creatures that are so like us stretches the limits of the &quot;cost benefit&quot; analysis that is part of every licence granted for research on any animal.  Put crudely, the cost (suffering) to the animal is weighed against the probable benefits to us. Neither of these variables can, of course, be measured with certainty, and while some argue that it is the similarity of non-human primates to us that makes them such good research models, others cite precisely this, and their ability to suffer much like us, that makes their use unacceptable.  Simon Festing, executive director of the Research Defence Society, a lobby group whose main focus is defending the use of animals in research, has been putting the case for primate research, in Brussels.  While he understands the &quot;reasoned argument&quot; against primate research based on their higher sentience, he fundamentally backs it because, he says: &quot;I see compassion as an individual thing and can&apos;t support the phase out of the very small number of primates used in research up against the suffering of the very large numbers of people affected by, or who will be affected by, the devastating range of conditions that primate research tackles.&quot; It&apos;s certainly a tough call, but when Robins switches off his brain stimulator, the PD tremors that rack his body are so severe you can see why it was impossible for his wife and children to stay long in a room with him.  You can also see why he went to Brussels. \u00b7 Sophie Petit Zeman is head of external relations for the Association of Medical Research Charities", "tags": ["Health", "Medical research", "Society", "Education", "Animal experimentation", "Science", "Animals"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-04T16:04:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/05/art1", "sentences": ["High point: &quot;Doing an art project with migrant worker children in Shanghai last year.&quot; Low point: &quot;The death of my Italian art dealer, Guido Carbone, at the opening of my show in 2007."], "title": "Portrait of the artist: Bob and Roberta Smith, artist", "article": "How did you come up with your name?

She was a third-generation Chinese-American on a mission to reconnect with her family&apos;s home culture, but she was much more than just another tourist. She had starred in the first Technicolor epic, had sparred with Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express, had sunk the first rivet into the steel skeleton of Grauman&apos;s Chinese Theatre, and was the most admired Asian actor in western cinema: a glossy, shimmering presence. But she had achieved her status by embodying the whole canon of western fantasies about the Chinese. And she knew it. In 1933, Doris Mackie of Film Weekly magazine visited Ealing studios to observe the shooting of a sweaty tropical melodrama called Tiger Bay, and found its star railing against cinema in general and Hollywood in particular. &quot;Why is it that the screen Chinese is nearly always the villain?&quot; asked Wong. &quot;And so crude a villain. Murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass. We are not like that. How should we be, with a civilisation that is so many times older than that of the west?&quot; In the past decade, the reputation of Wong has been returned to brilliant life. Her image - the intense gaze, the sleekly serpentine arms, the impossibly reflective flapper bob - is in circulation again, in poster tubes and postcard racks. There have been two new biographies and a meticulous filmography, and now comes a documentary about her life. Called Frosted Yellow Willows, a literal translation of her Cantonese name, the movie has its UK premiere at the National Portrait Gallery on Friday. This is mainly due to the rediscovery of Wong&apos;s performance in the 1929 melodrama Piccadilly, in which she plays Shosho, a kitchen scullion whose gyrations among the soap suds of a West End club lead to a star residency above the stairs. The film was dismissed as vacuous by generations of critics who never had the privilege of seeing it. Now it is recognised as a masterpiece whose power is derived, in part, from Wong&apos;s skilful manipulation of familiar oriental cliches. &quot;I danced once before in Limehouse,&quot; reads one tantalising intertitle. &quot;But there was trouble, men, knives.&quot; Frosted Yellow Willows tells the story of Wong&apos;s birth in her father&apos;s laundry in Los Angeles, her single-minded devotion to the movies, her rise to fame, her dealings with a crazy extortionist who threatened her family, her tireless war work. But it seems confused about how we should now regard her. The film celebrates her as a pioneer, but invites the viewer to despise much of her work - all those 1930s crime dramas in which she plays a gangster&apos;s moll, a beautiful assassin or the knife-wielding offspring of Fu Manchu. It offers her as a victim - enumerating the painful moments when she was passed over in favour of western actors with unconvincing makeup, or cast, improbably, as an Inuit or a Native American - yet the footage from her pictures shows that she transcended this status. And it makes little of her boozing and complicated love life. (The lyricist Eric Maschwitz is said to have memorialised an affair with Wong in his song These Foolish Things, but you won&apos;t hear it in this documentary.) And this is the trouble with Anna May Wong. We disapprove of the stereotypes she fleshed out - the treacherous, tragic daughters of the dragon - but her performances still seduce, for the same reason they did in the 1920s and 30s. Watch her as the Mongol slave girl running around with Douglas Fairbanks Jr in the silent The Thief of Bagdad. Or in Tiger Bay as the proprietor of the sultriest dance hall in British Guyana, spooking some troublesome clients by suggesting she might have poisoned their food. Or in the 1928 film Show Life, in which she spears a lobster from a rock pool, cracks it with her teeth and sucks out the meat. You&apos;ll see how much the camera loved her, and how impossible it is not to feel the same - whatever ideological badness we might now detect in these pictures. By the war, Chinese-flavoured melodramas had gone out of fashion, and Wong with them. But in 1960, after two decades of relative obscurity, she made a faltering comeback, playing housekeeper to Lana Turner in Michael Gordon&apos;s slightly pervy thriller Portrait in Black. It was her last big-screen role and, four decades after her debut, the publicity employed a tiresomely familiar language. A press release attempted to explain her absence from cinema with a proverb, supposedly passed down to Wong by her mother: &quot;Don&apos;t be photographed too much or you&apos;ll lose your soul.&quot; When asked in person, Wong&apos;s reply was very different: &quot;I was so tired of the parts I had to play.&quot; \u00b7 Frosted Yellow Willows is at the National Portrait Gallery, London (020-7312 2463), on Friday, and at the BFI Southbank (020 7928 3232) on Saturday", "tags": ["Film", "China", "World news", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-06T09:31:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/07/popandrock.madonna", "sentences": ["Madonna actually made more than one of the ghastliest movies ever: Shanghai Surprise and Who&apos;s That Girl?"], "title": "Joe Queenan asks what is the point of a middle-aged pop star?", "article": "Rock&apos;n&apos;roll, unlike jazz, blues, cabaret and classical music, has never figured out what to do with ageing deities. No one told Duke Ellington or Arthur Rubinstein or Lionel Hampton or Andres Segovia to stop playing when they turned 30, 40, 50 or, for that matter, 90. Smoothies such as Tony Bennett retain a strong appeal well into their 80s; they are not thought of as old, but as venerable. Luciano Pavarotti&apos;s declining gifts in his autumnal years were graciously overlooked by his adherents out of respect - or perhaps even gratitude - for his youthful triumphs. People knew that he was finished. That was no reason to stop adoring him. As for blues singers, not only does the public not resent their being a bit long in the tooth, they expect them to be old, acting as if BB King and Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters were born brandishing canes and foraging about for their reading glasses. Only in the rock genre does the ageing process make the public feel uncomfortable; only in the world of rock do middle-aged performers feel pressure to exit the scene before they start making fools of themselves. Sometimes this pressure comes from the public, but the most vehement exhortations to blow town come from music critics and pundits who, with the exception of a few chosen ones - Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Patti Smith, Neil Young, David Bowie and other beneficiaries of some sort of cultural coolness pass - would like all the Claptons and Collinses and Joels and Stewarts to get off the stage, go into retirement, take up Scottish country dancing, move to Spain, play more cribbage, or just curl up and die. This year, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince will turn 50. Even for those of us who never seriously believed that any of the Beatles would actually turn 64 - which John Lennon and George Harrison did not - it is hard to believe that this trio of performers, who once symbolised the insolence and iconoclasm and adrenaline of youth, are now walking museum pieces, just as it is hard to believe that former teen idols Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves are now both in their 40s. It is not just that people such as this become famous when they are young; to a large degree these people become famous because they are young. Ageing performers whose records are ignored and whose concerts no longer sell out often grumble that the music they are recording today is just as good as it ever was. This is not true: rock stars never do work in their 30s that approaches the quality and originality of the work of their teens and 20s. Fame brings too many distractions, even the mildest affluence is the implacable enemy of creativity, and, most important, musical styles change and musicians can rarely change with them. A sure sign of panic is the statutory David Byrne/Peter Gabriel/ Paul Simon trip to the developing world in search of inspiration. But even more to the point is that being just slightly older than the audience was always part of the Faustian marketing arrangement. Pop music, which is as much about demographics and style as it is about culture, is for the most part produced by the young and targeted at the young. This is because young people do not want to listen to their parents&apos; music, even if their parents&apos; music is listenable. It also means that performers need to get started early and clean up quick because the spotlight dims fast. Audiences may grudgingly accept that they themselves are ageing, but they expect their idols to remain young for ever. The results are often grotesque: singers who cannot remember the lyrics, lead guitarists who cannot remember what key they are supposed to be playing in, drummers who cannot keep the beat, flautists who can no longer support themselves on a single leg, rhythm guitarists who have to do the entire show sitting on a chair. Some performers can survive the stigma of age, but most rock stars end up playing private parties in Los Angeles, corporate functions in Osaka, free concerts in Paramus, New Jersey. If they are lucky. None of the rules governing ageing rock stars apply to Jackson, Madonna and Prince, just as none of them apply to Mick Jagger or Aretha Franklin. These performers are like the Queen; they can rule as long as they like because they have the sceptre. Economists may charge that this is unfair and counterproductive: a misallocation of resources that obstructs the rise of subsequent generations. Jackson, Madonna and Prince don&apos;t care about that, and neither, by the looks of it, does the Queen. The three stars came to fame by very different paths and have stayed famous in very different ways: Jackson was on top of the world as a child, then washed up at age 20, then the biggest star in the world at age 25, and now appears to be down for the count. Prince was up, then down, then way, way, way down and is now back on top. Madonna has never left the big time since she arrived in it, has never experienced a serious career slump. She&apos;s like the iPod; she came out of nowhere, and no one is quite sure how she became as huge as she became. Stylistically, the three have little in common, nor do their careers resemble one another&apos;s. The tightest link between them is that they all grew up in America&apos;s heartland: Jackson in Gary, Indiana, Madonna in the suburbs of Detroit, Prince in Minneapolis. This may prove that young people marooned in the provinces are more ambitious than kids who grow up in New York and Los Angeles. Or it may just be a coincidence. Then there&apos;s the fact that Prince is a rock star, and a remarkably important one, while Madonna and Jackson are mainstream pop stars. Prince and Madonna are linked by appearances in memorable motion pictures (Desperately Seeking Susan, Purple Rain) that somehow managed to survive their woeful acting, and each made one of the most ghastly motion pictures ever (Under the Cherry Moon, The Next Best Thing). Madonna actually made more than one of the ghastliest movies ever: Shanghai Surprise and Who&apos;s That Girl? are right up there in the Hall of Shame too. Nor is Body of Evidence anything to write home about. This flirtation with Hollywood suggests that both Prince and Madonna would have liked to break out of the pop music straitjacket and establish themselves as stars in another genre, but had to throw in the towel, Prince because his pencil-thin moustache made him look like an out-of-work gigolo, Madonna because her arboreal acting actually got worse over the years. Jackson, Madonna and Prince took entirely different paths to the top and have dealt with the maturation process in entirely different ways. Jackson, a child star who has now been in the public consciousness for more than four decades, pre-empted the question of getting too old for the rock star job by undergoing a physical and psychological transformation that turned a very handsome, very likable young man into a reclusive, grotesque, anti-social freak. Jackson, the biggest star in the world in the 38 years since the Beatles broke up, never had to worry about looking preposterous at the age of 50; he had started to look preposterous by the age of 35. It is impossible to say if Jackson, because of the child molestation charges that have dogged him for many years, could ever make the kind of comeback Prince has pulled off, as it would require a massive shift of attitudes on the part of the public. The public is ultimately forgiving, although it seems unlikely. Less gifted than Jackson or Prince - as a singer, as a dancer, as a musician - Madonna is really a cabaret act who somehow managed to find a colossal world stage. Long the beneficiary of a cowed or indulgent press so smitten by Madonna the in-your-face feminist that it takes little note of her laughable acting, mechanical dancing and bubblegum song catalogue, she has begun to resemble Mount Rushmore: a revered icon whose fundamental cheesiness goes unnoticed because she&apos;s been around so long. Because she has been reinventing herself from the beginning - pop star, dominatrix, ingenue, fallen-away Catholic, matinee idol, children&apos;s book author, philosopher, Kabbalah devotee, political activist, Michigan suburbanite with phony British accent - Madonna has never had to compete with a single youthful image that is frozen in her fans&apos; minds, in the way that the Rolling Stones or Sinead O&apos;Connor or even Britney Spears has had to. There have been so many Madonnas that at this point one more incarnation isn&apos;t going to make much difference. Nor can there be any denying that by constantly shifting the target, she has made a little go a long way. She is a guerrilla chanteuse who always makes sure the battle is fought on her turf. And she works hard for the money, a lot harder than most of her male contemporaries. Prince has also had several distinct phases to his career, though he never completely stopped being Prince. Hardcore fans remember his daring quasi-burlesque act long before the public discovered him in the Purple Rain era. By then, some of his early fans already felt he was going soft. No matter. Arriving on the grand stage at the same moment that Jackson was recording intergalactic hits such as Billy Jean and Beat It, Prince had to accept the somewhat thankless role as the second most fascinating, second most compelling, second weirdest star in pop music for several years. He then launched into a long phase of career self-immolation - refusing to be called Prince, warring with his record company, releasing too many records too often with too little top-quality material on them - basically sabotaging his professional life through a mixture of pique, self-indulgence and personal idiosyncrasy. When he finally did make his astounding comeback a few years back, a triumph that culminated in his appearance at the Super Bowl half-time show last January followed by his month-long residency in London in August, he was coming back from the dead. Prince hadn&apos;t been a vital force in music for years. He had been written off as a guy who used to be big in the 80s. Of course, the truth is, Prince is not a vital force in today&apos;s music, nor are his two celebrated contemporaries. True, nobody who can bring a record company to its knees or rewrite the rules of concert promotion the way Madonna has, or who has risen from the ashes to have the biggest-grossing tour of the year and play the Super Bowl the way Prince has, can fairly be called a has-been. Yet none of the three artists turning 50 exerts any real creative importance over the music scene any more. Jackson doesn&apos;t make records and he doesn&apos;t tour. Prince&apos;s shows are the very highest-class nostalgia - terrific, but certainly not anything new. The same is true of his recordings: the new stuff sounds like the old stuff. As for Michigan&apos;s most famous alumna, people don&apos;t come to Madonna shows to hear new songs; they come to see Madonna. Unlike pathetic has-beens who peddle their musty wares from one provincial town to the next, Madonna and Prince play in huge venues and command huge ticket prices. But musically, the shows are the same as the shows Joe Cocker and the Lovin&apos; Spoonful and the survivors of Yes are doing these days. They&apos;re oldies shows. Nobody associated with popular music ever wants to believe that it is first, last and foremost a business, much less that it is a business in which the same rules apply as in any other sphere of economic activity. In real life, middle-aged people cling to their high-paying jobs for as long as possible, resenting the younger employees nipping at their heels, all the while reassuring themselves that the youngsters can&apos;t get the job done the way they can. This sounds like every middle-aged rock star who ever lived, every former headliner who once played the Hollywood Bowl and is now playing small clubs in Norway and the cultural centre in Amiens. Nobody ever gives up a good job, with a nice salary and benefits and lots of prestige just because younger people think that they&apos;re out of step with the times or because they&apos;ve stopped being cool. People in their 50s and 60s have more important things to do than worry about being cool. Decades ago, critics wondered out loud how Jagger was possibly going to be able to keep a straight face singing Street Fighting Man when he had reached 30. Then they wondered how he would do it at 40. There was a general consensus that Jagger was starting to look a bit silly exhorting his fans to man the barricades at age 50, but now that he is well past 60 and the Stones have just finished another record-smashing three-year tour, it is no longer pertinent or relevant to ask how a near-septuagenarian can continue to strut and fret his two hours upon the stage the way he does, singing about revolutions that didn&apos;t happen, social upheavals that never occurred. A long, long time ago, Jagger made it clear that he was not giving up his job, not only because of the money and the adulation, but because the evidence seemed to suggest that, even though it was indeed only rock&apos;n&apos;roll, he rather liked it. Prince and Madonna probably feel the same way: as long as the crowds keep coming, as long as they keep cheering, and as long as they keep paying, we&apos;re going to keep going out on the road.

In 2007, the economy grew by 11.3%, the fastest rate in 13 years; stock prices on the main Shanghai bourse hit a record high of 6,000, having risen sixfold in two years; foreign exchange reserves surged over $1.4 trillion thanks to booming exports; and PetroChina became the planet&apos;s most valuable company - one of five Chinese firms in the world top 10. By contrast, the year of the rat starts with a bigger weight of expectations and far less certainty about the government&apos;s ability to meet them. There is even talk that the economy&apos;s high-growth phase may have peaked. Inflation is at a 10-year-high, share prices have fallen 25% from their peak last year, export growth is under pressure from a rising currency and the coldest winter for half a century has paralysed large swaths of southern and central China. Instead of relaxing over new year, millions of migrants have been stranded at railway stations, hundreds of thousands of coal miners have been told to work through the holiday to alleviate power shortages and hundreds of army regiments have been dispatched to clear the snow. In the past, such problems would have had little impact on the outside world, but Beijing faces more external pressure than ever to prove itself a major power. The Olympics in August will focus attention on China as never before. With the US facing an alarming downturn, policymakers are looking to China to step forward and prevent the world from slipping into recession. But it is just as likely to be dragged back. This week the World Bank cut its growth forecast for China to 9.6%, the first slip into single digits for six years. By the standards of any other country, it is still enviably fast. But China has become used to supercharged growth. Last month the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, spelt out the challenge facing the country in grim terms. &quot;We fear that 2008 will be the most difficult year for the economy,&quot; he said. &quot;There are uncertainties in international circumstances and the economic environment, and there are new difficulties and contradictions in the domestic economy.&quot; On the streets of Beijing, shoppers were happily oblivious to their responsibility to rescue the world economy. The week before the spring festival is a peak of consumption as people splurge on new year gifts, food for family banquets and red seasonal decorations bearing rat symbols and wishes for good fortune. For many, prices have risen faster than incomes. According to the China Cuisine Association, the cost of a Spring Festival Eve dinner has jumped by about 20% since last year. Wandering around a market, Li Baoshang - one of the city&apos;s laobaixing (common people) - said his family felt the pressure. He had to pay more than he did 12 months ago for the mandarin oranges, prawns and red lanterns bought for the celebration. He believes the games in August will only drive up prices further. &quot;The Olympics will be good for the government, but not for the people,&quot; said Li, who copes on a pension of 1,250 yuan a month. &quot;When we had the Asian games, prices rose. After we have the Olympics, the cost of goods will go up too.&quot; At Beijing railway station, a nation was on the move. More than 2bn journeys will be made during the spring festival - a greater movement than the hajj. For many, the celebratory mood is mixed with exhaustion. Ma Yingwei was a man in need of a holiday. Laden down with bags, jostling in a chaotic queue, then rushing down a platform, he and his family boarded a packed carriage for the seven-hour ride that would take them home for the first time in two years. Ma expects he will have to work harder just to stand still next year. His monthly salary has been stuck at 2,000 yuan since the last spring festival. But he has to pay more for the fireworks he set off at midnight last night and the food for their celebration dinner. &quot;Compared with last year, prices have risen dramatically. I&apos;m not depressed though; there&apos;s just more pressure to earn more money,&quot; he said. As in other countries, globalised consumer culture is changing traditional celebrations. Local newspapers bemoan the fact that many young people are more concerned about Valentine&apos;s Day on the 14th than the Lantern Festival on the 21st, which marks the end of the spring festival period. With more choice and more competition, relaxation is not what it was. Spring festival was once a time only for lolling around at home with the family, eating dumplings and watching the live song and dance extravaganza on the main state broadcaster, CCTV. But in recent years, more people are travelling overseas, downloading pirated films and eating out at hotels. Among those who will be working this week are 3 million restaurant staff. Shop manager Xing Jin could only look forward to a half-holiday. She opened 14 new outlets last year and doubled sales of foreign-designed accessories. It was great for business, but she often has to work until 3 or 4am several days in a row to keep up. &quot;I just want a rest. This is one of the only times I can take a break, but I can&apos;t completely relax. During the holiday, I must prepare for the launch of new products straight after Spring Festival.&quot; For New Year&apos;s Eve, she was planning a dinner of dumplings and niangao new year cake first with her family, then immediately after with her husband&apos;s family. &quot;It&apos;s tradition. I always get fat at this time of the year.&quot; She expects to double revenues again in the year of the rat, but fears a more strained relationship with her 40 staff as the result of a new labour law that starts this year, which will make it harder to hire and fire staff. &quot;I don&apos;t think the government&apos;s new employment policy is fair. It puts a lot of pressure on us and might cause some unrest in our shops.&quot; Rodent rising In astrology, rat years are associated with wealth, but also death. The animals&apos; attributes include cunning, aggression, leadership, hard work and strong will. According to a popular myth, the rat is the first animal in the 12-year cycle because it sneakily rode on the back of the ox (the second year) and jumped off near the finishing line. Xiang Wen, a pest control engineer, says he is in a growth market. &quot;I feel that in Beijing in 2008, the Olympic year, there is a particular stress on the extermination of rats,&quot; he says. &quot;When we were holding the Asian games the electric cables were ruined by mice, and the transportation of signals stopped for a few minutes. So the eradication of rats is being taken very seriously.&quot; Britain is playing its part. In his last job before the Spring Festival, Xiang used a rare UK export to China: Talon rat poison. In the year of the rat, Xiang says his biggest worry is seeing a mouse at one of the Olympic venues for which he is responsible.", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-07T12:47:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/07/newsstory.premierleague", "sentences": ["We know that the Premier League are equally conscious of these issues.&quot; Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Miami and Shanghai are among potential venues for the first scheduled matches in 2011, while other cities will bid for the right to stage games in following seasons."], "title": "Football: Premier League to go global with overseas matches", "article": "Guardian Unlimited understands there are serious reservations in the government about the Premier League&apos;s plan to take matches overseas for the first time from the 2011 season. Ministers will not at this stage oppose the audacious proposal to extend the season from 38 games to 39 to allow every club to play one extra match abroad every year, but they are not convinced that the move is in football&apos;s best interests and there are concerns around supporters, sporting integrity and the impact upon other national leagues and competitions. The league and the chairmen of its 20 clubs unanimously agreed to further explore the proposal in London today, and the FA has also reacted positively to the move having been briefed before this morning&apos;s meeting. Should the deal go ahead, the 10 overseas games are expected to take place in January providing space can be found in the calendar, with points awarded for the extra match in the normal way. The top five sides are likely to be seeded so that they do not meet each other, but otherwise the fixtures will be drawn out of a hat and played in cities around the world. &quot;The international round is an exciting and innovative proposal that needs careful consideration before being introduced,&quot; said the Premier League&apos;s chief executive, Richard Scudamore. &quot;However, this concept recognises the truly global appeal of the Barclays Premier League while understanding that the traditions of the English game have always underpinned our success. &quot;We believe that an international round of matches will enhance the strength of the Premier League as a competition; create extra interest in all 20 Premier League clubs at home and abroad; and allow increased investment in talent development and acquisition, facilities, as well as our football development and community programmes. The globalisation of sport is both an opportunity and a challenge; one that needs addressing in a responsible way. We are a better competition for being a cosmopolitan league and have benefitted from our increased international reach. None the less, it is critical we retain our English character by improving our efforts to produce homegrown talent, deepening our commitment to community engagement and continuing our investment in the grassroots.&quot; The league appears intent on trying to appease supporters by extending the season rather than reducing the number of games in England, but there is certain to be a degree of anger among fans at matches being played away from domestic grounds. &quot;We challenge the Premier League to scrap these plans if the majority of football fans in this country don&apos;t want matches to be played abroad,&quot; the Football Supporters&apos; Federation chairman, Malcolm Clarke, said. &quot;The FSF has no doubt whatsoever that the vast majority of supporters are against this, and believe it would drag the Premier League into the realms of farce. When this ludicrous idea was first mooted in October last year, we ran a poll here on our website and a huge majority of supporters - 80% who took the trouble to vote - were in complete opposition to this. &quot;Are we going to see local derbies played in a foreign country thousands of miles away? Are supporters supposed to accept missing the biggest games of their season because it&apos;s being played on the other side of the planet? Let&apos;s face facts, the sole motivation for this is the Premier League to make more money - aren&apos;t they making enough already? This displays a complete disregard for the proud traditions of the English game as well as a crass lack of consideration for football supporters in general.&quot; The FA backed the proposal in a statement this afternoon, but will ensure the overseas matches would not impact on Cup or England games. &quot;We understand the Premier League&apos;s desire to raise interest in English football around the world,&quot; read the statement. &quot;We look forward to discussing the detail with the league and looking carefully at the implications, to ensure that the proposal fits well alongside the existing fixture list, including our domestic cup and league competitions and our national team games. We know that the Premier League are equally conscious of these issues.&quot; Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Miami and Shanghai are among potential venues for the first scheduled matches in 2011, while other cities will bid for the right to stage games in following seasons. Five cities would be chosen each year, with each venue hosting matches on consecutive days. A certain number of games are likely to be played in third world nations, with the Premier League keen to use football as a development tool. Cities will also be asked to auction for the TV rights for the games, with the initiative not starting until the current TV deal expires in 2011. Commercially the opportunities for the Premier League are enormous - its income from the sale of overseas TV rights has already increased from \u00a3178m in 2001 to \u00a3625m for the current deal, while an estimated 1 billion people around the world watched Arsenal&apos;s match with Manchester United last November. The majority of Premier League clubs already embark on annual pre-season overseas tours to tap into burgeoning markets such as south-east Asia, the Middle East and the United States. With the influx of foreign businessmen to the Premier League - nine top-flight clubs are owned by overseas owners, including Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea - it has long been thought that league matches would eventually be taken outside England. The league is following the example of the top American leagues, the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB, the first three having all staged games in London last October, the latter having previously played regular-season baseball games in Tokyo. Before this year&apos;s Super Bowl, the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell approved a plan to host a game in the UK every year until 2010, and confirmed that the Buffalo Bills would be playing an annual regular season game in Toronto from next season. There is a lot of speculation about the NFL&apos;s long-term plans for expansion abroad, but in particular there have been whispers that the NFL may be considering expanding to a 17-game season, in which every team plays eight home games and eight away games (as they do now), and then one extra game outside of the United States, with obvious similarities to the Premier League&apos;s proposal.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-07T18:05:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/08/sport.comment4", "sentences": ["It has mooted the expansion of its season to 17 dates from the current 16 after the National Basketball Association took the Houston Rockets and Sacramento Kings to China to play two pre-season games in Beijing and Shanghai in October 2004 with enormous success."], "title": "Digger: Slow growth in China fuels overseas ambitions", "article": "The Premier League&apos;s radical announcement yesterday about adding an extra fixture to the calendar that would be staged overseas reflects a growing anxiety about the threat to its popularity in foreign markets, with its reach in China, potentially the greatest mass market, extending to only 0.02% of the population. Despite regular claims that Premier League matches reap audiences of 1bn, yesterday&apos;s proposals explode the hyperbole. &quot;There is not a big overseas market,&quot; said an executive at one leading Premier League club. &quot;People talk about it and the numbers of people interested but, in fact, it is very small. This is a way of driving interest. My view is that the Premier League has to develop to survive.&quot; That accounts for the unanimous support among club chairmen for the plan that bears clear similarities to a proposal by the gridiron organiser, the National Football League. It has mooted the expansion of its season to 17 dates from the current 16 after the National Basketball Association took the Houston Rockets and Sacramento Kings to China to play two pre-season games in Beijing and Shanghai in October 2004 with enormous success. Very little of the \u00a3625m income from the Premier League&apos;s three-year overseas deal comes from China and it is fearful enough to sell itself short there in return for long-term growth. In an attempt to build the brand with new partners abroad the league sold its broadcast rights for mainland China to a pay-tv company, Win TV, which has only 300,000 subscribers. Premier League executives hope taking the mountain to Mohammed will help their competition compete with the US leviathans. Viewers eyes on Capello Premier League sources insist that yesterday&apos;s announcement was in no way an attempt to steal the Football Association&apos;s thunder after the success of the England team in the opening game of Fabio Capello&apos;s stewardship. The FA was diplomatically insouciant about the Premier League&apos;s designs, probably still basking in the warm glow of the BBC&apos;s viewing figures released yesterday afternoon. The peak audience of 10.6m was a phenomenal figure for a midweek friendly fixture. By contrast, the most ever to watch the team of Sven-Goran Eriksson in his first 12 months in charge was 11.6m, for a competitive World Cup qualifier only four days after his greatest success, the 5-1 win over Germany in Munich. Capello and the FA can also be gratified that the vast majority stuck with it: the average audience over the 90 minutes was 10m. Most pleased about the Capello effect, though, will be ITV and Setanta, who take over the rights to England matches from the BBC next season through their four-year, \u00a3420m deal. FA focus on skills Even if, as one football analyst yesterday warned, the move of Premier League clubs into overseas territories will prove a serious threat to international football, the FA continues to make plans for a brighter future for the England team. Its director of football development, Sir Trevor Brooking, showed three governement ministers round a city academy in Willesden yesterday to propound the virtues of the \u00a36m FA Tesco Skills Programme that aims to provide 1m youngsters aged five to 11 with access to specialist skills training. The programme, which benefits from \u00a33m of government cash, will also provide retired former Premier League stars with a first step on the coaching ladder. Sailing close to drug ban Sailing, Britain&apos;s most successful Olympic sport, is under threat from the nation&apos;s anti-doping programme. There was brouhaha at the revelations that three athletes face a ban if they miss one more drugs test but British medal hopes would be more disrupted if they are suspended. One leading Olympian revealed yesterday that there are two sailors who are on &quot;two strikes&quot; of the three-strike policy. Sailors are the least likely to benefit from performance-enhancing agents but the need to chase suitable weather around the world makes them the most likely to miss random tests. matt.scott@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-08T12:06:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/08/thefiver.sport", "sentences": ["Let&apos;s give Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Miami, Shanghai, the Moon and Mars some Bolton v Wigan Premier League classics to chew on."], "title": "Money-Generating Wheeze; and Furious Pine Cones", "article": "PREMIER PASSIONS Whenever the Fiver is having difficulty deciding what opinion to have on thorny issues - blonde v brunette, Tin v Special Drink, Hollyoaks v Ben Fogle&apos;s Extreme Dreams - we find out what somebody we habitually disagree with thinks, then take the opposite view. &quot;I think it&apos;s going to the well too many times with our players,&quot; said PFA chief Gordon Taylor of the Premier League&apos;s proposal to add an extra fixture to the list and send teams flying around the world to play them, prompting the Fiver to decide once and for all that the Premier League&apos;s latest money-generating wheeze is emphatically A Very Good Thing. We began to suspect ours was the correct stance when it emerged that the Football Supporters&apos; Federation was planning to stop the Premier League in their tracks by ... staging some half-hearted demonstrations. &quot;The FSF is planning local action at every Premier League club, inviting supporters of all teams to unite under the banner &apos;NO TO GAM\u00a3 39&apos;. They&apos;ve gone too far this time - and the time to do the right thing is right now,&quot; thundered a threatening statement that&apos;s bound to have the fan-friendly fat cats at Premier League HQ trembling in their expensive hand-stitched Italian loafers. Further confirmation that we were on solid ground arrived when Sunderland manager Roy Keane, who totally unpartisan Roy Keane biographer Eamon Dunphy once described as &quot;the perfect human being&quot; who &quot;is always right about everything&quot; agreed with us. &quot;Sometimes change is good,&quot; he said. &quot;I know our fans and I know they would probably find a way of travelling in numbers, even if it is on the moon - particularly if it is against Newcastle.&quot; It was a ringing endorsement of the Premier League&apos;s plan that was only slightly undermined when he went on to say &quot;the group of players [here at Sunderland], I wouldn&apos;t swap them for anybody&quot;. What, not even Michael Chopra for Ronaldinho? Meanwhile, at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson was providing further evidence that sending teams abroad in January is a super idea by cantankerously bristling about the fact that he hadn&apos;t been consulted about any of this. &quot;This should be discussed internally by clubs before they come to this position we are in today,&quot; growled the man fabled for his extreme reluctance to drag Manchester United halfway around the world in the middle of the domestic season for no good reason. The Fiver&apos;s final thought: the success of the NFL&apos;s whistle-stop visit to London last year - a stadium full of gullible, foam finger-waving gridiron devotees watching a dreadful spectacle in the rain - shows that there are eejits out there who will pay to watch anything if you market it hard enough. Let&apos;s give Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Miami, Shanghai, the Moon and Mars some Bolton v Wigan Premier League classics to chew on. Actually, let&apos;s give them as many as they want. The sooner we can ship Richard Scudamore and his bloated money-making jamboree out of the country for good, the sooner the rest of us can get on with enjoying proper, competitive, sleeves-up, top-flight Championship football.

ON YOUR BIKEY! It&apos;s not the first thing you think of when you decide to embark on medical training. It&apos;s more about the graduation ceremonies, the professional esteem, the overt $exual advances from single women in their early thirties. In fact the Fiver can only assume it never entered the head of the Ghanaian physio tending to Rigobert Song during last night&apos;s African Cup of Nations semi-final that his career choices might lead directly to a furious Mick &quot;Not the Ears&quot; McManus style body-check from an enraged and heavily perspiring Andre Bikey on a steamy night in Accra. Bikey was reportedly incensed at the amount of time it was taking to load his team-mate on to a stretcher. Which has certainly given the Fiver a few ideas for the next time it has to spend half an hour reading Best! in Dr Zszgrzbbzg&apos;s waiting room when all it wants is a repeat prescription for its unsightly rash unction. The Reading bruiser is banned from the final against Egypt after his red card and has also single-handedly resurrected all those lazy stereotypes about lack of discipline, naivety, not knowing the rules - and just as the Premier League was doing so well. The presence of Bikey&apos;s Invincible Woodlouses [note: may not be correct zany nickname] in Sunday&apos;s final is still something of a shock, mainly because on the Fiver&apos;s grainy wind-up black and white they&apos;ve looked very much like 10 cloggers plus Samuel Eto&apos;o. &quot;Cameroon has the best bench in the tournament,&quot; was the explanation of their coach Otto Pfister, who sounds like Germany&apos;s answer to Ben Dover. The Fiver was going to add something about a lovely beech-effect finish here, but unfortunately it collapsed on to its own nicotine-stained keyboard at the shame of it. Pfister&apos;s Indestructible Mosquitoes will now face the Furious Pine Cones of Egypt, also surprise finalists thanks to last night&apos;s 4-1 duffing up of hosts Ghana. Even more exciting, Yakubu has finally washed up at Goodison Park after going awol following Nigeria&apos;s exit last weekend. The Yak has been dropped for tomorrow&apos;s game against Reading after &quot;talks&quot; with Dave &quot;The Eyes&quot; Moyes. An \u00a380,000 fine could also be in the offing.

How refreshing", "article": "For a man who was once terrified of change, it has been quite a week. Playing a full 90 minutes for England - for the first time in almost three years - working with a new manager, and hearing of Premier League plans to play a round of fixtures abroad. In the old days it would have played havoc with my senses. Change used to dog me. I preferred to stick with what I knew, hence all those obsessive pre-match rituals I used to go through. Playing for England last week, I remembered those days. Somehow the newness of the game at Wembley reminded me of my England debut under Glenn Hoddle, 11 years ago against Mexico. It is a wry comparison because at that time in my career everything was going wrong. I was at the height of my obsessive behaviour, my performances in the League were poor and, despite not having a save to make, I still managed to mess up. My life quickly imploded. Since moving to Portsmouth, everything has changed for the better. Against Mexico that day I had felt the excitement of a debut, but as soon as the whistle blew the match became a damp squib. On Wednesday against Switzerland, give or take 30 minutes at the start, I felt we were spot-on: manager, staff and players. The result spoke for itself. On the pitch I was genuinely buzzing. We didn&apos;t know the line-up until five minutes before getting on the coach - classic Deal or No Deal territory - and the tension was tangible. The hacks were the only ones not impressed with the timing of the squad announcement. Someone suggested Mr Capello should be more like Slaven Bilic, who named his Croatia side the day before the match, but what&apos;s the point of having someone in charge if they just do what everyone else wants? The new regime and its rules inevitably became a talking point, but in reality the changes were small reminders of common courtesy - timekeeping, turning off mobile phones during mealtimes and eating together. The papers have been marvelling over the boss calling us by our surnames, but it&apos;s no revelation and it suits my train-spotter outlook to a tee. I like things to be right and proper, none of that fluffy first-name nonsense. What struck me most was how everyone in the squad was treated as an equal. Mr Capello didn&apos;t jump on the favourites and leave everybody else behind. He made us feel as though we were together as one team - rather than a large group supporting a tiny nucleus. There will be obvious comparisons with my England managerial hero Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson - the Italian style, the authority - but the new boss is more directly involved in training. He is hands-on, even with goalkeeping. It&apos;s refreshing. And there&apos;s dialogue; he has his own ideas, but he asks the players&apos; opinions. Other managers would rather tell you what they want than ask you what you think. In four days of taking in new information, there was no waffle - or &apos;offal&apos; as I call it. Everything was focused towards playing football. For the first time in a long while I felt good about everything. When I heard the news about the Premier League&apos;s discussions to play a round of fixtures abroad, however, I must say I wasn&apos;t immediately taken with the idea. Since then I haven&apos;t spoken to one person who is excited about the proposal. The scheme is likened to the NFL - of which I&apos;m a huge fan - and its system of one fixture being played abroad each year; but one fixture is very different to a whole programme of games. It&apos;s times like these you need a number of heads on - I call it the Worzel Gummidge approach. Thinking with my eco-crusader head the idea is disastrous. The environmental impact of 20 teams flying abroad is a negative when football should be promoting a reduced-carbon footprint. My &apos;collector&apos; head worries about the obsessive fan who hasn&apos;t missed a game in 15 years, and won&apos;t have the budget to fly thousands of miles to watch his team - heralding yet further shifts in the demographic of our supporters. The other problem is attendance. When we played in the Asia Trophy in Hong Kong pre-season, it was a fantastic atmosphere with a full house, but would it have been the same had Liverpool not been present? Outside of the top four clubs, how much demand will there be for tickets to watch games between lower-end teams? And are we already so far beyond the old- fashioned notion of bums on seats that we are resigned to virtual supporters subscribing via pay TV? In an industry that frequently bemoans congested fixture lists and match fatigue as detrimental to our national team, how can we seriously think of introducing yet more games and more travelling? It&apos;s only with my business head on that I can appreciate the plans. The Premier League is fantastically successful but, if we don&apos;t continue to develop, other countries could replicate what we have here and we could lose our top talent to rival leagues. The global approach is a race in which the Premier League clearly wants to be ahead. Psychology teaches you to embrace change, whether that&apos;s surnames and Deal or No Deal, or accepting that a few years down the line Bolton v Portsmouth might have been played in Shanghai yesterday afternoon instead of the Reebok. All in all, I&apos;ve got to admit it&apos;s been a pretty exciting week. \u00b7 David James has donated his fee for this column to the Oakley Waterman Foundation, for children suffering life-threatening illness", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Fabio Capello"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-10T00:26:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/10/biography.shopping", "sentences": ["The child of expat parents in Shanghai, he was interned in a Japanese prison camp in 1943.", "Growing up in Shanghai, &apos;the wickedest city in the world&apos;, he admits: &apos;I would see something strange and mysterious, but treat it as normal&apos;, a juvenile manifesto for his surreal imagination.", "Slowly and painfully, he began to dissect the pathology of his early life, from Shanghai to Shepperton.", "Shanghai Jim, as he was known in camp, made the most of internment."], "title": "Review: Miracles of Life by JG Ballard", "article": "Miracles of Life by JG Ballard  Fourth Estate \u00a314.99, pp278 Graham Greene once wrote that a writer&apos;s childhood is the bank at which, in later life, he will cash his creative cheques. In another exploration of the writer&apos;s inspiration, he also declared, in A Sort of Life, that novelists write out of &apos;a desire to reduce a chaos of experience to some sort of order&apos;. If the extraordinary life and work of JG (Jim) Ballard is a case study of these observations, then Miracles of Life, his autobiography, is a detached commentary on a life foretold. Between the ages of 13 and 33, the young Ballard suffered the kind of experience that perhaps only the 20th century could provide. The child of expat parents in Shanghai, he was interned in a Japanese prison camp in 1943. Having survived, and even thrived, in some gruelling conditions, he came home to a country devastated by the war. Here, in late adolescence, he was packed off to school (where, he notes, &apos;the food was worse&apos; than in camp), studied medicine at Cambridge, dropped out, joined the RAF, was stationed in Canada and married Mary, settling down to family life in Shepperton. He was just beginning to make a name for himself as a new-wave science fiction writer, while raising three young children, when Mary died prematurely abroad, from a savage and inexplicable pneumonia. That, in summary, is the meat of this autobiography. Vanity is the curse of successful writers, but Miracles of Life is impressively free from all forms of show (no name-dropping; no index; scarcely any photographs). Moreover, what this brief, modest and occasionally shattering book only glances at is the extraordinary body of work that has flowed from this remarkable life. For many readers, Ballard is the author of the controversial novel Crash (1973), a surreal exploration of sexuality and the motor car. But before Crash, and before his wife&apos;s death, Ballard&apos;s novels had begun to shape a unique suburban dystopia. In its time, this vision was categorised as science fiction. Now we can see it more clearly as deeper, darker and more prophetic. To fans of this early work, Miracles of Life will be at once disappointing and fascinating. The disappointment is intrinsic to Ballard&apos;s achievement. He has mined this material so often and so brilliantly in the past that he can hardly have much that&apos;s new to say. Read the 30-odd pages devoted to Lunghua Camp: remarkable enough, but not a patch on Empire of the Sun, the bestselling novel that transformed that experience into art. Still, there are numerous compensating fascinations. Successful writers in old age are often reluctant to discuss their inspiration for fear of betraying the mystery of their art. Ballard, the former medical student who loved to dissect and has always stood out as an iconoclast, has no trouble with exposing some of his secrets. Growing up in Shanghai, &apos;the wickedest city in the world&apos;, he admits: &apos;I would see something strange and mysterious, but treat it as normal&apos;, a juvenile manifesto for his surreal imagination. Ballard writes that his boyhood project was &apos;to find the real in all this make-believe&apos;. But then, as a young man in Attlee&apos;s Britain, he found himself in &apos;a world that was almost too real&apos;. Hence, he says, his adult determination to treat England, &apos;as if it were a strange fiction&apos;. A few years later, now at King&apos;s College, dissecting cadavers in the Fifties Cambridge of Crick and Watson, Ballard decides that &apos;psychoanalysis and Surrealism were a key to the truth about existence and the human personality and also a key to myself&apos;. In the battle to make sense of things, the &apos;preposterous society&apos; of England was no help. To save himself from &apos;the suffocations of English life&apos;, Ballard seized on the great modernists, &apos;Hemingway, Dos Passos, Kafka, Camus, Joyce and Dostoevsky&apos;. Slowly and painfully, he began to dissect the pathology of his early life, from Shanghai to Shepperton. His &apos;entire fiction&apos;, he says, explores a psychic terrain that runs from &apos;the threat of nuclear war to the assassination of President Kennedy, from the death of my wife to the violence that underpinned the entertainment culture of the last decades of the century&apos;. There, indeed, is the bank at which Ballard has cashed his literary cheques. But, because Ballard is never less than ruthlessly honest about what he sees and feels, Miracles of Life also tells quite another story, unconscious and inadvertent, perhaps, but finally brave in a way that elevates it to a level of greatness. In this book, we discover a little boy who grew up with &apos;patriotic newsreels, suspicious of all British adults&apos;, a nine-year-old steeped in GA Henty, Dickens and Charles Kingsley, who transcribes pages of Westward Ho!, and for whom &apos;home&apos; was the England of AA Milne, Just William and Chums . To this child of the British empire, &apos;reality was a stage set that could be dismantled at any moment&apos;. A lesser character might have been overwhelmed, but that was no problem for &apos;a 12-year-old who thrived on change&apos;. Shanghai Jim, as he was known in camp, made the most of internment. It was, he writes, &apos;a prison where I found freedom&apos;. When the war was over, he was the boy who &apos;knew that childhood had passed for good&apos;. But, of course, it hadn&apos;t. When Ballard began to write, he would be shaped by his inheritance. &apos;At heart,&apos; he confesses, &apos;I was an old-fashioned storyteller with a lively imagination.&apos; This, perhaps, is the key to Ballard, an outcast of empire who found self-expression scavenging the fertile wasteland of 20th-century modernism. Tellingly, however, as an Anglo-Saxon narrator, he cannot conceal from his readers at the end the devastating news that this may be his last book.", "tags": ["Books", "Biography", "Culture", "JG Ballard"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-10T14:09:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/11/architecture.chinaarts2008", "sentences": ["Ai Weiwei, who once smashed a 2,000-year-old Han dynasty vase to make a decidedly iconoclastic point about Chinese art, and who, in 2000, curated a highly controversial art show in Shanghai entitled Fuck Off, was raised in a labour camp in Xinjiang province."], "title": "Jonathan Glancey sneaks a look inside Beijing's new Olympic stadium", "article": "When Sebastian Coe unveiled the design of the 2012 London Olympics stadium in November, you could have heard a pin drop. There was a breathless hush - and stifled yawns. Was this really it? The architect was smooth-talking, but as I looked around, the mood of photographers, cameramen and journalists said it all. It might well do the job, but its design seemed almost wilfully lacklustre. In dramatic contrast, the main stadium for this year&apos;s Beijing Olympics is, quite simply, stunning. Here is an adventure in steel and concrete, a building - despite its age-old purpose - like no other. Its structure is very nearly complete, while the fit-out, with its plethora of shops, restaurants, cafes, bars and meeting places, is racing ahead. At times, there have been as many as 7,000 construction workers on site, yet this is no rush job. It is a work of exceptional quality. If China has set out to impress the world with the 2008 Olympics, the stadium and its attendant buildings - the Aquatics Centre and Digital Beijing (the Olympics &quot;command post&quot;) - have set a heady precedent. The furtive London Olympics, with its glum building site hidden behind what can only ever be known as the Great Wall of Stratford, will struggle to match the design standards set by the Chinese, although Zaha Hadid and her wave-like swimming pool offer a ray of hope for the London event. At the moment, although the Beijing stadium can be seen from the long avenues flanking the Olympic Park, access is barred to all but the most determined. Guards in thick green army coats and fur hats patrol the gate, while workers - from the far-flung provinces, mostly, and earning about \u00a33 a day - troop in and out. Inside the compound where the stadium sits, its structure now complete, men stand on high-level walkways brandishing welding guns. Others balance precariously from the steelwork; at least 10 are said to have fallen and died here. An eye-catching design even from a distance, the stadium proves to be a mind-bogglingly complex artefact as you get up close, and it is just as dizzying on the inside. The Chinese named it the Bird&apos;s Nest as soon as its creators - Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, working with Arup and the China Architectural Design and Research Group - unveiled their design five years ago. It measures 320 metres by 297 metres, and is 69 metres high. Its mesmeric steel frame, 41,875 tonnes in all, loops, swoops and swirls over and around the great, red, concrete 91,000-seat arena. What had seemed to be a solid structure from a distance proves to be a filigree Chinese puzzle close up. Jacques Herzog has described this 12-metre-deep frame as &quot;an architectural forest&quot;, its beams, stairs, frames and other steel elements standing in for trees and branches, and providing an awe-inspiring transitional space between the exterior, the Olympic Park, and the interior, where the arena awaits. The latter, a great, red bowl of concrete, proves to be almost circular, so everyone is equally close to the running-jumping-vaulting action. This makes it just that bit different from other ambitious stadiums, such as Wembley, and it does feel that bit more of a piece, streamlined even. Above the tiers of plastic seats and confident-looking clocks, the roof is a simple membrane designed to keep out sun and storm (the Olympics take place in August, when Beijing is hot and thundery) and to act as a foil to that intricate steel skeleton. When the Games are over, the stadium will host sporting and cultural events, as well as rock concerts and those ineffable flag-waving parades so beloved of the Chinese. By then, the stadium will sit comfortably in landscaped gardens, also designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, intended to be contemporary plays on traditional Chinese themes. If all goes to plan, the Olympic Park might yet turn out to be an Unforbidden City, a people&apos;s palace gardens of the future. Not everyone likes the Bird&apos;s Nest, though - least of all Beijing artist Ai Weiwei, whom Herzog &amp; de Meuron persuaded to work on the design. Ai Weiwei, who once smashed a 2,000-year-old Han dynasty vase to make a decidedly iconoclastic point about Chinese art, and who, in 2000, curated a highly controversial art show in Shanghai entitled Fuck Off, was raised in a labour camp in Xinjiang province. In the 1950s, his father Ai Qing, one of China&apos;s most celebrated modern poets, was denounced as &quot;an enemy of the state and a rightist&quot;. Ai Weiwei tends to speak his mind, even in a country that still frowns on free expression. He likens the 2008 Olympics to &quot;a pretend smile&quot; and, although he believes the stadium to be beautiful, he also calls it a &quot;public relations sham&quot; hiding the true political nature of China. His stance serves as a reminder that this global sporting event has not always gone hand-in-hand with polite politics and international camaraderie, however great its architecture and athletes. The Bird&apos;s Nest sits near the second of the major Beijing Olympic venues, the Water Cube; or, to give it its official name, the National Aquatics Centre. This magical structure - designed by Australian architects PTW with Arup, the Shenzen Design Institute and the China State Construction and Engineering Corporation - has just opened and is already hosting a Chinese swimming competition. In essence, the Water Cube is a big, \u00a350m steel and concrete box containing a huge swimming pool flanked by 17,000 seats. But what an extraordinary box it is. The pattern of the structure has been designed to hold huge pillows of ETFE, a lightweight substitute for glass, the same inflated hi-tech material used to clad the domes of Cornwall&apos;s Eden Centre. The pattern is based on the natural formation of soap bubbles to give a random, organic appearance. It was clearly clever, not to mention fun, to make a big box into an architectural and engineering conjuring trick. Yet this is also a responsible design; the pillows heat up in the sun, and this in turn heats the water in the pool and feeds into the rest of the building. It is exceedingly efficient. In the evening, as an added bonus, the Water Cube glows a happy, swimming pool blue; it looks great from the street, one of those buildings you feel compelled to go and have a look at. The last of the three major Olympic buildings was designed by Zhu Pei, a Beijing architect trained in the US as well as China. This is Digital Beijing, the control and data centre for the Games, scheduled to become a museum and exhibition centre for digital design and technologies and, apparently, a communications hub for the city. Zhu&apos;s design, in stark contrast to the stadium, is a sequence of tall buildings that look, on first encounter, rather like upright 1960s IBM computers. What makes it a delight, as you get up close, is Zhu&apos;s creative use of unexpected materials. A special fibre he developed with a Chinese manufacturer will be used for floors in the building, and is ideally suited for the projection of ever-changing digital images. Equally, the material is strong enough to be used for sci-fi-style pedestrian bridges within the building. As for the oddly gleaming end walls of the pavilion, these are composed of aluminium sheets made to look, strangely, like stone. The technique was developed by a Chinese tin can manufacturer. Ingenious - and the result is delightful. Zhu is one of a number of Chinese architects who have been able to set up their own studios freely in recent years, and who are keen to invent and develop a modern Chinese architecture that plays with, rather than mimics, tradition, one that is as independent as it wishes to be from contemporary western practice. The great luxury Zhu has enjoyed with the Olympic project is time. Most modern Chinese architecture is raced up as fast and as cheaply as possible, leaving precious little time for original thought or craftsmanship. Yet the three major Olympic buildings have been almost five years in the making. And they are not just for the summer Games. Each has something to offer a new, specifically Chinese architecture that might yet emerge - against the political and economic odds - in the coming years. For this alone, each deserves a gold medal, though the spellbinding Bird&apos;s Nest deserves a special award of its own. The designs will be on show at the V&amp;A&apos;s China Design Now exhibition, opening in London next month, but nothing quite prepares you for the reality.

Madonna, the queen of reinvention, has done it once more by arriving in Berlin as the director, co-writer and executive producer for the world premiere of an 80-minute film called Filth and Wisdom. Everyone was expecting a turkey from the woman whose previous movie experience has included starring in Swept Away and Shanghai Surprise, and by general consent, it was. Despite her lofty ambitions, the first morning screening was greeted by a smattering of applause and a general sense of disbelief. Madonna was giving no interviews but did face the press last night. She revealed that she was exploring the idea of releasing Filth and Wisdom, which was originally meant as a 20-minute short, on the internet. &quot;It&apos;s quite exciting because it&apos;s a non-conventional way for a film to be seen and I like doing things in a non-conventional way.&quot; She said the movie was about the duality of life. &quot;It&apos;s also about the struggle with that duality. Filth and wisdom is the ultimate duality. You can learn and find enlightenment in either place.&quot; The main character is played by Eugene Hutz, the lead singer of New York Gypsy punk band Gogol Bordello. Asked whether she was attracted to the Gypsy lifestyle Madonna said: &quot;I think, secretly, I want to be a Gypsy. I love the idea of travelling round and playing music and letting life unfold in a spontaneous way.&quot; Asked how she related to her film&apos;s characters, Madonna got all profound. &quot;In spite of what appears to be my material success, I still feel like I&apos;m struggling with the contradictions of life, the duality of life. I&apos;m still struggling to find my way to understand the difference between right and wrong. To see things for what they are, to not be tricked by illusions, and I think I vacillate between light and dark.&quot; Madonna, composed and funny, also said she had just finished producing a documentary about Malawi, where she adopted her son, which would be shown at the Cannes film festival. Filth and Wisdom is a morality tale whose message appears to be that in order to be good and wise, we all need a bit of filth in our lives. Hutz stars as a philosophising S&amp;M escort, beating up grateful clients and spanking a schoolboy-outfitted Guardian reader. Other characters include a thieving chemist&apos;s shop worker and a ballet dancer forced to lap dance. In her programme notes Madonna says: &quot;When the film was finished I realised that they [the three main characters] were all aspects of me so the whole experience was both artistic and therapeutic. &quot;I have always been inspired by the films of Goddard [sic], Visconti, Passolini [sic] and Fellini and hope that I may one day make something that comes close to their genius.&quot; For Madonna it represents another string to her already very large bow, albeit one she may come to regret. She is still the queen of pop, the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century, but also a record producer, fashion designer, children&apos;s book author, and British lady of the manor.", "tags": ["Film", "US news", "World news", "Madonna", "Berlin film festival", "Music", "Culture", "Festivals", "Berlin film festival 2008"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-14T10:51:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/14/olympics2012.humanrights", "sentences": ["Brown&apos;s officials insist he did raise human rights on his recent two-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai, but details are scarce."], "title": "China feels heat as activists take their cue from Spielberg", "article": "The Chinese authorities yesterday received an uncomfortable preview of the scrutiny and criticism likely to accompany the Beijing Olympics this summer as human rights groups hailed Steven Spielberg&apos;s withdrawal from his role as an artistic adviser to the games. Campaign groups vowed to turn their attention to the major Olympic sponsors and other high-profile supporters of the games as they celebrated the international reaction to Spielberg&apos;s decision.  The director stepped down from his role as artistic adviser to Beijing late on Tuesday, citing his opposition to China&apos;s support for the Sudanese regime responsible for the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. He accused China of not doing enough to press Sudan to end the &quot;continuing human suffering&quot; in the troubled region. China imports two-thirds of Sudan&apos;s oil and in return is said to be the African country&apos;s biggest arms supplier. Spielberg&apos;s move, taken after months of sustained pressure form his Hollywood peers, led by actor Mia Farrow, apparently took Beijing by surprise.  The state-controlled media pointedly ignored the story and the Beijing organising committee for the Olympic games is understood to be preparing a statement which is likely to be issued this morning.  However, Spielberg&apos;s action is bound to anger and alarm the authorities as it comes amid growing complaints about Beijing&apos;s record on human rights and Tibet, and is likely to encourage attempts to use the Olympics as leverage on those issues. There is particular concern that the government is cracking down on critics to ensure that they do not embarrass it during the games.  Human rights groups vowed to do just that by targeting other high-profile institutions and individuals: &quot;Olympic corporate sponsors are putting their reputations at risk unless they work to convince the Chinese government to uphold the human rights pledges it made to bring the games to Beijing,&quot; said Minky Worden, media director at Human Rights Watch. &quot;Human rights are under attack in China and Olympic sponsors should use their considerable leverage to persuade Beijing to change policy.&quot; Major Olympic sponsors include household names such as Coca-Cola, McDonalds and Kodak. Dr James Smith, chief executive of the Aegis Trust, which campaigns to prevent genocide around the world, said: &quot;This is the biggest message to the Chinese that turning a blind eye to the atrocities in Darfur is unacceptable. Spielberg has demonstrated that collective responsibility means everyone&apos;s responsibility.&quot; Spielberg&apos;s decision, declared in the pages of the Hollywood journal Variety, comes in a week in which the political ramifications of China&apos;s hosting of the games moved to the forefront of public attention. While the Chinese consider the Olympics a coming-out party that will mark their emergence as a major player on the world stage, human rights groups and non-governmental organisations aim to draw attention to Beijing&apos;s failings. The arrival of 20,000 journalists in China this summer - two for every athlete - provides opponents of the Chinese government with an unprecedented opportunity to make their case. Criticism of China&apos;s human rights record has coalesced around the issue of Sudan, which Beijing has enthusiastically supported through trade, arms sales and advocacy at the United Nations. More than 200,000 people are thought to have been killed and a further 2.5 million forced from their homes in the five-year conflict between Sudan&apos;s Arab-dominated government and Darfur&apos;s black African rebels. Spielberg&apos;s announcement coincided with a global day of action in more than a dozen major cities around the world by opponents of the Sudanese regime who called on China to help end the Darfur crisis. The British Olympic Association was forced to rewrite its athletes&apos; contract for Beijing this week after widespread criticism of a clause that barred athletes from discussing &quot;politically sensitive&quot; issues. Dr David Zweig, director of the Centre on China&apos;s Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said he believed Spielberg&apos;s actions would be damaging: &quot;Clearly, Spielberg is a big enough and important enough person that this decision certainly colours the world&apos;s view of the Olympics and brings politics front and centre - something the government would have preferred not to see. Internationally, their message is that China is here on the world stage, is a major player and can pull off a world-class event ... they know their international prestige is on the line.&quot; There is deep concern in China that athletes will use the platform of medal success to denounce the country, and at least one campaign group, Team Darfur, is recruiting athletes to do so. British badminton player Richard Vaughan, who hopes to make the Olympic team, said he would defy an attempt at gagging him and speak out about Sudan if asked.  British ministers insisted yesterday that the government would not support any call for a boycott of the Beijing games, but Andy Burnham, the culture secretary, acknowledged that Spielberg had made a point. &quot;He obviously felt very strongly about it and has now very successfully raised the issue,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think you can make a clean separation between representative sport and the situation in any particular country. The world&apos;s a complicated place and we have to work together to address those problems.&quot; Downing Street would not comment but the prime minister&apos;s official spokesman said last month that Gordon Brown had &quot;no intention of supporting a boycott of the Beijing Olympics&quot;.  Ministers believe that the Olympics can spur China to do more on human rights, as well as draw attention to their failings.  Brown argues privately that democracy can emerge slowly in China, but acknowledges that there is work to do. Foreign secretary David Miliband, who is heading to China in the next fortnight for a week-long visit, said in a lecture at Oxford this week: &quot;Now, with the economic success of China, we can no longer take the forward march of democracy for granted.&quot; Miliband will meet his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, for talks. Darfur will be on the agenda. Brown&apos;s officials insist he did raise human rights on his recent two-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai, but details are scarce. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrats&apos; foreign affairs spokesman, said: &quot;Gordon Brown&apos;s silence on human rights and Darfur during his recent Chinese trip stands in sharp contrast to his hand-wringing over Darfur when back in Britain.&quot; The International Olympic Committee maintains that staging the games in China will bring benefits. In December IOC president Jacques Rogge told the Guardian the games would be a &quot;force for good&quot;. &quot;But they will not solve all the world&apos;s problems.&quot;", "tags": ["Human rights", "Sudan", "China", "US news", "World news", "Film", "Olympics 2008", "Culture", "Darfur", "Law", "Africa", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-14T12:24:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/14/minutebyminute.aberdeen", "sentences": ["&quot;Right, Paul, I&apos;m upping the stakes: if the Dons win I will buy my wife, Katrina, two Jade bracelets in Shanghai!"], "title": "Football: Aberdeen v Bayern Munich - live minute-by-minute!", "article": "Preamble: [GU hack wrestles with clich\u00e9d instinct.

Is this a record?&apos;&quot; reminds Praveen Kumar. &quot;Possibly, but a far more important record is that 31 minutes have passed and Gary Naylor has not mailed yet.&quot; He has. With a Valentine&apos;s Day pun. I just didn&apos;t publish it. Not that his love for GU is unrequited, just that I&apos;m a man of principle. 35 mins: Aluko nutmegs Lucio and hares towards the box, but Lell slides in to deny his a shooting opportunity. 39 mins: This game is now officially as scrappy as Scooby Doo&apos;s nephew. &quot;I am watching from Regensburg,&quot; yelps Markus Karl. &quot;Bayern have looked absolutely awful to me so far. They&apos;re clueless. Just long-ball stuff. Is it because Jurgen Klinsmann just woke up in his California home and checked in to see his side play?&quot; Not a Klinsi fan, then, Markus? Tell us more. GOAL!! Aberdeen 2-1 Bayern (Aluko 41&apos;) Lovely striker from Aluko, who&apos;s had a terrific game so far. Severin pounced on a breaking ball around midfield and nodded it hopefully forward. Aluko was first on the scene, looped it over Lell and flashed a low shot into the net from the edge of the box! 43 mins: More dithering by Bayern&apos;s defender and Aluko again claims possession. But this time is powerful shot from 25 yards whizzes just past the post. Half-time: An energetic and enterprising Aberdeen side deservedly lead the Bundesliga table-toppers, who thought they could just strut around Scotland and go home with an easy victory. They&apos;ll have to get their finger out if they&apos;re to avoid ignominy here. &quot;Some admirably prompt and computer literate Aberdeen fan has already updated Josh Walker&apos;s wikipedia page,&quot; gushes Chris Thomas, who may or may not be praising himself. Your half-time pep talk, courtesy of Billy Clark &quot;As a North London-based emigr\u00e9, who was still in Aberdeen back in 1983, I never thought the dandy dons would be featuring in an MBM!&quot; mewls Billy. &quot;I was a stereotypical sceptic back then, convinced that I&apos;d seen it all before and of course Bayern would just keep hitting us on the break for a goal whenever they needed one. Ah, but I was so much older then.... and I&apos;m thoroughly enjoying this. And the team sheets take me back twenty years or so to days when the foreign sounding names were more likely to be playing for the European team. Who are these guys, anyway? Toni? Ze Roberto? What chance have they got against Maybury, Mackie, Miller and Mair? 46 mins: Bayern change: From the last of the stein comes pint-sized Philippe Lahm, in place of Lell. Bayern&apos;s salvage operation begins in earnest ... 48 mins: Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock ... Bayern still no closer to a dignified result, though they are stroking the ball around impressively in the middle. 51 mins: Ottl spanks the ball embarrassingly wide from 25 yards. GOAL! Aberdeen 2-2 Bayern (Altintop 54&apos;)  Penalty! Lucky, lucky Bayern. They were going nowhere until Ze Roberto clipped in a harmless cross towards. It banged against the arm of Maybury, who was too close to move away. Langfield saves Altintop&apos;s spot-kick! But the rebound falls straight to the taker, who rams it gratefully into the net. 56 mins: Aberdeen rollick forward a new and a clearly flustered Lucio shanks an attempted clearance, bringing hearty laughs from the home crowd, who remain furious about the penalty decision and a farcical Altintop dive just after the restart. 59 mins: Amid boos from the Dons&apos; faithful, Bayern besiege their opponents&apos; box. &quot;Re: Josh Walker&apos;s Wikipedia page. How in hell can he have earned himself the nickname &quot;Dr. Love&quot; for scoring a goal when the match isn&apos;t even over?&quot; roars Luke Rickard. &quot;Methinks Mr Thomas is trying to write himself a little piece of history...&quot; Well, if that&apos;s the case, then I think we should all doff our caps to Mr Thomas because that&apos;s some quality nicknamin&apos;. Not as good as Olivier T\u00e9bily&apos;s moniker when he was at Celtic, of course. There he was known as &apos;Bombscare&apos; Tebily because of the speed at which he ran away from the ball whenever it threatened to go near him ... 63 mins: Nicholson bundles Jansen into touch, ending another Bayern burst. &quot;Why am I not surprised that, instead of being on a romantic date with a lady, Gary Naylor is spending his Valentine&apos;s evening mailing a MBM report?&quot; asks Nathan Smith, who must surely have foreseen that I would throw that slur right back at him. Oh, he did. &quot;My excuse is that it&apos;s mid-afternoon in New York and I&apos;m stuck in the office.&quot; Yes, but what have you got lined up for tonight, Mr Loverman? 65 mins: Aberdeen relieve the pressure and start to exert some of their own. Severin&apos;s weak shot is easily blocked by Lucio, and the move dies. 67 mins: Substitution: Ze Roberto off; Podolski on. 68 mins: Substitution: Mackie off; Steve Lovell on. 70 mins: Diamond curtails a Bayern break with a magnificent tackle on Podolski by the corner flag. Josh Walker wikipedia update According to the leading online encyclopaedia: &quot;Josh joined Aberdeen on 29 January 2008, where he is on loan till the end of the 2007/2008 season. It was announced shortly afterwards that he had signed a new one year contract with Boro, keeping him at the club until June 2009. Walker scored his first goal for Aberdeen on 14th February against Bayern Munich, earning him the nickname Dr. Love. Immediately after the goal, Josh became a hit with the female fans. He is reported to have told his agent at half time in that very match that he was to release a single entitled: &apos;Dr Love&apos;s Bayern Luvbug&apos;&quot; You naughty imps. 74 mins: Bayern monopolising possession but doing nowt with it, apart from chucking in some crosses that Diamond and Considine are repelling masterfully. &quot;That&apos;s really great,&quot; waaaahs Ian Copestake. &quot;Emailing in on Valentine&apos;s Day now marks one out as a no-mark incapable of resisting the commercial pressure to sit in a restaurant for no good reason!&quot; 76 mins: Corner to Aberdeen! &quot;Right, Paul, I&apos;m upping the stakes: if the Dons win I will buy my wife, Katrina, two Jade bracelets in Shanghai! And she says I&apos;m not romantic...&quot; Is your wife with you on that raft in the North Sea, Mitch? No wonder she says you&apos;re not romantic. 77 mins: Toni intercepts the corner and charges all the way into the Aberdeen half before teeing up Podolski, whose potent low shot is well held by Langfield. 80 mins: Substitution: Klose off, Schlaudraff on. &quot;Please let Nathan Smith know I am also in New York following this MBM,&quot; toots Tom Astin. &quot;And if he is at a loose end this evening then I can fix him up with Valentines cheer should it be required.&quot; That&apos;s the spirit, lads. 84 mins: Severin flings a long throw into the box. Diamond soars to butt it goalward, but Rensing catches comfortably. 87 mins: Substitution: Josh &quot;Dr Love&quot; Walker off; Touzani on. The only way the Dons are going to win this thing is if I pledge three Jade bracelets. Thus it is so,&quot; replies Mitch Low. &quot;And no, my wife is not offshore with me; she is having a romantic meal at home with the pooch, Hobo.&quot; You&apos;ve left here at home with a bowl of dog food? You really aren&apos;t romantic. You sir are a cad! 89 mins: Schweinsteiger swings and smacks the ball high and wide from 20 yards. &quot;This looks like a job for John Hewitt,&quot; parps Billy Clark. 90 mins: Diamond falls over as he&apos;s about to clear and Langfield pounces to prevent Toni from taking advantage - that would have been cruel. 90+1 mins: Bayern clear a lofted Aberdeen free-kick. &quot;If Mitch had taken his wife with him, would his dog have been The Loneliest Hobo?&quot; wonders Archi Campbell. Full-time: Rank underdogs, Aberdeen played tigerishly to claim a deserved draw. Meeting adjourned to the Allianz Arena.

The young Ballard had already had &quot;a lot to take in and digest&quot;, as he ruefully understates it, on his solitary cycle rides around the &quot;bright but bloody kaleidoscope&quot; of Shanghai, a capitalist boomtown thronging with gangsters, businessmen, soldiers, beggars and prostitutes. There could be no attempt to shield children from the all-pervasive violence and brutality; indeed, chauffeur-driven trips to nearby battlefields, &quot;wives in their silky best&quot;, were a Sunday afternoon diversion. Fascinating as Ballard&apos;s experiences are, this is not new material; he vividly described the extraordinary atmosphere of 1930s Shanghai, the privations of the camps and the dreamlike uncertainty surrounding the last days of the war in his 1984 autobiographical novel Empire of the Sun, a book commercially overshadowing the hypnotic science fiction and edgy experimentalism which had previously made him a cult name. His life writing continued with its 1991 sequel The Kindness of Women, a novel that moves into the first person to chart Jim&apos;s training as a doctor and a pilot, his efforts to become a writer, the premature death of his wife and his domestic bliss bringing up young children in sleepy Shepperton while observing the 60s counterculture and fuelling it with his own literary concoctions. This straight autobiography, then, contains few surprises: Ballard revisits episodes from both novels and there are even precise verbal echoes. Instead, it combines an amazingly lucid distillation of an unusual life with a running analysis of Ballard&apos;s own themes and inspirations as a writer. Shanghai, &quot;cruel and lurid . . . polluted and exciting&quot;, is his primal city, and he ventures that &quot;a large part of my fiction has been an attempt to evoke it by means other than memory&quot;. It was here that he first saw &quot;the drained swimming pools, abandoned hotels and nightclubs, deserted runways and flooded rivers&quot; that recur across decades of his fiction; while that other Ballardian staple, the closed community bubbling with potential violence, can be found in Shanghai&apos;s International Settlement as well as in the internment camps. In Ballard&apos;s case, the life casts an additional light on the work, as it reveals the artistic choices he made when composing his autobiographical novels. The real-life journey to Lunghua was less harrowing than the version in Empire of the Sun, but more incongruous: a gaggle of half-cut Brits, the women in fur coats and the men clutching sports equipment for a ramshackle holiday, waiting round the pool of the American Club for the buses to arrive. Once in the camp, the forced jollity of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan rehearsals dissipated only gradually as conditions worsened and the Japanese guards lost their confidence; but the young Ballard remained buoyant &quot;even when the food rations fell to near zero, skin infections covered my legs, malnutrition had prolapsed my rectum and many of the adults had lost heart&quot;. He was exposed to a far wider social mix than in his previous life, and dashed about the camp gleaning unsuitable stories, doing odd jobs, trying on the guards&apos; traditional armour and irritating his family at every mealtime by counting up the maggots they forced down for protein before &quot;tucking in lustily&quot;. He was, he says now, &quot;probably hyperactive, in today&apos;s jargon&quot;. The presence of his parents in the camp constitutes the main difference between novel and memoir, although considering Ballard&apos;s interest in Freud, his family is surprisingly unobtrusive: he claims to have few memories of his mother in the camp, and none at all of his sister. He notes a lone boy who, like the fictional Jim, was billeted on a reluctant family and had to &quot;fight too hard to survive&quot;. Ballard comes to a chilling conclusion: &quot;Thinking of him now, I realise that part of him had died, and I hope that he never went on to have children of his own.&quot; Yet along with the relentless optimism, Ballard&apos;s survival techniques seem to have included solitariness; one of the war&apos;s many effects on him was an irreversible estrangement from his parents, stripped as they were of the power to protect, punish or reward, and when he walked out of the camp in 1945 he did it alone. The emotional fallout of the war plays a far greater part in the novels, with their inchoate yearning for world war three. Here the tones are measured, tranquil; a tranquillity only possible, perhaps, because he has already written the jagged, urgent version. In fact, this pared-down, understated style lends even more power to a familiar episode in which Ballard witnesses a Japanese soldier strangle a Chinese peasant with telegraph wire, as well as to the later description of his time studying anatomy at Cambridge. These two years were critical for Ballard: an investigation into all those corpses he&apos;d seen, a mastering of the human body so degraded over the preceding years. He writes about dissection in an almost mystical way, seeing &quot;the last breath of their identities&quot; emerge from the remains of worked-over cadavers. It gave him a fund of anatomical metaphors as well as &quot;mysterious feelings&quot; for the doctors who&apos;d donated their bodies to this perversely healing process: think of all the medical men in his novels. Ballard had been considering a role as a storyteller from a very young age; what held him back in Lunghua was a lack of paper. His first review came from a schoolmaster who&apos;d ordered him to write out a Charles Kingsley novel as a punishment. Realising it would be quicker to compose something himself, he was told: &quot;Next time, Ballard, don&apos;t copy your lines from some trashy novel,&quot; which gives an indication of the energetic authority of even his prepubescent writing. Ballard charts his literary journey from &quot;deeply disturbing&quot; children&apos;s books such as the Grimms&apos; tales - preparation, he says, for his beloved surrealists - through his adolescent discovery of Freud and modernism. Psychoanalysis and surrealism provided the key to unlock his literary impulses, but he didn&apos;t find a form until his pilot training in a dead-end Canadian town introduced him to science-fiction magazines, the only reading matter available at the local bus depot. Docking at Southampton, Ballard had been disgusted by &quot;derelict, dark and half-ruined England&quot;, and by the outmoded tropes of the equally dusty realist novel. Here at last was a form that was &quot;actually about the present day, and often as elliptical and ambiguous as Kafka&quot;; one that could be used to explore not the stars but &quot;inner space&quot;. Ballard&apos;s interior journey was to make him a key author of the 20th century. His &quot;dissection of a deep pathology&quot;, as he calls his fiction, was all the more striking for commencing against the gaudy pop art backdrop of the 60s, a celebrity-obsessed media landscape not dissimilar to the present day; the mysterious depths of the psyche were exposed against the smooth surfaces of the modern world. Over half a century he has been a vigorous genre writer, a prescient conjuror of ecological catastrophe, a purveyor of shocking psychodramas, an avant-gardist, a vivid recorder of history, and a great popular novelist. His literary career has been conducted from one &quot;warm domestic nest&quot;, the Shepperton house he declines to leave because it reminds him of the family room in Lunghua. After the destruction of the war and two years of dissection, procreation was a magical act for Ballard, and he writes movingly about his three children, &quot;miracles of life&quot; whom he brought up single-handed after the early death of his wife from a sudden bout of pneumonia. Domestic confinement enabled his imagination to run wild: &quot;My greatest ally was the pram in the hall.&quot; The fragmentary meditations on geometry, psychosis and &quot;celebrity sex death&quot; of The Atrocity Exhibition were composed between the school run and Blue Peter, while anatomies of solitude such as Concrete Island came from the man who could now say, &quot;Thankfully, I had long forgotten what it was like to be alone.&quot; One reason it took him so long to tackle Shanghai was that he didn&apos;t want to expose his young children to memories of the dangers he&apos;d faced at their age, while the most painful part of writing Crash - the feast of deviant sex and high-speed mutilation whose hero bears his name - was the image as he worked of his children at the zebra crossing. &quot;Deep assignments run through all our lives; there are no coincidences.&quot; Ballard has always seen reality as a stage set; the novel Crash was followed by his own car accident, and eventually he appeared as an extra in the story of his childhood, as filmed by Steven Spielberg. However, the artful organising intelligence of the autobiography begins to wind down, petering out into lunches and book tours, as he approaches the present day, and the spur to writing: advanced prostate cancer, and the care of another inspirational doctor. It&apos;s a moving coda to a memoir that effortlessly combines emotional frankness with artistic insight, demonstrating that Ballard has truly staked his life and writing on his credo, &quot;I feel we should immerse ourselves in the most destructive element, ourselves, and swim.&quot;", "tags": ["Books", "Biography", "Culture", "JG Ballard"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-16T00:05:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/16/china", "sentences": ["In Shanghai on Valentine&apos;s Day you would have seen many couples dining by candlelight - but not so their parents, and not in villages an hour&apos;s drive away."], "title": "Xinran: In the new China, sex can still be the stuff of scandal", "article": "An argument is raging in China over images that have been released on the internet showing Edison Chen, one of Hong Kong&apos;s most famous celebrities, engaging in sexual activities with eight of the territory&apos;s top actresses and singers.

You never knew what could be said until someone knocked on your door with a &quot;leader&apos;s order&quot; - or even a punishment. From what my Chinese friends tell me, little has changed. There is no clear standard and little freedom for the &quot;central media&quot;, despite two decades of slow improvement. For the new Chinese generation, the internet has become the platform for free public communication, a very big part of which involves the exchange of views on sex. Anything relating to sex has always been difficult in China. Discussion of these issues was forbidden for thousands of years. A single woman and man sitting together might be arrested as &quot;sexual hooligans&quot;, and at the very least would cause their families to lose face. Before China&apos;s &quot;opening up&quot; policies of the 1980s, you would have been jailed for anything from three months to three years for talking about sex in public. Now? It is possible for a young woman in a city to have sexual relationships with as many men as she wants - as long as she doesn&apos;t mind her family&apos;s nagging and friends&apos; gossip. But not in poor rural areas. There, as a woman, she might pay with her life for being touched by a man, even if just his hand contacts her face. I return to China often, and have always been surprised by the number and speed of the changes in young urban China, including perceptions of sexual relationships. Chinese society&apos;s response to the political and cultural convulsion of the Hong Kong sex scandal offers a telling test case of how far those perceptions - this newborn freedom of the sex press - have moved. More than half the hundreds and thousands of Chinese views on the Edison Chen scandal have expressed anger at &quot;the disgusting images&quot;, &quot;privacy invasion&quot; and &quot;destruction of China&apos;s culture rules&quot;. Many hoped the Hong Kong government could put a stop to the circulation of the images with the threat of heavy punishment; only a very few spoke up for the freedom of media and democracy and argued against media control and traditional taboos. In Chinese, the style of writing and noms de plume employed in chatrooms offer clues about the authors&apos; ages and which part of the political-cultural spectrum they come from. Most government supporters&apos; names and writing sounded as if they came from well-educated or wealthy families, probably born before the 1980s. Those who opposed the government&apos;s position, by contrast, appeared to be much younger, with their language influenced by computers and western visual culture. I also looked at some English views on the scandal and what it says about &quot;China&quot;. My understanding of nuance in English prevents me from making a close analysis, but the difference between how things are seen with English and Chinese eyes is clear. The biggest mistake is to imagine that there is such a thing as a homogeneous Chinese perspective. We are living in a misguidedly over-simplified world. Many Chinese local governments are still offering their best locations to McDonald&apos;s, because they are told McDonald&apos;s is the finest cuisine of the west. At the same time many westerners think sweet and sour pork is the best Chinese dish, yet most Chinese won&apos;t touch it. As for sex, many Chinese women used to think British men never talk about it, because the translated books they read contained nothing of the subject. Many western men, on the other hand, have considered Chinese women uninterested in sex, oblivious to the fact that they had married women brought up in the old China, when the idea of enjoying sex was very, very bad behaviour. In Shanghai on Valentine&apos;s Day you would have seen many couples dining by candlelight - but not so their parents, and not in villages an hour&apos;s drive away. China is on a long march to develop the legal rights and freedoms of a &quot;romantic&quot; society. But westerners also need to climb a Great Wall of understanding, and remember China is made up of many ways of living. \u00b7 Xinran is the author of The Good Women of China, Sky Burial and Miss Chopsticks  comment@theguardian.com", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-16T00:06:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/feb/17/hottopic", "sentences": ["The trip with Hurd, a former Foreign Secretary, to China, takes in the Terracotta Warriors, Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai."], "title": "Good Lord - is that our tour guide?", "article": "As Derek Conway ponders his post-Parliament job options, dare we suggest to him a new career as a package holiday tour guide? The job is often thought of as the preserve of enthusiastic school-leavers or recent history graduates, but there is a growing trend for senior figures from public life to don the guide&apos;s blazer and sally forth with clipboard and umbrella.  This year, no lesser parliamentary personages than Lord (Roy) Hattersley and Lord (Douglas) Hurd will be leading tours for Cox &amp; Kings while cruise company Spirit of Adventure has recruited Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, and the current Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, as lecturers. &apos;Our clients want to come away from their holiday with as much knowledge and experience as possible,&apos; says Nigel Hosking, senior product manager with Cox &amp; Kings. &apos;While the local tour leaders are experts on their country and its sites and can provide valuable insight into the local cultures and traditions, having a well-known and respected expert on the trip adds a whole new dimension.&apos;  And there&apos;s nothing quite as good as a dog collar when it comes to prising open the doors to a crypt that is usually off-limits. Two years ago, the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, faced criticism when he abandoned his pulpit over Easter to accompany a Swan Hellenic tour to Spain and Libya. Undeterred, the Bishop will this year be accompanying the operator&apos;s Norwegian fjords cruise in May. Labour veteran Hattersley will be heading to Cuba in November and will give a variety of talks on Cuba&apos;s history and politics; punters will also get to meet Che Guevara&apos;s son, Camilo. The trip with Hurd, a former Foreign Secretary, to China, takes in the Terracotta Warriors, Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai.  But access to such high-level guides doesn&apos;t come cheap. The 11-night tour of Cuba costs \u00a32,950, while Hurd&apos;s tour of China will cost \u00a32,995 for nine nights. A 15-day cruise with Swan Hellenic costs more than \u00a32,200. But are these guides any good at the job? Tony McDonnell of the Association of Professional Tourist Guides points out that long and rigorous training is required before people become Blue Badge guides. &quot;Guiding isn&apos;t just about facts,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s about relating to people, being adaptable and flexible.

But, while Kazakhstan has not gone down the &quot;colour revolution&quot; route to democracy that other post-Soviet republics such as Ukraine and Georgia have followed, its timidity about reform does not justify isolation. After all, the west is not deterred in the slightest from dealing with authoritarian Russia and communist China. Moreover, Kazakhstan, though a Muslim majority country, has established the type of secular, multi-ethnic, and multi religious polity that the west is seeking to encourage throughout the Muslim world. But the principal reasons for the west not to isolate Kazakhstan are geo-strategic. The Kazakhs are keen to sell their oil and gas to the west at the very moment that the European Union is anxious to shed its dependence on Russian supplies. Yet the window of opportunity for an EU-Kazakh partnership may be closing. Kazakhstan&apos;s historical ties to Russia and its geographical proximity to China have caused a keen competition between those two countries for influence. It is vital that Europe joins in this &quot;great game&quot; for influence and draws Kazakhstan&apos;s political orientation westwards. There are signs that Europe is finally waking up to the possibilities that Kazakhstan offers. Indeed, two recent developments may help anchor Kazakhstan as a western ally. The first is the country&apos;s election to the annual rotating chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2010. Kazakhstan had lobbied for years for this opportunity in the face of fierce opposition from Britain and other EU countries. Its selection to lead the OSCE is seen as a reward for President Nursultan Nazarbayev&apos;s policy of engagement with the west. Russia is deeply suspicious of the OSCE - the Kremlin recently restricted the number of OSCE observers for Russian elections - so Kazakhstan&apos;s future stewardship hints that the Kazahks are anxious to move closer to the west, and unafraid to challenge their former masters in the Kremlin. In the long term, the European neighbourhood policy (ENP), the EU&apos;s blueprint for relations with states on its periphery, offers the best chance for nurturing this relationship. The ENP is designed to forge a &quot;circle of friends&quot; around the EU based on shared interests in security, economic development, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. The European parliament has, for now, rejected the idea that Kazakhstan could one day become an ENP member. But this narrowness of vision will have to be overcome if Kazakhstan is not to be lured into either the Chinese or Russian orbits. Kazakhstan is a suitable partner for the ENP in every respect. The country&apos;s southwest edge is on the same longitude as the countries of the south Caucasus and Turkey, all of which are already ENP countries, or in the case of Turkey, an EU candidate. This alone makes a strong geographical case for Kazakhstan&apos;s ENP status. There are of course concerns about freedom of speech and a lack of media diversity, but conditions in Kazakhstan are no worse than in, say, Azerbaijan, its ethnic Turkic cousin, which is fully in the ENP. Moreover, Kazakhstan is already in formal talks with the EU about human rights issues. But it is Kazakhstan&apos;s strong secular tradition, inherited from its Soviet past, and a very large European Christian minority (approximately 40% of its 15.2 million people) that make it a society that the west needs to encourage, given the Islamic arc of instability upon which it sits. Drawing Kazakhstan westward would help embed this secular tradition. The challenge is clear. Russia and China will not wait for the EU to make up its mind about whether Kazakhstan is a worthy partner. Kazakhstan already plays a key role in the Shanghai cooperation organisation (SCO), a group that comprises Central Asian countries, along with Russia and China. The SCO focuses on regional security, economic ties, and cultural cohesion in much the same way as the OSCE and EU do. There is little doubt that the SCO is an instrument for Russia and China to make the case for a multi-polar world based on regional security blocs that counterbalance American strategic hegemony. It would therefore be tragic if the EU missed the opportunity to tie Kazakhstan firmly to the west. There may not be many more chances.

The showbusiness entrepreneur Xu Wenrong is soliciting donations to build a full-scale replica of the imperial palace and gardens - which were destroyed by the British and French in the Opium wars - in Zhejiang, east China. He has won the support of local Communist party bosses but commentators and historians are horrified by his plans to turn the elegant Qing dynasty treasure, known in Chinese as the Yuanmingyuan, into a glitzy theme park. &quot;The burning and destruction of the Garden of Perfect Brightness was a humiliation for our country and nation,&quot; said Xu at a press conference in Beijing. &quot;Building a new garden is a good deed to wipe away this disgrace.&quot; Xu&apos;s business, the Hengdian Group, is best known for building film sets for the imperial soap operas, which are hugely popular in China. It already has a development containing an imitation of parts of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The local Communist party chief, Zhang Zhongcan, said: &quot;The goal is to build a Chinese Hollywood.&quot; But Xu said the project was a patriotic charity that aimed to collect 20bn yuan (\u00a31.4bn) to recreate the palace and buy back looted treasures. The Hengdian Group said people who donate 500m yuan or more would be honoured with full-size gold statues of themselves on the site. Work would begin this year and the garden would open in 2013. The original palace was built in the 18th and 19th centuries and its pavilions, fountains, lakes and gardens covered 365 acres. In 1860 British and French troops burned and pillaged the palace in revenge for the killing of western prisoners held by Emperor Xianfeng. The events are still taught to Chinese schoolchildren today as evidence of China&apos;s humiliation at the hands of western powers. Victor Hugo wrote bitterly about the events and Charles George Gordon - who later became famous as Gordon of Khartoum, but was then a captain in the Royal Engineers - noted: &quot;You can scarcely imagine the beauty and magnificence of the places we burnt ... It was wretchedly demoralising work for an army.&quot; Hengdian&apos;s proposal has reignited arguments over whether the ruins should be restored. Ruan Yisan, a historian at Tongji University in Shanghai, told local reporters: &quot;The remnants of the Old Summer Palace are witnesses to that period of history, and no matter where you rebuild it, there&apos;s not much value in it.&quot; He suggested the money would be better spent on preserving fragile ancient sites.

His tenure has coincided with a feverish London building boom partly encouraged by his enthusiasm for tall buildings.  His office has approved a slew of skyscrapers, most of which have yet to be built. But when they are, credit crunch permitting, Livingstone&apos;s enthusiasm for towers will be there for all to see. &quot;Livingstone looks set to go down in history as the man who turned London into Shanghai-on-Thames,&quot; says the architecture magazine Building Design. Over the next few years 20 or so buildings of more than 300ft are due to go up, with now-obligatory nicknames such as the shard of glass, the cheese grater, the helter skelter, the walkie talkie, and the boomerang. Livingstone&apos;s permissive approach to towers, largely against the advice of the conservation body English Heritage, has infuriated many. The Guardian&apos;s Simon Jenkins says that Livingstone&apos;s &quot;urban anarchy&quot; will wreck views across London and the city&apos;s intimate scale.  The historian Tristram Hunt complains that &quot;the capital&apos;s precious skyline is being consciously recrafted into an expression of corporate dominance&quot;.  Prince Charles claimed that the &quot;free-for-all&quot; would leave London with a &quot;pockmarked skyline&quot;. Others are more forgiving. Nick Raynsford, the former planning minister who wanted to be mayor himself, says Livingstone&apos;s record has been positive. &quot;Any vibrant city is going to see significant amounts of new development and some people will regret that because it does change the appearance of the city,&quot; he says. Raynsford has reservations about some of the buildings approved but claims that Livingstone has exercised his planning powers successfully. &quot;Parliament has recognised the need to give additional powers to the mayor, which is a real accolade and sign of his achievements,&quot; he says. The mayor will take over the strategic planning powers from the London boroughs as well as the right to decide on planning applications for tall buildings. Livingstone&apos;s current London plan stipulates that tall buildings will only be promoted when they create &quot;attractive landmarks&quot; and then only in &quot;economic clusters&quot;. Even the design establishment has been horrified by some of his decisions.  While there is excitement about the prospect of Renzo Piano&apos;s 66-storey shard of glass at London Bridge, few can see why the 50- storey Vauxhall Tower passed the attractive-landmark test.  The lumpy &quot;walkie talkie&quot; building proposed for Fenchurch Street has also had very mixed reviews. English Heritage said it would be London&apos;s &quot;ugliest and most oppressive building.&quot; There has been a suspicion that Livingstone has cared too little about the appearance of buildings and has been overly persuaded by developers&apos; claims of the economic or social benefits that they will bring. Justifying the Vauxhall Tower Livingstone&apos;s regeneration director, Neale Coleman, said: &quot;It was a scheme which should be supported because we desperately do need new homes.&quot; Architects argue that there should be greater clarity about how the skyline should take shape to avoid a muddled hotchpotch.  Housing has been a bigger priority than design. This week his office boasted that the number of new homes being built each year is at its highest since the 1970s. The mayor has insisted that 50% of all major residential developments should be affordable. In many areas he has struggled to enforce this, and developers claim this quota system is putting off house building in the capital.  &quot;They would say that,&quot; says Raynsford. &quot;The number of homes has increased very dramatically [under Livingstone].&quot; The mayor has now pledged to build 50,000 affordable homes over the next three years. Critics claim too few homes are being built for families.  Boris Johnson accuses him of a &quot;Ceausescu-esqe obsession will building rabbit hutch homes.&quot;  Livingstone has less to show for other building targets. In 2002 he announced plans to remake 100 public spaces. The project is way behind schedule with only a handful of schemes completed. But there are plans to part pedestrianise Parliament Square - as was successfully achieved at the other end of Whitehall at Trafalgar Square.

The 102-year-old linguist is renowned as the &quot;father of pinyin&quot;, the system for representing standard Mandarin in the Roman alphabet. The country is celebrating the anniversary with lectures, a TV series and educational programmes. Although Zhou is marking the half-century by publishing the latest of his many books, he is otherwise modest about his achievements and a life so packed with incident that for many years he completely forgot a brief friendship with Albert Einstein. &quot;I&apos;m not the father of pinyin - I&apos;m the son of pinyin,&quot; says Zhou.&quot;It&apos;s [the result of] a long tradition from the later years of the Qing dynasty down to today. But we restudied the problem and revisited it and made it more perfect.&quot; The results are remarkable. Over the last half-century, the illiteracy rate in China has slumped from 80% to as little as 10% - the precise figure is disputed - thanks to a combination of mass education, simplified characters and pinyin. &quot;[Pinyin] is very simple but had a significant purpose. First, it denotes the sound of Chinese characters,&quot; Zhou explains. &quot;Second, it has helped [students] to learn putonghua, the national standard language. Before, I met a Cantonese and a Hokkien in foreign countries and couldn&apos;t communicate - I had to speak English to them. Without an alphabet you had to learn mouth to mouth, ear to ear. It&apos;s a bridge to speech between Chinese people.&quot; Chan Yuen Chi, associate professor at the School of Chinese, Hong Kong University, argues that pinyin succeeded because it was a better phonetic match than other transcription methods, and was &quot;extremely easy and convenient&quot; because it used a widely recognised alphabet rather than other symbols. &quot;On a level of practicality, it makes up for the fact that Chinese characters do not indicate the sounds themselves,&quot; he says. &quot;In politics, economics and every kind of cultural work, it has very important value. China is a country of many dialects, and hanyu pinyin helps the realising of a common language for the entire nation.&quot; Zhou&apos;s involvement came about by chance. He was a banker working in New York when the communists seized power in 1949 and, like many expatriates, he returned home to help rebuild his country. &quot;We all thought that China had a very good opportunity to develop; we didn&apos;t expect the later turmoil. History misled us,&quot; he says. It soon became clear that his economic expertise was not required or appreciated. But in 1955 the government asked him to put his hobby - languages - to use by overseeing reforms. It believed only an explosion in literacy could allow China to develop. Two years later, the unwanted career change saved him when Mao Zedong launched his anti-rightist campaign against intellectuals. &quot;Mao disliked greatly the economists - especially economic professors from America. By that time I had shifted to the line of language and writing. I was not considered a rightist. Very lucky,&quot; Zhou recalls. &quot;If I had remained in Shanghai teaching economics I think I certainly could have been imprisoned for 20 years. A good friend of mine was imprisoned and committed suicide; my student committed suicide.&quot; However, he was denounced as a reactionary academic during the Cultural Revolution in the late Sixties, and exiled to the countryside. Zhou, who still produces a paper a month from his modest flat in Beijing, is cheered to see that pinyin is growing ever more useful. Many people rely on pinyin-to-character conversion programmes to send text messages or type on their computers and even Chinese Braille is based on the system. But many students forget pinyin once they have reached their ultimate goal. &quot;Pinyin is not to replace Chinese characters; it is a help to Chinese characters,&quot; Zhou says. &quot;They have a very long tradition of more than 3,000 years ... people will use them for at least 500 years more. It&apos;s almost impossible to change to another writing system because it&apos;s so deeply rooted in China.&quot; Nor does he believe that Mandarin will overtake English as the major international language, despite China&apos;s growing power and his own surprise at the number of foreigners learning putonghua. &quot;Chinese characters or pinyin will never be a competitor to English. [Its dominance] is the work of over 400 years,&quot; he added. Background Chinese languages do not have an alphabet. Instead they have a character for each word, which does not indicate pronunciation (although it sometimes contains a phonetic element).  The resulting difficulty in learning to read and write - or learning putonghua, standard Mandarin, if not a native speaker - has led to numerous attempts to develop phonetic representation systems. The first attempts to transcribe Mandarin in the Roman alphabet were designed by foreigners seeking to learn Chinese; the best-known - though not the first - is Wade-Giles, produced and refined by two British diplomats in the second half of the 19th century. The Chinese subsequently produced their own phonetic alphabet, Zhuyin, also known as Bopomofo after its first letters. Then came Gwoyeu Romatzyh, a romanisation system that spelled the tones as well as the sounds of words - but proved so complicated that few could master it.  The communists turned to Zhou Youguang and his team to develop a replacement that could establish standard Mandarin as a truly national language and increase literacy. Chinese children who grow up speaking putonghua use pinyin to associate characters with spoken words. Those who grow up with other languages also use it as a guide to putonghua pronunciation.  Confusingly, Taiwan uses several different romanisation methods - including a variant of pinyin, tongyong pinyin - and zhuyin.

One night in Shanghai, Yue-Sai throws a party, celebrating the winner of a prize for young artists whom she sponsors. As stated on the invite, the dress code is &quot;Yue-Sai red&quot;. The scene inside her penthouse apartment is typical of a certain milieu in Shanghai at the moment, dominated by what might be called the men in cashmere jumpers: that is, the European art dealers, carpetbaggers and assorted taste-makers who descend on a country after the initial boom but before the money settles. They mill about, drinking champagne and eyeing the furniture like bailiffs. To Yue-Sai&apos;s delight, the Italian ambassador is also present, and before he can get too comfortable he is grabbed by Yue-Sai&apos;s sister, Vickie, and made to watch a promotional video about Yue-Sai on a large flatscreen television. &quot;She introduced make-up to the Chinese woman,&quot; Vickie hisses, and the ambassador allows a gracious smile. Yue-Sai, meanwhile, resplendent in red, has sushi sent out to those smoking on the balcony and mingles around a coffee table on which a copy of Forbes magazine has been left open at a page mentioning her in the context of women of achievement. As they come inside, guests file past the photo of Yue-Sai meeting Prince Charles, and congregate beneath the framed poster of her face on a set of Chinese postage stamps. At one point, she leans over and, in a voice that is neither wholly serious nor wholly self-mocking, hands me a cup and says, &quot;Yue-Sai tea?&quot; Several days earlier, on a cold afternoon, I visited Yue-Sai&apos;s apartment and was invited by her assistant to watch the same promotional video. It shows Yue-Sai broadcasting in front of the Eiffel Tower and the Hollywood sign, and describes her as a &quot;cosmetics queen&quot;, &quot;cultural ambassador&quot; and &quot;humanitarian&quot;. Just as it finishes, as if she has been waiting for her cue, Yue-Sai sweeps into the room, her make-up so flawless it&apos;s like looking at someone trapped behind glass. Her Cartier watch is the size of a playing card. The premise for our meeting is Yue-Sai&apos;s inclusion in the Victoria &amp; Albert museum&apos;s forthcoming blockbuster show, China Design Now, which recognises the 58-year-old TV host&apos;s iconic status in China by featuring a range of her products alongside the work of the best Chinese architects, fashion and graphic designers: there will be the &quot;Yue-Sai Wa Wa&quot; tribute dolls, her books on social etiquette, some of the Yue-Sai Kan cosmetics range and items from her latest venture, the House of Yue-Sai. This is a sort of Shanghai version of the Conran Shop that will sell patterned napkins and lacquered paperweights, and all the other things people in the west use to advertise their wealth, and that Yue-Sai hopes will catch on in China. &quot;I am taking my famous brand name and horizontally growing it across a whole range of categories,&quot; she says, &quot;from table-top glasses to chopsticks to dishes to furniture, to bedding, accessories, lighting, to everything. Because China doesn&apos;t really have a lifestyle brand, not to international standards.&quot; Yue-Sai, as you will see, is not fearful of offending her customers, the stylistic cost of whose isolationism she sums up thus: &quot;If you go around town, there are some stores that sell the most peculiar furniture.&quot; Her baby-face puckers into an expression of horror. There is a question as to whether the Chinese language has found a way to accommodate Yue-Sai and the broader cultural movement she represents, the way the term &quot;lifestyle&quot; took off in the west in the 80s. Yes, she says, the term in Chinese is &quot;fu gue&quot;, pronounced &quot;foo-gway&quot;. &quot;Everyone wants to be &apos;fu gue&apos; in China at the moment. What is fu gue?&quot; - she speaks in that manner peculiar to nursery school teachers and TV veterans - &quot;Well, fu means rich; gue really means style, elegance. That&apos;s what everybody seems to want to be. There is a lot of fu in China right now, but there is little gue.&quot; There is a danger in setting oneself up as an arbiter of taste, and in Yue-Sai&apos;s case it puts unbearable pressure on, for example, the cast-iron sculpture of an aubergine that sits on her sideboard and the diamant\u00e9-encrusted photo frame that surrounds a picture of Yue-Sai in the company of Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson. She is friends with lots of celebrities, thanks to her long career as host of a chatshow that broadcasts on China state television, in English with Chinese subtitles. (In the friends and family section of her website, Yue-Sai is featured standing next to Helen Mirren, Michael Douglas, Hillary Clinton and wedged up against a game-looking Meryl Streep.) But what interests her more these days is rolling out the franchise. She is someone about whom Anthony Trollope could have written and although she giggles and says things such as, &quot;Emma, I&apos;m nuts! Look at me!&quot; the frilly persona hangs on her like a garland of flowers around a steel water tank. &quot;There are few things you can do in life that live on after you die,&quot; she says. &quot;For example, I am a great admirer of composers. Look at Mozart, look at Beethoven. There is architecture. And the other thing you can do is build a brand. Build a brand that lasts 150 years.&quot; When she was a child, Yue-Sai Kan wanted to be a concert pianist and to that end practised at the keyboard for up to eight hours a day. Her parents were Chinese immigrants to Hong Kong and, like many in their position, tried to shore up their children&apos;s futures by insisting that whatever they did, they did it competitively. When Yue-Sai expressed an interest in ballet, they sent her to the best school in town; when she started learning piano, they found her the best teacher. Yue-Sai&apos;s father told her, &quot;Be the first person to walk on the moon. No one remembers the second&quot;, and years later, when she met Buzz Aldrin, Yue-Sai remembered her father&apos;s advice and felt bad for him: &quot;Buzz is a good friend of mine - Mr and Mrs Aldrin.&quot;She makes a face like, what can you do? One evening in her late teens, Yue-Sai gave a piano concert. &quot;I remember distinctly it was a good concert, but I didn&apos;t sleep until four in the morning, because I was sure I would never make it. I was totally sure I would never be a Rubenstein or a Horowitz. You see, painting - painting is very subjective. But when you talk about classical piano, it&apos;s not subjective. You can actually compare the pianists, one to another. The difference between a really brilliant pianist, or a singer for that matter, and the second one - the difference is so minute and yet that difference is the most divine difference. It puts them into the rank of the gods. Correct?&quot; And so she gave up the piano and went into television, where the divine, she says, doesn&apos;t really come into it. Yue-Sai&apos;s father was an artist, and the family left the city of Guilin, in China&apos;s Guangxi region, when she was too young to remember it. Why did they leave, I ask. Yue-Sai looks startled, then she bursts out laughing. &quot;Communism!&quot; Her father was an intellectual, by definition an enemy of the state, and they fled to Hong Kong where the conditions, she says, were &quot;pretty primitive&quot;. Her mother was the practical one and the primary breadwinner. &quot;I think I learned a lot about money from my mother. She had a stock company. And she managed to send all of us to school in America. Amazing, right? She started to buy and sell real estate, and I remember when she needed money to send me to school, she sold one of her apartments.&quot; Yue-Sai has three younger sisters, one of whom, Vickie, now works for her. (Another is a banker with Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong and the third is in business in New York.) When Yue-Sai was 18, she won a place to study music at Brigham Young University in Hawaii and happily headed west. As far as she was concerned, mainland China had nothing to do with her. &quot;Our parents didn&apos;t want to talk about it, because they had such a terrible memory of it. Those years - there was the Japanese occupation, the civil war, then the communists came.&quot; Although she still has a strong accent, Yue-Sai identifies herself as an American. It allows her to claim lots of firsts. Her appearance on those Chinese postage stamps, for example, is all the more remarkable because she is &quot;the first and only living American&quot; to have been accorded the honour; likewise her success on Chinese TV. In 1972, after graduating, she moved to New York and for a while made a living in an import and export business. She got into television by chance, as a volunteer on a local cable station broadcasting to New York&apos;s growing Chinese population; from there she was plucked and promoted by PBS, America&apos;s BBC equivalent. In 1984, the channel asked her to present the first live broadcast between China and the west, and Yue-Sai made such a good impression on the Chinese government that they invited her to front a series for state television of programmes about the rest of the world. There were several significant things about this. First, that Yue-Sai&apos;s huge ratings and subsequent fame owed much to China Central Television&apos;s monopoly over Chinese broadcasting. And second, that she cottoned on very early to how her fame might be used to open up other markets. One World was a travelogue in which Yue-Sai was filmed in front of the world&apos;s greatest landmarks. It was the first time many Chinese had set eyes on them, a novelty compounded by the even more astonishing spectacle of a Chinese woman dolled up like an American, in bright red lipstick, pageboy haircut and a series of square-shouldered jackets that could have comfortably hung in Joan Collins&apos; wardrobe. The impact was so huge that Yue-Sai effectively became a celebrity in China before the concept existed. The &quot;Yue-Sai&quot; was a much-imitated haircut that, when she finally dispensed with it for a shorter style, was mourned in the press. &quot;When my first book, One World, came out, they had to have 150 policemen at the book store,&quot; she says. And if you walk down the street... I am about to ask whether autograph-hunting exists in China. But she anticipates some slight on the integrity of her fame, and cuts me off. &quot;If I walk down the street,&quot; she snaps, &quot;I can wager to you everyone will know who I am.&quot; In 1989, while China was allowing its citizens a glimpse of the outside world, the outside world was focusing on China&apos;s brutal oppression of its citizens, in what is coyly and glancingly referred to on Yue-Sai&apos;s website as the &quot;Tiananmen Incident&quot;. Her take on this follows the contested logic of the Olympics, that you can encourage change in China only by engaging with it. This is an easier position to defend in 2008 than it was in 1989. But Yue-Sai is squirm-free on the subject of her warm relations with the Chinese government. Not long after the pro-democracy protests were quashed and hundreds of protesters killed, she was invited to dine with the vice-president and asked not to join the exodus of prominent figures leaving the country. &quot;They said, &apos;We are really having a very hard time.&apos; All businesses were leaving. &apos;It would be really nice - you&apos;re so famous! - it would really look good for us [if you stayed and set up your cosmetics business].&apos;&quot; She says this with pride. There was apparently no ethical dimension to her calculations, or rather the ethical dimension was resolved by her absolute faith in the redeeming power of the free market. The Chinese government&apos;s entreaty gave her leverage to squeeze all sorts of concessions out of them, for instance to waive the requirement that she have a local business partner. &quot;I was very firm,&quot; she says. Still, didn&apos;t she have to think hard about committing to the country after what happened at Tiananmen? Yue-Sai gives a strange answer to this, in which she promotes her own career in China as symbolic of the country&apos;s growing enlightenment. &quot;No. My programme started airing in 1986 and it was amazing for the Chinese. It was aired all over the country with very minimum censorship. So was I ever in doubt of [the country] opening? No - 86, 87, 89, those were the years that China was amazingly open. It was so open that it led to Tiananmen; the students were given freedom all of a sudden and didn&apos;t know how to temper that freedom, and the government was trying to show them. So I was part of that movement, part of that encouragement.&quot; Yue-Sai&apos;s reading of Tiananmen, as the end rather than the beginning of something, proved in some ways to be right. Economically, the country did open up and she was perfectly positioned to reap the benefits. &quot;I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m shrewd, I&apos;m just very lucky. I think of things to do at the right time. I think one of the most important things is gut feeling. If your gut feeling doesn&apos;t tell you whether or not you should do it, then you shouldn&apos;t do it. You have to feel l&apos;air du temps.&quot; Yue-Sai Kan&apos;s role in Chinese culture is as a safe but cheeky subversive, someone whose economic power and foreign status give her a certain licence to misbehave. She talked about her divorce in Chinese women&apos;s magazines when it was still considered a shameful admission of failure. She counselled readers of her etiquette books about sex. Wearing make-up was still a taboo in China - &quot;It was considered bourgeois. It was politically not correct&quot; - when she set up her cosmetics firm. &quot;Do women want to look better?&quot; she asked herself. &quot;That I&apos;m sure I can answer - yes.&quot; Those are western standards of &quot;looking better&quot;, aren&apos;t they? &quot;No,&quot; she says, &quot;if you look at the Tang dynasty ladies, they used pretty much everything that we use - rouge, eye pencils, lips, nail polish!&quot; The Yue-Sai Wa Wa doll, meanwhile, is made in its namesake&apos;s image: &quot;She is an American-Chinese girl, studies hard at school, respects her parents, is kind and generous to her friends. She adores music, sports, and likes to dress up and go to parties. Yue-Sai Wa Wa also enjoys learning about Asian heritage from her parents, a rich culture that is some 5,000 years old. And, of course, Yue-Sai Wa Wa is very beautiful.&quot; Yue-Sai Wa Wa sounds like a pain. So, she&apos;s an alternative to Barbie? &quot;Barbie, ugh.&quot; Yue-Sai looks disgusted. &quot;That&apos;s why you create a Paris Hilton generation.&quot; Her expression brightens. &quot;I just had dinner with Paris Hilton the other night - I know Paris. Last time I saw her was at Puff Daddy&apos;s birthday. I was with Naomi Campbell.&quot; Inevitably, the younger generation of fashionable Chinese see Yue-Sai as matronly and outmoded, her bright red lipstick an embarrassing hangover from the 80s. When I mention her name during dinner with the lifestyle editor of one of the independent Chinese newspapers, she wrinkles her nose and says, &quot;Big, loud, red lipstick&quot;, and, adjusting her shawl, adds, &quot;Not really to my taste.&quot; Sophisticated Chinese might also be embarrassed by the condescension of such books of hers as How To Be A Beautiful, Healthy And Successful Modern Woman and The Chinese Gentleman, in which she informs people how not to behave like peasants. As artefacts, they would appeal in the west to the sort of adults who collect Hello Kitty merchandise and they offer practical advice on matters of hygiene, deportment and sexual relations. Yue-Sai sees a vast hypocrisy about sex in China, although she doesn&apos;t want her book to be mistaken for the Kama Sutra. &quot;I tell them natural stuff. I remember a western friend of mine saying, &apos;I can&apos;t stand it, the Chinese women I go out with always act like they&apos;re so coy about sex. But I know that they&apos;re not! They&apos;re not that innocent.&apos; So I wanted to convey the idea, if you&apos;re enjoying it, enjoy it.&quot; She divorced 11 years ago - &quot;Oh, I&apos;m a real divorcee,&quot; she says drily - and doesn&apos;t have children. &quot;Now, I talk about the definition of sexiness. I say a sexy woman has a beautiful voice and a clean body to start with. That&apos;s just basic. Cleanliness is the first point. Beautiful underwear. The way you move. And your behaviour towards people. I said, &apos;Don&apos;t forget, it&apos;s not a bad thing to have sex.&apos; I said, &apos;I don&apos;t care how you do it, but have an orgasm every week.&apos; Is that outrageous? I talk about how to make friends with foreigners, about dating and marrying a foreigner. Because I married a foreigner. He was 20 years older than me, so today he&apos;s really old. Ha!&quot; She cackles, brilliantly, for ages. She says: &quot;The Chinese look as if they are international and open, but they are really not. It&apos;s been only a few years. All this glitter, but you scratch a little deeper, there&apos;s zero underneath.&quot; Her interviews are deeply respectful; she might fly to Paris to ask Jean Paul Gaultier how it is he comes to be such a genius, or to New York to quiz Karl Lagerfeld on the nature of his timeless brilliance. But then she will say something refreshingly blunt. &quot;You know, I sit on a gold mine here in China.&quot; She grins. &quot;The Chinese produce everything.&quot; Can she imagine a show like Jerry Springer&apos;s in China? &quot;No, they wouldn&apos;t allow it. The media is going to be the last stronghold they have, particularly television.&quot; Of course, she says, this has its advantages: being a celebrity in China is much nicer than in America. &quot;There are no paparazzi in China. The government will make sure that there isn&apos;t anything outrageous about you going out. The government is pretty controlling in this.&quot; Innocently, I tell her I&apos;ve heard her grandfather was influential in the Chinese government. Yue-Sai is suddenly very agitated. &quot;Are you crazy? No. No connections in China at all. A lot of people think I have a lot of connections - none. I always say that someone like me really had it hard. If you are a Chinese, you were born here, grew up here, you have a lot of connections. Business in China is all about connections. Your uncle&apos;s uncle&apos;s sister. Or school mates. For someone like me to be where I am - and an American! - you have to build your own relationships. When I first came to China I couldn&apos;t speak a word of Chinese. I had guts, right? I signed the contract to do a television series on the national network and I couldn&apos;t even speak my name in Mandarin - we spoke Cantonese at home. I worked so hard. I seem to have worked hard all my life.&quot; I ask where she ranks in the Chinese rich list. In 2004, when L&apos;Or\u00e9al bought her cosmetics company, it had revenue of $80m. She owns a house in one of the most prestigious streets in New York, next to the official residence of the UN secretary general. Yue-Sai says she finds it &quot;unsophisticated&quot; to talk about money in this way. &quot;I&apos;m never on any list, you know why? Because I&apos;m not Chinese. And you know what? I wouldn&apos;t want to be Chinese. I mean,&quot; she quickly corrects herself, &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want to be on a list. People always ask how much am I worth, and I say&quot; - she shoots me her beadiest, most imperious look - &quot;it&apos;s nobody&apos;s business.&quot;  &amp;#183 China Design Now opens at the V&amp;A, London SW7, on March 15.

There are skyscrapers, airports and museums to design, city plans to shape with low-cost housing a priority, and a lecture to give this evening - but, this being Rogers and the setting being Paris, everything must stop for lunch. So here we are at Benoit, an old-school restaurant near the Pompidou Centre, possibly his most famous building. Seated around a table groaning with food are Rogers, his wife Ruthie of River Cafe fame, two other architects, friends from Mexico, the actor Ian McKellen, and me, in what is rapidly becoming a bit of a party. The Pompidou, which Rogers created with Renzo Piano (then, as now, his closest friend), was always meant to be about fun, and Rogers is back here today to walk me and his fellow lunch guests around the lively exhibition of his work currently on show to celebrate the building&apos;s 30th anniversary. By all accounts a great success, it arrives at London&apos;s Design Museum in spring for a four-month run. As we move through the exhibition, a teacher stops Rogers to ask, in English, if he will answer questions from her pupils. The architect peels off to talk, in French, to the teenagers. They say they find the design of the exhibition engaging, all those alluring models of shape-of-things-to-come-style buildings, sitting on zigzagging metal tables finished in bright pop colours. It is unsurprising that the youngsters like it. The design is by Rogers&apos; son Ab, who says he was &quot;marinated&quot; in his father&apos;s architecture. When he was very young, he was taken to the Pompidou and asked his father what the big tubes on its outside were. These contain the escalators, but Rogers told him they were the biggest slides in the world. Ab&apos;s colourful work - he recently designed a neo-psychedelic boutique in Mayfair called Emperor Moth - shows he has never lost this parentally ingrained playfulness. Rogers would like everyone to live an enjoyable, playful life, to inhabit likable, environmentally sound buildings in vibrant, intelligent cities. But, as he is the first to admit, brute economics and politics often get in the way. &quot;Architecture is a slow business,&quot; he says, walking round the exhibition, &quot;and city planning even slower.&quot; Rogers may be 75 this year, but you get the feeling that he will never stop trying to make this world he dreams of. So we look at the stark challenges facing him - and the 60 million people living in Britain - today. In front of us is a huge model of One Hyde Park, a project commissioned by London developers Nick and Christian Candy. Scheduled for completion in 2009, it comprises 86 flats housed in four slim, steel and glass Knightsbridge towers, varying from 10 to 14 storeys. Each has 24-hour room service, floor-to-ceiling fridges, bulletproof windows, panic rooms and entry approved by iris scanner. One is already rumoured to have been snapped up by Qatar&apos;s foreign minister for \u00a3100m. This is architecture for the new global oligarchy. Rogers doesn&apos;t even bother to tell me that One Hyde Place will be as energy-efficient as possible, that it will offer soaring views of Hyde Park from Knightsbridge, or that - in exchange for this billionaire&apos;s playpen winning planning permission - a number of &quot;affordable&quot; homes will be built in the borough. Nor does he explain why he accepted the commission in the first place. You might as well ask: why do Heathrow&apos;s T5 if you&apos;re so concerned about the environment and the good life for all? The answer is that Rogers is an optimist: if we must have a big new air terminal, it might as well be the best; and if London is increasingly becoming the home of the mega-rich, they might as well live in the most environmentally sound luxury apartments yet. &quot;The gap between the rich and poor is widening fast,&quot; says Rogers, as we look at a speeded-up video of the construction of the new Oxley Wood housing scheme in Milton Keynes. &quot;The middle ground belongs to house-builders, and none of us - architects, government, local authorities - have managed to get the balance right.&quot; Rogers&apos; concern is that British city centres might become ghettos for the very wealthy, while pretty much anyone else will be squeezed out to run-of-the-mill, architecture-free estates. Oxley Wood, part of a new estate by Wimpey, is Rogers&apos; way of making the most of this middle ground. The estate is quite a departure for normally conservative Wimpey. Practical, low-energy homes costing no more than \u00a360,000 to create, they are made of timber, insulated with paper and vary in size from two to five bedrooms. While only the two-bedroom homes can be thought of as in any way &quot;affordable&quot; (they have been selling for just under \u00a3200,000), the idea points the way to future low-cost homes. Each of the 145 houses has taken just two days to erect, and a month to fit out; each shares an identical &quot;service unit&quot;, comprising kitchen, bathrooms, heating equipment and so on; and each is topped with an &quot;eco-hat&quot;, a rooftop gadget that uses warm air rising up through the house to heat domestic water. The discussion of how to design and build affordable homes is one that preoccupies Rogers, who is chair of the Design for London advisory group and the Mayor of London&apos;s adviser on architecture and urbanism. He believes Ken Livingstone has made progress, but is concerned to know what Boris Johnson thinks; like the rest of us, he has no idea what the would-be Tory mayor has to say about architecture and urbanism. Rogers has spearheaded the campaign to build cheap yet intelligent homes in London, many now under construction, but he fears this campaign might be written off by a Conservative mayor. There is nothing remotely conservative about the architecture on show at the Pompidou. Here, in the form of billboard-sized photographs and intricate models, are designs for museums, airports, law courts, one-off houses as well as everyday ones that speak of a truly glamorous modern world. Here is a city plan for the Pudong district of Shanghai that lights up in colours representing morning, noon, evening and night, which draws schoolchildren to it like moths to a flame; and here is a tower made of what must surely be Meccano. But perhaps most fascinating of all, in the confines of this extraordinary building, are the four original sketches from which the Pompidou eventually grew. Drawn on paper, they are almost quaint, harking back, as they do, to a pre-computer age. Indeed, the Pompidou was designed before new concerns for the environment had kicked in. Every year, 20% of its \u20ac100m (\u00a375m) budget goes on maintaining the building. St\u00e9phane Viale, its security director, has described it as &quot;one huge draught&quot;. It was, of course, an experimental building, designed for just 250,000 visitors a year; over the past few months alone, half this figure have come to see the Rogers exhibition. What&apos;s astonishing is that so many of the designs on show here have been built for real. It is, though, Rogers&apos; role - one he adopted from his first forays into architecture in 1963 at part of Team 4 - to invent new forms of buildings and to persuade the most unlikely clients to allow him to experiment with sensational designs, such as that of the Lloyd&apos;s building in London, begun in 1978 and completed in 1986. Rogers is facing up to what it means to have designed buildings that are now considered to be of historic and architectural importance. The Lloyd&apos;s building, written off by many City types in the mid-1980s as being little more than an overhyped oil refinery, is about to be listed Grade 1. When this happens, a building designed, just as the Pompidou was, to change with the needs and wants of its users, becomes pickled in aspic. If Lloyd&apos;s is not listed, it might fall into the hands of owners who are careless with its unusual, brilliant design. So Rogers, a very Modern architect and one who believes in buildings capable of change, now finds himself being squeezed into the starched architectural corsetry of the world of heritage. If you had told him it would be like this 30 years on from Pompidou, he would never have believed you. \u00b7 Richard Rogers + Architects is at the Pompidou Centre, Paris, until March 3.

Interest in such news would not normally reach beyond the ranches of the mid-western prairies. But it is only the latest sign that the long era of cheap food is finally over. It arrives at the end of a month when the implications have started to be felt around the world.  Ahead of the Chinese new year on February 7, the authorities in Beijing suspended their faith in the market forces that have brought prosperity and placed restrictions on the price of meat to ensure that the party went smoothly. On Valentine&apos;s Day, the governor of the Bank of England made no attempt to win the hearts of cash-strapped shoppers; instead he warned them that more expensive food would inevitably affect living standards. Last week, General Musharraf faced defeat in the parliamentary polls: western reporting emphasised Pakistan&apos;s security situation, but the vicissitudes of the wheat price was the bigger factor on the ground. Then yesterday, the UN agency charged with relieving hunger told the Financial Times that it was having to contemplate tough choices, potentially including cutting the number of people it helps or the amount of sustenance they receive. Although the World Food Programme soon calmed fears that it was about to turn away the starving, it stressed that it urgently needed $500m a year extra to deal with the runaway costs. The effects of costlier food are all the more serious because it is something the world has grown unaccustomed to coping with. For a quarter of a century after the mid-1970s, new technologies and freer trade combined to make food almost continuously cheaper. The price of wheat, for example, dropped by more than 80% between 1973 and 2000, once allowance is made for overall inflation. In the last year, however, creeping rises quickened to a canter - and then a gallop. The real cost of wheat has not yet returned to 1970s levels, but it is now more than double what it was a few years ago. If the trend continues, the bread and butter of rich-world politics could become real bread and butter once more. It is in the poor world, though, that the effects will be most grave: the cost of food can often be counted in human lives. Whether prices continue to rise, however, depends on what has driven them up so far. Since Thomas Malthus in the 18th century, pessimists have blamed every incidence of scarcity on the rising population. They have been wrong in the past, and they are wrong this time, too. While the world population continues to grow, it is doing so at a much slower rate than it was in the long decades when the price of food was falling. Climate change makes another obvious culprit, and perhaps it did play a role in last year&apos;s Australian drought. It is likely to become a serious threat to food security in future, but it is not an adequate explanation for high global food prices today, because far from falling off, global food production has continued to increase. Demand, not supply, is the motor of the current food inflation. A growing taste for meat and dairy in newly prosperous parts of the world is one important factor. When it takes 10 kilos of feed to make one of beef, farming animals swallows land that might otherwise be feeding people. But the new middle classes of Beijing and Shanghai will not easily be persuaded that eating meat is a bad idea, especially if the persuasion comes from western countries that are far from vegan. Meanwhile, subsidies to biofuels, particularly in the US, are distorting global farming. The 60m tonnes of American maize being burned each year represents more than twice the UK&apos;s entire cereal crop. The world wants cheaper food, and it wants more food - without the environmental consequences. In reconciling the three, the overriding priority must be ensuring that the hungry are not made even hungrier.", "tags": ["Global economy", "Business", "US news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-02-26T00:05:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/26/furthereducation", "sentences": ["In October, I travelled to Shanghai to compete in the Special Olympics world games and won two gold medals.", "We met in Shanghai."], "title": "The tennis player", "article": "I first realised I was different from other people when I was four. My brother was two years younger, but was learning to do things much more quickly than I was. I was diagnosed with moderate learning difficulties. My parents later found out I am on the autistic spectrum. I enjoyed my school, but I found it difficult, especially reading and writing. I got tired easily and bored of listening. I am lucky because everyone has always been nice to me. I have never been bullied and have a really supportive family. Sport has always been my passion. A teacher at school introduced me to tennis when I was 14. Since then, I have competed in a number of national competitions. In October, I travelled to Shanghai to compete in the Special Olympics world games and won two gold medals. It was a great experience but I did miss my mum. Since I started playing tennis, I have met a number of famous people, including Greg Rusedski, Andrew Castle and Jamie Murray. I have been nominated for many awards, including the BBC East Midlands Sports Awards last year, but I am most proud of being nominated as sportsperson of the year in the Leicester Mercury along with Martin Corry and Matt Selby. I felt so proud to be nominated as a regular sportsperson, nothing to do with my disability. I am far more confident now because of my tennis. I was at a party hosted by Cliff Richard, when I went up, tapped him on the shoulder and said: &quot;Can I have a photo?&quot; I&apos;d never have done that before. I find social situations quite hard. My brother is really good and always invites me out with his mates, but I find it very difficult. I often don&apos;t understand what they are talking about. I would like to socialise more but most of my education has been away from Melton Mowbray where I live so it is difficult to travel to meet friends. Because of my disability, it is harder for me to meet girls. I do have a girlfriend at the moment. We met in Shanghai. She is really nice, but she lives in Aberdeen. It was quite heartbreaking when she had to fly back to the UK. In the future, I&apos;d love to work with children. In a few weeks, I&apos;m going back to my old primary school to coach children with learning disabilities in football and swimming. People have been so supportive to me.

The alarm went off at six the next morning. Bill groaned. Surely no one in their right mind started a new job the day after arriving in a new country? But then he remembered. He wasn&apos;t in his right mind. He was in Tony&apos;s. A parallel universe of unbelievable stupidity. And short sentences. And paragraphs. Becca felt sad as she left Holly at the school. Less than a day in China. And she had never felt so alone. I&apos;d better get used to it, she sighed. After all, it had been her idea for them to get out of London after Holly had been diagnosed with asthma. It was just that she&apos;d hoped that at least one person might have told her that Shanghai was even more polluted. &quot;Good to have you on board, Bill,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;We do things differently out here.

Back home, his accent, his chip on his shoulder and his obvious lack of intelligence had counted. Against him as a lawyer. But here, he could earn enough. To buy a house in Islington. Becca and Bill watched the single women polish their new cars outside their gated community in Paradise Gardens. &quot;They look like kept women,&quot; Becca exclaimed in surprise. &quot;Modern China is a complex country,&quot; Bill replied, sagely. &quot;And everyone has to make difficult choices.&quot; &quot;Well, they seem like whores to me.&quot; &quot;I suppose they are,&quot; he nodded, knowing he could never be. The type of man who had a mistress. Or could he? He remembered Li Jin Jin, the pale Chinese woman he had met briefly. And felt a pang. Of guilt. &quot;Listen, Bill,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;We&apos;re working on a big development. It involves a stereotypical, ruthless Chinese businessman and oppressed peasants. People are going to lose their limbs. So don&apos;t go squeamish on me.&quot; Bill gulped. China really was another world. But wasn&apos;t it good that some of the Chinese were getting rich? And didn&apos;t all new economies need to make compromises? &quot;I&apos;m lonely and my dad&apos;s ill,&quot; Becca sobbed. &quot;I&apos;m going home with Holly for a while.&quot; Bill nodded. He would be lonely. But it was the right thing to do. And he wasn&apos;t the type to have an affair. Was he? He held Jin Jin in his arms. He wasn&apos;t like the others. He truly loved her. And she loved him. Though they both knew she came second. He checked his mobile. Twelve missed calls. &quot;Your dad&apos;s dying,&quot; Becca said. He felt guilty. He was the loneliest man in the world. &quot;I&apos;m glad we could have some catharsis,&quot; he said as he sat by his father&apos;s deathbed. &quot;I&apos;m going to be a proper husband and father now.&quot; And he meant it. But it wasn&apos;t easy.

It was the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100, with its shares ending at \u00a317.04, up 124p. &quot;The world looks very different if you are sitting in Shanghai or Mumbai,&quot; said Peter Sands at the end of his first full year as chief executive. The bank has been affected by the credit crunch through Whistlejacket, its structured investment vehicle now in the hands of receivers after six months of trying to keep it afloat. Losses from the sub-prime turmoil were $300m, of which $116m was the result of Whistlejacket. Sir Mervyn Davies, the former chief executive who is now chairman, described the banking and financial services industry as being in &quot;a very unusual time&quot;. &quot;Unprecedented losses, huge volatility, the recapitalisation of the major banks,&quot; Davies said. &quot;My reflections are that the industry has learned: first, the overwhelming importance of liquidity; second, the need to price properly for risk and, third, the danger of over complexity.&quot;  The bank is 19% owned by Temasek, which is run by the Singapore state and is one of the sovereign wealth funds that have been propping up troubled US investment banks. Sands described Temasek as &quot;a very supportive shareholder and we treat them like any other shareholder&quot;. If the stake rises above 20%, the authorities in Hong Kong have indicated that this might cause them to consider changing Standard Chartered&apos;s status as an issuer of banknotes. Sands, though, played down any concerns, saying &quot;a note-issuing bank is something we value ... we also have a good relationship with Temasek.&quot; The arrival of the Singaporeans on the share register has led to some confusion about whether this makes a takeover of the bank more or less likely. Yesterday, though, the focus was more on the types of deals that Standard Chartered might be able to do instead. Its largest takeover so far, in South Korea in 2005, continues to be a problem area, with profits falling 29% to $324m. Sands has installed new management and is now hoping it can achieve double-digit growth this year. Sands, though, insisted that the focus was on organic growth, pointing out that 80% of the bank&apos;s growth was coming from existing businesses. &quot;We have businesses that are capable of delivering very rapid growth,&quot; he said. Alex Potter, an analyst at the stockbrokers Collin Stewart, said: &quot;The key to the Standard Chartered story is revenue growth - at two to three times the level of peers, it clearly deserves a material premium, in our view. These results do show some weaknesses (Korea and India) but are more than offset by Hong Kong, China, Africa.&quot;  The bank believes it is well placed for 2008.

In June 2004, Beijing announced its Olympic Games slogan, &quot;One World, One Dream.&quot; From their inception in 1896, the modern Olympic Games have always had as their mission the promotion of human dignity and world peace. China and the world expected to see the Olympic Games bring political progress to the country. Is Beijing keeping its promises? Is China improving its human rights record?  When you come to the Olympic Games in Beijing, you will see skyscrapers, spacious streets, modern stadiums and enthusiastic people. You will see the truth, but not the whole truth, just as you see only the tip of an iceberg. You may not know that the flowers, smiles, harmony and prosperity are built on a base of grievances, tears, imprisonment, torture and blood. We are going to tell you the truth about China. We believe that for anyone who wishes to avoid a disgraceful Olympics, knowing the truth is the first step. Fang Zheng, an excellent athlete who holds two national records for the discus throw at China&apos;s Special Sport Games, has been deprived of the opportunity to participate in the 2008 Paralympics because he has become a living testimony to the June 4, 1989 massacre. That morning, in Tiananmen Square, his legs were crushed by a tank while he was rescuing a fellow student. In April 2007, the Ministry of Public Security issued an internal document secretly strengthening a political investigation which resulted in forbidding Olympics participation by 43 types of people from 11 different categories, including dissidents, human rights defenders, media workers, and religious participants. The Chinese police never made the document known to either the Chinese public or the international community. Huge investment in Olympic projects and a total lack of transparency have facilitated serious corruption and widespread bribery. Taxpayers are not allowed to supervise the use of investment amounting to more than US$40 billion. Liu Zhihua, formerly in charge of Olympic construction and former deputy mayor of Beijing, was arrested for massive embezzlement. To clear space for Olympic-related construction, thousands of civilian houses have been destroyed without their former owners being properly compensated. Brothers Ye Guozhu and Ye Guoqiang were imprisoned for a legal appeal after their house was forcibly demolished. Ye Guozhu has been repeatedly handcuffed and shackled, tied to a bed and beaten with electric batons. During the countdown to the Olympic Games he will continue to suffer from torture in Chaobei Prison in Tianjin.  It has been reported that over 1.25 million people have been forced to move because of Olympic construction; it was estimated that the figure would reach 1.5 million by the end of 2007. No formal resettlement scheme is in place for the over 400,000 migrants who have had their dwelling places demolished. Twenty percent of the demolished households are expected to experience poverty or extreme poverty. In Qingdao, the Olympic sailing city, hundreds of households have been demolished and many human rights activists as well as &quot;civilians&quot; have been imprisoned. Similar stories come from other Olympic cities such as Shenyang, Shanghai and Qinhuangdao.  In order to establish the image of civilized cities, the government has intensified the ban against and detention and forced repatriation of petitioners, beggars and the homeless. Some of them have been kept in extended detention in so-called shelters or have even been sent directly to labor camps. Street vendors have suffered brutal confiscation of their goods by municipal agents. On July 20, 2005, Lin Hongying, a 56-year-old woman farmer and vegetable dealer, was beaten to death by city patrols in Jiangsu. On November 19, 2005, city patrols in Wuxi beat 54-year-old bicycle repairman Wu Shouqing to death. In January 2007, petitioner Duan Huimin was killed by Shanghai police. On July 1, 2007, Chen Xiaoming, a Shanghai petitioner and human rights activist, died of an untreated illness during a lengthy detention period. On August 5, 2007, right before the one-year Olympics countdown, 200 petitioners were arrested in Beijing. China has consistently persecuted human rights activists, political dissidents and freelance writers and journalists. The blind activist Chen Guangcheng, recipient of the 2007 Ramon Magsaysay Award and named in 2006 by Time Magazine as one of the most influential 100 people shaping our world, is still serving his sentence of four years and three months for exposing the truth of forced abortion and sterilization. The government refused to give him the Braille books and the radio that his relatives and friends brought to Linyi prison in Shandong. Chen has been beaten while serving his sentence. On August 24, 2007, Chen&apos;s wife, Yuan Weijing, was kidnapped by police at the Beijing airport while waiting to fly to the Philippines to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award on behalf of her husband. On August 13, 2007, activist Yang Chunlin was arrested in Heilongjiang and charged with subversion of state power &quot;for initiating the petition &apos;Human Rights before Olympics.&apos;&quot; China still practices literary inquisition and holds the world record for detaining journalists and writers, as many as several hundred since 1989 according to incomplete statistics. As of this writing, 35 Chinese journalists and 51 writers are still in prison. Over 90 percent were arrested or tried after Beijing&apos;s successful bid for the Olympics in July 2001. For example, Shi Tao, a journalist and a poet, was sentenced to ten years in prison because of an e-mail sent to an overseas website. Dr. Xu Zerong, a scholar from Oxford University who researched the Korean War, was sentenced to 13 years&apos; imprisonment for &quot;illegally providing information abroad.&quot; Qingshuijun (Huang Jinqiu), a freelance writer, was sentenced to a 12-year term for his online publications. Some writers and dissidents are prohibited from going abroad; others from returning to China. Every year in mainland China, countless websites are closed, blogs deleted, sensitive words filtered. Many websites hosted abroad are blocked. Overseas radio and television programs are interfered with or strictly prohibited. Although the Chinese government has promised media freedom for foreign journalists for 22 months, before, during, and after the Beijing Olympics, and ending on October 17, 2008, an FCCC (Foreign Correspondents Club in China) survey showed that 40 percent of foreign correspondents have experienced harassment, detention or an official warning during news gathering in Beijing and other areas. Some reporters have complained about repeated violent police interference at the time they were speaking with interviewees. Most seriously, Chinese interviewees usually become vulnerable as a result. In June 2006, Fu Xiancai was beaten and paralyzed after being interviewed by German media. In March 2007, Zheng Dajing was beaten and arrested after being interviewed by a British TV station. Religious freedom is still under repression. In 2005, a Beijing pastor, Cai Zhuohua, was sentenced to three years for printing Bibles. Zhou Heng, a house church pastor in Xinjiang, was charged with running an &quot;illegal operation&quot; for receiving dozens of boxes of Bibles. From April to June 2007, China expelled over 100 suspected US, South Korean, Canadian, Australian, and other missionaries. Among them were humanitarian workers and language educators who had been teaching English in China for 15 years. During this so-called Typhoon 5 campaign, authorities took aim at missionary activities so as to prevent their recurrence during the Olympics. On September 30, 2006, Chinese soldiers opened fire on 71 Tibetans who were escaping to Nepal. A 17-year-old nun died and a 20-year-old man was severely injured. Despite numerous international witnesses, the Chinese police insisted that the shooting was in self-defense. One year later, China tightened its control over the Tibetan Buddhism. A September 1, 2007, regulation requires all reincarnated lamas to be approved by Chinese authorities, a requirement that flagrantly interferes with the tradition of reincarnation of living Buddhas as practiced in Tibet for thousands of years. In addition, Chinese authorities still ban the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet and a world-renowned pacifist, from returning to Tibet.  Since 1999, the government has banned many religious beliefs such as Falungong and the Three Servants. Their followers have experienced extremely cruel and planned persecutions. Many died from abuse, suffered torture, brainwashing, imprisonment and labor camp internment for persisting in their faith, possessing religious books, making DVDs and writing articles to expose the truth of the persecution. China has the highest death penalty rate in the world. Execution statistics are treated as &quot;state secrets.&quot; However, experts estimate that 8,000-10,000 people are sentenced to death in China every year, among them not only criminals and economic convicts, but totally innocent citizens, such as Nie Shubin, Teng Xingshan, Cao Haixin and Hugejiletu, whose innocence was proven only after they were already dead.  Another eight innocent farmers, Chen Guoqing, He Guoqiang, Yang Shiliang, Zhu Yanqiang, Huang Zhixiang, Fang Chunping, Cheng Fagen and Cheng Lihe, who confessed their &quot;crimes&quot; after being cruelly tortured by the police, have been sentenced to death and are currently held in prisons in Hebei [province] and in Jingdezhen [in Jiangxi province]. Torture is very common in China&apos;s detention centers, labor camps and prisons. Torture methods include electric shock, burning, use of electric needles, beating and hanging, sleep deprivation, forced chemical injection causing nerve damage, and piercing the fingers with needles. Every year, there are reported cases of Chinese citizens being disabled or killed by police torture.  Labor camps are still retained as a convenient Chinese system which allows the police to lock up citizens without trial for up to four years. The detention system is another practice that the police favors, freeing them to detain citizens for six months to two years. Dissidents and human rights activists are particularly vulnerable targets and are often sent to labor camps, detention centers or even mental hospitals by authorities who want to simplify legal procedures and mislead the media. China has the world&apos;s largest secret police system, the Ministry of National Security (guo an) and the Internal Security Bureau (guo bao) of the Ministry of Public Security, which exercise power beyond the law. They can easily tap telephones, follow citizens, place them under house arrest, detain them and impose torture. On June 3, 2004, the Chinese secret police planted drugs on Chongqing dissident Xu Wanping and later sentenced him to 12 years&apos; imprisonment for &quot;subversion of state power.&quot;  Chinese citizens have no right to elect state leaders, local government officials or representatives. In fact, there has never been free exercise of election rights in township-level elections. Wuhan resident Sun Bu&apos;er, a member of the banned political party the Pan-Blue Alliance, was brutally beaten in September 2006 for participating as an independent candidate during an election of county-level people&apos;s congress representatives. Mr Sun disappeared on March 23, 2007. China continues to cruelly discriminate against its rural population. According to the Chinese election law, a farmer&apos;s right to vote is worth one quarter of that of an urban resident. In June 2007, the Shanxi kiln scandal was exposed by the media. Thousands of 8-13 year-old trafficked children had been forced to labor in illegal kilns, almost all with local government connections. Many of the children were beaten, tortured and even buried alive.  The Chinese judiciary still illegally forbids any HIV/AIDS lawsuits against government officials responsible for the tragedy. AIDS sufferers and activists have been constantly harassed by the secret police.  The Chinese government has been selling arms and weapons to Darfur and other African regions to support ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The Chinese authorities have forcibly repatriated North Korean refugees, knowing that they would be sent to labor camps or executed once back home. This significantly contravenes China&apos;s accession to the &quot;Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees&quot; and the &quot;Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.&quot;  \u0095 Please be aware that the Olympic Games will be held in a country where there are no elections, no freedom of religion, no independent courts, no independent trade unions; where demonstrations and strikes are prohibited; where torture and discrimination are supported by a sophisticated system of secret police; where the government encourages the violation of human rights and dignity, and is not willing to undertake any of its international obligations.  \u0095 Please consider whether the Olympic Games should coexist with religious persecution labor camps, modern slavery, identity discrimination, secret police and crimes against humanity.  As the Beijing Olympics slogan says, we live in &quot;one world&quot; with &quot;one dream.&quot; We hope that one day the Chinese people will be able to share universal human rights, democracy and peace with people from all around the world. However, we can see that the Chinese government obviously is not yet prepared to honor its promise. As a matter of fact, the preparations for the Olympics have provided the perfect excuse for the Chinese government to restrict civil liberties and suppress human rights!  We do not want China to be contained or isolated from the rest of the world. We believe that only by adhering to the principles of human rights and through open dialogue can the world community pressure the Chinese government to change. Ignoring these realities and tolerating barbaric atrocities in name of the Beijing Olympics will disgrace the Olympic Charter and shake the foundations of humanity. Human rights improvement requires time, but we should at least stop China&apos;s human rights situation from deteriorating. Having the Olympics hosted in a country where human dignity is trampled on, will not honor its people or the Olympic Games. We sincerely hope that the Olympic Games will bring the values of peace, equality, freedom and justice to 1.3 billion Chinese citizens. We pray that the Olympics will be held in a free China. We must push for the 2008 Olympics to live up to the Olympic Charter and we must advocate for the realization of &quot;one world&quot; with &quot;one human rights dream.&quot; We believe that only an Olympic Games true to the Olympic Charter can promote China&apos;s democratic progress, world peace and development. We firmly hold to the belief that there can be no true Olympic Games without human rights and dignity.

Which must be why Human Rights FC owner Thaksin Shinawatra arrived home in Thailand today - where he was immediately arrested on corruption charges - flanked by none other than big-name HRFC duo Kasper the Friendly Goalkeeper and Kelvin Etuhu, who were chosen because of their failure to make it into the first team and were in no way whatsoever so help the Fiver God playing the role of political pawns in a situation far murkier than they can ever hope to understand. (The Fiver hasn&apos;t the foggiest either, but let&apos;s not split hairs.) After Thaksin emerged from Bangkok&apos;s supreme court celebrating bail - a snip at \u00a3132,000! - and protesting his innocence through mouthfuls of champagne, the Friendly Goalkeeper boldly spoke for politically sensitive HRFC fans the world over. &quot;He&apos;s a very genuine and a very nice person,&quot; he automatoned of the man once described by Human Rights Watch as a &quot;human-rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;. &quot;He&apos;s willing to put in time, money and effort to make sure the club&apos;s a success ... but not necessarily in that order,&quot; added Schmeichel. Actually, he didn&apos;t really say that last bit. But oh, if he had ... Back in Blighty, Sven-Goran Eriksson was busy burrowing his shiny bonce under the nearest carpet and hoping Shinawatra returns very soon with skipfuls of cash. &quot;His support and involvement with the club is nothing to do with [the situation in] Thailand,&quot; he whimpered. Thaksin obviously agreed. Swatting aside trifling questions such as &quot;What do you think of the PPP [People Power Party]?&quot; and &quot;Will you give them any policy advice?&quot;, he seized the moment following HRFC&apos;s dismal 2-0 defeat to Everton on Monday night at Fortress Eastlands to unveil his plans for world domination. &quot;It will be the team Thais are proud of,&quot; he announced to a backdrop of one bemused granny waving a placard of Shinawatra in a HRFC shirt. &quot;There will be Man City China, Man City Japan, Man City US.&quot; And if the prospect of hearing Blue Moon being murdered by the inhabitants of Shanghai, Tokyo and Oklahoma was not enough to get the juices flowing throughout the non-red half of Manchester, Shinawatra expertly hammered the final nail in the coffin. &quot;In the next season, Man City will be another Man United,&quot; he droned rather tactlessly.

It can hardly be because they are obscure, since much more obscure items of clothing than pyjamas - equestrian hacking jackets, ice-skating skirts, thigh-high stripper boots - get referenced several times a season by fashion designers. And it can&apos;t be because they look silly, because in the eyes of designers that is less an impediment than an encouragement. At last, anyway, their time has come.

Livestock farming gobbles up agricultural land, water and energy that could far more efficiently be devoted to growing food for people to eat directly. Meat, therefore, is a rich person&apos;s food and those who consume it - whether in India, Denmark or England - cause malnourishment and death among the world&apos;s poorest people. When Animal Aid launched the first Veggie Month 15 years ago (the 2008 celebration begins March 1), hard evidence as to the impact of meat-eating on the lives of impoverished people was mainly confined to arcane journals. Today, the evidence showers down upon us like hailstones. Do we put up our umbrellas and disregard the signs or do we change direction? The most recent storm warning was published in the Guardian this week. The UN&apos;s World Food Programme said that the rising price of grain means it no longer has enough money to keep global malnourishment at bay this year. Millions more people face starvation. Rising commodity prices have already caused food riots in Morocco, Yemen, Mexico, Senegal and elsewhere. While a switch in use of agricultural land from producing food to producing biofuels is a major cause of the grain price rises, the biggest factor is the accelerating demand for meat in increasingly prosperous countries such as China and India. A Guardian leader recognised the inherent inefficiencies of meat production but went on to complain that &quot;the new middle classes of Beijing and Shanghai will not easily be persuaded that eating meat is a bad idea, especially if the persuasion comes from western countries that are far from vegan.&quot; If eating meat - and other animal products - is the problem, then the Guardian should not wait for salvation from the east, but confront its readers with that reality so that more of them might be encouraged to take positive action. Animal Aid has dared to offer similar guidance to aid charities such as Oxfam, Christian Aid and Help the Aged, which promote gifts of farmed animals for the world&apos;s poorest communities. People who can&apos;t feed themselves should not be encouraged to devote precious agricultural resources to growing crops to feed animals. If they used the land to feed themselves directly, they would obtain up to ten times more nutrients. And they would need far less water and cause less soil damage and pollution. The promotion of meat as a solution to world hunger is an especially pernicious deception when practised by poverty relief charities. But the suspicion is that the agencies concerned fear conveying to their supporters the hard message that their own meat consumption contributes to world hunger. Christian Aid (CA), for all its other good works, is particularly culpable in this regard. Last summer, it organised a 1,000-mile Cut The Carbon march from Northern Ireland to St Paul&apos;s in London. Its message was that the profligate use of energy in the rich world is generating climate-changing gases whose impact is felt most acutely by the world&apos;s poorest people. Naturally, it wanted the government to do something. When it came to individual action, CA confined itself to urging people to switch off unwanted lights and run more efficient cars and the like. Not a word on meat, dairy or egg consumption, even though a UN report published in November 2006 (Livestock&apos;s Long Shadow) calculated that the volume of greenhouse gases generated by global livestock farming exceeds that generated by the whole of the world&apos;s transport sector. As Green MEP Caroline Lucas succinctly put it when addressing the London Climate Action rally in December 2007: &quot;A vegan driving a 4x4 generates fewer climate-changing gases than a meat-eater on a bicycle.&quot; But the bad news about meat extends beyond climate change and production inefficiencies. The endless succession of disease epidemics afflicting farmed animals is not merely &quot;bad luck&quot; that improved biosecurity or more generous farmer compensation packages will fix. BSE, salmonella, E coli, campylobacter, swine fever, foot and mouth, avian flu, bovine TB, pig wasting disease et al result from pushing animals - physically and emotionally - past the point beyond which they can cope. High levels of disease and death inevitably follow. Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recently drew welcome attention to the plight of broiler chickens - birds reared for meat in appallingly crowded, windowless sheds, each frequently holding more than 40,000 chickens. Instead of abolition they called for a palliative, which they called &quot;high welfare&quot;. I recently wrote to both celebrity chefs inviting them to try a veggie diet for a week or more to coincide with Veggie Month. My letter commends them for highlighting the suffering of chickens, but goes on to say:  &quot;The promotion of Freedom Foods products, free range systems and the use of slower growing chickens can only ever have a marginal impact on bird welfare. The lives of these &apos;high welfare&apos; birds are also miserable and deprived. The fundamental problem is the commodification of chickens (and of other farmed animals). There will always be a niche market for less roughly-processed birds, but for so long as animals are mass produced, fattened, transported and killed for food products, then those engaged in such activities will obey the rules of the market place and seek to reduce unit costs and maximise output. These cardinal rules of the marketplace translate inexorably into animal suffering. Animal Aid believes that it is cruel and immoral to treat animals as commodities, which is why we promote the non-animal diet.&quot;  World hunger, climate change, animal disease epidemics and animal suffering are all reasons to abandon the meat habit. For those who do so, the news with respect to human health is encouraging: vegetarians are less likely to suffer from various cancers, or from diabetes, heart disease and obesity. They have a longer life expectancy. Long ago, Morrissey proclaimed: &quot;Meat is Murder&quot;. He had in mind the non-human victims of animal farming.

Partly, I suspect, it&apos;s the shock element. Young people enjoy turning the convention on its head, and young women in particular like doing something that was so firmly off-limits to them until very recently.  &apos;There&apos;s an unmistakeable element of coolness in rolling your own cigarette,&apos; he added. &apos;You see young people competing in pub gardens to roll the smoothest or thinnest ciggy. What we are also seeing is that the young people who started rolling their own cigarettes at university because they were cheap, no longer move on to manufactured cigarettes once they became older and more affluent, which is what they used to do. What we&apos;re seeing now is that as young people leave university and enter the world of conventional work, as accountants and lawyers, they continue to roll their own cigarettes,&apos; he said.  Smoking is, according to market analysts Nielsen, a market in decline. Sales of cigarettes are down almost 4 per cent year on year, with the slope becoming steeper in recent months: in the last quarter of 2007, sales were down 6.7 per cent. The roll-your-own category, however, is now one of the most dynamic sectors of the market with volume up 7 per cent and value up 12 per cent in the 12 months to December 2007. &apos;Roll your own has always appealed to older, male smokers, but now there are 1.9 million female smokers, up from 1.7 million in 2005,&apos; Iain Watkins, trade communications manager from Imperial Tobacco told the Grocer magazine. &apos;This rise is largely due to the rise in younger smokers, which is giving it a funkier edge.&apos; John Catania, managing director of Swedish Match UK, the company that produces Swan rolling papers, agreed. &apos;Roll your own tobacco used to be a smoking trend restricted to the sort of men who wore flat caps and kept whippets, but we now know it is gaining popularity among the younger generations.&apos; The trend is one that concerns Robert West, professor of health psychology and director of tobacco studies at the Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Unit. &apos;There seems to be a weird belief, particularly among young women, that it&apos;s healthier to smoke hand-rolled cigarettes than manufactured ones because there are fewer additives in loose tobacco,&apos; he said.  &apos;This belief continues despite evidence that those who roll their own cigarettes end up with higher levels of tobacco in their lungs than those who smoke manufactured cigarettes.&apos; The ban on cigarette advertising has had other effects on the type of tobacco products that people buy. Some smokers, say the experts, have taken the view that if they have less time to smoke they will smoke fewer but they choose products that are of a higher premium.  This is how James Higgs, the head of commercial marketing at Henri Wintermans, explained the rise in sales of miniature cigars. &apos;Miniature cigars continue to drive growth in the UK cigar sector, accounting for 49 per cent of sales,&apos; he said. &apos;They are popular because it is easier for time-poor and venue-restricted smokers to smoke miniatures rather than small cigars, a trend that has been developing in recent years.&apos; Smoke signals \u00b7 From the 1920s, women who were emancipated or elegant were rarely seen without a cigarette. With a casual blowing of smoke, Princess Margaret or Hilda Ogden could indicate their sexuality. \u00b7 Refinement was crucial to respectable smoking.

That is the peripatetic career path of Bob Houghton, head coach of India and formerly national manager of China and Uzbekistan. He is particularly fondly remembered in Sweden, where he is credited, along with his friend Fulham manager Roy Hodgson, with transforming Swedish football by introducing 4-4-2 during a successful stint with Malmo in the 1970s, when Houghton led them to four league titles and a European Cup final. He is a man worth listening to, whether discussing the Premier League&apos;s plans for the 39th game, his influence on Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, or his days playing with and under Bobby Robson. &apos;Let me tell you something that was absolutely dreadful. Last October, Manchester United had 5,000 kids in the Nehru stadium here in Goa to select 11 boys to go Manchester for a week&apos;s training. It was horrendous, because they were all believing that they&apos;d end, after three days of judgement, playing for United. That sort of marketing thing is in nobody&apos;s interests.&apos; What of the Premier League&apos;s plan to take their games around the globe, with India a possible venue? &apos;To be honest, we&apos;re fighting quite hard to keep the Premier League out of India. Last month they sent over Warren Barton and Robbie Earle for their Premier Skills thing [a scheme launched in Delhi, with the British Council, with the stated intention of improving boys&apos; technical ability]. &apos;They&apos;re just marketing the Premier League. Why else are they doing it? And as well as Manchester United, who are also running a cup competition [Manchester United Premier Cup], Everton are here,&apos; he adds, of a coaching project in which the Goodison club are involved. &apos;But it&apos;s not doing us any favours, it&apos;s something we need to be doing ourselves. &apos;The Premier League is responsible for the crushing of many successful leagues in Asia. In Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong the Premier League has engulfed them. When Star [Sky&apos;s sister network owned by Rupert Murdoch] decided to show matches in Asia, it had to be five. It was blanket coverage, and became so big, with so many repeats, that the sponsorship became huge. Now, if they start playing games here as well, I just can&apos;t see anything that commends it other than the possibility for the Premier League to make more money. What else could it be to do with?&apos; Houghton&apos;s senior playing career was brief. A midfielder at Fulham for three seasons, where Robson was a team-mate then boss - &apos;a real coaching man&apos; - he moved on to Brighton in 1969. A year there was followed by another at Hastings United, where he met Hodgson, then he became Maidstone United player-manager at 24. Houghton took over Malmo in 1974, having spent two seasons coaching in South Africa, where Hodgson also played under him. Malmo remain the only Swedish team to have reached a European Cup final, which they lost 1-0 to Clough&apos;s Nottingham Forest. A second, three-year spell at the club, beginning in 1990, was less successful and during that time Houghton was accused of threatening to strangle a photographer after a defeat to IFK Norrkoping before a judge ruled there was no case to answer. &apos;Clough was lucky in one respect - that the difference between our team which played in the quarter-final and final was six players. And the irony of that game, just to underline what I&apos;ve been saying about development, is that every boy was born in Malmo. There&apos;s 300,000 people there, which tells you that in Sweden at that time, they got the development right.&apos; Houghton is nearly two years into his job of attempting to implement a structure in Indian football that will allow the national team to improve on a miserable record for a land of 1.2 billion people. Although cricket is hugely popular, football has been played in India for more than a century, and the Durand Cup is the third oldest cup competition in the world, behind the English and Scottish FA Cups. They have qualified for a single World Cup, by default due to withdrawals in 1950, but did not go to Brazil because they were not allowed to play barefoot. Their best performance in the Asian Cup is runners-up in 1964, and they are already out of the 2010 World Cup after losing 6-3 to Lebanon in a two-leg playoff. There is, though, hope for the future. The first season of full professional football, with its rebranded I-League, has just finished and gradually Houghton is accomplishing the tricky feat of aligning the country&apos;s competing factions. &apos;Sometimes you come against a brick wall,&apos; Houghton says. &apos;But for the most part the idea of the national team is gaining more and more interest.&apos; Indian football is complicated, with tensions between the differing associations in its 28 states and seven union territories. There are myriad cups and tournaments, and overlapping state leagues, but from next season I-League players will not play full midweek games in lesser competitions. Houghton has strong views on English football. He counts Eriksson as a friend, but says foreign coaches and owners always look abroad first for young talent, rather than nurturing English players. England should not have an Eriksson or a Fabio Capello in charge, he believes, as a foreigner will not have a long-term vision. The popularity of looking overseas, Houghton further states, also has real implications for English coaches and managers. &apos;A guy only last week phoned me. I worked with him not so long ago. He was then a youth coach, and is now a first team coach. There was an academy director job and he asked me to put his name forward. I rang and was told that they were interested in someone with good contacts outside of England because they want to recruit foreign players for their academy. I was stunned.&apos; This has only firmed up Houghton&apos;s intent never to work again in England, where his sole managerial job was at Bristol City for two seasons beginning in 1980. The experience left Houghton preferring to work abroad because: &apos;There the coach is the most important man at the club. When I worked at Bristol, I would&apos;ve been better off being a bank manager, such was the time I had to spend on financial issues.&apos; Houghton&apos;s preference for the wider world also extends to his &apos;home&apos;. When not living wherever his job lands him - he has a stunning villa near Margao in Goa - he heads for his house in Gordon&apos;s Bay, on South Africa&apos;s southern cape. His intention, though, is to stay in India a good while longer. Can they qualify for a World Cup over the next three cycles? He cites the US, China and Japan as examples. &apos;I coached in the first season of the MLS in America in 1996 with the Colorado Rapids,&apos; says Houghton, who also had a stint at Toronto in the NASL, the league&apos;s predecessor (where his wife, Nerise, became a celebrity for her fitness series on Canadian television). &apos;They planned then to win the World Cup in 2010.

He said that, up until then, Bjork had delighted Chinese fans by saying &quot;xie xie&quot; (thank you) after every song. Comments from Chinese discussion boards (translated by the media blog Danwei), however, were mostly outraged. &quot;Those who put on the show should be severely fined and not allowed to bring this kind of trash in for performances,&quot; wrote one angry commenter.

Photograph: AP. &quot;Tibet, Tibet!&quot; With those two words (well, one word repeated) Bjork caused a storm of controversy at her concert in Shanghai this week. The Icelandic warbler has joined a long list of celebrities, commentators and sportsmen who plan to use the platform provided by the Beijing Olympics to protest against China&apos;s occupation of Tibet. If Bjork&apos;s squealing of the T-word is anything to go by, these protests will confirm what lies behind the adoption of the &quot;Tibetan cause&quot; by many in the west today: not a passion for freedom, but a disgust with modernity. Tibetophilia is driven less by solidarity with Tibetans than by disdain for the old &quot;yellow peril&quot; - the Chinese - who are seen as too modern, too calculating and too materialistic. The people of Tibet, like the people of China itself, who toil under Stalinism, should be free to determine their own destinies and affairs. They need democracy and full and unfettered freedom of speech, and they need it now. However, anyone who wants, truly, to see more freedom in both Tibet and China should steer clear of the celebrity-fronted, Prince Charles-endorsed pro-Tibet lobby - for, ironically, this campaign is underpinned by its own deeply patronising, borderline colonialist view of Tibetans as innocent, child-like creatures, and by a desire to preserve Tibet as a pure, green, mystical land for the benefit of wealthy westerners disillusioned by western modernity. Pro-Tibet campaigners seem always to be outraged by two things in particular: China&apos;s incessant modernisation of Tibet, and its refusal to allow the Dalai Lama to return and assume his &quot;rightful&quot; position as Tibet&apos;s leader. Currently pro-Tibet activists are particularly agitated by China&apos;s construction of the Gormo-Lhasa railway, a spectacularly ambitious project that will allow trains to run from the heart of China into Tibet. They claim the railway will damage Tibet&apos;s environment and &quot;wipe out Tibetan identity and culture altogether&quot;. They also campaign for China to engage in direct dialogue with the Dalai Lama, currently living in exile in India, and to recognise him as the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of the Tibetan people. These two aspects of pro-Tibet campaigning show what lies behind Tibetophilia. First there is the desire to save Tibet from anything that looks or smells modern: from Chinese jobs, industry, railways. Apparently such things are a threat to Tibetans&apos; &quot;way of life&quot;, which is honourably simple, rustic and rural. This paternalistic defence of &quot;natural&quot; and childlike Tibet from rampant, industrious China is perfectly captured in a Free Tibet poster (pdf). It asks, &quot;Whose side are you on?&quot;, and shows on one side a very yellow-looking Chinese official sitting in a train, surrounded by modern weaponry, and pumping out grey smog into the environment, and on the other side, wise-faced Tibetans in traditional dress surrounded by their happy, leaping farm animals. The message is clear: China is modern, and thus wicked, and Tibet must be protected from anything so new-fangled as railway or factories. At the same time, campaigners&apos; unquestioning support for the Dalai Lama suggest they see Tibetans as an immature people who need a godlike figure to lead them. The Dalai Lama was never elected by anybody; rather, in a process that makes Britain&apos;s House of Lords seem almost modern and democratic (I said almost), he was handpicked by a tiny sect of monks who believed that he represents one of innumerable incarnations of the Buddhist entity Avalokitesvara. The Dalai Lama is no more the legitimate representative of Tibet than I am the legitimate representative of Timbuktu. Indeed, some writers on Tibet have pointed out that the idolisation of the Dalai Lama by western activists and officials, and of course by some Tibetans, might actually undermine the development of democracy in Tibet. In her book The Tibetan Independence Movement: Political, Religious and Gandhian Perspectives, Jane Ardley writes:  &quot;[It] is apparent that it is the Dalai Lama&apos;s role as ultimate spiritual authority that is holding back the political process of democratisation. The assumption that he occupies the correct moral ground from a spiritual perspective means that any challenge to his political authority may be interpreted as anti-religious.&quot;  In elevating the Dalai Lama to the position of unquestionable representative of the Tibetan people, pro-Tibet activists are helping to stifle &quot;the opportunity for opposition and the expression of different views&quot; - the very lifeblood of democracy. It would be like Britain being under occupation, and campaigners around the world hailing Prince Charles or, worse, Dr Rowan Williams as our true, brave, godlike spokesperson. Tibet has long been the plaything of people disillusioned by the modern world. Since James Hilton wrote Lost Horizon in 1933, in which Tibet was depicted as &quot;Shangri-la&quot;, Tibet has been used and abused, turned into an idealised land of goodness and purity by aristocratic and artistic elements in the west who despise the pace of change over here, and like the idea of a completely natural, archaic, mystical, politics-free land &quot;over there&quot;. In his 1991 book Sacred Tibet, Philip Rawson wrote: &quot;Tibetan culture offers powerful, untarnished and coherent alternatives to Western egotistical lifestyles, our short attention span, our gradually more pointless pursuit of material satisfactions...&quot; In other words, the driving force behind Tibetophilia today is not political solidarity with the Tibetans, and certainly not any positive argument for full democratic equality for Tibetans, but rather a sense of disgust with western life. It is a deeply narcissistic project, where &quot;the west perceives some lack within itself&quot; and seeks to find fulfilment in the always-preserved &quot;pure east&quot;. This is why pro-Tibet campaigning can so easily slip into ugly China-bashing. In the morality tale constructed around Tibet, China comes to be seen as the evil representative of modernity, a faceless, smog-producing people who are ruining western activists&apos; spiritual backyard in Tibet. As Donald S Lopez Jnr argues in his fascinating book Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West:  &quot;The invasion of Tibet by [China] was and still is represented as an undifferentiated mass of godless Communists overrunning a peaceful land devoted only to ethereal pursuits... Tibet embodies the spiritual and the ancient, China the material and the modern. Tibetans are superhuman, Chinese are subhuman.&quot;  Too much of today&apos;s pro-Tibet campaigning is underpinned by two things: self-loathing for our own, apparently over-modernised societies, and a semi-colonialist view of Tibetans as spiritual children and the Chinese as evil automatons. No wonder it can attract the support of such an archaic, illiberal figure as Prince Charles. Tibetophilia will do nothing whatsoever to increase the freedom of the people of Tibet, or the people of China.", "tags": ["China", "Sport", "Politics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-06T15:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/07/gender", "sentences": ["Sharan Burrow, the ITUC president, said: &quot;Despite decades of anti-discrimination legislation and changes in company rhetoric, the pay packets of women, whether they are in New York or Shanghai, are still significantly thinner than those of men.&quot;"], "title": "Audits urged to close 16% gender pay gap", "article": "Women workers around the world are paid 16% less than men, with more educated women facing an even bigger gap, according to a new international study published yesterday.

Check. But does the money flood in quicker than you could scream &quot;Nurse!!! Ma catheter!!!&quot;? No, sadly not. Which is why Weird Uncle Fiver was hoping to earn a few extra quid from the arrival of Paolo Maldini, 83, who had announced earlier this season his intention to hang up his boots and take his leave of a Milan side he&apos;s graced since 1957. But Maldini - who tragically suffers from Redknapp Syndrome, which in the blink of an eye causes the face to start melting towards the floor, turning strikingly handsome young men into spits of their dad/Starbucks-era Paul McCartney lookalikes - appears to have changed his mind. &quot;The whole club is pushing for me to play another year,&quot; said Maldini today, who isn&apos;t so green as he&apos;s cabbage looking. &quot;My knees are much better compared to three months ago. I know I should stick to what I originally said but only stupid people don&apos;t change their minds, just because of something they&apos;ve said in the past.&quot; Bah! No sooner had Weird Uncle Fiver felt the impact of that bodyblow, than he was given the bodyswerve by Sir Alex Ferguson. Initially tempted by a trail of Special Malt Sweeties which led all the way up to the front door of Snuff Shack, Fergie had hinted at his impending retirement for only the 473rd time of his career. &quot;I&apos;M 66 YEARS OLD YOU KNOW,&quot; he proudly announced yesterday. &quot;Maybe three years more, then I&apos;ll finish. I have a great assistant in Carlos Queiroz. He will come into the reckoning. But we have owners and a chief executive who will choose the new man in three years&apos; time.&quot; That gave Weird Uncle Fiver fleeting hope, as he&apos;d worked out that Snuff Shack could hold out until then if he cuts back on the biscuits and the gin and the food and the water. But it wasn&apos;t long before Fergie was spectacularly back-pedalling over retirement plans for only the 473rd time in his career. &quot;I am not going to pigeon hole myself on that one,&quot; said Fergie, who is 66 years old you know. &quot;It could be four years. Who knows, it could be tomorrow. It is impossible to put a time limit on it.&quot; Unlike Snuff Shack, which having been totally stiffed by Ferguson and Maldini, now faces that most ignominious of closures: an old people&apos;s home outlasted by every single one of its residents.

And, what with it being early March and a couple of weeks after the FA Cup fifth round, it&apos;s not just any weekend. Oh no. We all know what&apos;s going to dominate the next couple of days, monopolising conversations and television schedules with equal certainty ... yup, Crufts! Clare Balding, given the rare chance to stop presenting programmes about animals that all look like her (horses) and instead present programmes about animals that don&apos;t all look like her, though quite a lot do but it depends what breed they are (dogs), will be (there&apos;s an element of presumption going on here) panting with excitement.

OK, so there&apos;s nothing on TV. But let&apos;s get out of our living rooms - after all, some of us like to actually get out there and attend the big events for ourselves.

[Fiver recycles useless papers and phones Birmingham tourist office] ... apparently there&apos;s some kind of dog show in the Midlands! Bah! There is, almost literally, nothing to do this weekend except watch the FA Cup sixth round, even though it contains Bristol Rovers, West Bromwich Albion, Cardiff City and Barnsley. So, in case you&apos;re struggling, here are five very good reasons to get excited - provided by the very players you&apos;ll be seeing in action! 1) &quot;It&apos;s one of the most important cups in Europe, if not the world!&quot; - Middlesbrough&apos;s Julio Arca. 2) &quot;Every player at every league club, in the Premiership or in the lower divisions, is desperate to go as far as possible in this competition. That&apos;s what makes the FA Cup so special!&quot; - England&apos;s Brave John Terry. 3) &quot;I&apos;m not going to Old Trafford to avoid defeat. I am going there to win. It is the FA Cup and anything can happen!&quot; - Portsmouth&apos;s Sylvain Distin. 4) &quot;There is no greater cup competition around&quot; - West Brom&apos;s James Morrison. 5) &quot;We&apos;re ecstatic to have got this far and Wembley is, of course, a carrot!&quot; - Bristol Rover Steve Phillips (we think he means figuratively, because Wembley isn&apos;t actually a carrot). So there you go. Print that off and keep it to hand, in case there&apos;s a moment during Middlesbrough v Cardiff City when you start to doubt your sanity.

Help is at hand", "article": "After a lacklustre Oscars ceremony, and a depleted awards season that failed to capture the public imagination, all stardust-seekers must turn their eyes to Crufts this weekend, where the flashiness quotient has never been higher.  According to reports, the biggest dog show in the world has seen an influx of canine glamourpusses, if you will, as a result of the relaxation of the quarantine laws, the general apotheosis of all things showbizzy, and probably the Hollywood writers&apos; strike. The writers&apos; strike seemed to affect everything from David Letterman&apos;s opening monologue to Shanghai zinc futures, so it stands to reason it will have had some influence on the owners and dogs gambolling round the Birmingham NEC on these most hallowed of dates in the canine calendar. But just as the glittering surface of the Oscars masks the often troubled lives of its sparkly attendees, so the razzmatazz of Crufts belies the existential angst suffered by - or, more likely, projected upon - so many pets. Why is it that more and more dogs seem to lack the skills to cope in a troubling modern world? Who knows. But last year, that big-hearted pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly launched its response to the crisis: a canine form of Prozac, called Reconcile. (Aren&apos;t drug names always so creepy?) So if your dog is sleeping a lot, writing morbid poetry, or listening to the Smiths - or if you just feel he&apos;s getting too old for his pooch Ritalin - chemical help is now at hand.  Not that it&apos;s only Eli Lilly identifying a sea change. Some pharmacologists and veterinarians genuinely believe the human-animal bond has changed significantly in recent years, with owners actively wishing to splash out on the same palliatives that ease their struggles, or which they are encouraged to believe do so. Each new pet medicine is welcomed by a host of vets who blame the stresses of the human world for the fact that increasing numbers of dogs are developing psychological problems. Our occasionally bizarre relationship with dogs is nothing new, of course, but man&apos;s best friendship seems to be taking a slightly unhealthy turn. As one dog trainer declared at the time of Reconcile&apos;s launch: &quot;Neurotic dogs are innocent victims of a changing world. Dogs are more neurotic today than ever because they&apos;re more man&apos;s companion today. We live in a world with fences, lots of traffic and lots of stress. Our dogs are just a barometer of our emotions.&quot;  In which case, a glance at just the past fortnight in dog stories would suggest we humans have raised our emotional terror alert to orange, and our pets&apos; problems are becoming indistinguishable from our own. This week alone the veterinary charity PDSA warned that 2 million British dogs are obese. In unconnected news, it emerged that a new dog diet drug is to be added to the range of products available to treat the problem. Elsewhere, a state-of-the-art collar was launched, which will use satnav to alert owners to their dog&apos;s movements. Should your pet stray outside pre-set boundaries, it will send you a text message. I assume the technology could be adapted into a bracelet or somesuch for a child, were you as bothered about keeping tabs on one of those.  Raging alongside all of these is the reaction to the YouTube video of a US marine hurling a puppy into a ravine in Iraq. The tide of internet outrage is so great that the man&apos;s family back in America have received death threats and are on the point of having to be removed from their home to a safe house. (For some reason, the business puts me in mind of another intellectual triumph by the animal rights group Peta, whose president was only moved to comment on Middle East carnage after the killing of a donkey in the region. At that point, Ingrid Newkirk wrote to Yasser Arafat and asked him to keep animals out of the conflict.) Yet though the marine is obviously vile and repulsive, and though internet storms shouldn&apos;t be used as proportionate scientific indicators, there is something faintly troubling in the knowledge that another deeply disturbing and revolting YouTube video - which depicted a drugged woman being gang-raped in at least earshot of her young children - was viewed 600 times without causing anyone sufficient offence that they decided to report it.  The wonderful thing about Crufts is that it provides a sort of escapism from these seemingly quotidian horrors, so we must hope that all the mutterings about its incipient flashiness and the growth of dog-pharma are just a fad. Logic suggests otherwise. All other competitions based on physicality, from sport to beauty pageants, have seen people go to ever-more extreme lengths to improve the specimens on show, while all other pharmaceutical markets have been ruthlessly expanded by the drug firms. For all its Britishness, the dog show&apos;s quintessential spirit was most brilliantly captured by Christopher Guest and company in the spoof US documentary Best in Show. It would be too heartbreaking to think that kind of magic might soon be eclipsed by people asking if we really are seeing a clean Crufts. marina.hyde@theguardian.com", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2008-03-08T00:02:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/09/citigroup.banking", "sentences": ["Pandit, who was born in the south-western Indian state of Maharashtra and schooled in Mumbai before moving to the US to study electrical engineering at Columbia, has spent the past month inspecting his far-flung empire, travelling to branch offices in London, Mexico City, Warsaw, Istanbul, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Seoul."], "title": "Profile: Vikram Pandit", "article": "When Vikram Pandit was appointed CEO of Citigroup last December, the studious, mild-mannered former fund manager could not have predicted that two months later he would be defending the continued existence of the $250bn (\u00a3124bn) institution. But over the past week, Wall Street has succumbed to seemingly irredeemable pessimism over the prospects of the huge firm and the 51-year-old executive&apos;s commitment to making the changes it needs to survive. On Tuesday, investors sent shares tumbling to a nine-year low after a respected analyst at Merrill Lynch warned that Citigroup might have to write down a further $18bn in sub-prime and other mortgage-related losses. On top of similar write-downs last autumn, that cost then-CEO Chuck Prince his job, analyst Guy Moszkowski warned that the firm still has &apos;quite a way to go&apos; before resolving the fate of its $37bn portfolio of junk mortgages. In a move to boost confidence, the bank last week announced it would reduce its $200bn mortgage portfolio by 20 per cent, mostly by cutting back on new loans. But it is questionable if Pandit, who announced a 41 per cent cut in dividends in January, can reduce Citigroup&apos;s exposure to riskier assets and improve performance before pressure from analysts and investors to break it up becomes irresistible. Last week&apos;s stock rout, which saw Citi shares fall to $20.89 - comfortably less than half their value of a year ago - came as one prominent Middle Eastern banker suggested it would take more than just infusions of cash from sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf and Far East to keep the company intact. Over the past three months, Citigroup has tapped foreign investors for nearly $30bn. Adding to the gloom, rumours have spread on Wall Street that the company may dismiss a further 30,000 employees, on top of 21,000 jobs already lost, in the coming months. Reviving the firm is among the stiffest challenges facing any Wall Street executive. Citigroup is not only the largest bank but also one of the sickest after ingesting billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities, even when it was apparent that the US housing market was in trouble. With credit-market losses expected to mount, the concept of an all-in-one financial powerhouse that includes a commercial bank, a brokerage firm, an investment bank, and a credit card company, is being reconsidered. Pandit, who was born in the south-western Indian state of Maharashtra and schooled in Mumbai before moving to the US to study electrical engineering at Columbia, has spent the past month inspecting his far-flung empire, travelling to branch offices in London, Mexico City, Warsaw, Istanbul, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Seoul. Since taking the job, he has said that he wants to re-orient the company to focus on customer needs. But until his review is complete, he has declined to decide which bits will be divested. Pandit is expected to outline his plan to investors and analysts at a meeting on 9 May. Last Thursday, the CEO tried to put a positive spin on the situation in a memo to staff. In it, he conceded Citigroup faces a &apos;challenging economic environment&apos; but said &apos;fundamentally we remain strong&apos;. He was also upbeat about the foreign cash injection, saying that capital is at &apos;a level that was stress-tested against a number of economic downturns&apos;. But there is still unease among investors and analysts over whether Pandit can turn around its fortunes. His 100-day honeymoon, they say, is close to conclusion and the investment banker, who has never run a public company, must show he can act with a firm hand over the 330,000-employee firm. Pandit was chosen in December after recruiters spent a fruitless month polling suitable executives. Several candidates - including Royal Bank of Scotland&apos;s Sir Fred Goodwin and Deutsche Bank&apos;s Josef Ackermann - turned Citigroup down flat, fearing the extent of exposure to mortgage-related debts. Others, including former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and John Thain, now CEO at Merrill Lynch, declined after it became clear that Citigroup&apos;s board wanted to keep the conglomerate intact. In choosing Pandit, the Citi board selected an analytical technocrat over a charismatic figurehead. Despite misgivings over his experience, Pandit has proved himself an able businessman. He joined Citigroup in 2006, to run its alternative assets division after selling his hedge fund, Old Lane, to the firm for about $800m. This was barely a year after founding it - and at the very top of the market. After graduating with a PhD in finance in the mid-Eighties, he joined Morgan Stanley. By 1994, he&apos;d risen to become head of its institutional securities division and helped build up the firm&apos;s electronic trading and prime brokerage divisions. According to his father, Shankar Pandit, the Citigroup CEO was &apos;a brilliant student throughout&apos; and possessed a &apos;steely resolve&apos;.  Pandit, who lives with his wife and two children in an $18m apartment on Central Park West, resists the typical profile of a Wall Street titan. He maintains that he&apos;s never been on a golf course; he&apos;s not known as a lavish spender on art or fine wine; and he&apos;s more likely to be reading a book than showing off on a yacht. &apos;He has an analytical mind. He won&apos;t ever get perturbed by problems. He&apos;ll jot down the pros and cons of the issue and then come up with a workable solution,&apos; says his father. The changes Pandit is said to be considering involve combining Citigroup&apos;s low-margin consumer unit with its wealth-management division, to give its brokerage business, Smith Barney, better access to branch customers. The structure of Citigroup&apos;s investment bank may also need to be altered, say analysts. But some also warn that Citigroup, like many huge companies, represents the vision and energy of one man, in this case Sandy Weill. As is often the case, the firm has struggled for direction without him. Weill&apos;s designated successor, Chuck Prince, came from the firm&apos;s legal arm, not one known for making money.  So far, Pandit has attempted to limit the excesses of the Prince era by installing a new risk-management team, cutting exposure to sub-prime, and focusing on its wealth-management operation. Some analysts say the sell-off of Citibank stock has gone far enough, but others remain unconvinced. &apos;Unless he is willing to engage in a decisive plan to break up this company, you have a highly disruptive year coming up,&apos; warns Meredith Whitney, the banking analyst at Oppenheimer, who first warned last year that Citigroup would need to cut its dividend or sell assets to avert a $30bn capital shortfall. Other analysts criticised Citi&apos;s claim that its sovereign-wealth cash infusion was enough. Christopher Whalen at Institutional Risk Analytics told the New York Post: &apos;It&apos;s trying to do this in bite-size pieces. But everyone&apos;s still waiting for the other shoe to drop.&apos; But will it? In spite of his optimistic &apos;Dear Colleagues&apos; memo last week, Pandit is a realist: the colossus that was built on ego and hubris in the Nineties may not be the same one that flourishes in what remains of the Noughties.

The dispossessed, and the ambitious are flooding into cities swollen out of all recognition. Poor cities are struggling to cope. Rich cities are reconfiguring themselves at breakneck speed. China has created an industrial power house from what were fishing villages in the 1970s. Lagos and Dhaka attract a thousand new arrivals every day. In Britain, central London&apos;s population has started to grow again after 50 years of decline. We have more big cities now than at any time in our history. In 1900, only 16 had a population of one million; now it&apos;s more than 400. Not only are there more of them, they are larger than ever. In 1851, London had two million people. It was the largest city in the world by a long way, twice the size of Paris, its nearest rival. That version of London would seem like a village now. By the official definition, London has getting on for eight million people, but in practical terms, it&apos;s a city of 18 million, straggling most of the way from Ipswich to Bournemouth in an unforgiving tide of business parks and designer outlets, gated housing and logistics depots. There might be fields between them, but they are linked in a single transport system and a single economy. Those villages in Suffolk that are close enough to a railway station to deliver you to Liverpool Street in under 90 minutes are effectively as much a part of London as Croydon or Ealing and they have the house prices to prove it. The other big conurbations - from Birmingham to Manchester and Glasgow, names for cities that spread far beyond the bounds of political city limits - can be understood in the same way. Having invented the modern city, Britain promptly reeled back in horror at what it had done. To William Morris and John Ruskin, or the Salvation Army exploring the cholera-ridden back alleys of London&apos;s East End, the city was a hideous tumour sucking the life out of the countryside and creating in its place a vast, polluted landscape of squalor, disease and crime. In their eyes, the city was a place to be feared, controlled and, if possible, eliminated. In William Blake&apos;s bitterly ironic words, Jerusalem had been overwhelmed by dark, satanic mills. Morris dreamt of a London abandoned by its population in favour of communal country life, leaving behind a dung heap in Parliament Square and empty streets enlivened by fluttering, worthless banknotes. Such attitudes continue to shape thinking about the city and not only in Britain. In America, the Republicans have concluded that there are no votes to be had in cities. And wealthy suburbanites refuse to pay the property taxes that will support the downtown areas they fear and despise. Yet whether we like it or not, at some point in 2008, the city will have finally swallowed the world. The number of people living in cities is about to overtake those left behind in the fields. It&apos;s a statistic that seems to suggest some sort of fundamental species change, like the moment when mankind stopped being hunter gatherers and took up agriculture. It has been the trigger for a wave of task forces, academic disaster tourism and feverish speculation, from Forbes magazine and National Geographic to the United Nations&apos; habitat programme. When Forbes went to Lagos last year, drawn by what it called the &apos;Malthusian nightmare&apos; of a city that had grown from 300,000 people in 1950 to 10 million today, in an unconscious echo of those Victorians horrified by the spectacle of the new industrial cities of the 19th century, it invited us to think of the future of Lagos in terms of the lawless chaos of Baghdad&apos;s Sadr City, multiplied by 100. The future of the city has suddenly become the only subject in town. It ranges from tough topics such as managing water resources, economic policy, transport planning and law enforcement to what is usually presented as the fluffier end of the scale, such as making public spaces people want to spend time in. It&apos;s about racial tolerance and civilised airports, the colour of the buses and the cost of the fares on them. Unless you have some kind of framework to make sense of all that, the city can seem to be about so many diverse things that it is about everything and nothing. And that is how I found myself swept up in Urban Age, a mobile think-tank set up by the London School of Economics Cities programme, with the Alfred Herrhausen Society, a well-funded charitable arm of Deutsche Bank. The starting point of the Urban Age project, originated by Richard Sennett and Ricky Burdett of the LSE, was that a successful city has to be based on an understanding that it is shaped both by politics and by ideas about space and architecture. Their idea was to bring together a diverse selection of people, not only those who spend their time thinking about cities, but also those who have to try to do something about them. There were a couple of mayors - of Washington and Bogot\u00e1 - and a formidable American sociologist in the shape of Saskia Sassen. They were joined from time to time by Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. On one occasion, Ian Blair, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, turned up. There were Gerry Frug, a Harvard lawyer who writes constitutions for cities, a criminologist from the Sorbonne and an Austrian transport planner desperately worried about the impact of cars on the sustainability of cities. These are not the kind of people you usually find in the same room. Over two years, the group toured six of the world&apos;s key cities - New York, London, Shanghai, Mexico City, Johannesburg and Berlin - in a series of conferences. At each stop, they met their local peers. In New York I listened to Rem Koolhaas behaving badly and blaming our inability to face up to the realities of the contemporary city on our sentimental attachment to Jane Jacobs and the rose-tinted views on street life she expounds in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Ever since the 60s, Jacobs ideas about protecting traditional neighbourhoods from planners trying to carve urban motorway through them have made her a heroine to generations of urban activists. Later, I was in Johannesburg and saw Richard Sennett offend a roomful of South Africans as he attempted to put the ANC deputy mayor on the spot by asking her exactly what she intended to do about making life better in a city in which taking a journey on a suburban train is too dangerous for all but the desperate to contemplate. And in Berlin I asked Ian Blair how he defined the boundaries of London. His answer included Jamaica and Baghdad. The results of all this have been boiled down to The Endless City, a 500-page doorstep of a book I edited with Ricky Burdett and which is published this week. It has a lot of messages about reducing the reliance of cities on the car, on high-density cities being more sociable places in which to live, as well as more sustainable environmentally, about the importance of a coherent form of city government. Though it doesn&apos;t shrink from the darker aspects of city life, it is also a powerful affirmation of the city as mankind&apos;s greatest single invention. The nature of cities has already changed irrevocably and in The Endless City, there is plenty of evidence to show that they are changing us. In 1950, they were predominantly a Western phenomenon, with the developed world accounting for 60 per cent of the urban population. Now, 70 per cent of city dwellers are from the developing world. In China in 1970, one in five people lived in cities. In 30 years, that number has risen to two in five. The fastest-growing cities are all well outside the comfort zone of the Western world. Lagos, the fastest growing of them all, is adding 58 people every hour; Mumbai is growing by 42 every hour. A score of cities including Los Angeles, Shanghai and Mexico City, which were still tiny in the 19th century, have all passed the once unimaginable 18 million mark. That puts them well ahead of all but eight of the 27 nations of the European Union. This is a dizzying rate of transformation and it&apos;s still accelerating. In 1900, 10 per cent of the world&apos;s population lived in cities; by 2050, it is going to be 75 per cent. And the biggest question is if such places can survive as coherent cities at all. Cities bring out a lurking paranoia in some people. They see this explosive growth as a tide of slums engulfing the world. Certainly there is plenty to be worried about. Half of the 12 million people in Mumbai live in illegal shacks, 200,000 of them on the pavement. Every day, at least two people are killed falling off overcrowded suburban trains. In Mexico City, fewer than four workers in 10 have formal jobs, public transport is largely in the form of mafia-controlled minibuses, and taxis. The last mayor&apos;s response was to build a second tier on the elevated motorway, to allow the rich to speed up their commuting time. Johannesburg, with its horrifying levels of violent crime, has seen the affluent quit the city centre for fortified enclaves on its boundaries. As a result, South Africa is leading the world in developing new security techniques for gated housing, built appropriately enough in the style of Tuscan hill towns. Private security is also a divisive a topic in north London where I live where the clatter of police helicopters has become routine. My neighbourhood divides between those who want to install barriers and gates to cut us off from the world outside and those who see such measures as the ultimate negation of what life in a city should be. Despite our anxieties, London is a safe city by world standards. The murder rate is 2.1 for every 100,000 inhabitants. In Johannesburg, it is nine times that figure and you are eight times as likely to be killed in a car crash there. Even in the traditionally more successful cities, there is plenty to fuel the anxieties of those who worry about such an uncontrollable surge of urban change. In the last 20 years, the percentage of people with manufacturing jobs in New York has fallen from 20 per cent to just 4 per cent. In London&apos;s central seven boroughs, more than 70 per cent of births last year were to mothers not born in Britain. In 1992, 38 per cent of newcomers to London were foreign-born. Five years later, it was 40 per cent and in 2001 it was 56 per cent. Cities look different, too. Shanghai had just 121 buildings over eight storeys high in 1980. Twenty years later, it was 3,500, and just five years after that it was a staggering 10,000. But for all their agonies, cities must also be counted as a positive force. They are an engine of growth, a machine for putting the rural poor onto the first rung of urban prosperity and freedom. Look at London, a city that existed for several centuries before anything approximating England had been thought of. It has a far stronger sense of itself and its identity than Britain as a whole or England. It has grown, layer on layer, for 2,000 years, sustaining generation after generation of newcomers. You see their traces in Spitalfields, where a Huguenot chapel became, successively, a synagogue and a mosque, tracking the movement of waves of migrants from poverty to suburban comfort. It is a history of migration marked by place names like Lombard Street, Hindu shrines and mosques. It&apos;s a place without an apparent structure that has proved extraordinarily successful at growing and changing. Its old residential core, sheltering in the approaches to its fortress, has made the transition into the world&apos;s busiest banking centre. Its market halls and power stations have become art galleries and piazzas. The simple terraced streets built for the clerks of the Great Western Railway in Southall have become home to the largest Sikh community outside India. The failed speculation of 19th-century housebuilders in Holland Park has provided the base for the international financiers. Hoxton&apos;s nonconformist chapels and Camden&apos;s wharves provide fertile territory for hipsters interested in tattoos, unnecessary facial hair and the internet. And all of these worlds overlap in space and time. London is different for all its people. They make the most of the elements in it that have meaning for them and ignore the rest. A city is an a la carte menu. That is what makes it different from a village, which has little room for tolerance and difference. And a great city is one in which as many people as possible can make the widest of choices from its menu. Ever since I began writing about cities, London&apos;s structure has fascinated me. It manages to be both monumental and intimate. I have lived in many cities: Edinburgh was spectacularly beautiful; Glasgow has the grim magnificence of its stone built core and its American style grid of streets. Milan has its glittering centre and its endless sprawl of factories and workshopts that make it a world capital of design. But it is London which has left me with a mental map to interpret every other city in which I have found myself. Which is the east end, which is south of the river? It is partly that phenomenon that made the experience of the Urban Age conferences so compelling. It was a chance to sample in quick succession a sequence of very different urban menus. The South African leg of the programme took me to the top of the country&apos;s tallest skyscraper. Once it housed Johannesburg&apos;s only four-star hotel. It is shuttered now, trapped in the midst of a dystopia that could have been the product of JG Ballard&apos;s imagination. Nigerian squatters occupy brutalist concrete towers. Stalls selling bush meat and magic have taken over the streets. A particularly fearless band of yuppies is attempting to turn the Art Deco office blocks left behind by the gold rush years of the 1930s into city-centre lofts. When the Urban Age got to Mexico, I found myself touring illegal squatter camps in Mexico City, in the company of armed guards courtesy of the Herrhausen Society, not so surprising, perhaps, since it was established by Deutsche Bank in memory of a chairman assassinated by terrorists. These settlements are called informal, yet they are planned with remarkable precision. A whole community from the rural south of the country arrives in a single co-ordinated movement to establish an instant suburb. Mexico is a place in which globalisation works in unexpected ways. While America might be worrying about losing car plant jobs to Mexico, the street traders who crowd the heart of Mexico City are the tip of another global supply chain. The T-shirts and the plastic flip-flops they sell are from China. In Berlin, Angela Merkel talked about the challenge that migration poses to the big cities, while Lord Foster discussed designing a symbol for the capital of a reunited Germany in the form of the Reichstag, and Berlin&apos;s mayor offered a model for the future of his city as &apos;poor but sexy&apos;. In Shanghai, the city had been hit by a rash of graffiti. There had been nothing like it on my first visit in the early 1990s, when the main road into the city was a two-lane blacktop. Now it&apos;s an eight-lane highway, amid a forest of skyscrapers. It turns out that the ubiquitous sequences of spray-painted numbers, with the occasional Chinese character thrown in, have nothing to do with tagging or politics - they are mobile phone numbers of migrants looking for work. In the turmoil that is modern China, it&apos;s the only way to show they are available for hire. It is chastening, but valuable for a critic to be confronted with how little you really know. Before the Urban Age conference in Shanghai, I hadn&apos;t understood that the city has three million illegal immigrants from inland China with fewer rights than Mexicans in Los Angeles, or that the city had levels of inequality of an order close to Manhattan&apos;s. In the context of a state based on an ideology-free version of Marxism, it&apos;s hard to know if that is to be understood as a success or a failure. I knew that huge areas of the city centre had been bulldozed, but I had not understood that this relentless tide of construction had doubled the living space, which is still far from generous, of its most crowded inhabitants. I knew that Johannesburg was a city shaped by apartheid, but I hadn&apos;t understood what it would mean to try to deal not just with social inequalities, but structural ones too. Johannesburg was built as a white city surrounded not by suburbs but by invisible black labour camps. It&apos;s not enough to open the city to the majority; the edges are still hugely dispossessed. I could not have imagined what it is like for the city&apos;s transport officials to work on its suburban rail system until I heard at first hand of the effects of a security-guard strike that involved scores of murders. Six dead bodies were found on one particularly bloody day. The Urban Age did make me understand exactly how the Victorians felt about the city, and how threatening a place it seemed to them. It also forced me to think not just as a critic, but to look at things from the point of view of a politician. What is to be done about the city? It&apos;s clear that every city is in desperate need of answers, and that events like the Urban Age act like hot spots for the transmission of avian flu. Ideas spread from them like epidemics. Culture-led renewal, congestion charging, elected mayors have all been strategies for the future of cities that have ricocheted around the world. What may be surprising is that, for once, many of these ideas are coming from London. Ken Livingstone&apos;s electorate may be focusing on allegations of misdemeanours at City Hall, but in New York and Barcelona, they are taking his policies on planning, transport and housing with the utmost seriousness. Nobody knows what effect his insistence on making the builders of luxury flats include a percentage of affordable housing will have on land prices in the long term, but it looks like an experiment worth trying. We do not belong to a generation that has the shared faith that the pioneer architectural modernists had when they chartered a liner to cruise the Mediterranean and drew up their vision of what the modern city ought to be, the Charter of Athens (1933). They divided their ideal city into functional zones, shaped by slabs arranged to maximise the sunlight falling on the ground between them. Theirs was a generation that was freed from the luxury of self-doubt. Ours is not and that is why we struggle now when we try to think what cities should be. We have seen too many soured urban utopias that were invented by the architects on that liner, and propagated by a political system that measured success in the number of new buildings that it could deliver each month. Politicians love cranes; they need solutions within the time frames of elections and cranes deliver them. But there are only a limited number of problems that are susceptible to this kind of time scale. The result is a constant cycle of demolition and reconstruction that is seen as the substitute for thinking about how to address the deeper issues of the city. Visions for cities tend to be the creation of the boosters rather than the theorists or the policy-makers. City builders have always had to be pathological optimists, if not out-and-out fantasists. They belong to a tradition that connects the map-makers who parcel up packages of swamp land to sell to gullible purchasers, and the show-apartment builders who sell off-plan to investors in Shanghai, who are banking on a rising market, making them a paper profit before they have even had to make good on their deposits. Cities are made by an extraordinary mixture of do-gooders and bloody-minded obsessives, of cynical political operators and speculators. They are shaped by the unintended consequences of the greedy and the self-interested, the dedicated and the occasional visionary. The cities that work best are those that keep their options open, that allow the possibility of change. The ones that are stuck, overwhelmed by rigid, state-owned social housing, or by economic systems that offer the poor no way out of the slums are in trouble. A successful city is one that makes room for surprises. A city that has been trapped by too much gentrification, or too many shopping malls, will have trouble generating the spark that is essential to making a city that works. The pattern of the Victorian terraces of London has proved to be remarkably adaptable. A four-storey house 18ft wide can be used for almost anything and it supports a population dense enough for pedestrian life on the pavement that makes cafes and small shops flourish; a system-built tower block marooned in Tarmac is not so adaptable. Similarly, giant out-of-town sheds, the predominant form of so many new cities now, are not designed for flexible use or even for the long term. They are built with a maximum of 20 years of life in mind and then trashed. Successful cities are the ones that allow people to be what they want; unsuccessful ones try to force them to be what others want them to be. A city of freeways like Houston or Los Angeles forces people to be car drivers or else traps them in poverty. A successful city has a public transport system that is easy to use; an unsuccessful city tries to ban cars. Later this year the Urban Age programme moves to Sao Paolo, shifting its focus from the bigger picture to the fine grain of life in a city in which the rich commute by helicopter, the prisons are a state within a state, and in which the mayor is able to ban outdoor street advertising overnight in a bid to beautify his city. A successful city has room for more than the obvious ideas about city life, because, in the end, a city is about the unexpected, it&apos;s about a life shared with strangers and open to new ideas. An unsuccessful city has closed its mind to the future.

It's the brand new face of China", "article": "China Design Now V&amp;A, London SW7, from Saturday until 13 July Twenty years ago, China did not have a word for &apos;designer&apos;. There were &apos;artist workers&apos; who fashioned utilitarian packaging, and makers of propaganda posters for the government, but design as an idea in itself was un-Chinese, bourgeois. After Deng Ziaoping declared that &apos;to get rich is glorious&apos; and China began to open its markets to the world in 1992, there was, therefore, a great deal of catching up to be done. The exponential trajectory of this catching up is the subject of China Design Now at the V&amp;A. The project was conceived four years ago, but since four years in the current Chinese economy is the equivalent of four decades anywhere else, its challenge has been to try to capture exactly the &apos;now&apos; of the current Chinese moment. It does so with stylish clarity. The exhibition is organised around the three cities that have shaped China&apos;s emergence into the world. Shenzhen, the &apos;economic zone&apos; that opened China up to the West, with its day-tripping shoppers and pioneering businessmen from Hong Kong; Shanghai, the perennial style capital of the country, one of the fastest growing cities on earth; and Beijing, the powerhouse, which has reimagined itself through a vast building programme (China currently uses nearly two-thirds of the world&apos;s concrete and more than a third of the world&apos;s steel). Like all stories of towering ambition this one has quite humble foundations. In the late Eighties two young colleagues working at the Guangdong Provincial Packaging Company, sensing that China needed a new graphic language to explain itself to the world, set up the nation&apos;s first design consultancy in Shenzhen. Wang Xu and Wang Yuefei gathered other designers around them and set about thinking of China as a brand. Their early efforts, collected here, tend to play with calligraphy and traditional Chinese symbolism - porcelain fragments and chicken&apos;s feet - looking for the new spirit in old characters. In recent years this studious graphic language has given way to a more homemade visual vernacular which is captured here in the fliers and packaging of the new urban youth culture, with its hip-hop caricatures and slightly naive appropriation of European pop trends. These younger designers, influenced by Japanese Manga cartoons, universal graffiti styles and Britpop, are in search of that most intangible of all Western inventions, &apos;ku&apos; (&apos;cool&apos;). They are led by the so-called &apos;Eighties generation&apos; of artists and writers, such as the iconoclast novelist Han Han, and are the stuff of fantasy for the marketing departments of global corporations. There are Nike trainers that play with Chinese style - limited editions for the Year of the Dog and so on - and skateboards decorated with ironic Maoist slogans. What is clear from this display is that the emergence of design in China is inseparable from the emergence of the self-conscious, brand-aware individual. Nowhere is this felt more keenly than in Shanghai. The mass migration of Chinese to cities - over 100 million people in the last decade - and the rise of a wealthy elite and a growing middle class finds its most dramatic expression in the nation&apos;s consumer capital. In the Sixties, Chinese aspiration stretched not much further than ownership of &apos;The Four Great Things&apos;, a bike, a radio, a sewing machine and a watch. These days, the Four Great Things are a house, a car - preferably a BMW - a mobile phone and the internet. In a recent survey two-thirds of young Shanghainese were said to be active bloggers. While exporting almost everything under the sun, the Chinese have done their bit for the balance of trade by importing the three pillars of Western consumerism: fashion, celebrity and the world of interiors. Chinese homes, recreated here in photograph and model, ape the international style, stainless steel kitchens and claw-footed bathrooms, but always with a parochial twist, a discreet lantern or a nod to the opulent boudoir style (itself an appropriation from the French) of Twenties Shanghai. Fashion trends have been set in motion by iconic Chinese films such as Wong Kar-Wai&apos;s In the Mood for Love. Chinese celebrities, led by Zhang Ziyi, the star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Chinese face of Garnier and Maybelline, occupy the public spaces that Chairman Mao used to dominate. The politics of all this is muted but insistent; Super Girl, the Chinese version of Pop Idol, pretty much single-handedly destroyed the state monopoly of television output. The Party&apos;s response to this dismantling of traditional power structures has been to create new symbols of Chinese confidence. In many cases these symbols have been imported from the West. Beijing&apos;s three iconic architectural projects - expertly visualised here - all originated in Europe. Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch maverick, has created a new China TV building which does not so much defy gravity as make Newton look a nonsense; Norman Foster&apos;s dragon-inspired airport, which opened last month, features a terminal building nearly two miles long; and Swiss-based Herzog and de Meuron&apos;s Olympic stadium is an inspired and witty bird&apos;s nest of steel. I wandered round these three vast buildings, in various states of readiness, last summer, and was struck by the unavoidable contingencies of China&apos;s rapid growth. It took 50,000 men to construct the airport, and armies of them were at work with ancient shovels and wheelbarrows when I visited - it was like watching the pyramids being built. I t looked too like a metaphor: countless men stuck in the old China, toiling resolutely to complete the shiny design of the new. \u00b7 China Design Now opens at the V&amp;A on Saturday and showcases Chinese fashion, lifestyle, graphics, architecture and design.

It has occupied them so much Ferrari must have the whip hand this year. And you wonder for how long Dennis will remain at the helm. The 780-page dossier they need No comment.

How outsiders view them McLaren have always been a bit too clever by half, but this time they sailed too close to the wind and got caught. Serves them right.

The boss In 2006, as part of his sponsorship deal with Johnnie Walker, Dennis created a one-off whisky blend which was sealed in a diamond encrusted bottle and auctioned in Shanghai.

This race in one of Asia&apos;s most vibrant and cosmopolitan cities is emblematic of Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s relentless determination to make formula one bigger, brighter, more prestigious and more exclusive than any other sporting spectacle on earth. Even by the standards of some of the greatest and longest-established races on the calendar Singapore promises to be a high octane experience with a mood and ambience to match European classic events such as Monte Carlo and Monza. Before the 1970s races outside Europe had intermittently ducked in and out of the championship schedule. This year half of the season&apos;s 18 races will take place outside Europe. With South Korea, Abu Dhabi and India all queuing to join the party the financial pressure is steadily increasing on bedrock &quot;establishment&quot; races such as the British and French grands prix to keep pace with this frantic spending spree. This is just how Ecclestone likes it. His formula one management group takes a 53% share of the sport&apos;s commercial rights revenue, which includes the race promotion fee estimated to be as much as $25m a year from some of the newest events on the calendar, almost $10m more than that generated by the older races in Europe. Races outside Europe had only been occasionally included on the schedule in the decade following the inauguration of the official world championship in 1950. Argentina staged its first race in 1953 on the back of Juan Manuel Fangio&apos;s emergence as the country&apos;s most famous international sportsman. From 1950-59 the Indianapolis 500, the prestigious oval track race which was the highlight of the US calendar, was also included as a qualifying round of the world championship. The fact that there was almost no interchange of competitors between this event and the main body of the formula one contest was neither here nor there. This strange state of affairs ended in 1959 when the first proper US grand prix took place at the Sebring Aerodrome circuit in Florida. The US grand prix became firmly established on the championship schedule in the 1960s. It took place at California&apos;s Riverside Circuit in 1960 and then moved to the Watkins Glen track amid the spectacular pine forests of upstate New York, where it remained from 1961 until 1980. Yet it was the development of a street race through Long Beach in California that proved the most significant illustration that there were like-minded entrepreneurs in the US who shared Ecclestone&apos;s commercial edge. The race was the brainchild of Chris Pook, an expatriate British travel agent who could see the potential to change the southern Californian city&apos;s dowdy image as a retirement haven. The race was a huge success from 1976 until 1983, when Pook concluded that Bernie&apos;s tab had become too costly and he switched to running a Champ Car event. Brazil joined the championship schedule in 1973, Emerson Fittipaldi winning the inaugural race at the wheel of a Lotus. Brazil had their own Chris Pook in the form of the charismatic Antonio Scavone, who laid the foundations for Sao Paulo by staging a series of winter events for formula two cars at various Brazilian circuits over the previous couple of years. Scavone lived just long enough to see his dream of a world championship race at Interlagos come true in 1973. Later that year he was among more than 100 passengers who perished when a Varig Boeing 707 crashed on the approach to Orly airport near Paris. In the decade that followed the formula one circus pitched camp behind the iron curtain for the first time with the advent of the Hungarian grand prix at Budapest in 1986. The Chinese grand prix was introduced at Shanghai in 2004 and the inaugural Turkish race on the Asian side of the Bosphorus a year later. Ecclestone is still driving formula one relentlessly, foot hard to the throttle, and at 77 years old remains determined to cram the calendar with more than 20 races on the basis that there is already too much testing. He feels that the effort and expenditure required to thrash round empty circuits in the middle of winter chasing fractions of a second in lap times would be better spent generating more revenue by adding extra races to the schedule. In the meantime the British sporting calendar would not be complete without Ecclestone warning the owners of Silverstone that they will lose their race after 2009 unless the circuit is suitably upgraded for the future. With new races in Valencia and Singapore signed up for this year and Abu Dhabi waiting in the wings Ecclestone is demanding improvement to the pits and paddock before any contract extension will be granted. Asked what would happen if Silverstone&apos;s owners, the British Racing Drivers&apos; Club, failed to meet his requirement he replied crisply: &quot;We won&apos;t be here. They have known for five or six years exactly what we want.&quot; The investment in Singapore&apos;s new circuit proves exactly what he is talking about.

The reality Well, thanks to McLaren&apos;s exclusion last year, BMW Sauber were elevated to second in the final rankings behind Ferrari.

It was the closest they got to a race win all year. How outsiders view them They are closing the gap, but not as quickly as hoped. Their 2008 car suffers from a worrying handling imbalance and their drivers aren&apos;t quite good enough. Perhaps not even quite good enough for a not-quite-good-enough car. Oh dear. Our mole says We have every confidence in Robert and Nick Heidfeld. The fact their contracts expire at the end of 2008 when Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button become available, and no new deal has been offered, is neither here nor there. Spending money About \u00a3161m in sponsorship from blue-chip companies such as Credit Suisse and Petronas, plus technical input from BMW&apos;s mainstream car resources. And BMW can always top up the budget with the proceeds of selling executive sedans to blinged-up wideboys. The boss Theissen gambled his career on the belief that BMW could do a better job running its own team rather than simply being an engine supplier for Williams. A keen skier, he once blotted his copybook by crashing a priceless BMW 507 sports car on the Mille Miglia. What to say about the car &quot;Promising in winter testing although front-end handling problems slowed them initially. Signs are this has been addressed.&quot; What not to say about the car &quot;How much extra for real-wood trim, sat nav, CD changer and 600W bass tube?&quot; Best friends or bust-up? They don&apos;t care. Heidfeld, 73, is too busy trying to consolidate his fading reputation as a bright young thing, while Kubica just wants to be the first Pole on pole.

It is the first &quot;serious music&quot; I have experienced in China and it is on the hotel TV, airing on what I was assured was the classical music channel. It gave me an early indication of the complexity of nailing just what the term &quot;serious music&quot; means in China. The Amadeus string quartet it isn&apos;t. Holed up for a week in a cheap hotel on the edge of the Forbidden City, close to Tiananmen Square, I am in Beijing to explore classical music in the Chinese capital and beyond. Near by is the Grand Theatre, aka the new National Centre for the Performing Arts, a vast egg-shaped structure containing an opera stage, a concert hall, a theatre - and some public spaces that make the Vatican feel claustrophobic. It is a good time to be here. The New York Philharmonic is in town, and the Shanghai Opera is performing Otello at the Grand. But I&apos;m also here to seek out China&apos;s indigenous traditions: the music of the villages, the opera derived from the imperial court, as well as the propaganda-laden &quot;model&quot; operas about heroic peasants, written in the mid-1960s, during the Cultural Revolution, and good enough to have survived beyond that grisly period. China has such a rich musical heritage of its own - why does it even need Beethoven and Brahms? The grand fromage, or perhaps mega dumpling, of classical music in China is Yu Long, artistic director of both the China Philharmonic and the Guangzhou Symphony, as well as founder of the Beijing Music Festival. This confident, pinstriped, Shanghai-born grandson of a composer is both artist and bureaucrat, proudly proclaiming China&apos;s potential as a classical music powerhouse - even if, after graduating from the Shanghai Conservatory, he himself studied in Berlin and built a career in Europe. &quot;Everybody laughed when I came back to China,&quot; he tells me when we meet at the festival&apos;s smart Beijing offices. &quot;Nobody believed China could be an important country for classical music. But I had an instinct.&quot; It paid off: the festival is now in its 10th year, a glittering collision of western artists and Chinese money. What&apos;s more, the China Phil has just signed a deal with Decca, all of which has made Yu the public face of western classical music in China, along with the pianist Lang Lang and the composer Tan Dun. Curtis Price, principal of the Royal Academy in London, even believes China will be the &quot;salvation&quot; of classical music, taking up the slack as its audience declines in the west. Lorin Maazel - music director of the New York Phil, which I saw perform in Beijing for an outrageous $234 (\u00a3120) - agrees. &quot;I think the Chinese people, who have shown their passion and high sense of aesthetics, are an ideal spawning ground for burgeoning interest in classical music,&quot; he said while in the capital. &quot;It could be that one of the most important defenders of classical music will be China.&quot; Can this really be? Have I arrived to find China on the cusp of a golden age for classical music? Such talk is disputed by music critic Liu Xuefeng, who - over a superb late-night Peking duck in a teahouse - argues that, in the 1980s, there was a post-Cultural Revolution upsurge of interest in western classical music, but it has now waned. &quot;Then, we had an audience but few musicians,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, we have musicians but no audience.&quot; Events such as the festival, he maintains, are built on shallow foundations: audiences enjoy big, romantic repertoire, gala events, Lang Lang&apos;s emphatic (some say overblown) style, but they are not being educated to appreciate music in the round. China has no chamber orchestras; you will not hear a piano trio or string quartet outside the music conservatories; with the exception of Shanghai, opera is moribund. Liu explains how localised western music is in China, concentrated as it is in the big cities. In this vast country, only 30 orchestras give more than 10 performances a year. And, says Liu, most of the provincial outfits &quot;would make you want to commit suicide&quot;, so low is the standard. Even the top orchestras, in Beijing and Shanghai, have a long way to go before they can compete with those in the west. One hopeful sign, adds Liu, is that most provincial cities are building new concert halls, part of China&apos;s current construction mania fuelled by economic growth. Someone will have to perform in them, and Liu hopes this will lead to a new generation of orchestras. The other key development is the mass production of musicians in China: a staggering 20 million youngsters are said to be learning the piano, 10 million the violin, and the conservatories are bulging. The new multi-storey Central Conservatory building in Beijing will house no fewer than five recital halls. This, surely, is the future - the source of the salvation Curtis Price talks about. Perhaps. But a visit to former army accordion-player Jiang Jie&apos;s central piano school (he has 14 others in Beijing, with 30,000 pupils) made me doubt the value of the numbers game. There, in rooms arranged around a spiral staircase, children aged six to 18 were rehearsing, many overseen by eager parents. I asked one youngster to play a piece for me. &quot;Some Chopin?&quot; I suggested, but he insisted on Liszt. It was showy, bashed-out virtuosity, not too accurate, though impressive in its sweaty energy. Musical education in China seems to be about passing exams, becoming a virtuoso, and getting to a music school so you can earn lots of money by taking private pupils. It is musical pyramid-selling. Lured by cash incentives and teaching jobs, many of China&apos;s leading classical musicians have come back to their newly affluent country in the past 10 years. I talked to five, and what struck me was how little they were now performing. Xue Wei (violin), Su Zhen (viola), and Song Yi (double bass) are all professors at that Central Conservatory powerhouse. Dai Yuqiang (tenor) is teaching, but also taking part in lucrative galas. Lu Siqing (violin) is, for his part, performing regularly: on my first day in China, I heard him give an abridged version of the ubiquitous Butterfly Lovers concerto - a Tchaikovsky-like Chinese staple written in 1959 - at a concert in the Forbidden City. China&apos;s top musicians are earning a good living, clearly, but in what appears to be an undemanding environment. As well as the Butterfly Lovers, that afternoon&apos;s concert by the Beijing Symphony featured folk songs, arias from a model opera and two pieces composed for the Olympics. In the second of these, called Hurrah for the Olympics, singers dressed in the traditional costumes of China&apos;s 55 ethnic minority groups came on stage and made a truly dreadful wailing sound. The audience&apos;s response was distinctly underwhelming; the earlier folk songs and model opera pieces were much more to their liking. Many mouthed the words to the songs. Later, at the Shanghai Opera&apos;s Otello - a traditional, stand-and-deliver production in which Iago hammed it up for all he&apos;s worth - the audience were far less involved, drifting in and out during the performance and offering only tepid applause. The all-Chinese cast did their damnedest - Ma Mei was outstanding as Desdemona - but the audience, mainly Chinese but with a smattering of westerners, just didn&apos;t get it. I heard one American voice complaining that the surtitles were in Chinese. Well, this is China. The country has produced many fine singers. Its conservatories are churning out many more. Yet the infrastructure for western opera is almost non-existent. Partly, this is because of the dominance of China&apos;s own operatic tradition. The evening after Otello, I go to the Meilanfang theatre, the ravishing new home of the Peking Opera, with lovely polished floors that an elderly man sitting near me keeps spitting on. It&apos;s packed - and the audience bravos throughout the double bill. First comes a martial piece about a power-crazed warlord brought down by a sort of Chinese Robin Hood; it is followed by a lyrical tale about a newly married woman dreaming of the husband who has gone off to war. The star is Zhang Huoding. Graceful, petite and adored, she is the Angela Gheorghiu of Peking Opera. Her voice is like that of a soprano, but the sound comes from the throat not the chest, and the arias are filled with guttural trills. It is extraordinary, utterly unlike anything in the west - and you could say the same about the audience. After each trill, they roar their approval, making each song a delightfully collective affair. It is almost as if Zhang, with her arms slashing about in the billowing sleeves of her kimono, is conducting the audience. At the end, 50 or so young men with cameras rush up to applaud Zhang and shower her with flowers. The poor cast of Otello, who had been reduced to ostentatiously applauding each other, would love to get a 10th of this acclamation. During the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao&apos;s shock troops rejected both &quot;bourgeois&quot; western music and what they considered feudal Chinese music, producing instead eight &quot;model&quot; operas that fused the stage techniques of Peking Opera with rousing symphonic music. Over dinner one evening, conductor Hu Bingxu recalls those days for me. Hu was an oboist with the Central Orchestra in Beijing when the Cultural Revolution began. Unlike many of his colleagues, he survived the purge of intellectuals. Catapulted into the role of chief conductor, he was given three days&apos; notice to prepare the first of the eight operas. He went on to work on two others, managing to sustain a high-profile career after Mao&apos;s death. As with many other musicians of his generation, the Cultural Revolution defined Hu&apos;s career. He gives little away about how grim the period was, but at one point in the evening his wife becomes agitated, insisting he explain how depressed he had been and how painful it is to recall. It is a sobering moment. Later, I meet Ye Xiaogang, one of China&apos;s leading composers, who says his father, also a composer, attempted suicide during the Cultural Revolution. Ye, 50 years old and wearing a black leather jacket, is the artistic director of the Beijing Modern Music festival. Four decades on, he says, the country and its artists are still coming to terms with the trauma of the Cultural Revolution. He calls it a giant fault line, ripping through China&apos;s musical life. The growth of classical music in China, its sonic brilliance and attraction to sponsors cultivating western links, has posed a challenge for players of traditional instruments. For them, earning a living, let alone building a recording career, can be a struggle. The problem is that their instruments - the guqin and zheng (types of zither), the pipa (lute) and the erhu (a two-stringed Chinese violin with a wonderful, unearthly sound beloved of buskers, who often pretend to be blind) - were not designed for the concert hall. Bigger ensembles just do not suit them; they are better played singly or in small groups, where the delicate solo passages can breathe. Large groups have been assembled, serried ranks of erhu and pipa players, all performing as if their lives depended on it. But the results, says the China Phil&apos;s Yu Long, were a disaster. To survive, he insists, traditional Chinese music has to be true to itself. Some players of traditional instruments now graft a pop beat on to their work, in a bid to expand their audience. The 12 Girls Band - a sort of Chinese version of the bikini-wearing British quartet Bond - are hugely popular. I bought several of their CDs, and can recommend their seasonal selection, Merry Christmas to You, with its heroically awful Santa Claus Comin [sic] to Town. More satisfying is a new work called Sound of China by the brilliant pipa player Zhao Cong, who plays traditional and more populist material with electronic backing. I doubted whether traditional Chinese instruments could survive the ubiquity of pop, but 10 minutes of her remarkable playing and performance style (pipa players seem to become their instrument as they play) convinced me it had a future. Don&apos;t go home without meeting a guqin player, I had been advised. The emperor of Chinese instruments, the guqin is a seven-string zither with a 3,000-year pedigree. It is associated with courtly poets and philosophers, including Confucius, but my guqin player, Wu Na, is a distinctly modern incarnation. We meet in Starbucks, where she tells me that all her energy is currently being put into jazz improvisation. On her demo disc, it sounds as if she is being accompanied by dripping taps. One day, she says, she will return to traditional guqin-playing. &quot;When?&quot; I ask. &quot;When I&apos;m about 50.&quot; In the belief that true Chinese music must lie in its villages, one morning I take a bus to Qian Juntang. About 50km from the capital, this small mining village is holding its annual festival, to celebrate its fraternal relations with another village, Zhuang Hu, further down the hill. Each village processes towards the other, brandishing flags and banners, dancing, beating drums, clanging cymbals and playing flutes. The sound is grotesque, but you can&apos;t help noticing elements of Peking Opera - in the elaborate makeup and costumes, in the raucous, percussive energy of the bands. When the two processions meet, candles are burned, firecrackers explode and a variety of deities are thanked as a hymn-like song is sung. It is all very moving, in a chaotic sort of way. Two film-makers, who have come from Beijing to capture it, tell me this sort of traditional festival is in danger of dying out, as young villagers haemorrhage to the towns. What does it all add up to? Classical music in China - despite the mass production of musicians, the vitality of &quot;high-end&quot; music-making in Beijing and the phenomenon that is Lang Lang - is still in its infancy. It has yet to truly enter the bloodstream: it feels thinly spread, sponsor-dependent, in some ways misdirected. Every music student wants to be a superstar soloist, another Lang Lang; established artists are happy to be teachers or showbizzy gala stars. China needs opera houses and touring companies (the country produces plenty of singers but they have to go to the west to work), chamber orchestras, recitals. China may yet be the salvation of western art music, but it will take several generations. More interesting is the question of what happens to traditional music. The Peking Opera may have been buoyant on the evening I went, but the government is worried about its future as pop-mad youngsters look elsewhere, and has just made it a compulsory part of music education in schools. But can the state keep Peking Opera and other regional musical forms alive? Should it even try? The Chinese, practical people, are not interested in museum pieces: adaptation and absorption are the touchstones of their history. Is the village festival, with its raucous band and its painted dancers, doomed? Will players of traditional instruments manage to incorporate pop, or will they be consumed by it? Who knows - perhaps one day I will return to this big, baffling country and find the classical music channel broadcasting not some Mongolian boy-band in gold lam\u00e9 suits, but a guqin-player called Wu Na performing her extraordinary dripping-taps jazz.", "tags": ["Classical music", "China arts 2008", "Music", "China", "World news", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-10T16:50:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/11/athawinchina", "sentences": ["What will happen once the oceans begin to flood Beijing and Shanghai, as predicted in Al Gore&apos;s film An Inconvenient Truth?"], "title": "A thaw in China", "article": "A few days before the lunar new year holiday in early February, southern China was hit by the fiercest snow and ice storms in half a century. The lives of over one hundred million people in 21 provinces were thrown into chaos and about one 10th of China&apos;s forests were destroyed or damaged. According to official figures - and we can assume they underestimate the scale of the devastation - there were 129 deaths, 1.66 million people made homeless, 151 billion Yuan in losses and 15.8 million livestock killed. What made the storm into the &quot;perfect storm&quot; is that it hit at the peak travel season, as tens of millions of migrant workers were heading home for the annual new year festivities. The heart-wrenching images of nearly one million migrant workers stranded in Guangzhou&apos;s train station were beamed the world over. Much of the western reporting - prior to the Olympics, foreign journalists have been given the right to travel around the country without restrictions - focused on the possibility of social unrest and mass mobilisation against the party. It was noted that the gathering of migrant workers in Guangzhou was the largest gathering of people since the pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Such headlines as &quot;Cold Chinese grow angry over lack of preparation&quot; suggested that the Chinese government may not be able to manage the potentially explosive scenes in Guangzhou and elsewhere. Yet the government seems to have emerged relatively unscathed. At the very least, they defused the anger of the crowds without the sort of violence deployed on June 4 1989. Why the different outcomes? Needless to say, the snowstorm is a natural disaster that can&apos;t be blamed on the government. The Earth is supposed to be getting warmer, not colder, and yet southern China was hit by an almost unheard of cold spell. Perhaps the worst hit city was Chenzhou, a city of 4.6 million at the southern most tip of Hunan province that was covered in snow and ice and had no access to water, electricity, or heat for 10 days. The ice made it particularly difficult for public authorities: think of the Great Ice Storm in Montreal ten years ago in a relatively poor city twice the size. In normal times, Chenzhou is known for its vast, subtropical forests and year round temperatures of about 18 degrees celsius. Governments need to plan for emergencies, but it&apos;s hard to imagine any government not being caught offguard by such unlikely scenarios. Still, the government&apos;s reaction to such disasters can undermine its legitimacy. Chicago was hit by a huge snowstorm in January 1979, and the slow snow removal combined with the mayor&apos;s careless approach to the media is widely believed to have led to the mayor&apos;s defeat in the Feb. 27 election. The Bush administration&apos;s seemingly indifferent and incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina&apos;s devastation of New Orleans led to widespread outrage. Of course, China is different. The government is not subject to democratic accountability and the state-controlled media won&apos;t report too much bad news, especially if it implicates government officials. But authoritarian politics isn&apos;t the only reason for the lack of political payback. For one thing, the media isn&apos;t as tightly controlled as it used to be. The Hong Kong media was openly critical of the government&apos;s response to the natural disaster - blaming the railway ministry for blockage in Guangzhou and the lack of coordination for problems elsewhere - and people in Guangdong province often have access to Hong Kong TV and newspapers (even in Beijing, the South China Morning Post newspaper is sold in restaurants, hotels, and here on the Tsinghua campus). Some critical reporting also filtered through the mainstream media. And the internet was filled with horror stories that blamed weather forecasters and government officials. Perhaps the key point is the government seems to care about public opinion more than it used to: or at least, it knows how to project a caring image. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao spent the lunar new year going to various disaster sites and apologizing for the disruption caused by the winter storm (the last apology by a Chinese leader to disgruntled crowds was delivered by then premier Zhao Ziyang when he apologised to pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square shortly before he was deposed; Wen Jiabao was at Zhao&apos;s side at the time). President Hu Jintao ventured into minus-20 conditions in an underground mine to encourage miners to work through the holidays so that energy could be restored in the disaster-affected areas. Other Politburo members and lower-level government officials cancelled their own holidays to coordinate relief efforts. Over 300,000 People&apos;s Liberation Army soldiers were deployed to help deal with the disaster, including 80,000 troops sent to de-ice part of the highway that runs through Chenzhou. One million militia and reservists as well as half a million police were dispatched to key railway and highway points to maintain order and ease ten kilometre long traffic jams. As with most things in China, the numbers boggle the mind. The caring image extended to the Spring Festival Gala, the variety television show watched by about half of China&apos;s population on the eve of the lunar new year. Normally the skits are prepared and rehearsed long in advance, but this year&apos;s show featured some of China&apos;s biggest entertainment stars in a song honouring those affected by the &quot;merciless snow&quot; as well as shots of migrant workers forced to stay behind during the new year holiday (12.5 million workers in Guangdong alone). The government also took concrete measures for such workers, such as capping the prices of basic foodstuffs and subsidising new year parties for those who could not make it home. Let me conclude with two observations. It could be that government control of the media explains the lack of social unrest in response to the &quot;perfect storm&quot;. But even if the Chinese political system opens up - as I hope it will - at least two features will continue to mark it off from western-style liberal democracies. First is the need for a highly centralised state to deal with such &quot;natural&quot; catastrophes. The country&apos;s dependence on coal was manifest during the crisis, and the consequences for global warming are ominous. What will happen once the oceans begin to flood Beijing and Shanghai, as predicted in Al Gore&apos;s film An Inconvenient Truth? It&apos;s hard to imagine a response that doesn&apos;t involve massive mobilisation of manpower and resources. Half a century ago, the German thinker Karl Wittfogel argued that water control and distribution had spawned authoritarian centralised regimes and sprawling bureaucracies in China. Perhaps it&apos;s possible to combine more democratic forms of rule with highly centralised regimes. But it&apos;s an argument that needs to be made. Second is the need for the media to portray moral exemplars, appeal to people&apos;s better nature, and help to generate sympathy for the disadvantaged. The importance of moral education is perhaps the least controversial part of China&apos;s Confucian heritage (and its &quot;communist&quot; updates) and it has implications for the way for think about the role of media in Chinese society. Yes, there can and should be more independent and critical media in China that tells the truth about social problems and blames the government when it&apos;s at fault. But it doesn&apos;t follow that complete separation of media and government is the best way forward. Privatisation might just lead to titillating news reporting that diverts attention away from real problems. So the task will be to steer between an authoritarian model of media control and a free market model that doesn&apos;t take sides with anyone. The resulting model - perhaps looser constraints on private media combined with a government-funded service that has the mandate to strive not for the party&apos;s interests but for widely endorsed social values like concern for the poor and filial piety - may strike westerners as moralising and paternalistic, but there are areas of justifiable difference that need to be tolerated, if not respected.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-11T07:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/11/globaleconomy.china", "sentences": ["&quot;There&apos;s growing concern that China&apos;s inflation is getting out of control,&quot; said Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.", "But the main Shanghai index recovered to end 0.47% higher as investors took comfort in the view that bad weather and other temporary factors were behind the spike in inflation to the highest level since May 1996."], "title": "China's inflation at near-12-year high", "article": "BEIJING, March 11 (Reuters) - China&apos;s consumer price inflation jumped in February to a near-12-year high of 8.7%, handing the central bank a dilemma over whether to raise interest rates even as the economy is coming off the boil. Inflation in January was 7.1% and economists had expected a February figure of 8.0%. &quot;There&apos;s growing concern that China&apos;s inflation is getting out of control,&quot; said Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities in Shanghai. Share prices initially fell in anticipation of higher interest rates. But the main Shanghai index recovered to end 0.47% higher as investors took comfort in the view that bad weather and other temporary factors were behind the spike in inflation to the highest level since May 1996. &quot;I think it raises the odds of a hike, but the PBOC is likely to wait for at least another few weeks,&quot; Ben Simpfendorfer, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong, said. The People&apos;s Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, raised interest rates six times in 2007, but it has marked time this year even though bank deposit rates yield less than half the inflation rate. The National Bureau of Statistics blamed the surprising increase largely on the fierce winter weather and seasonal price rises due to the Lunar New Year holiday. These factors helped boost the cost of food by 23.2% from February 2007. Pork, the staple meat for most of China&apos;s 1.3bn people, cost 63.4% more than a year earlier. Vegetables were up 46% and food oil rose 41%. One silver lining was that the annual rate of non-food inflation remained tame at 1.6%, up just a touch from 1.5% in January. Still, the statistics office said it would now be harder for the government to meet its goal of holding inflation below last year&apos;s average rate of 4.8%. Xie Fuzhan, commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters inflationary pressures were still fairly high. &quot;Many countries are also experiencing rising inflation.

But while some analysts think another increase in interest rates is imminent, others believe the central bank will hold off in the short term after hiking interest rates six times and banks&apos; reserve requirements 10 times in 2007 - apparently to little avail. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, food costs rose 23.2% last month compared with February 2007; an enormous increase in a country where households spend a third of their income on food. There is also concern that inflation is spreading as expectations of further price rises develop. &quot;After so many months of big rises I&apos;m afraid now the risks are high that China will see more broad-based inflation,&quot; Chen Jijun, an analyst at CITIC Securities in Beijing, told Reuters. &quot;Though non-food inflation is only 1.6%, it has been accelerating.&quot;Monetarist explanations of the problem are gaining ground. Hong Liang and Yu Song, analysts with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, cited rapid money supply growth as the main driver of inflation, adding that they expected a modest interest rate rise. But Michael Pettis, a former banker and currently professor of finance at Peking University, said that rate hikes have already failed and - like the gradual appreciation of the yuan - may actually have exacerbated the problem. &quot;If you stick money into a Chinese bank account you get 4% interest and 8- 10% appreciation over the year. In the US you get 2%,&quot; he said. He argued that only a &quot;maxi-revaluation&quot; - abruptly raising the yuan&apos;s value by 15-20% - would halt hot money inflows. &quot;It&apos;s true it will create risks to the banking system and may hurt parts of the export system. It&apos;s a bad option, but the rest are worse,&quot; Pettis added. But Andy Rothman of CLSA in Shanghai told Reuters that monetarist explanations did not make sense because the broad M2 measure of money supply has been growing more or less in line with nominal GDP growth.", "tags": ["Economics", "China", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-11T12:36:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/mar/11/roadtrips.travelnews", "sentences": ["Elsewhere in the world, Buddha Bar is a swanky franchise, with branches in Paris, Dubai, Vienna, and a particularly popular one in, yes, Shanghai."], "title": "Buddha leaves the bus", "article": "In an age when Che Guevara&apos;s image is used to sell ice cream (Cherry Guevara Magnum) and John Lennon&apos;s All you Need is Love is spun into an ode for nappies (Procter &amp; Gamble&apos;s Luvs), you&apos;d be forgiven for thinking that nothing is sacred anymore.

Torturing Nurse is not one of them Alex Petridis, writing in today&apos;s G2, shares his experiences of China&apos;s new wave of cult rock bands, focusing on the Beijing scene in particular. It&apos;s a strange scene indeed, at once vibrant and thriving, yet strangled by the Ministry of Culture and hampered by the absence of intellectual property rights (not that many are bothered about the latter). Nearly two years ago, Reuters reported how few musicians, even the most popular, made any money out of the scene, so it&apos;s heartening to see that the predicted end has not materialised. The element of studiousness (similarly present in Japanese culture), which the Chinese call xuexi, is a fascinating one. One might naively expect this to produce diluted versions of Western imports; on the contrary, the result is a brand new thing in itself, with a definite sound of its very own. We would do well to remember that in Chinese, &quot;xuexi&quot; means &quot;to learn&quot;. &quot;To imitate&quot; and &quot;to copy&quot; have their own terms; xuexi is something very different. Have a listen to some of the bands mentioned, and let me know what you think. \u00b7 Carsick Cars Legend has it there&apos;s some graffiti in the D-22 club&apos;s toilets that says, &quot;I love my mom, I love my country and I LOVE Carsick Cars.&quot; Established in Beijing in 2005, they&apos;re a good example of xuexi at work (at play?) - they have developed a unique and attractive style based on a thorough understanding of music. It&apos;s an interesting mix of the light-hearted indie hooks punctuated with amp-busting noise. Apparently this has delightful and unpredictable results when they play live. \u00b7 Too Koo Petridis has them down as &quot;roughly approximate to Kasabian&quot;, which is a fair cop, but Too Koo have nothing of their pompous swagger, despite their name being an approximation of &quot;too cool&quot;. Occasionally, there seems to be a bit of Chinese Bloc Party in there, mixed with something I can&apos;t quite put my finger on - the &quot;derivative yet elusive&quot; aspect seems ubiquitous. No doubt everyone will recognise different flavours in there, which I find rather appealing. \u00b7 Snapline Initially a side project of Carsick Cars&apos; drummer Li Qing and bass player Levi, the D22 site describes them as &quot;not the easiest band to love&quot;. True, they&apos;re much more introspective and lo-fi than Carsick Cars, but this is a good thing - particularly if you like Tortoise. \u00b7 Joyside Any band who call their debut album Drunk is Beautiful automatically get a thumbs-up. They&apos;re a charmingly shambolic bunch, with a vintage sound - more Stooges than Libertines, and still with that odd familiar authenticity, which seems to reside primarily in Bian Yuan&apos;s vocals. Listen to his intonation in the opening to Dong Dong Dong. \u00b7 Torturing Nurse You can&apos;t actually hear much on their MySpace page, since the live videos don&apos;t quite do the sounds justice (and the page takes ages to load). You can hear some of the Shanghai noise band&apos;s tracks, including Junky Isuzu, and the verrrrry intense Pesto Nirvana over on Shasha Records. To some people it will sound like an interesting electro take on the drone/doom genre. To others it will sound like someone blowtorching a goat. If you do like it, check out their bewildering collaboration with cyberpunk author Kenji Siratori. \u00b7 New Pants I shall lead you out of the psychotic blackness of Torturing Nurse with New Pants. It&apos;s OK, really: we&apos;re back to disco-infused cutesy-pop. New Pants have been around since 1996, and were included (along with Joyside) in Susanne Messmer and George Lindt&apos;s 2005 Documentary Beijing Bubbles. I&apos;ve resisted the temptation to describe any of these bands as &quot;X crossed with Y on drug Z&quot;, but New Pants are sort of like the soundtrack to the computer game Fantasy Zone if it was written by Daft Punk and the Ramones while they were on PCP.

Ambitious skyscrapers, soaring apartment blocks, Olympian designs in central Beijing by celebrated international architects, and the unbridled kitsch of suburban estates like Thames Town, a bizarre mock-English development near Shanghai. But even while great - and likable - tracts of old Chinese cities continue to come tumbling down in the names of change and modernisation, the country&apos;s up-and-coming practices are developing intelligent new forms of specifically Chinese design, even if they do draw from the west from time to time. Whatever other glamorous projects these talented young architects are beginning to scoop up, it is mostly housing for ordinary people that concerns them - that, and a desire to change the direction of Chinese architectural development, all too often a soulless juggernaut ripping the hearts from old towns and cities. Zhu Pei is one architect at the forefront of this new wave. In his busy Beijing studio, Zhu shows me ideas for the redevelopment of one of the city&apos;s &quot;hutongs&quot;. Made up of tangling alleys brimming with workaday life, Beijing&apos;s hutongs are fast disappearing. &quot;This is the type of district most people lived in before the towerblocks arrived,&quot; says Zhu. &quot;Naturally, many people were happy to move out to new apartments because the hutongs were old, poor and often unsanitary. But the hutongs are built on a human scale and can be very beautiful. What we propose is reconstruction: adding gentle modern buildings where necessary, to improve them and make ordinary people like them again. We want the present to connect with the past - we want to perform an urban acupuncture on Chinese cities.&quot; This isn&apos;t easy. As Zhu knows, it is far easier to design ambitious new museums and sporting venues than it is to construct modest, modern homes in age-old city courtyards and alleys, especially when such sites are being hungrily eyed up by state-sponsored property developers. Educated at Tsinghua University and the University of California, Zhu - who set up Studio Zhu Pei in 2005 with architects Wu Tong - was the man behind Digital Beijing, the all-but-completed control centre for the 2008 Olympics, as well an origami-like art pavilion in Abu Dhabi that will stand alongside monuments by Zaha Hadid, Jean Nouvel and Frank Gehry. He is also working on designs for the Guggenheim Beijing and created the city&apos;s Kapok hotel, with its translucent screens and shimmering courtyards. Yet the building he lingers over, as we look through his work, is a beautifully restored single-storey merchant&apos;s house - the Cai Guo-qiang Courtyard - that stands in a Beijing hutong. The house, says Zhu, is &quot;about 200 years old. Here, we have had the budget to create a house that belongs to old Beijing - and to the modern city. But you can&apos;t do this cheaply, even though this is the way we would like the hutongs to go forward.&quot; Without ideas like this, he says, Beijing will lose its soul. There are similar concerns over at Standard Architecture, where I am talked through models, drawings and photographs of highly intelligent new townhouses by Zhang Ke, who did his masters at Harvard. These townhouses, built in terraces, boast internal courtyards and gardens, some open, others glazed. Although busy creating big art galleries and impressive hotels, Zhang is clearly very excited by the new housing Standard is developing. &quot;There is no implied style,&quot; says Zhang. &quot;They are simple, free of ornament. We have concentrated everything on what people tell us they really want.&quot; And what they want, clearly, is courtyards. &quot;The houses, although narrow, are deep,&quot; he says. &quot;You enter into high-walled entrance courtyards and then into inner courtyards that are double-height living rooms. Behind the kitchens are third - or garden - courtyards. And on top of the bedrooms, we have roof terraces.&quot; I look on with envy at these courtyards within courtyards, offering privacy, daylight and space, even on low budgets. We could be building these modern homes in Britain, instead of third-rate junk. Coming fresh to private architectural practice in China - just a few years ago, Zhang and his partners would have worked in huge state-run studios - young Chinese architects appear to have an unhindered view of what can be done, as well as a genuine love of the old Chinese towns and cities that, sadly, are being replaced by rubbish to rival our own. Wang Hui, of Limited Architecture, meets me in the cafe on the ground floor of Beijing&apos;s Today Art Museum. His studio is just down the road, in the basement of a high-rise apartment block. Glasses of hot water arrive to take off the morning chill, steaming up the architect&apos;s big. green-framed glasses. But, even in the depths of winter, Beijing is a much warmer place than Taer Qin Xinjiang, a Tibetan village some 16,000ft up in the mountains, where Wang Hui has been toiling to complete a school for the children of nomadic herders. Although modern in plan, the school is built of local materials, while the sun meets all its energy needs. This is a genuinely &quot;green&quot; building, one that Wang is proud of. &apos;It&apos;s not a money-making venture,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a four-day journey up the mountains by Jeep; it&apos;s a bit different from doing cultural projects in Beijing.&quot; For Wang, this venture is as much about giving something back to Tibet as it is a way of proving that a fresh generation of Chinese architects is as removed from the absurdist world of Thames Town, some 20 miles south of Shanghai, as it can possibly be. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, we might even look to China to see how to develop parts of our old cities, build new towns and decrease our use of energy. How can you tell that Thames Town is not in England? Well, for one thing, there&apos;s no Chinese takeaway. In fact, when I turn up at Thames Town, in the depth of a cold snap, there is nothing to eat whatsoever. Not even a Tesco Express, although don&apos;t hold your breath. A coffeeshop with a name that seems to say &quot;Costa&quot; proves to be nothing but a fa\u00e7ade. The local pub is empty and dry as old bones. It is not even fitted out. A nominally &quot;independent&quot; record shop - promising &quot;all the music style&quot;, with the words &quot;Miles Davies&quot; splashed across its windows - is as silent as a grave. The door of the parish church, a prickly, wafer-thin version of an English gothic revival parish model, is locked and bolted. Thames Town&apos;s official website describes it thus: &quot;Embraced by lush greenery and beautiful scenery, the catholic [sic] church is an exclusive living space to begin a life of happiness and bliss.&quot; Thames Town is a Chinese fantasy, a make-believe English town designed, as far as I can see, for business-class families who want either to play out a Hollywood version of life in an English town, or else rent out faux historic English homes to those for whom a comic-book, or TV-influenced, western lifestyle is the way to go. In a narrow Thames Town shopping street, a young bride and groom strike poses for a photographer. This is a daily occurrence in Thames Town. Couples, married in humdrum civic offices in Shanghai, send family and friends pictures of themselves Four Weddings and a Funeral-style, shot in Thames Town. The odd thing is that Thames Town is so quiet. Being here is like walking onto an empty film set, or waking up to find yourself one of the few people left in the world. Just where are the 8,000 people who are meant to live here? Perhaps they commute en masse to Shanghai. I ask a beaming security guard huddled in a scarlet greatcoat. He says that a third of the houses in Thames Town are lived in, while the rest are for rent. So are they empty? He smiles. OK, when does the pub open? He smiles again. We walk on, hungry and thirsty, as CCTV cameras, mounted on both sides of every street, follow us - a sudden reminder of England. I walk into what is meant to be, I think, a Belgravia-style townhouse. Inside, all is bleak concrete and exposed plumbing, with a narrow stair leading up to cramped, low-ceilinged flats. Classical proportions are clearly not the order of the day. Through low-set windows, I peer out at a townscape dotted with cartoon-like versions of red 1930s telephone kiosks and what looks to be a Scottish baronial-style provincial bank. (It turns out to be more flats.) Quite where the Thames slips into this town planning equation escapes me, although there is a canal, if not a river, by the empty pub, complete with frustrating dead-end walkways - a metaphor of sorts, perhaps, for this utterly un-English new town. Shanghai was an intensely cosmopolitan city before the communist era. Today, in the age of officially controlled ultra-capitalism, it is no stranger to fey and fanciful English-style architecture. A 30-second walk along Foochow Road, just behind the Bund (the city&apos;s famous Edwardian baroque and art deco riverfront promenade) lies the Macgregor House. Dating from 1937, this mock tudor (or &quot;joke oak&quot;) cottage was once HQ to Caldbeck Macgregor, purveyors of fine wines and spirits. It survives as a teasing riposte to the 21st-century architectural bombast of the high-rise Pudong district, across the Huangpu river. In Shanghai&apos;s Hongqiao district, you can find Victor Sassoon&apos;s house Eve, a grand mock tudor pile dating from 1933; and I have also been to Holly Heath, an endangered &quot;joke oak&quot; suburb that might as well be in Surrey. Thames Town, though, is a joke of a different nature. Commissioned as part of a new town programme initiated by Huang Ju, former secretary of the Shanghai communist party, it was designed by the international engineering practice WS Atkins, along with eight other themed foreign towns on the fringe of Shanghai. On the journey back to the city, I spotted a windmill in what must have been Dutch Town; I hope you can forgive me for not bothering with Swedish Town, Spanish Town, Italian Town, US Town, Australia-New Zealand Town, German Town, complete with a Volkswagen factory and architecture by one Albert Speer Jr. There was even a Chinese Town. Somewhere not far over the horizon, though, a new school of Chinese architecture is emerging - one that is seeking to connect genuine traditions with the needs and desires of the future \u00b7 The work of young Chinese architects and designers features in China Design Now, at the V&amp;A, London, from Saturday to July 13.

Kids daub flowers on the brickwork. Artists sketch portraits on the door frames. Someone - perhaps a tourist gatecrasher, perhaps a famous painter - scrawls &quot;poo&quot; across the toilet seat. The crowds, colours and fumes thicken, and the Yanjing beer flows freely. This &quot;defacing party&quot; at the Red T Space in the contemporary art district of Dashanzi comes two weeks after a demolition notice, and several days before the wrecking ball. By the time you read this, the gallery will be a pile of gorgeously painted rubble. And in six months - just in time for the Olympic crowds - the space will be occupied by a six-storey car park. Other small galleries in Dashanzi will also be bulldozed this week, along with a theatre established by one of the first artists to move into the old industrial park. As these small, individually run spaces go down, giant structures are being erected for international art foundations and museums. It is the end of another era in Dashanzi, which - for better or worse - has come to represent the giddying rate of change in what has become the world&apos;s hottest contemporary art market. Six years ago, this dusty warren of smoke stacks, cavernous factories and brick workshops was barely known outside Beijing. The first artist, Huang Rui, moved in in 2002, rapidly followed by dozens of others attracted by the airy Bauhaus architecture and cheap rent. Like much of the avant-garde scene in those days, it was semi-legal, edgy, vibrant and constantly threatened by demolition. But now Dashanzi - also known as Factory 798 after one of its biggest workshops - has government backing, and big money is moving in. Last November, the Ullens Centre for Contemporary Art launched a multi-million dollar complex in Dashanzi by flying in dozens of international VIP guests for a caviar and champagne party. Next door, construction workers are putting the roof on a $15m (\u00a37.5m) space financed by the Iberian Centre of Contemporary Art and other foreign institutions. The art district has become a thriving institution, but its commercial success has come at a cost. Formerly quiet alleys now throng with tourists and traffic, and most of the old workshops are now terrace cafes, boutiques and trinket shops. Sharply rising rents and tighter government controls have driven out many founding artists. Small studios have been replaced by big galleries - a sign, say critics, that commerce has supplanted creativity. &quot;Dashanzi has lost its soul,&quot; says Tamsin Roberts, the British owner of the Red T Space. Many Chinese artists and foreign curators would agree with Roberts; but, while they scorn the commercialisation of the area, those who have stayed welcome the crowds it draws to their work and galleries. &quot;Dashanzi used to be a place we wanted to be a part of,&quot; says Hu Ge, a member of the Woza collective of young, experimental media artists. &quot;Now it is something we want to rebel against. During the past year, the meaning of art here has changed. Many artists are now commercial. We want to move away from that, to develop something new.&quot; Woza&apos;s current exhibition, at the Beijing Tokyo Art Projects in Dashanzi, certainly rips visitors from their comfort zone. Against a backdrop of screeching, clanking noise, a series of works invokes feelings of worry and stress. On one wall are 43 open windows on a giant computer screen. On another is a giant photograph of a soldier abseiling into a desert landscape. A pair of TV screens show soothing, rolling waves next to a fit-inducing strobe of red, purple and blue. Cages and pipes litter the floor. Scaffolding holds up a squid-like rocket with cable tentacles. You step out of this exhibition feeling relief - and sympathy for the poor security guard who has to experience the sensory disruption for hours on end. The studio next door used to be the home of Huang Rui, who was effectively driven out of the space last year by the Seven Star group, which manages Dashanzi. This could have been because of his politically provocative work; more likely it was a display of power. As the founder of the artists&apos; community here, Huang was a rival source of authority in an increasingly lucrative community. Considering his displacement, Huang is remarkably even-handed about what is happening to the district and to Beijing&apos;s art world. Chinese artists, he believes, are enjoying a golden age - though it could be short-lived if the trend for commercialisation continues. &quot;The power of artists is stronger than before,&quot; he says. &quot;Compared to the late Qing dynasty, or any time in the past 50 years, we have more freedom and social status. In the past, the only secure artists were those who worked for the government, painting propaganda pictures, but they were not independent. Now artists enjoy more freedom of expression. They can exhibit their work in public. They can participate in commerce, advertising and the media. This was unimaginable before.&quot; Huang blazed a trail after the Cultural Revolution by forming China&apos;s first independent artists&apos; group, the Stars, which embraced many ideas from beyond China. But he believes the current flood of foreign investment is a mixed blessing. &quot;There are more galleries, and more Chinese works are being exhibited and sold in auctions. But because of the market, the power, wit, individuality and freedom of Chinese artists is being submerged in the commercial sea. The creation of art has become the production of goods.&quot; Wandering through Dashanzi, it is easy to see what he means. Dozens of new galleries have opened up over the past couple of years, but it has become harder to find original work. Most of the exhibitions feebly echo the big-selling artists, or revisit familiar icons, such as the Cultural Revolution, Mao, migrants and grinning faces. But even if the poster peddlers have pushed out the picture painters, visitors are increasing. It is great for tourism. You could argue that even bad contemporary art is interesting because the usual subject matter - China&apos;s spectacular modern history - is so compelling. Certainly, international buyers cannot seem to get enough of it. Last year, three Chinese artists - Zhang Xiaogang, Yue Minjun and Zeng Fanzhi - made the global top 10 bestsellers at auction houses. And although the spectacular rise in prices has slowed, strong domestic demand has kept the trend upwards. According to the Artron.net research company, $3.3bn worth of Chinese art was sold at public auction worldwide in 2007 - a 29.1% rise on the previous year. Eric Chang Ting-Yuen, senior vice-president of Christie&apos;s in Hong Kong, says the market for Chinese contemporary art has soared in the past seven years. Last year, sales of Asian works at his auction house rose from HK$49m (\u00a33.1m) to $74m (\u00a34.7m). A few years ago, interest was almost exclusively the preserve of foreigners, but a recent report by Hurun - which compiles annual lists of China&apos;s wealthiest people - revealed that collecting contemporary art had become the leading hobby among the country&apos;s new rich. Brian Wallace, an Australian who founded China&apos;s first contemporary art space, the Red Gate gallery in Beijing, estimates that 30% of buyers are now Chinese, compared to almost none three years ago. He expects the bubble to continue expanding for at least two years. &quot;From our perspective, things are getting better and better,&quot; he says, despite what he describes as a loss of creativity. &quot;Prices are still going up, led by the big auction houses at the top end. Many artists are sold again and again. Quality work is much harder to get. Some artists, even a few of the big names, are cranking work out with the help of assistants. They are flooding the market. When there is a correction, these will lose value the quickest.&quot; For the moment, buyers interested primarily in investment are opting for established names and styles. As long as it is Chinese, contemporary and famous, the assumption is that it will rise in value. If creativity is not what it was, there have been gains in other areas of the art world. The professionalism of exhibitors is improving rapidly as foreign money and expertise bring galleries, museums and catalogues closer to global standards. Rather than ruin the art scene, this might ultimately allow Dashanzi - and China - to become a serious international player, say supporters of the transformation. &quot;The problem is not money, but how it is used,&quot; says Colin Chinnery, the British chief curator of Ullens. &quot;If it is just to create a commercial zone with cafes, restaurants and galleries, then Dashanzi will lose the plot. But if there are also serious organisations that put art first, then it will keep its gravitas.&quot; Commercialisation has brought opportunities, according to artist Zhang Xiaogang, who has more reason than most to be upbeat about the flood of money. In 2006, a piece from Zhang&apos;s Bloodline series of Cultural Revolution portraits was the first work of Chinese contemporary art to fetch more than $1m on the market. It was bought by Charles Saatchi, whose rapidly expanding collection of Chinese works has helped up the value of pieces by Zeng Fanzhi, Yue Minjun, Wang Guangyi and others he collects. Saatchi will open his new gallery in Chelsea with an exhibition of Chinese art this spring. &quot;Very few of us in the west know much about the new Chinese art,&quot; he says. &quot;But I am convinced that the best of this generation are as exciting as the leading artists in the US and Europe. Although there is an overwhelming amount of derivative and kitschy nonsense, I hope our opening show will be full of surprising and interesting art - rather different to the work we have all grown more familiar with.&quot; Zhang believes Chinese art is entering &quot;an era of the sort that comes only once every 100 years. I think the young generation are very fortunate. Some receive attention when they are only in their second year of university. Buyers offer bags of money. But I think they are under more pressure than me, because they are deeply influenced by the market. It is hard to balance this with the idealism they want to pursue.&quot; Zeng Fanzhi, another bestselling Chinese artist, is uneasy about the impact of the market. &quot;Many works now are empty and vague,&quot; he says. &quot;They don&apos;t express the real thinking of society. Even some excellent artists have joined in with this kind of horrible work. All artists should feel worried when they receive attention not because of who they are, but because of how much money they can make.&quot; Zeng has recently shifted his focus from garish expressionist portraits to what he describes as &quot;wild brushstroke&quot; landscapes. Chinese culture, he says, is in his marrow, but he is not convinced there is - or should be - a Chinese style. &quot;All Chinese contemporary artists are trying to express their own understanding of society, their own feelings. But, unavoidably, some icons come up again and again, like Mao or Tiananmen. I guess they have been repeated so often that people feel that represents &apos;Chinese style&apos;, but this is weak. Repetition is boring.&quot; The danger is exactly that: that as foreign investors and government administrators seek safe, commercial art, Dashanzi&apos;s artists begin to repeat themselves. But Dashanzi is not the whole of China, and even if the district does turn into Carnaby Street, other places might take the creative lead. There are thriving art communities in Shanghai, Chengdu, as well as elsewhere in Beijing. Among the most dynamic is Caochangdi, where Platform China runs exhibitions of new - and less mainstream - work by upcoming artists. This is also the home of Ai Weiwei, one of the most influential conceptual and performance artists of the past 30 years. He remains as defiantly anti-establishment as ever, last year announcing his refusal to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympics even though he helped design its spectacular &quot;Bird&apos;s Nest&quot; stadium. The Beijing Olympics, he says, is propaganda: a &quot;fake smile&quot; masking the country&apos;s &quot;disgusting&quot; politics, troubled society and foul environment. It is still too early to give up on Dashanzi, though. Despite the loss of some of the most innovative smaller galleries, there are still superb shows at good contemporary galleries. Like the demolition zones and building sites throughout Beijing, the area is a work in progress. &quot;Dashanzi is incredibly young,&quot; says Colin Chinnery. &quot;It is just five years old, so it is hard to say what its soul is. It is still in the process of finding itself.&quot; The same might be said of China and its contemporary art scene. It is wealthier, slicker and more professional than it was a decade ago, but still wandering uncertainly amid the rubble of the old China. \u00b7 Work by contemporary Chinese artists will feature throughout the year in China Now, a UK-wide festival of Chinese culture. chinanow.org.uk", "tags": ["Art", "China arts 2008", "China", "The art market", "Culture", "Art and design", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-13T14:49:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/mar/14/2", "sentences": ["She impressed her Honeydripper co-star Charles S Dutton enough for him to give her a role in a TV movie he&apos;d directed, Racing for Time, and has just completed work on Jerry Allen Davis&apos; human trafficking drama The Shanghai Hotel."], "title": "First sight", "article": "Who is she?

He is invariably linked with his ex-girlfriend Tracey Emin, who once described his art as &quot;stuck stuck stuck&quot;, a quote that was then turned around to inspire the formation of the Stuckists, a group of artists who promote painting and reject the high concepts of the YBAs.

Abstract art that is all about pictorial suggestiveness, this kind of thing goes on these days far more in France, Italy and Spain than it does back here in Tippett&apos;s native UK, where the genre seems to have faded from mainstream view sometime in the 1980s. The artist improvises his rhythmic lines and colour expanses, plays with the push and pull of illusionistic space, and leaves the image as a catalyst for the viewer&apos;s projective dreaming. His titles hint at the evocative territory: Angel Entering, Blue Notes, Sky Writing, Silver Hair. Mushroom Cloud. Robert Clark \u00b7 Artco Gallery, to Apr 14 China Design Now, London After the success of the V&amp;A&apos;s contemporary Chinese art show in 2005, the museum follows up with cutting edge design from China. The words &quot;Made in China&quot; are a familiar tag on many household goods, and this exhibition introduces us to some of the creatives behind those words, who transform our domestic environment with their cheap, versatile designs. Focusing on three industrial cities - Shenzhen, the world&apos;s largest manufacturing centre; Shanghai, China&apos;s foremost international city; and Beijing, soon to be in the global spotlight for this year&apos;s Olympic Games - the exhibition uncovers a country in cultural rebirth as young designers combine pre- socialist traditions with a new pioneering spirit. Jessica Lack \u00b7 V&amp;A, SW7, to Jul 13 Folk-Us On Robertsbridge, Battle The East Sussex village of Robertsbridge is the subject of this intimate exhibition curated by the photographer Malcolm Glover. Last summer Glover invited the residents of the 12th-century village to make a contemporary portrait of Robertsbridge. The results avoid the usual clich\u00e9s - quaint hospitality or disquietingly surreal imagery - and opt for everyday depictions of a working village. Pictures of the chip shop at dusk, the football field on a Saturday morning or the choir&apos;s robes hanging in the vestry of the local church capture the community spirit without indulging in cosy sentimentality.Jessica Lack \u00b7 The Independent Photographers&apos; Gallery, to Apr 19 From Sickert To Gertler Edinburgh Through the 1940s, 50s and 60s, in relief from the human wastages of the second world war, artists flocked to Boxted House, the Essex home of patrons Bobby and Natalie Bevan, to catch a glimpse of the odd Goya or C\u00e9zanne as well as make themselves at home in the comfortable surroundings. Bobby&apos;s father, the painter Robert Polhill Bevan, was a founder member of The Camden Town Group, so this exhibition of the Boxted House collection features many of the artists in the Tate Britain&apos;s current reappraisal of the group&apos;s murky-eyed oeuvre: Harold Gilman, Spencer Gore, Mark Girtler and Walter Sickert, the last the only one able to match the dark mood of the London smog of the times. Robert Clark  \u00b7 Scottish National Gallery Of Modern Art, to Jun 22 Nigel Hall/Brass Art: Skyscraping Wakefield Forty years of tireless Nigel Hall sculptural transfixions appear to reveal a secret geometry underlying the Yorkshire Sculpture Park landscape. Far from the knowing ironies of postmodernism, Hall reminds us of a time when sculptors used to go on about truth to materials, the creative displacement of space and the aesthetic tensions conjured in the gaps between horizontals and verticals, fulcrums and ellipses. Whether working in cool strands of aluminium or immaculate timber, Hall&apos;s work (pictured) is always spot-on, like some utterly sublime form of fine art design. In contrast, the collaborative threesome Brass Art (Chara Lewis, Kristin Mojsiewicz and Annek\u00e9 Pettican) wield three-dimensional body scans and morphed video to entrance us with hi-tech hallucinations of carnival grotesqueries and hot air balloon aerial panoramas over Manchester. Robert Clark \u00b7 Yorkshire Sculpture Park, West Bretton, Nigel Hall to Jun 8; Brass Art to Jun 22 No Such Thing As Society, Aberystwyth You can say what you want about the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, but sometimes her way with words did latch on to the political paranoia of the time. &quot;Society? There is no such thing. There are individual men and women and there are families.&quot; Her tenure timed with a growing disillusionment with the libertarian cultural optimism of the 1960s and with a tendency among an increasingly sardonic society of contemporary artists to turn to photography to document their grim observations. Here, in a comprehensive show of photo-art from the British Council and Arts Council Collections, we see the whole social mix-up: industrial closures and Silver Jubilee union flags, National Front graffiti and seaside beauty contests, DHSS waiting rooms and Ascot races. Yet Keith Arnatt (work pictured) unearths the charms of rubbish tips while Martin Parr and Chris Steele-Perkins show how a defiantly upbeat style persists when the working class go out for a good time. Robert Clark \u00b7 Aberystwyth Arts Centre, to Apr 27 The Skat Players, London The grotesque, in all its grisly forms, is the theme of this absorbing group show organised by Sarah McCrory, the innovative curator behind such idiosyncratic events as Publish And Be Damned. McCrory has found some pretty sordid examples to wither our passions, from Jabba The Hutt courtesy of Spartacus Chetwynd to Mikhail Bahktin&apos;s writing on Francois Rabelais (a Renaissance writer with a prolific collection of dirty jokes). The title is taken from a painting by the German expressionist Otto Dix, which features a card game played by a ragged collection of monstrous &quot;war-cripples&quot;. With LA artist Mike Kelley, French opium eater Charles Baudelaire and studies of Leigh Bowery by Charles Atlas (work pictured) among the mix, it&apos;s a foul collection of beauties that are presented for our delectation.

In 1920, Sun Yatsen, who was head of his new nationalist party, the Guomingdang, needed an outfit. As a young man in America and Hawaii he had adopted a western lounge suit, although the women in his family remained clad in the old Chinese collages of loose silks that emphasised their minute feet. He had worn soldierly khaki and, as an officer, Ruritanian epaulettes. He also slipped into a long gown, the changpao, natty outfitting for proud Chinese gents. But in that crucial year 1920, the shop owner helped him tailor a novel mode, probably reworked from a Japanese student uniform. (The Japanese had borrowed it from the Russians, and the Russians from the Prussians, who stole it from the French.) A fingertip-length tunic jacket, four patch pockets with flaps, and collar set into a neck-circling band, plus pants. This was the Sun Yatsen suit, which, adopted later by Mao for its Sino-sensibility, renamed after him, and supplemented by related army uniforms and their civilian modifications, became the generic outfit worn by the most people ever. From the 1950s until about 1990 - it made a comeback on the nervous after Tiananmen Square - billions of Chinese regarded some version of it as a habit for life. I own a blue linen specimen lined in reactionary silk and labelled in revolutionary red, one of the designer David Tang&apos;s wicked summations of heritage, bought in Hong Kong before it reverted to the motherland. As Antonia Finnane points out in her overview of the clothes of the past century in China, and Valery Garrett shows in her clever and generously illustrated outline running all the way back to 1644, that suit was a genius compromise: its balance of length of jacket over trousers referred to Han Chinese working gear for both sexes across regions and epochs, while the built-in high collar ascended as a marker of modernity after the 1911 revolution (before that it had been an elite add-on). Yet the suit fastened with flat western buttons through cut and sewn holes, not the ball and loop froggings that had ridden into China with Mongolian and Manchurian conquerors, and it had pockets instead of the pouches hung on belts and tucked into boots on which the Middle Kingdom had relied. It was a synthesis embraced by all - Chiang Kaishek for the nationalists negotiated with Mao Zedong for the communists in suits identical but for Chiang&apos;s ace of a pen in his top pocket; Chinese mothers as well as fathers boasted to children about the day they were issued their first uniform. Moreover it wasted minimal cloth during dearth and could be calibrated to class, from barathea for top cadres down to sacking for proles. It projected plangent sincerity when patched. You might believe that the Mao suit, my Shanghai Tang pastiche aside, couldn&apos;t be described as fashion, but the achievement of Finnane&apos;s overwhelming scholarship (which she wears casually) is to restore fashion - transient display for sexual and/or social status - to contemporary Chinese history, which also means understanding even terrible aspects of that history as fashions. I&apos;ve long thought that the university and school origins of the Red Guard movement resembled a monstrous teen craze, with bad attitudes and sartorial fads, and Finnane has retrieved revelations about kids badgering their mothers to make them People&apos;s Liberation Army uniforms, the glamour gear of the cultural revolution, when the real thing couldn&apos;t be wangled through connections or nepotism. No Wasp campus clique into Abercrombie &amp; Fitch could be so exacting about denim as were Guards grading the precise shade of PLA dye that guaranteed ideological coolness: Little Red Book and matching armband accessorised blue, grey and green. Educated youth who were relocated to the country for re-education recall, writes Finnane, &quot;how their peers dressed as clearly as if they had spent those years dating in America&quot;, and the memories are nasty - the in-crowd attended denunciation sessions in military greatcoats just bought from the official store, while those with counter-revolutionary backgrounds tried desperately to pass through earnest shabbiness. A rebel girl who pieced her pretty underwear from scraps went mad because her lover was executed after she had been forced to accuse him, falsely, of rape: her original sin had been to restyle her wide, flat shirt. Detail was that important. A paper pattern for a peasant jacket, a rural alternative to combat gear, was printed with the slogan &quot;the theoretical basis that guides our thought is Marxist-Leninism&quot;. Citing Karl didn&apos;t sharpen its shape. Finnane argues that the cultural revolution elimination of China&apos;s immediate garment-past left the post-Mao nation unsure what it wanted to wear in future. Released from a &quot;monastery in which members of a secluded order took pride in their religious habit&quot;, the Chinese have since expended most of their sartorial energy on clothing the rest of the planet. By the 21st century China could deliver anything the world&apos;s wardrobe wanted at the shortest of notice, since tens of thousands of mills had expanded from the first cotton textile plant established in Shanghai in 1890. Even more garment factories had displaced traditions of hand sewing, although not the still saleable skill of hand knitting, which Finnane notices was introduced to Shanghai in the 1930s by destitute European Jewish refugees. (Now there&apos;s a fact.) But the Chinese remain tentative about what it might be to dress Chinese. They produce sensational simulations of Manchu-vintage costumes for movies and prestige events, and there will be parades of brocade and embroidery at the Olympics; there is a Hanfu movement whose young followers gussy up in copies of even more ancient gowns, having been inspired to research antiquity by gorgeous Korean period serials networked on Chinese television, plus an overdose of Zhang Yimou epics. Designe rs and wedding guests keen on deco retro flirt with the qipao, aka cheongsam, the body-contoured dress that dominated the 1930s. But the average urban Chinese sets out daily in the same logoed global muddle of jeans and trainers as the rest of us - and why not? They manufacture most of them. When I depart this earth, though, I want the paper clothes burnt as my offerings at the hungry ghosts festival to be cut like the sleek tunics over narrow trousers worn as reform dress for a while after the 1911 declaration of the republic.

It felt like there were as many journalists on the flight as musicians. The New York Philharmonic is the oldest active symphony orchestra in the United States, and we made our first trip to mainland China in the 1990s, returning there once again for this tour of Asia. Shanghai and Beijing are now mostly indistinguishable from any of the other Pacific Rim cities such as Singapore or Hong Kong or even Seoul in South Korea, which is only a couple of days&apos; walk from Pyongyang. The North immediately felt not only like a different world; it was like it came from a different century. Driving from the airport, we saw ox-carts and people in the fields - rather well-dressed for peasants, perhaps. Sure, there was advertising all over the place: one poster showed a huge boot crushing a helmet with the letters &apos;USA&apos; on it. In terms of commercial advertising: zero, nada, zilch. I can&apos;t speak for everyone, but I think it&apos;s fair to say that everyone in the orchestra was on edge, until we started to speak to our minders. Someone later wrote that there hadn&apos;t been this many Americans in the North since 1953 - when we were at war. The trip came at an invitation received via a representative of the North Korean Ministry of Culture, and the US State Department was involved as well. Our executive director Zarin Mehta billed it as &apos;a manifestation of the power of music to unite people&apos;. Some of us were justifiably cautious but I was in favour right away - it felt to me that this trip could put the symphonic arts back into the centre of world events, which is where they belong. I&apos;m a protege of Leonard Bernstein&apos;s, and I remember thinking: &apos;Lenny would have wanted us to go.&apos; The city had put on its Sunday best for us: we knew that in Pyongyang there&apos;s often no electricity, but for us there was heating and light. At the hotel, there was a lot of curiosity - no one crowded around us, but everyone was watching. Immediately we noticed other differences. Other than our caravan, shuttling us around the city, there was virtually no vehicular traffic on the streets. But there were extraordinarily beautiful traffic cops directing what was there with great pantomimed movements - with almost balletic grace. We went almost immediately that evening to a great cultural presentation of dance, music and song. We had seen footage of their epic military parades with thousands of women goose-stepping with machine guns; well, they do tend towards unison performance, but we saw the beautiful aspect of that tendency. Then there was a huge banquet with 13 or 14 courses and many of us felt guilty because we knew that there&apos;s hunger in North Korea. But it would have been impolite to refuse such hospitality. Also, you know, it was scrumptious (with none of the stomach lining or bird feet you sometimes get in other cities). But more importantly, I had the good fortune to be sitting next to fascinating people, including the president of the State Symphony Orchestra. He told me that he&apos;s looking for better instruments. He&apos;s also proud of his musicians. I asked whether he performed Beethoven&apos;s symphonies with Eastern and Western instruments and he said: &apos;No, I tell the Eastern instruments to go off stage!&apos; It was a very open conversation, conducted through the interpreters. Everyone said: &apos;Don&apos;t surprise the North Koreans - they hate surprises, everything has to be totally by the book.&apos; Well, that turned out to be true and not true. The longer we were there, the more we could appreciate the warmth of the people. While they had undoubtedly been carefully chosen and coached in terms of what to say and how to act, it was much easier to feel a connection to our minders than it had been, for instance, with people in East Germany in the Seventies. There, it was hard to say hello, and everyone was worried about the Stasi. In North Korea: well, when a woman talks to you about her two-year-old daughter being back with her husband, and she&apos;s worried whether he&apos;s going to feed her the right formula milk - there&apos;s a human connection there. 26 February  In the morning there was a full rehearsal at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, which has excellent acoustics, I can report. The evening&apos;s performance was going to be broadcast on state television, so we had to be in concert dress and as always with anything like that, it all took a lot of time. Even then, the hall was packed, and at the end we exchanged gifts with the Koreans, although there was some confusion about when they were to come on stage - there was a lot of scrambling about, but it turned out fine. Then we visited their conservatory, where we coached the students, and they were much like students anywhere in the world. They were dealing with the same issues of phrasing, intonation and rhythm. Our education department deserves great credit for its organisation of events and contacts on this tour. The Philharmonic&apos;s music director, Lorin Maazel, also coached the North Korean State Symphony Orchestra and I was able to watch for about 20 minutes. It sounded wonderful - so the musicians there are obviously able to play Western music. Then that evening was our concert itself. Often when we play in a foreign country, we start with the national anthem of the host nation and then &apos;The Star-Spangled Banner&apos; - we did it in Argentina six months after the Falklands war. After the anthems, we played the Prelude to Act III of Lohengrin by Wagner - a little bit of a reach because of the German association, but it went over fine; then Dvor\u00e1k&apos;s Symphony No. 9, &apos;From the New World&apos;, which we like to claim for ourselves because it was written for the New York Philharmonic; followed by Gershwin&apos;s An American in Paris, before which Lorin Maazel said &apos;perhaps someone will write [now] a piece called &quot;Americans in Pyongyang&quot;!&apos; Then finally the Korean folk song &apos;Arirang&apos;, the words of which describe a man and a woman parted by circumstances beyond their control. It&apos;s a poignant song for South and North Koreans, and the reaction to it was quite extraordinary. There are eight Koreans in our orchestra and they were moved profoundly, but then so were we all. Many of us were crying, as were many people in the audience; we were waving to each other, as if we didn&apos;t want to say goodbye. I was at the Berlin Wall with Bernstein in 1989 and it was a very similar feeling back then, although we can&apos;t be so presumptuous to say that anything will happen because of this visit. But as we say, it weren&apos;t nuthin&apos;. Something profound had happened between two peoples. It was something. 27 February  Following the concert, there was another enormous banquet, when we all compared notes with each other - I felt both shattered and joyful. Then in the morning, we heard the Mendelssohn Octet with four of our musicians, including our concertmaster (leader) Glenn Dicterow, in a sensational reading with four Korean musicians. This was performed in the Moranbong theatre for hundreds of Koreans, including members of their State Symphony Orchestra. At the conclusion of the performance, Mr Dicterow gestured to me and, shaking, I brought up to the stage an original composition by a young girl from a New York school, which she&apos;d dedicated &apos;To the children of Korea&apos;. She is Farah Taslima, an American, born in Bangladesh. The Americans and Koreans then sight-read it perfectly. I told them it was a gift from the heart of one child to another. Many of us left our hosts with strings, which can be hard to get there, mouth pieces or reeds and stacks of music. The whole visit had lasted less than 48 hours. Most us were in tears for one reason or another when we landed back in the US.

Everyone recognises Patrick&apos;s Day. It is said that a thousand church bells ring out globally, from Shanghai to Buenos Aires, to celebrate Patrick, the (possibly Englishman) who Christianised Ireland in the fifth century. It was recently suggested that Paddy&apos;s day should be a national holiday in the US, so widely celebrated is the festival, by Jewish Americans with green bagels and by Czech Americans with green beer. This is &quot;brand recognition&quot; at a level that admen can only dream of. While the British visibly and collectively squirm at the suggestion that there should be new definitions of &quot;Britishness&quot; or some ritual, or national day to mark &quot;Britishness&quot;, the Irish identity as branded by St Patrick is easy, natural, exuberant - sometimes too much so, with fashionable concerns now about binge drinking - and inclusive. Paddy&apos;s day in Dublin can accommodate gay tableaux and Chinese dragons as gracefully as it can the traditional allusions to the holy Ireland of St Pat. A definition of success is when something can be &quot;all things to all men&quot;: and you can take your Paddy&apos;s day any way you choose. But it will always have an element of the green - of Irishness - at its core. Britain has never quite managed a regular national holiday in the same way. First, the British don&apos;t really do saints: they are too Protestant. When a Christian feast closes the stock exchanges in continental Europe (Ascension, All Saints Day), the BBC has always announced that &quot;the money markets are closed on the continent because it is a bank holiday&quot;, this being the nearest that can explain a European sacred fiesta. Second, St George doesn&apos;t really cut the mustard as a saint, and certainly not as an English saint: he may have been a Cypriot, a Palestinian or a hermit of Mount Olympus. As a patron saint, he is too promiscuously claimed by England, Aragon, Portugal, Genoa, Venice, Cyprus and Georgia to have any true purchase on British branding. A St George&apos;s Day has never really got off the ground in England for a number of reasons: included in which the English, if not the British, feel self-conscious about proclaiming national days. And possibly a little superior: such confections are only suited to struggling minority cultures which have to consciously affirm themselves as cohesive nations - all those tinpot Latin American states with their &quot;national&quot; or &quot;liberation&quot; or &quot;independence&quot; days. Britain was above all that. It was above the French idea, too, crafted by Jules Ferry during the Third Republic, that you had to &quot;make Frenchmen&quot; out of the too-diverse French. Traditionally, you knew you were British by osmosis: by the respect accorded to British institutions and the permanent seat at the high table of global pow-wows. Therefore, there was no British &quot;national day&quot; as such, and no need for one. There was trooping the colour and the Last Night of the Proms, and they sufficed to transmit that feeling of belonging. Yet times change and cultures change, and Britain isn&apos;t what it used to be. Britain today is a multicultural, multi-ethnic and multi-faith society: and, I would argue, that is all more reason to have symbols or festivals or special occasions to knit a nation together. As Ferry so well understood, a diverse nation - in his time, half the French didn&apos;t even speak standard French - requires identity and cohesion in a way that a monolithic kind of society does not. It is when cultural norms are not taken for granted that they require affirmation - for the common good of knitting society and communities together. But while national days can be founded artificially, they have to grow organically: people have to feel in their bones that this is an event they in which they naturally participate. I am proud to be a citizen of the Irish Republic, and I wouldn&apos;t be anything else: but that sense of identity marked by St Patrick&apos;s Day gives me an objective viewpoint on what it means to be British - and a perspective on how important it is to cherish national definitions. Build on what is there already: build on the glorious Last Night of the Proms (so inclusive, it even features Irish flags) and trooping the colour, and yes, the monarchy at its most dignified and ceremonial that imparts such a wide sense of shared ritual. A formal oath of allegiance may be too over-stated and self-conscious, too American, but a sense of loyalty to the nation of which you are a part is socially constructive, and even personally uplifting. And emphatically, the more multicultural the society, the more that ceremony is needed to bind diversities together: build on what is there: what is good: and what works. Isn&apos;t that how St Patrick used the shamrock? The Celts loved nature, so he took a symbol of nature to emphasise unity and diversity - and a logo, you might say, which has lasted over 15 centuries.", "tags": ["British identity and society", "Identity cards"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-17T13:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/17/tibet.china3", "sentences": ["&quot;We saw it again when Bjork shouted &quot;Free Tibet&quot; in her concert in Shanghai a few weeks ago."], "title": "Tibet's young exiles sick of passive approach", "article": "Last week&apos;s violent protests in Tibet have emphasised the growing divide within the exiled community of how to win the propaganda war against China.

The Chinese premier Zhou Enlai once declared with justification that John &quot;opened the door&quot; to China for the foreign media. Between 1945 and 1947, he spent a total of seven months with the Chinese communist rebel army in Yan&apos;an, centre of the communist revolution, filing dispatches for Associated Press (AP) on life with Mao Zedong and his comrades. Initially enthusiastic about the young poet Mao, John rapidly became disillusioned with the dictatorial tendencies that emerged after the 1949 communist takeover, culminating in the purges and violent upheavals of the cultural revolution between 1969 and 1976. Nonetheless, he leapt at the chance to return to China with a US table tennis team in 1971, to witness at first hand ping-pong diplomacy in action. When AP was able to reopen its Beijing bureau eight years later, he was the natural choice to run it. China remained the great cultural and political passion of his life, though he spent most of his later years in Japan and Hawaii. His last article - a reflection on how far China has advanced economically in recent years - appeared only three weeks before his death. &quot;To my old eyes,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it seems almost a miracle that China has survived the pain and bloodshed to emerge from poverty and become one of the richest of Earth&apos;s nations in so short a time.&quot; John&apos;s interest in China was kindled on an American golf course, when he was a 13-year-old earning pocket money as a caddy in Maine. One player had just returned from Shanghai and showed him pictures of young Chinese being beheaded in the 1927 massacre there which sparked the civil war. From that moment, he wanted to see history being made at first hand. Born in Waterville, Maine, the youngest of five brothers, he had a difficult childhood as his mother was widowed early. But he discovered a talent for reportage, contributing pieces on high-school activities for the local newspaper, the Sentinel, from the age of 15. He went on to study at the small but distinguished local liberal arts school, Colby College, before joining AP as a junior reporter at their Portland office. In 1941, AP moved him to Washington. This was shortly after Pearl Harbor and the US entry into the second world war, so John was soon drafted into the army. He was sent to Yale University to learn Japanese, with the intention of becoming an interpreter after the eventual defeat and occupation of Japan. But in the event, he was posted to Kunming in China, working for the Office of Strategic Services - forerunner of the CIA. Back in AP&apos;s employ at the end of the war, he was sent out to join the Red Army at Yan&apos;an, staying in one of the 10,000 caves that had been carved out of the hillsides after the Japanese destroyed the old walled town. John towered physically over the Chinese, and with his jutting jaw and energetic manner, made an indelible impression. AP then transferred him to the Middle East. He was in Amman, Jordan, two weeks after the declaration of the state of Israel, and interviewed the UN mediator Count Folke Bernadotte only a couple of days before he was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1948. Short spells in London and Paris - &quot;the city of my dreams&quot;- were followed by an assignment to French Indochina, where he covered the fall of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. When John eventually got posted to Tokyo in 1959, he was surprised and delighted to find that the Japanese were nowhere near as anti-American as the French had been. Moreover, they talked boisterously about politics, literature, food and sex, as he liked to do himself. He relished the fact that his birthday, September 15, is the Japanese festival of respect for the elderly. He had expected to stay in Japan only a few years, but he became attached to a young Japanese called Yoshihiro &quot;Yochan&quot; Takishita, whom he made his adopted son. In turn, Yochan&apos;s parents became John&apos;s surrogate family. Through them, John was offered the chance to buy a large 18th-century traditional farmhouse in the Gifu mountains, for the derisory price of \u00a55,000 (the equivalent of about \u00a325). The building was dismantled and transported to Kamakura, where John had it lovingly restored. It became a place of cultural pilgrimage for personalities as disparate as George Bush Sr, Hillary Clinton and the Queens of Denmark and Greece. It was also the subject of a book which was published at Princeton last year, Minka: My Farmhouse in Japan. In recognition of his services to Japan, the Emperor bestowed upon John the order of the sacred treasure in 1985. From 1980, John was a roving special correspondent all over Asia. Though he officially retired in 1984, when he turned 70, he continued to write. When Beijing was awarded the 2008 Olympics, he began a series of monthly analytical pieces about China&apos;s transformation. To escape Japan&apos;s harsh winters, he had got into the pattern of spending several months each year in an apartment in Hawaii. He was soon heavily in demand as a lecturer on China, not only there, but also in Britain and Russia. His zest for life made him popular with young audiences, as did his capacity for indiscretion. His lecture on the cultural revolution contained the unforgettable line: &quot;Then there was Madame Mao; she was a bitch.&quot; As deafness began to set in, John became ever more voluble, sometimes silencing the dining room at the Oriental Club in London, where he stayed during his annual visits to Britain, by loudly recalling lunchtime conversations of the past, discussing the quality of oysters, or commenting on the comeliness of a particular waiter. A great bon vivant, John stopped eating anything except chocolate ice cream when he realised the end was near. He had kept hundreds of his friends in touch with his progress - as he did with all aspects of his life - by email. A group of his nearest and dearest gathered at his bedside for the final days, during which he pronounced his own epitaph: &quot;People should eat chocolate ice cream, instead of killing each other.&quot; \u00b7  John Roderick, journalist and China expert, born September 15 1914; died March 11 2008", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-18T00:08:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/18/radio", "sentences": ["Sex in the City Shanghai Style (Radio 4) had a cumbersome title - and, while we&apos;re about it, shouldn&apos;t that be Sex and the City Shanghai Style?", "At its core was a group of young, successful Shanghai women talking about how different their lives are from their mothers&apos; generation."], "title": "Radio review by Elisabeth Mahoney", "article": "Sex in the City Shanghai Style (Radio 4) had a cumbersome title - and, while we&apos;re about it, shouldn&apos;t that be Sex and the City Shanghai Style? - but was a fascinating snapshot of what&apos;s it&apos;s like to be a young woman in this hothouse metropolis.

Wikileaks said that posting the videos was a &quot;response to the Chinese Public Security Bureau&apos;s carte-blanche censorship of YouTube, the BBC, CNN, the Guardian and other sites&quot; that had carried sensitive video footage about Tibet. Wikileaks, which earlier this month successfully saw off legal action that threatened to shut the website, is calling on bloggers to post footage to help it circumvent the Chinese internet censorship. China&apos;s internal censorship of online and TV coverage of the unrest in Tibet has drawn heavy criticism. However, the BBC world news editor, Jon Williams, revealed on a BBC Editors blog that the press counsellor at the Chinese embassy in London had indicated that a foreign press trip to Tibet could be on the cards. Williams said that the Chinese embassy is giving &quot;serious consideration&quot; to organising a foreign press trip to Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. He added that the embassy&apos;s press counsellor, Liu Weimin, had repeated an offer made by the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, in Beijing that &quot;serious consideration&quot; was being given to organising an official trip so that &quot;international media could see for themselves the situation in Tibet&quot;.  Earlier this week the Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger, sent a formal letter of complaint to the Chinese embassy in London calling for access to the Guardian website to be restored and &quot;henceforth unfettered&quot;. Chinese authorities can censor online content internally using either an outright block on a specific website address, or using filtering technology that restricts access to individual online articles containing key words such as &quot;Tibet&quot; and &quot;violence&quot;. It has not been clear which technical restrictions the Chinese authorities have been using against international news websites. However, according to reports from several internet users in China, the censorship appears to have become less draconian this week compared to the weekend, when the worst of the unrest in Tibet was taking place. Videos on the Guardian website that had previously been inaccessible can now be viewed in China and users in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guilin have been able to access a range of online news stories on Tibet. One Chinese technology blogger said that while access has improved it does not necessarily mean that the authorities have relented. &quot;Suppose there is less access from Chinese readers once they felt the site is hard to access,&quot; he said. &quot;The censorship system will turn to other hot sites with higher sensitive hits automatically.&quot; Wikileaks&apos; call for bloggers to post the Tibet videos in a bid to circumvent the Chinese internet restrictions echoes comments made earlier this week by Jaime FlorCruz, the CNN Beijing bureau chief, about how digital information was being disseminated from Tibet. FlorCruz said that the online and broadcast censorship of media and access in Tibet meant that the only information trickling out from locals was via less mainstream sites including a Chinese blog and a version of Twitter. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

After making early gains, propelled by a rally in Asia, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended the day 60.2 points lower - down 1.07% - to 5545.6 points amid speculation that HBOS was in trouble and the Bank of England was convening emergency meetings.  Sally Dewar, managing director, wholesale and institutional markets at the FSA, said: &quot;There has been a series of completely unfounded rumours about UK financial institutions in the London market over the last few days, sometimes accompanied by short-selling. We will not tolerate market participants taking advantage of the current market conditions to commit abuse by spreading false rumours and dealing on the back of them&quot;. &quot;We remind market participants of the need to take extra care, in this market climate, to adhere to the market code of conduct,&quot; she said. The Bank of England had earlier asked the City regulator to investigate whether London share prices are being deliberately manipulated by speculators. Shares in HBOS, owner of Britain&apos;s biggest mortgage lender Halifax, fell as much as 18% in early trade on fears the bank was in trouble, before recovering some ground. Despite denials of any problems by HBOS the company was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 on Wednesday, although its shares pared some losses. The bank&apos;s shares closed down 34p at 446.25p, down 7%. The Bank of England was racing to reassure the market, nervous after the near-collapse of Bear Stearns in the US on Friday and rife with rumours that emergency meetings were being convened. A Bank spokesman said: &quot;The rumours that the governor or any other senior executive has cancelled a trip to the Far East is complete fantasy. There are no immediate trips in the diary anyway&quot;. &quot;The governor deferred a visit to the West Midlands and two other MPC members cancelled or shortened theirs in the wake of Bear Stearns episode, in order to be in London to monitor general market conditions,&quot; the spokesman added. The Bank put \u00a35bn of liquidity in to the markets on Monday and another \u00a310bn yesterday, prompting Bank of England governor Mervyn King and deputy governors Rachel Lomax and Sir John Gieve to postpone travel plans. The Bank of England spokesman went on: &quot;No meetings have taken place or been scheduled to discuss problems with any institutions in the UK. It is also a fantasy that leave for Bank staff has been cancelled over Easter&quot;.  It is thought that the Bank wants to establish whether rumours about problems at banks are being spread by people who want prices to fall. An HBOS spokesman denied speculation in the market that the bank had been intending to suspend its shares. There was also talk that the bank had gone to the Bank of England for emergency funding.  The spokesman dismissed the rumours out of hand. &quot;This is complete and utter nonsense,&quot; he said. &quot;HBOS is one of the strongest financial institutions in the world. We are one of the most respected institutions in the capital and wholesale markets. We continue to access the wholesale markets whenever we think it is appropriate to do so.&quot; He said the bank has a diversified business with an &quot;exceptionally strong&quot; balance sheet. Most of the main banking shares were off at the close. Alliance &amp; Leicester shares were down nearly 2.8%, or 14p, to 501.5p. Royal Bank of Scotland ended down 9.5p at 316.5p. After falling in early trading, Barclays and Lloyds TSB closed higher. Banking shares have suffered in recent days in the aftermath of the bailout of Bear Stearns, America&apos;s fifth largest bank, orchestrated by the US Federal Reserve over the weekend. HBOS shares have been hit hardest amid concern about its exposure to investments linked to the US sub-prime mortgage market. Last year Northern Rock, the UK mortgage lender, collapsed and was nationalised by the government. EasyJet&apos;s warning that higher fuel prices will cut profits this year dragged down the airline sector. EasyJet shares plummeted more than 16% and later traded down nearly 10%, or 35.75p, at 339.25p. Budget rival Ryanair dropped over 5% while British Airways shares were down 3.15% at 223p. Overnight, markets in Asia had continued the rally begun on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve took the emergency action of cutting interest rates by three-quarters of a point. In Japan the Nikkei index, which has fallen around 20% so far this year to near four-year lows, closed 2.5% higher today. Shares in Australia were up 4% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong closed 2.4% higher, while Markets in South Korea, China and India were also sharply up. The Shanghai Composite index ended trading 3.6% higher, after five straight days of losses. Wall Street staged its biggest one-day rally in more than five years yesterday after the aggressive action by the Fed, even though the cut was smaller than many in the markets had hoped for. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 420 points on Tuesday, up 3.51%, to 12,392.66. The S&amp;P 500, the broader gauge of US stocks, climbed 4.24% to 1,330.74, the highest gain in a single session since October 2002. But by 7pm GMT on Wednesday, the Dow was back in the red - trading 1% lower at 12,265 points. Market nerves had been soothed by earnings statements from Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers. While profits at both were down sharply, they were better than expected, and also calmed fears, albeit temporarily, that another big bank might be heading the way of Bear Stearns. The interest rate cut was aimed at restoring some confidence in the financial system, which was severely rattled by the near collapse of Bear Stearns last week and its cut-price rescue by rival JP Morgan. The US treasury secretary Henry Paulson said that the US economy was facing a &quot;sharp decline&quot;, although he still hoped that it might stage a recovery later this year.

Murray and Mirnyi, on the other hand, only got together in January, and while Mirnyi is no stranger to winning major titles and 22-year-old Murray won the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon last year with Jelena Jankovic, their trophy haul as a partnership consists of one low-level ATP event in Delray Beach. That was won last month with defeat of the Bryans in the final, an achievement every bit as significant as winning their first title together and a feat matched by their 5-7, 6-4, 10-6 success over the Bryans in the quarter-finals of the Pacific Life Open last night. &quot;It was so important to have won Delray, even though it&apos;s not a top tier tournament,&quot; said Mirnyi. &quot;But to have beaten the Bryans in the final, that meant so much to both of us, and to the rest the field out there.

Murray and the Belarussian got together only in January and their partnership remains a work in progress, yet their three wins in Indian Wells this week was a big step forward, largely because of the calibre of the pairs they beat en route to a prestigious Masters Series semi-final, including the Wimbledon champions Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment and Micha\u00ebl Llodra and the American world No1s, Bob and Mike Bryan. In addition to the injection of confidence and the reassurance that they are starting to gel as a combination, their efforts this week also brought more tangible reward in pushing them further up the team rankings and closer to their goal of qualifying for the eight-pair Masters Cup in China at the end of the season. They began the tournament at No15 in the race to Shanghai and should now begin the Sony Ericsson Open even better placed.

But the banker I know best is neither greedy nor stupid, so I asked him for his take on the crisis.  He said it resembled the great savings and loan scandal in the US &quot;when Reagan made it child&apos;s play for the most slow-witted conman to open a savings bank, rake in government-insured deposits, then lend the money to cronies - and to themselves. When the banks went bust, the government repaid the depositors, and the bankers (only a few went to jail) made regretful Rotary Club speeches about &apos;market forces&apos;. &quot;Looting the equity out of American homes was a way for the Bush administration to stimulate the economy without increasing inflation. After 9/11, government spending went into the Middle East sinkhole, which meant the only way the US could support the domestic economy was to turn the average American home into a sort of printing press, spewing out consumer dollars. The US economy marked its declining output and industrial base by selling increasingly worthless bonds to the Asian markets, in exchange for all the junk that was shipped direct from Shanghai to Wal-Mart.  &quot;It was a &apos;win-win&apos; situation for everyone except the home owner, who failed to understand the small print, which made him the chattel of companies like Bear Stearns - for whom homes were just safes to be cracked.&quot; And it wasn&apos;t much better here. Goodness knows what price we will all have to pay. \u00b7 I read the Daily Telegraph on how to manage in a downturn, and though the advice is meant for business people, I thought it might be useful for the rest of us. It suggests seven steps to survival. &quot;Offer vision,&quot; it says. &quot;Communicate the realities of the situation; provide stepping stones for changes ... keep the ship pointing in the direction you want to go. Cut supplier costs and prepare for different scenarios.&quot;  It sounds like inspiring stuff. But for the average family, I suspect it translates as: &quot;Here&apos;s my vision. We&apos;re screwed. The mortgage has doubled. This year&apos;s holiday will be a weekend in Skegness, from now on breakfast is own-brand Tesco cornflakes and supper is baked beans. You, young lady, will buy your clothes at Primark, and I don&apos;t care what your friends say.&quot;  \u00b7 The other day I found myself locked in a Swiss bank vault, which I vaguely felt was one of those experiences that everyone should try at least once in their life. I was staying with American friends in Geneva. The husband had been invited by a friend of his - who just happens to be a millionaire banker - to view his extraordinary collection of first editions of great works in science and philosophy.  We were ushered into the basement of his bank, through clanging steel grilles, and into the rows of deposit boxes, looking like the left luggage office in a very modern but deserted railway station. We were then locked in, which was slightly scary, though since these places are designed to survive a direct nuclear hit, perhaps not all that frightening. The books were astounding. The first edition of The Origin Of Species, unread and so perfect that our host wouldn&apos;t open it for fear of cracking the spine. First editions of essays by Montaigne and Montesquieu, plus Pascal&apos;s Pense\u00e9s and works by Descartes. Hobbes&apos;s Leviathan and Smith&apos;s The Wealth of Nations. Several books, including Plutarch&apos;s Lives, first printed by the Venetian printer Aldus, who toured Europe seeking manuscripts which he could produce in editions so beautiful and so well-made that they are in better condition than many books published last year.  The owner had had gorgeous and appropriately decorated boxes made for each book in Amsterdam. The collection was worth several million dollars, but it&apos;s impossible to say exactly how much. The world&apos;s best preserved copy of The Origin Of Species is worth what someone is prepared to pay, which might be \u00a3500,000, or more. We wondered, politely, if he didn&apos;t miss the fact that he can&apos;t actually read the books. But he can - he keeps reading copies at home, doubling his pleasure as he reflects that the real thing, the echt edition, is his possession and locked in a vault. I had a fantasy of an Ocean&apos;s 11-style raid, with guys swinging through the vault on carbon filaments, dodging the laser security beams, and stealing the first, vellum-bound edition of Bacon&apos;s essays. Try flogging that in the pub. \u00b7 Last week I mentioned the relish with which a French restaurant owner told us that at 1.35pm he had closed for lunch. Two days later, at 7.30am, I was at Gatwick. It was a vision of Gehenna. The big intercontinental flights had just landed so the place was heaving.  Extra security checks, which have ended the normal wave-through for British travellers, meant that we had to wait 20 minutes or so in the queue.  For the non-EU passengers, it was much more horrible and I could hear that same smug pleasure in the official&apos;s voice as he told them that they would probably have to wait an hour to get through. What a grisly welcome to our country. \u00b7 It is hard to remember, but a few years ago Heather Mills wasn&apos;t so unpopular. You could always tell what Middle England thought by the reaction to jokes on The News Quiz. One time, someone said, &quot;Paul McCartney is so upset by the terrible press his wife is getting, that he&apos;s bought her a plane for her birthday. But she insists she&apos;ll still use Immac on her other leg.&quot;  Utterly tasteless of course, but I bet the gag wouldn&apos;t be met with the same sharp, disapproving intake of breath that it got then. \u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday March 27 2008. The Venetian printer who toured Europe looking for manuscripts was Aldus (Manutius) and not, as we had it, Aldine. His printing house, established near the end of the 15th century, was called the Aldine Press.

The strategy is crude but effective and this is how it works. As I watched my colleagues on BBC World report on the riots in Tibet two weeks ago, the television in my Beijing hotel suddenly went dark. No test card, no patriotic music, just a blank screen and silence. When the Tibet report was done, back came the picture.  So I turned to my laptop. The BBC Online version of events in Lhasa? Unavailable. The Guardian story? Blocked. There were lane closures all over the information superhighway.  And it&apos;s not just the English-language reports that are being censored. The Beijing correspondent for the French TV5 satellite network was doing a live two-way with the anchor in Paris. &quot;As the crisis unfolds in Tibet the Chinese government is trying to control all the information coming out of Lhasa,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact, reports from foreign broadcasters are routinely taken off air.&quot; At that my screen in Beijing again went black. It was almost funny.  When it comes to controlling the flow of information, &quot;new China&quot; has yet to rid itself of old habits. Yet it&apos;s not that China hasn&apos;t changed. In fact, the scale and pace of the economic and physical transformation in the big cities are breathtaking; it&apos;s just that the country&apos;s Communist leaders have no intention of matching their relaxation of economic control with a similarly bold opening up in politics and the media.  Hardtalk, the BBC current affairs programme, has just spent a week in Shanghai and Beijing recording a series of interviews. The fact we were allowed in at all was a minor miracle, yet the experience illustrates the difficulty of reporting the China story. When I presented myself to the press attache in London he greeted me with a nervous laugh. &quot;Hardtalk,&quot; he murmured, &quot;very tough, very tough.&quot;  We last filmed in China eight years ago and one of my goals this time round was to test the proposition that internet culture and user-generated content are eroding the ruling party&apos;s ability to stem dissent. We arranged an interview with Gary Wang, founder and CEO of Tudou, a video-sharing website that already has millions of users and aspires to become a Chinese YouTube. On the eve of our interview, during the National People&apos;s Congress, an apologetic and unsettled Wang called the Hardtalk producer, Jessica Williams. &quot;Things are very sensitive right now,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t talk. Even now I&apos;m telling you more than I should.&quot; With that he rang off.  A cursory glance at the Congress proceedings provided an explanation. The government is planning new and tighter regulations on video-sharing sites. Content is to be even more tightly monitored and foreign ownership disallowed. Whether Tudou can survive in its current privately-owned form is unclear.  Government fear of the internet&apos;s subversive potential has led some of China&apos;s most savvy and ambitious media players to steer clear of web activities that could attract &quot;difficult&quot; user-generated input, from Tibet or anywhere else.  Tang Jun, the former president of Microsoft&apos;s China operations, is a good example. He was a high-flyer, recruited from the US and sent back to China at the behest of Bill Gates himself, but he jumped ship in 2004 to run Shanda Interactive Entertainment, the world&apos;s biggest online gaming company. He quit Microsoft just as the company came under enormous pressure from Beijing to restrict political comment on its Live Spaces blogging site.  Microsoft ultimately came to an &quot;understanding&quot; with the government, as did Yahoo and Google. In one infamous case, Yahoo handed over user information to government investigators, which allowed them to trace, prosecute and imprison a journalist who had used the internet to publicise a leaked Communist party document.  Human Rights Watch condemned all three companies for agreeing to act as &quot;Beijing&apos;s censor&quot;. It&apos;s a charge that has caused them deep embarrassment in the western world.  Tang Jun&apos;s conclusion is pragmatic: &quot;If you want to make money in China and sleep well at night, stick to entertainment.&quot;  This is from a man whose company is valued at over $2bn on the Nasdaq exchange. I asked him what he&apos;d do if any of the gamers on his site started to make controversial political comments to fellow-players. Would he report them to the authorities?  &quot;Of course. If they are breaking the law they deserve to be punished.&quot; What about confidentiality and freedom of speech? A slight pause. And then: &quot;If they are breaking the law they deserve to be punished.&quot;  Shanda&apos;s gamers have been warned: slaying dragons is fine, creating a virtual uprising in Tibet is most certainly not.  It&apos;s tempting to think the Beijing government&apos;s efforts to regulate, monitor and censor the net, and maintain the so-called &quot;Great Firewall of China&quot;, are doomed to fail. After all, there are now thought to be 220 million internet users in China - more than the US - and many are savvy enough to dodge the super-servers that monitor internet traffic between China and the outside world. Some are able to access servers in third countries, others encode sensitive information.  But intimidation is a powerful counter-force. Reporters without Borders believes at least 30 bloggers and 50 journalists are in jail, most charged with &quot;subversion&quot;.  The dissident blogger Hu Jia was arrested in December and now faces the prospect of years in prison. His wife and baby are under house arrest. An Australian journalist who recently tried to visit their apartment found his path blocked by no fewer than eight plain-clothes policemen.  It&apos;s difficult to gauge just how much the majority of Chinese people care about the continued suppression of dissident opinion. In the 19 years since the Tiananmen bloodshed the ruling party has delivered a remarkable period of economic growth and rising living standards. Yes, there have been continued challenges to authority based on specific grievances - wretched working conditions, toxic pollution - but the student-driven demand for democracy and the overthrow of the Communist dictatorship lost its urgency after the events of 1989.  Over the next few months, hundreds of journalists will head to China in the run-up to the Beijing Games. As the last couple of weeks have illustrated, the Olympics represents not just an opportunity for China to showcase its achievements and global status, but also for opponents of the dictatorship to garner unprecedented attention. Covering the former will be straightforward; reporting the latter, and putting it in context, will be anything but.  \u00b7 Stephen Sackur&apos;s Hardtalk series for the Inside China season will be on BBC World and BBC News 24 throughout this week", "tags": ["Media", "China", "Censorship", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-24T00:03:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/25/china.tibet", "sentences": ["The high-altitude train linking Shanghai and Lhasa that began service in 2006 represents not the beginning of Chinese hegemony, but its culmination.", "&quot;The Soviet Union collapsed because they experimented with glasnost prematurely, before the achieved unity among the peoples,&quot; explains a Chinese intellectual in Shanghai who studies central Asia.", "The annihilation of local people, history and architecture, and their replacement with shiny skyscrapers paying tribute to modern Chinese capitalism, make Urumqi the Shanghai of the northern Silk Road."], "title": "Parag Khanna: Just like America, China is building  a multi-ethnic empire in the west", "article": "It is difficult to find a westerner who does not intuitively support the idea of a free Tibet. But would Americans ever let go of Texas or California? For China, the Anglo-Russian great game for control of central Asia was neither inconclusive nor fruitless, something that cannot be said for Russia or Britain. Indeed, China was the big winner.  Boundary agreements in 1895 and 1907 gave Russia the Pamir mountains and established the Wakhan Corridor - the slender eastern tongue of Afghanistan that borders China - as a buffer to Britain. But rather than cede East Turkestan (Uighurstan) to the Russians, the British financed China&apos;s recapture of the territory, which it organised into Xinjiang (which means &quot;New Dominions&quot;). While West Turkestan was splintered into the hermetic Soviet Stans, China reasserted its traditional dominance over Xinjiang and Tibet, today its largest - and least stable - provinces. (Beijing has now accused the Dalai Lama of colluding with Muslim Uighur separatists in Xinjiang.) But without them, the country would be like America without all territory west of the Rockies: denied its continental majesty and status. Every backpacker who has visited Tibet and Xinjiang in the past decade knows that the Chinese empire is painfully real: the western region&apos;s going concern is undoubtedly Chinese Manifest Destiny. With the end of the civil war in 1949, China endeavoured immediately to overcome the &quot;tyranny of terrain&quot; and tame the interminable mountain and desert landscapes with the aim of exploiting vast natural assets, establishing penal colonies and military bases, and expand the Lebensraum for its exploding population.  Both Tibet and Xinjiang have the misfortune of possessing resources China wants and of being situated on the path to resources China needs: Tibet has vast amounts of timber, uranium and gold, and the two territories constitute China&apos;s geographic gateway for trade flow outward - and energy flow inward - with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Decades of labour by the army and swarms of workers have paved the way for unchallenged Chinese dominance. The high-altitude train linking Shanghai and Lhasa that began service in 2006 represents not the beginning of Chinese hegemony, but its culmination. Tibet and Xinjiang today set the stage for the birth of a multi-ethnic empire in ways that resemble nothing so much as America&apos;s frontier expansion nearly two centuries ago. Chinese think about their mission civilatrice much as American settlers did: they are bringing development and modernity. Asiatic, Buddhist Tibetans and Turkic, Muslim Uighurs are being lifted out of the third world - whether they like it or not.  They are getting roads, telephone lines, hospitals and jobs. School fees are being reduced or abolished to promote basic education and Chineseness. Unlike those Europeans who seek to define the EU as a Christian club, there are no Chinese inhibitions about incorporating Muslim territories. The new mythology of Chinese nationalism is based not on expunging minorities but granting them a common status in the paternalistic state: Uighurs and Tibetans, though not Han, are told they are Chinese. &quot;The Soviet Union collapsed because they experimented with glasnost prematurely, before the achieved unity among the peoples,&quot; explains a Chinese intellectual in Shanghai who studies central Asia. Large empires are maintained through a combination of force and law; and as recent weeks illustrate, China is determined not to waver.  In even the remotest corners of Tibet, small bases house platoons of the People&apos;s Liberation Army, with soldiers menacingly practising martial arts twice daily in public squares, often right next to ancient Buddhist stupas. Inaccessible jungle areas designated environmentally protected zones are often actually military encampments. Signs trumpeting &quot;Tibet power&quot; refer strictly to the Chinese electricity company.  China has pumped in billions of development dollars, hoping to generate goodwill among the scarcely 3 million Tibetans. In Lhasa, crumbling stone quarters have been replaced with sturdy homes built along thoroughfares connecting the city to the new railway station. The consequence of Chinese modernity, however, is that a city that once symbolised cultural authenticity has become merely a gateway to the remote plateaus where wild yak still outnumber people. An even greater prize than Tibet is the far larger and more populous Xinjiang, with its oil deposits, deserts and mountains. Its demographic dilution has been dubbed &quot;apartheid with Chinese characteristics&quot;. Xinjiang&apos;s Muslims have always been unruly, even briefly securing an independent East Turkestan at the end of the civil war. But massive Han resettlement began with the &quot;Develop the west&quot; campaign of the 1950s, and in the cultural revolution Xinjiang was sealed off for a massive pogrom of mosque destruction and Qur&apos;an burning. Violent clashes in Urumqi, Xinjiang&apos;s capital, in 1996 proved that no peaceful Islamic culture would prevail in a Chinese-dominated environment. China suspended all mosque reconstruction and launched a &quot;Strike Hard&quot; campaign, imprisoning and executing hundreds of suspected separatists. Today one can see the results of a programme Mao and Deng began, but never completed: a railway and highway transporting coal, migrants and goods across the Taklamakan desert, facilitating the Hanification of a province where Uighurs now make up only half the population. The annihilation of local people, history and architecture, and their replacement with shiny skyscrapers paying tribute to modern Chinese capitalism, make Urumqi the Shanghai of the northern Silk Road. A six-lane freeway runs through the city, and the Han majority fill up spiffy Japanese cars at the large Sinopec and PetroChina petrol stations. Urumqui buzzes with traders from Russia to Pakistan and all Stans in between, who buy cheap Chinese goods to be sold back home at a profit. Uighurs are now a marginalised minority in the city. Chinese tourists crowd the few accessible natural attractions, making the emerald-coloured Heavenly Lake no longer very heavenly. Ironically, China&apos;s near absolute sense of security over both provinces is the greatest hope for a Chinese glasnost: China no longer faces any meaningful resistance to its rule and so some day may lighten up. Spiritual Tibetans have long looked south to Nepal and India for their cultural underpinnings, and in the 18th century Tibet was allowed a functional autonomy from China, a model the current Dalai Lama has proposed. Once he passes the scene, China might be less anxious about cultural exchange between Buddhists, further restoring Tibet&apos;s role as the Silk Road passage it was when Dunhuang&apos;s Caves of the Thousand Buddhas were carved, more than a millennium ago.  Tibetans and Uighurs will gradually become more prosperous than their neighbouring Mongols, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Afghans, Pakistanis, Indians, and Nepalis - and this may provide a basis for Chinese claims of a benevolent hegemony elsewhere in Asia. But China will achieve that dominance before it talks about it. \u00b7 This is an edited extract from Parag Khanna&apos;s book The Second World: Empires and Influences in the New Global Order, which will be published next week  paragkhanna.com", "tags": ["China", "Tibet", "World news", "Xinjiang", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-25T00:02:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/mar/25/sport.comment", "sentences": ["Unfortunately, there will be no such crowds in Pyongyang this week as Fifa has moved the game against South Korea to Shanghai.", "The South won&apos;t be worried about playing in Shanghai&apos;s Hongkou Stadium which, unlike its Kim Il-Sung equivalent, does not boast artificial grass or 100,000 partisan fans.&quot; The world saw the enthusiastic South Korean fans at the 2002 World Cup, including supporters in the North, although the victory over Italy was belatedly broadcast after authorities had initially considered ignoring the entire competition."], "title": "Football: John Duerden meets North Korea midfielder An Yong-hak", "article": "&quot;Seventy-five per cent of games is what you need to qualify for a work permit for England, isn&apos;t it? That could be one benefit of North Korea not playing so much,&quot; joked An Yong-hak. The Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea midfielder may harbour dreams of playing in the Premier League, but it is Wednesday&apos;s World Cup qualifier between the two Koreas that provided our main topic of conversation as we sat cross-legged on the floor of a packed restaurant just south of Seoul. As tongues wagged, cow tongues sizzled on the grill in front of us. &quot;Try this,&quot; said An. &quot;This food is not so popular in Korea, but it is in Japan.&quot; And An should know. Born and raised in Japan, he plays his club football for South Korea&apos;s biggest club Suwon Samsung Bluewings and, were he not injured, would be facing some of his team-mates, playing in North Korea&apos;s second World Cup qualifier. In footballing terms, it is a unique situation but there are around 600,000 Koreans living in Japan - descendants of immigrants who arrived on the archipelago, in many cases against their will, during the second world war to help alleviate labour shortages of the country that colonised South Korea between 1910 and 1945. &quot;My grandparents went to Japan before Korea gained independence,&quot; An explained. &quot;My mother and father were born and raised in Japan. My nationality is Chosun (Chosun was the Korean name for Korea before it split, a term still used in the North but not in the South) but now the Korean peninsula is divided into North and South so, technically, my nationality no longer exists. I went to a school that follows the North Korean education system. I received a passport from the North. I have no Japanese passport. My life is deeply connected to the history of the Korean peninsula.&quot; An first arrived in the southern half of the peninsula in 2006, signing for Busan I&apos;Park after four seasons in Japan with Albirex Niigata and Nagoya Grampus Eight. Busan&apos;s manager at the time, Ian Porterfield, had never seen him in action, but the late Scotsman stopped grumbling when it became apparent that the wiry six-footer was a player. After two years on the south coast An was traded with Suwon&apos;s 2002 World Cup hero Ahn Jung-hwan. An started playing for the North during qualification for the 2006 World Cup and he only visits the secretive nation when summoned for international team duty. &quot;At first, the atmosphere was not a welcoming one,&quot; he recalled. &quot;The other players didn&apos;t know what kind of player I was and if I was good or not. But the situation is the same when you go to any new club. Now, we have become close. I don&apos;t have many chances to go to Pyongyang and I don&apos;t see the players often and can&apos;t speak with them by telephone. But because of that when we do meet we are very happy. The atmosphere in the team is very good, like a family.&quot; He may not be able to call his international team-mates but he is often on the phone to his friends in the South. An&apos;s lifestyle on the outskirts of the fast-paced, modern and increasingly international city of Seoul is likely to be a stark contrast to that of his North Korean peers 120 miles up the road in Pyongyang - a city that has been off-limits for over 60 years. Like his phone, his team belongs to that epitome of southern capitalism - Samsung, a company that ran a series of adverts in 2005 featuring the  sultry songstress from the South Lee Hyo-ri and Cho Myong-ae, a member of the Pyongyang-based Mansudae Art Troupe. The pair may have been born on the same peninsula but their differences in appearance, style and fashion shows just how far apart the nations have grown. The traditionally-dressed Cho said of the sexy Lee that she is &quot;beautiful, but with her dyed hair and everything, she doesn&apos;t look like a Korean woman&quot;. When a whole host of North Korean cheerleaders followed athletes south in the 2003 Deagu Universiade, sections of the southern media nostalgically compared the natural Korean beauty of the northern women to the fashionable, more westernised girls of Seoul. An, though, is not interested in local girls, as his high-school sweetheart has followed him to South Korea. A fan of Oasis and Green Day, a transfer to England would suit the girl who wants to one day attend the Reading Festival. An himself would also love to seal a transfer to the Premier League, meet his favourite player Cristiano Ronaldo and play in &quot;the best league in the world, with their big crowds and the fans so close to the pitch&quot;. Unfortunately, there will be no such crowds in Pyongyang this week as Fifa has moved the game against South Korea to Shanghai. Although hostilities between the two countries ended in 1953, they have never officially signed a peace treaty and so technically are still at war. This interview taking place at all was conditional upon there being no mention of politics whatsoever. For An, even talking about his background can be a matter of great sensitivity. (I have been warned that governments on both sides of the De-Militarised Zone dividing the peninsula will be reading this blog - although presumably they won&apos;t be leaving comments). Whatever his thoughts on the political situation, An is sorry that the match won&apos;t be taking place in Pyongyang, saying: &quot;It would be an advantage for us. We know the stadium, the pitch and the facilities. The South won&apos;t be worried about playing in Shanghai&apos;s Hongkou Stadium which, unlike its Kim Il-Sung equivalent, does not boast artificial grass or 100,000 partisan fans.&quot; The world saw the enthusiastic South Korean fans at the 2002 World Cup, including supporters in the North, although the victory over Italy was belatedly broadcast after authorities had initially considered ignoring the entire competition. &quot;Northern fans are different,&quot; said An. &quot;South Korean fans sing a lot, don&apos;t they? North Korean fans don&apos;t sing. They clap and shout and everything, but compared to fans in the South, they are quieter and support in a lot more of a simpler fashion.&quot; The last time the two Koreas met in a World Cup qualifier was in Doha in 1993 when the South won 3-0. That defeat led great leader Kim Il-sung to withdraw his underperforming team from international competition. The absence lasted five years, although dear leader Kim Jong-il didn&apos;t permit another tilt at the World Cup until 2006. That campaign ended in failure but suggested the beginnings of a decent team. The 2010 bid has started well - a preliminary win over Mongolia provided entry to the group stage, which kicked off with an impressive 1-0 win in Jordan. North Korea feel confident of reaching the next and final stage of qualification, but the closed door to the outside world can prevent access to games and vital experience. &quot;South Korea continuously qualify for World Cups,&quot; said Ahn. &quot;They play lots of friendly games against good teams. North Korea don&apos;t have that kind of experience. We don&apos;t play many games against strong teams from Europe or South America.&quot; There are other ways to get big-match experience. Another Japan-born North Korean international, one of three in the squad, is making waves and could perhaps become the first to play in Europe. An produces a picture of three players enjoying themselves at the Dead Sea - a welcome break after the Jordan victory. In the centre, arms crossed and the only one not wearing a red tracksuit, is a confident-looking Jong Tae-se. The Speedo-clad striker is North Korea&apos;s latest weapon and, unlike some of its ageing missiles, this one works fine. Two cracking goals in February, one each against South Korea and Japan, and 12 strikes in 24 appearances in the J-League for Kawasaki Frontale in 2007 has got the media in a lather. &quot;North Korea&apos;s Rooney&quot; or &quot;The People&apos;s Rooney&quot; is his nickname in Seoul, although the powerful and pacy striker said last week that he sees himself as more of an Adebayor or a Drogba. His background, however, is very different from most strikers. Jong&apos;s family background is South Korean and, although he was born in Japan and educated under a North Korean education system, he is a South Korean citizen. His attempt to revoke that citizenship - Jong adorns the cover of the latest edition of the Korean FourFourTwo with the headline &quot;I am not South Korean&quot; alongside his smiling face - was refused by Seoul, which doesn&apos;t recognise North Korea as a country. It is not a simple situation, but nobody in the North will care either way if Jong shoots the team to a first World Cup for 44 years. There is nothing that An would love more. &quot;In North Korea, the 1966 games are still the stuff of legend,&quot; said An, who has the DVD of the BBC documentary &apos;The Game of their Lives&apos; at home. &quot;The players are still treated well and the goalscorers are still heroes. They made history.&quot; But as I was dropped off at the local subway station for the fast train back to Seoul, the deafening noise of the low-flying fighter jets returning to a nearby US Air Base provided a stark reminder that history is still very much a part of the present on the Korean peninsula.

Tonight is make or break for the Lions of Mesopotamia and Team Melli as the second round of World Cup qualifiers take place. It should be a routine job for both. Iraq take on Qatar - effectively a home fixture for both teams as Baghdad is as likely to stage an international match as it is a 50 Cent concert - while Iran travel to Kuwait City to take on arguably West Asia&apos;s worst team. Yet both are embroiled in off-the-pitch turmoil, having dispensed with the services of supposedly troublesome foreign managers. You have to feel most sorry for Egil Olsen. The Norwegian tactician, ex-Crazy Gang, erm, gang master and card-carrying, welly-wearing communist has, or should I say, had, the hardest job in international football. The Iraqi national team job is fraught with pitfalls, and Olsen had been wooed for years to take on the challenge of moulding the absurdly talented Iraqis into a world force. Then, almost as soon as they got their man, they sacked him. After one competitive game. Why? The official reason was that he refused to travel to the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Erbil for a training camp on safety grounds. Unofficially, Iraq&apos;s tepid performance in the 1-1 draw against China last month burst the team&apos;s sense of invincibility garnered from their incredible Asian Cup victory. Olsen was also rumoured to be carrying an injury that rendered him less proactive on the training pitch. No one should be surprised at the Iraqi FA&apos;s behaviour. Despite braving death threats against him and his family, fleeing his home and then bravely coming out of hiding to lead the team once more, former coach Akram Ahmad Salman was sacked a few months later for losing 1-0 to Saudi Arabia in the 2007 Gulf Cup. And to think Premier League managers feel they have it tough. The match in Doha should be routine but without influential playmaker Nashat Akram, suspended after being stupidly sent off against China, and taking into account a Qatar team full of ringers that&apos;s still smarting after being thumped by Australia, it&apos;s no foregone conclusion. Draw and they are still in with a chance, but lose and they will miss out on a World Cup appearance that could have had the biggest social and political ramifications of any sporting event since Bobby Fischer brought down communism single handedly in 1972. Possibly. George Bush will no doubt be keeping his fingers crossed for a convincing Iraqi display. Iran isn&apos;t so much in crisis as in torpor. Iranians, brought up on a diet of crisp attacking football, have had to endure five straight games without a goal, including last month&apos;s first qualifier against Syria, which ended 0-0. The Iranian FA clearly blamed the insipid displays on the will-he-won&apos;t-he tug of love that surrounded the appointment of ex-Spain coach Javier Clemente. It ended acrimoniously with Clemente refusing to be based in Iran. You can hardly blame him: it must have been a hard sell trying to convince his wife of the merits of glamorous Tehran. What was a surprise was the man they turned to - a young ex-player with just one season of coaching under his belt. But Ali Daei is no ordinary ex-player. Since bursting on to the scene in the late 80s, he went on to break the world record for the most international goals scored whilst plying his trade in the Bundesliga. As he banged them in for Armenia Bielefeld, Bayern Munich and Hertha Berlin (Chelsea fans will remember him well after he scored twice against them in the Champions League) he became an embodiment of the Iranian zeitgeist among a public still isolated from the aftermath of the 1979 revolution. As captain, Daei lead the team to their greatest triumph, victory over the US at France 98, before returning to Tehran as the country&apos;s most popular man, conqueror of fields in European lands and vanquisher of the Great Satan. His wedding was even broadcast live on state TV. Think Diana meets David Beckham. Like Beckham, he is considered a heart-throb, has a huge sports clothing empire and even has a slight speech impediment and high-pitched voice, which he is lightly chided for. Daei finally hung up his boots after the 2006 World Cup in which a crop of outstanding players failed to live up to their dark horse billing. Daei was off the pace and offered little in his first game against Mexico. The fans pinpointed him as the weakest link, he was dropped and, some fans claimed, booed - unthinkable a few years previously. Call it his &apos;Argentina moment&apos; if you will. But just as Beckham played like a man possessed in the aftermath of his sending off at France 98, Daei braved the ridicule and took his first coaching job with Saipa FC. Twelve months later he won his first title, in his first season. The decision by the Iranian FA to make him manager was a clever one. Most fans were expecting a big name foreign signing, or the popular Iranian American coach of Persepolis, Afshin Ghotbi. But in Iran no one commands respect like Daei (OK, maybe Ayatollah Khamenei) and his ability to bring unity to the national team shouldn&apos;t be underestimated. For anyone questioning his experience, Slaven Bilic was hardly dripping in European silverware before he masterminded England&apos;s Euro 2008 downfall. But if Kuwait spring one of the great surprises of Middle Eastern football, Daei and his squad are likely to be lynched on arrival at Imam Khomeini Airport. Which, in a way, is pretty strong motivation. Elsewhere, the Socceroos are continuing on their mission to prove that switching to the Asian confederation wasn&apos;t a huge mistake, although for Australian fans attending today&apos;s game against China, it might have looked like a dodgy decision with Australia reliant on an 89th-minute penalty save by Mark Schwarzer to hold on for a point. The location proved a leveller, with the game played in Kunming, 2,000 metres above sea level. The thin air, coupled with China&apos;s newly acquired reputation for being the hard men of international football - they kicked Japan and South Korea off the park in the recent East Asian Championships - helped to level the gulf in class. One of either Singapore or Lebanon will also see their World Cup dreams effectively end today. Both lost their opening group game but Singapore has the advantage, following the fine result against Australia. And it always helps when the opposition&apos;s best players are denied visas. According to Emile Rustom, the team&apos;s head coach, four Germany-based players - Lebanon&apos;s only professional players - have all been denied travel visas. Japan, meanwhile, may find things a little trickier in Manama when they take on Bahrain. The Reds brushed aside Oman in their first game before securing a 1-0 friendly victory over Iran last weekend. But the tie of the round, in terms of political intrigue, takes place in Shanghai between North and South Korea. The match was due to be played in Pyongyang but a row erupted after the North Koreans refused to allow their southern brothers to hoist their flag or sing their national anthem. For the players, the match is a chance to indulge in some Korean fraternity. But for the authorities, especially in the North, the match is a publicity coup waiting to happen. A South Korean win might not be enough to have the North Korean coach sent for &apos;re-education&apos; somewhere in the northern mountains, but by Thursday morning there should be a few more names to join Clemente and Olsen on the Asian managerial scrap-heap.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "World Cup 2010", "North Korea", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-26T11:39:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/mar/26/londonmayoraldebatelive", "sentences": ["A questioner at the front indignantly asks what the &quot;embassies&quot; - starting in Shanghai and Beijing - have actually achieved."], "title": "London mayoral debate - Wednesday 26 March 2008", "article": "Where am I?

It&apos;s organised by London First, a body representing 300 major London-based companies. All the stars will be out: Boris Johnson, Ken Livingstone and Brian Paddick, with TV&apos;s Nick Ross in the chair. I&apos;m in a chair too. It&apos;s light grey with a steel frame and surprisingly comfortable. Two floors below and to my right, people in suits are small talking and sampling canap\u00e9s. Wish they&apos;d send some up here. Proceedings will begin at 6.30, by which time I expect my view will blocked by representatives of the uber capitalist class. Thank goodness I have a clean hankie. Back in a bit.  6.27 The glamour has arrived. Ken&apos;s being interviewed by Reuters, Brian&apos;s tucking in his shirt and there&apos;s Sian Berry, the Green candidate making sure she gets a good seat. Boris has yet to waft up in the lift. Canapes must be good.  6.53 Ok hob-nobbing over. Ken and Boris have had their photo taken together , both grinning genially. The place is nicely full, Sian too is on the panel - why didn&apos;t I know that before? - and following a few words of introduction she kicks off. She stresses that a well designed city works with human nature and London has a lot of work to do. Tailoring her message, she regres the loss of local industries and asks for a more resilient economy - a greener, more local one - before praising the work of London assembly members Darren Johnson and Jenny Jones. We need o boost small, green industries she says, and wants all new developments to have 60 percent affordable housing, much of it for rent. She&apos;s for free insulation and repeats her pledge to close City airport. On transport she wans more choice - cheaper public transport, more cycling provision, and smoother traffic flows at lower speeds. It&apos;s a confident performance. Warm applause.  7.01 Boris goes next. He starts with his &quot;Mayor Leavingsoon&quot; gag., then talks about how he&apos;ll be listening to business before bashing Ken about his opposition to PPP for the Underground and talking up his plans for a no-strike deal on the Tube. He attacks Ken&apos;s gas guzzler charge, likening any likely emissions loss to that generated by a herd of cows (small chuckling near the front). He presses his crime buttons - more police on buses, more police the streets, and bringing in neighbourhood crime mapping. He&apos;s the man, he says, who&apos;s operated in the private ector and understands what business needs. Warm applause once more. 7.10 Ken talks about a coalition of interests that&apos;s prepared London for globalisation. He points to his record for reaching out to the world, including those &quot;foreign embassies&quot; his critics get cross about. There&apos;s a lot of bashing Boris, accusing him of parochialism and talks of his success in keeping London ahead of Paris and Frankfurt and now being compared with New York. He stresses that running City Hall is &quot;a genuine big business&quot; - \u00a311 billion budget and all that - and it&apos;s important it&apos;s managed correctly. As is now his habit, he invokes Crossrail: we daren&apos;t go over budget or let Whitehall ruin it like they do every other big project. There will be big money, spent finding the right people to deliver it and says his record proves he&apos;ll spend it wisely. The question of competence is important, he stresses, meaningfully. It all boils down to - I&apos;ve done it before, I can do it again. Not like this blond fellow here. 7.12 Paddick has to work harder to establish his credibility. He stresses that the organisation he&apos;s had a big hand in running - the Met - was no small potato and required considerable management skills. As usual, he spoke persuasively on crime, emphasising that a safe city is vital for business. Bullishly, he picked on Ken, continuing their fight over whether the Tube would run better under a &quot;concession model&quot; like Dockland Light Railway. Ken calls that &quot;privatisation.&quot;  7.26 Questions from the audience centre on transport. Ross asks how anything else can be improved if all the effort goes into Crossrail. Ken again puts on his authoritative voice, talking about how the government will pick up the bill for Tube improvements and Crossrail will be entirely separate. There follows a great deal of complicated stuff about contracts before one of the few environmentalists in the audience asks why we don&apos;t take the lead in putting more money into improving air quality. Whack the air traveler he cries. Ken says if he had the power he&apos;d have everyone on trains to Paris instead of planes but, sadly, he&apos;s not allowed.  7.39 Now Ken&apos;s justifying taking the government to court over PPP. Then Ross asks Boris if he&apos;d risk the bad press that would come with spending big on experts to deliver Crossrail. He replies that he&apos;d want the best people, but he&apos;s quite sure money hasn&apos;t been well spent by Ken in general. Ross mves them on to the congestion charge. Boris says he applauds Ken&apos;s Thatcherite introduction of road pricing, but says the western extension isn&apos;t working very well. It&apos;s about time residents were asked again how it&apos;s going. Ross puts it to Ken that the initial consultation was &quot;a frace&quot;. Ken says &quot;Absolutely not.&quot; Surprise! Will Brian or Sian get another word in? 7.44 At last, Brian joins the conversation. He&apos;s a battler alright. He sticks up for small businesses damaged, he says, by the new Low Emissions Zone. The different bits of policy don&apos;t add up, he contends. Sian comes in to say she&apos;d give those worried small traders a loan to &quot;green&quot; their vehicles. Boris is becoming agitated, but at this point I&apos;ve no idea quite why.  7.55 Ken&apos;s wearing his amused, avuncular look as Boris grumbles about London embassies in Venezuela. He&apos;s playing the value-for-money card again, which may or may not impress the executive class fliers in the hall. Sian says we ought to have embassies in other cities to help spread good practice. A questioner at the front indignantly asks what the &quot;embassies&quot; - starting in Shanghai and Beijing - have actually achieved. Ken. very smooth, says its helped with inward investment. A punter who went on one of Ken&apos;s overseas trips - paying his own pay - says it was a great success for him. He&apos;s not making a political point he says, but thought the trips represented &quot;excellent value.&quot; Ken appears to be blushing.  8.01 Conversation has moved on to accountability, with Boris lingering on the Evening Standard&apos;s investigations into grants provided by the London Development Agency. He wants more transparency about the business conections of mayoral advisers. Brian says he wants &quot;hard headed business people&quot; to make sure money is better spent. Then the spotlight falls on Ken. A small hush descends. His line is the one he&apos;s used all along: relatively small sums of money are involved, some buisnesses are bound to fail, if anyone&apos;s stolen LDA money he hopes they are punished by the Law. Brian says that lots of deserving groups have never enjoyed LDA largesse because Ken&apos;s advisers have too much influence over who is favoured. Ken calls the Standard&apos;s stories &quot;bizarre.&quot; 8.06 Boris talks about the need to encourage and protect small businesses, contrasting this with Ken&apos;s conversion for mega-capitalism. He says he&apos;s in favour of &quot;tall buildings in the right place&quot;. Ken asks &quot;who&apos;s in favour of them in the wrong place?&quot; Guffaws from the audience. Boris and Ken are sitting next to each other in the centre seats. They seem to be getting on famously.  8.11 Boris challenges Ken to name the donors to his re-election fund. He says he&apos;d post his on YouTube. Ross asks if London comes first or the party the candidates belong to. Boris says London. Brian points out that that Boris hasn&apos;t a great record in the House when it comes to speaking on London issues. Ken joins in, doing his amiable assassin thing. Boris says he loves London too and why should Ken get away with posing as the only one who does? 8.17: Aha, a joke question! How would the candidates wish to be remembered in a rap? Brian says he saw two Muslim women rapping last night. It was nice, but rapping&apos;s not his thing. Boris admits his mind has gone &quot;uncharacteristically blank.&quot; Ken dodges the question by recalling once appearing on a Blur album. Sian says something about a spooky bit in Michael Jackson&apos;s Thriller but I can&apos;t hear her very well. I think I&apos;m losing the plot. Perhaps we all are.  8.32 And that&apos;s yer lot. Apologies to Sian for not knowing she&apos;d be on the panel. Brian&apos;s &quot;people&quot; ask me to mention that their man was the only one drinking tap water instead of bottled and that the Evening Standard&apos;s photographer has &quot;vote Brian&quot; stickers on his cameras.

The latest Ferragamo perfume is named Tuscan Soul. The label&apos;s pride in its Italian heritage is so strong that Ferrucio Ferragamo, son of the founder, yesterday described as &quot;written in stone&quot; his commitment that all Ferragamo products will be made in Italy forever. But yesterday the Ferragamo company celebrated their 80th anniversary not in Florence, but in a reproduction of the Palazzo Spini Feroni constructed for the night on the banks of the Huang Pu river in Shanghai. It was an event which speaks volumes about the luxury industry&apos;s current obsession with conquering the Chinese market. Not since the Japanese fell in love with logos in the 1980s has the luxury sector been so single-minded in its pursuit of one market. The waterfront of the Huang Pu river, known as the Bund, has become the frontline of the fierce battle being fought for the hearts, minds and, crucially, disposable income of the burgeoning Chinese middle class. This imposing block of colonial-era buildings lay dormant for half a century after the revolution of 1949, but is now set to become the Fifth Avenue of China. Giorgio Armani already has an enormous 1,100 square metre flagship store here. Salvatore Ferragamo&apos;s strategy in China is an audacious one. The brand has a highly respected heritage due to the visionary designs of its founder, who was shoemaker to Greta Garbo, Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, as well as Eva Peron and Margaret Thatcher. Salvatore Ferragamo himself died in 1960 and, compared to the likes of Dior and Vuitton, Ferragamo is currently a relative bit player in the luxury field. But in the virgin shopping malls of China, the company sees no reason why it cannot reinvent itself as a premier league name - and in doing so, make a killing. &quot;Most western people can only remember the names of five or six Chinese cities, even though there are 20 cities with more than five million people in them. In the same way, most Chinese people can only remember five or six western brand names,&quot; says Michele Norsa, CEO of Salvatore Ferragamo. &quot;What is fundamental in China is to establish ourselves soon.&quot; If they succeed, Norsa sees no reason why the Ferragamo name cannot become one of those top six. Ferragamo hopes to use the fact that China was for so long cut off from western consumerism to its advantage, as a chance to rewrite fashion history. Speaking to the International Herald Tribune, Angelica Cheung, the editor-in-chief of Vogue China, reported that Chinese consumers &quot;want to be told what to buy.&quot; For now the field is relatively open. Gucci has established itself strongly - sales in China rose 168% in 2007 on top of 65% growth in 2006 - but there is still room for other brands to bag the lucrative top spots. Ferragamo, having reported strong financial results for 2007, with record net profits that rose 34.2% to \u20ac47.1m, are now planning a listing on the stock market to raise funds for a major bid for China. Last night&apos;s gala dinner - preceded by a fashion show and two performances by ballet dancer Roberto Bolle, all lit by Murano glass chandeliers and staged against walls frescoed in the Florentine style - reflects Norsa&apos;s belief that this new market cannot be won by traditional advertising. &quot;To penetrate China is still difficult. Magazines do not necessarily have the wide reach that they do in the west.&quot; But the Chinese, just like the west, are celebrity obsessed, and star-studded occasions receive much attention. &quot;Events have a huge return on investment in China,&quot; says Norsa. Ferragamo also hopes to take advantage of the sober tastes of the Chinese, which they believe are suited to their brand.

The label&apos;s pride in its heritage is so strong that Ferrucio Ferragamo, son of the founder, yesterday described as &quot;written in stone&quot; his commitment that all Ferragamo products will be made in Italy forever. But yesterday the company celebrated its 80th anniversary in a reproduction of the palazzo built on the banks of the Huangpu River in Shanghai. It was an event which speaks volumes about the luxury industry&apos;s obsession with the Chinese market. Not since the Japanese fell in love with logos in the 1980s has the sector been so single minded in its pursuit of one market. Ferragamo&apos;s strategy is an audacious one. The brand has a highly respected heritage but compared to Dior and Vuitton, Ferragamo is currently a bit player in the luxury field. But in the virgin shopping malls of China, the company sees no reason why it cannot reinvent itself as a premier league name. &quot;Most western people can only remember the names of five or six Chinese cities, even though there are 20 cities with more than five million people. In the same way, most Chinese people can only remember five or six western brand names,&quot; says Michele Norsa, CEO of Salvatore Ferragamo. &quot;What is fundamental is to establish ourselves soon.&quot; Ferragamo hopes to use the fact that China was for so long cut off from western consumerism to its advantage: as a chance to rewrite fashion history. For now the field is relatively open. Gucci has established itself - sales in China rose 168% in 2007 on top of 65% growth in 2006 - but there is still room for other brands. Ferragamo, having reported strong financial results for 2007, with record net profits that rose 34.2% to \u20ac47.1m (\u00a337.2m), is planning a listing on the stock market to raise funds for a major push in China. Last night&apos;s gala dinner, preceded by a fashion show featuring top Chinese and European catwalk models and two performances by ballet dancer Roberto Bolle, all lit by Murano glass chandeliers and staged against walls frescoed in the Florentine style, reflects Norsa&apos;s belief this new market cannot be won by traditional advertising.&quot;Magazines do not have the wide reach that they do in the west.&quot; But the Chinese, just like the west, are celebrity obsessed, and star-studded occasions receive much attention. &quot;Events have a huge return on investment in China,&quot; says Norsa. Ferragamo also hopes to take advantage of the sober tastes of the Chinese. While new Russian luxury consumers have a voracious appetite for bling, the Chinese have a more understated aesthetic. &quot;The Chinese want daytime luxury. If you go into the Ferragamo store in Moscow, the heels will be very high; in China, the shoes have lower heels, but exclusive materials such as crocodile and alligator are very popular,&quot; says Norsa This suits Ferragamo, whose iconic products include the boxy handbags favoured by Margaret Thatcher and the Vara flat patent ballet pump, first introduced in 1978 and reissued this year as the Varina.

Chanel The Global Luxury Brand Survey found Gucci to be the &quot;most coveted luxury brand&quot; but in China, the top spot went to Chanel. Ermenegildo Zegna The Italian menswear label has a high profile in China where male products - unlike the west - account for the majority of the luxury market. Coach The American leather goods company, which has never made a play for the European market, hopes to make a splash in China.

That&apos;s not the only topsy-turvy thing around here. Take our location: the Bengal Club, the leading social club in Calcutta, former capital of British India. There was a time when it wouldn&apos;t have let the likes of Bajoria through the door. &quot;In the Bengal Club, they don&apos;t allow dogs or Indians,&quot; reported Somerset Maugham in 1938, &quot;but in the Yacht Club in Bombay they don&apos;t mind dogs; it&apos;s only Indians they don&apos;t allow.&quot; Calcutta is now called Kolkata and the Bengal Club&apos;s receptionist soon tumbles from wobbly English into Hindi, but the colonial relics are still on display. There are stern, 10ft-tall portraits of club luminaries Macpherson, Metcalfe and Marten. The only one who lets on that running the Raj might be slightly more fun than a spell in Guant\u00e1namo is William Bracken, a customs collector. He wears evening dress and what looks suspiciously like a smirk. Upstairs in the tearoom are Kolkata&apos;s modern burrasahibs, its ruling class, and there in the corner is Bajoria. With trimmed beard and white national dress, he could be a reformed poet. Instead, he&apos;s something much newer to these parts: the owner of an Indian multinational. A decade ago, Indian businesses rarely ventured aboard. Yet in the past few years, Bajoria&apos;s steel firm has bought rivals in Britain, America, Brazil and China. And last year, Indians bought nearly $18bn worth (\u00a39bn) of western companies; more than five times the value of western takeovers in India. Breaking off to check his mobile, he says, almost apologetically, &quot;One of my team is in Germany, looking at another acquisition.&quot; There&apos;s a common theme to these Indian takeovers, thinks Bajoria. &quot;For years, globalisation was something the west did to the rest. Now the boot&apos;s on the other foot.&quot; How should westerners feel about that role reversal? &quot;If I were them I&apos;d be bloody worried.&quot; Then Bajoria, who knows the UK so well he can tell you the train times from Charing Cross to Tunbridge Wells, tries to think up some consolations, before giving up. &quot;It&apos;s a big change. Of course I&apos;d be worried.&quot;  A funny thing happened to the world economy this year: it tilted. Pretty much ever since the 60s, America had been the undisputed centre of business. It had the biggest economy; the No 1 economic model (or so the zealots kept telling everyone); the blue-chip banks; the world-beating businesses. Le d\u00e9fiam\u00e9ricain was how France referred to Ford, IBM and the rest, meaning the American challenge. Then came last summer and the biggest banking crisis America has had in decades. The economy? Almost certainly in recession. The model? Obviously, no longer so exemplary. The banks? Some of the biggest are being propped up by money from governments in the Middle East and China. Amid all this, Asia is booming. China is the world&apos;s fastest growing economy, and India&apos;s national income is rising like never before. This shift of economic power from west to east, and other developing countries, has been going on quietly for a long time - but the credit crunch has both accelerated and exposed it for all to see. Then there are the business deals, those rough and ready reckoners of where economic power lies. Tata announced this week that it would take over Jaguar and Land Rover. Both firms are in the DNA of British manufacturing and the seller is Ford, one of those American corporate imperialists so deplored by the French. Whatever this deal&apos;s strategic purpose, its symbolic significance is undeniable. The British press wrote up the \u00a31bn sale as another paragraph in the obituary of a once great manufacturing base. On the subcontinent, newspapers chalked up another victory for &quot;India Inc&quot;. &quot;Tatas rule Britannia,&quot; crowed the Times of India on its front page: &quot;It took a company from a former colony to come to the rescue of a beleaguered British brand.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t like all this &apos;India Inc&apos; talk,&quot; says R Gopalakrishnan, executive director at Tata, when we meet just before the deal is confirmed. Can he see why there might be British sensitivities about two iconic businesses being run by an Indian firm? &quot;No. Isn&apos;t Harrods run by a foreigner?&quot; Gopalakrishnan&apos;s press officer cuts in to suggest Tata might not care to be cast as the next Mohamed Al Fayed.  Take two. &quot;We are not even at the start of this process of acquisitions. Indians will buy many more companies.&quot; His two gold rings catch the light and twirl it around the room. &quot;And we will compete with the west in all the industries.&quot; We? He is a patriot after all. &quot;All the areas,&quot; Gopalakrishnan continues. &quot;From natural resources to aerospace.&quot; Is he suggesting India could soon make its own jet planes? &quot;Why not?&quot; It&apos;s easy to see why he has such confidence. In the past four years, India&apos;s economy has grown at its fastest ever and the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, claimed it could keep motoring at 9% per year.  But there is more to India&apos;s optimism than economic growth, thinks Karan Paul, head of the Apeejay Surendra conglomerate which has interests in everything from Typhoo tea to shipping. &quot;Nowadays, people want things to feel Indian,&quot; he tells me by the pool at one of his hotels. &quot;Our music TV channels used to be in English - now they&apos;re in Hindi. The elite watch all the Bollywood movies they used to sneer at.&quot; Two events, he thinks, got Indians ready for superpower status. The first was the atomic missile test of 1998, when India finally admitted it had nuclear bombs. &quot;We were suddenly part of a select club.&quot; More useful, though, was the building of a highway that linked the major cities. &quot;We obviously have huge issues with poverty and with our infrastructure. But the national highway showed India could do more than incremental change - we could make a quantum leap.&quot;  Just around the corner from Paul&apos;s hotel is a huge hoarding: &quot;It&apos;s not important how you start, but how you finish - Kolkata Next&quot;. Some forecasts for where India goes next go a bit heavy on the spice. India&apos;s Century, by the commerce minister Kamal Nath, is a book on how &quot;the 21st century is poised to be India&apos;s century&quot;. By 2020, Nath writes, Davos will no longer be, well, Davos - instead the World Economic Forum should move its meeting place to Mumbai (Kashmir offers great skiing, apparently). And the New York Times might consider relocating to China or India, which will &quot;offer the largest markets for the products they advertise&quot;. About four years ago, Kamlesh Pandey came up with a TV advert for an after-dinner digestive. It showed an Indian executive being chauffeured around London. On driving past the headquarters of the East India Company, he orders his assistant to buy it. &quot;For hundreds of years, they ruled us,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it&apos;s our turn.&quot; How, I ask Pandey, did you dream up that idea? &quot;My friend, Subhash Chandra [a TV mogul] bought a British company,&quot; he says. &quot;He did it out of patriotism - to show the British. So what did he buy? &quot;He hunted till he found the original East India Company.&quot; It was in shipping, a business Chandra knew nothing about. &quot;We all said: are you crazy?&quot; That didn&apos;t matter; he&apos;d shown them. Any superpower, however, surely needs more guiding values than vengeance. Is India an alternative to the American business model, or an imitator? I put that question to Nirupam Sen, the minister for industry in Kolkata and the surrounding state of West Bengal. Part of a Marxist regional government that has been in elected power for the past 30 years, Sen has his office in the Writers&apos; Building in Kolkata. Formerly the redbrick home for clerks of the Raj, it is now guarded by a massive statue of three freedom fighters wielding fierce-looking handguns. Surely he&apos;ll strike a defiant note? Sadly not. &quot;India is becoming a fully-fledged capitalist state,&quot; he says. &quot;We are privatising our industries and falling deeper under American influence.&quot; Even for a party that often tussles with the national government this seems severe. Lots of industries are still in state hands and the prices of many goods are capped to protect the less well-off - the constitution even requires that India be &quot;socialist&quot;. What about his own state government, which has cleared agricultural land for the benefit of big business investors (including Tata)? At least, Sen argues, &quot;the Bengal government requires any business coming here to provide proper facilities for workers. Other states don&apos;t do that.&quot;  In his office is a 3ft portrait of Lenin, only partly obscured by a bunch of long-stemmed flowers. Sen meets the likes of IBM and Microsoft in this room; how do they react to his hero? He grins.  There&apos;s obviously a way to go before India looks too much like America. It&apos;s not just Marxist ministers who don&apos;t take after their western counterparts; it is also the business people. Bajoria writes briefings for the Marxist government; Tata gives a third of its profits to charity; then there was the young banker I met on the metro who said: &quot;For most Indians, capitalism is a foreign word.&quot; For westerners, the most immediate impact from the fast-growing India and China has been a higher cost of living. Despite the US and UK facing a severe slump, oil remains well over $100 a barrel. That and the higher price of a variety of commodities, from steel to soybeans, is often largely down to increased demand from Asia.  Over the longer term, the sheer size of the two new giants could force a rejig of markets - and companies. Distributing novels over mobile phones has been a big hit in China, so John Makinson, head of Penguin books, is introducing it in India. &quot;There used to be a cultural hauteur among publishers: an idea had to prove itself in New York or London first - then we&apos;d export it to India and China,&quot; he says. &quot;Now we&apos;ll take something that works first in Beijing or Delhi and try it elsewhere.&quot; In finance, Shanghai and Mumbai may soon rival Wall Street and the City for influence, thinks Frank Hancock at ABN Amro in India. The man who put the billions in place for Tata to buy Corus, Hancock says: &quot;Stockmarkets in India and China are growing so fast they could easily be as big as Wall Street within a decade. If that happens, it might be that a crash in Mumbai sends shockwaves through New York - rather than the other way around.&quot; These predictions do not hinge on economics so much as demographics. India and China have such big populations that, as they get tied into the global economy, they can&apos;t help but have huge impacts on the rest of the world.  &quot;We could be going back to a division of the world economy such as we had before the Industrial Revolution, where India and China once again dominate due to sheer size,&quot; says Greg Clark, an economic historian at the University of California. &quot;They could constitute a demographic dictatorship.&quot; What does he mean? &quot;For over 200 years, the west has had its own way. Now it will no longer be able to get its resources so cheap. Nor should we carry on expecting the rest of the world to learn English, say.&quot; Economists do not usually talk about power; they prefer to talk about trade. At first, Clark sticks to the script, and reminds me that 40% of his Californian students are of Chinese origin. But as he goes on he looks increasingly doubtful. &quot;As well as Shakespeare, British children might have to struggle through Chinese or Urdu classics.&quot; There&apos;s a long pause. &quot;A lot of people might not like that.

This, plus a bit of bad luck for our main competitors, has lifted us to fourth in the championship and put us right back in the mix. The weekend was extremely competitive, with only half a second between the top 10 teams in practice. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s because teams are getting more and more competitive as we near the end of the season or if it was the amended circuit, but there was certainly no margin for error in Mexico. I was pleased to see Ireland get their first ever win. They&apos;re a hardworking outfit and it was great to see them succeed - particularly as it meant they prevented our main competitors clocking up the points! It was particularly apt given that it was St Patrick&apos;s weekend - not that the Irish crew ever need an excuse to celebrate as they definitely have the reputation as the biggest party team in the paddock! I&apos;m sure they were on their usual form from the chequered flag until their flight home on Monday! Despite fantastic support from an extremely vocal home crowd, who really got behind the Mexican team chanting and doing Mexican waves, the local squad had a dismal weekend. It was the same for South Africa in Durban last time out. I&apos;m not too superstitious, but I hope it&apos;s not the curse of the home nation - I&apos;m looking for a repeat of last year&apos;s performance at Brands Hatch. As well as the massive cheering for the Mexican driver, there were also a lot of boos for the US during the drivers parade and the feature race podium where the US came third - it&apos;s possibly a bit mean on the US driver Jonathan Summerton, but at least the Mexicans were getting behind the whole national pride ethos of A1GP! Mexico has definitely been a good track for the Brits and it was nice to return to the scene of our maiden victory, but it is quite a tough event behind the scenes. Mexico City is one of the largest and most polluted places in the world - it&apos;s a nightmare dealing with the traffic getting to and from the track and, once there, it&apos;s often difficult dealing with the bureaucracy and policing system, making it a challenge to get jobs done. Once again, there were a few illnesses in the paddock as people struggled to work in the humid conditions or ate food they shouldn&apos;t. But that is just something we have to deal with at the majority of A1GP races - I&apos;d far rather work in warm climates than in a cold, wet, windy paddock in the UK! And although I think one of the benefits of travelling with a job is tasting the local cuisine, sometimes it&apos;s worth just holding back and going for the western-style food as we cannot afford to risk any illnesses within our small squad. Since Mexico is not one of our target markets commercially, it&apos;s a relatively quiet event for us in terms of guest attendance and promotional activities, but this didn&apos;t mean we had time to relax, because with Brands Hatch just round the corner, we are extremely busy with the build-up to the season finale. We&apos;ve also started to prepare for next season, testing out new British talent with the likes of Duncan Tappy joining the team as our rookie driver. Jarvis is a fantastic asset to the British A1GP entry in many ways, and although he now signs off this season to concentrate on his DTM commitments, he will still be very much a part of the team in an official capacity off-track until the end of the season, and I&apos;m sure British fans will see him back in the cockpit in the new Ferrari car next season.

And let us not forget John Lennon, who imagined a better world and became a symbol for the peace movement, when he sang Give Peace and Chance. Then there was Paul Simon who defied the cultural boycott against South Africa to record his acclaimed album Graceland, and who once said in an interview that he thought he had contributed to the downfall of apartheid. In his song about the late Steve Biko, leader of South Africa&apos;s Black Consciousness movement, who was brutally murdered by the Apartheid state, Peter Gabriel wrote prophetically, &quot;You can blow out a candle, but you can&apos;t blow out a fire.

The plunge from the pomp of the official opening by the Queen on 14 March to BA chief executive Willy Walsh finding his job on the line after more than 200 cancelled flights has been dramatic. This is no longer about &apos;teething problems&apos;, it raises fundamental questions about the private sector&apos;s capabilities, values and priorities. On the morning of Day One, Walsh was smiling, welcoming the first passengers to his wonderful new terminal. The website assured readers that Terminal 5&apos;s baggage-handling system &apos;will move your bags through the airport faster than you can move yourself&apos;.  What happened next and who was responsible is contentious, but a system allegedly capable of handling 12,000 bags an hour broke down with a flow of half that. Suddenly, the sparse manning, insufficient dry runs, failure to test properly the new systems and lack of contingency planning by BAA, owner of the airport, and BA were exposed. Planes took off without baggage or were cancelled, a problem that has continued through the weekend. Distressed travellers paid inflated prices for emergency overnight hotels. The media went into overdrive, bringing us the bitter soundbites we cherish amid the all-too-familiar Heathrow-in-chaos story, even though many flights and passengers were taking off from the terminal as planned. None the less, 200 cancelled flights is 200 cancelled flights too many, especially when so much was promised. Once he appeared, Walsh apologised over and over.  The warning that a debacle was imminent was the self-confidence from both BA and BAA beforehand that all would be well. BA&apos;s priority under Walsh has been cost, with savings sought in manning and training. BAA has had similar priorities for decades and an unrivalled reputation for dysfunction. As their promises and boasts mounted, the patience of the gods clearly snapped. It is so sad - and so avoidable. BA remains a good airline, with many great staff who deserve better. When I turned up to take a look on Friday, the people on the ground could hardly have been more helpful, or crestfallen, about what had happened. Terminal 5 is a superb celebration of contemporary architecture, Richard Rogers on song. There is a generosity about the design that immediately lifts your spirits. Every opportunity has been seized to please the eye - vaulted ceilings and stunning glass-and-steel walls. I thought Shanghai and Madrid airports the world&apos;s best until I saw Terminal 5.  But such pride struggles against the cock-up, likely to be the first of many. Even if BA gets its act together, its partner remains BAA. I was at Terminal 4 a month ago when the baggage belts broke, causing far more cancelled flights; that was just a routine breakdown unworthy of media attention.  The problem is that airports, like power plants, printing presses or car factories, are complex. It is not just a question of having up-to-date equipment, like the celebrated 12 miles of computer-driven baggage belts at Terminal 5. It is having the organisational capability to run them continuously, a question of skill, employee engagement, management dexterity and punctilious observation of the right process. This is neither BAA&apos;s nor BA&apos;s strength. Like most of the British private sector, they suffer from deeply ingrained biases against smart working. Any company that wants to improve what it is doing has to invest in the skills of its employees. It is well known in management theory that you have to run the organisation at lower levels of output while time is set aside to invest in the new capability. The trade-off is delicate. Holding back means financial pain. On the other hand, trying to improve capability on the hoof, while simultaneously maintaining output, means corners are cut. Companies have to find the right balance. British companies, BA included, almost always decide to improve capability on the hoof. One BA baggage handler said there had been only four &apos;familiarisation days&apos; before Terminal 5 - a small city in scale - went live. On the day, there were problems of car park access, ID cards and lift systems. There were either no or poorly implemented contingency plans for broken computer or baggage systems. The derided public sector, for all its weaknesses, is much more organisationally robust. The trouble is that BA&apos;s short-term shareholders permit the company no other option. BA needs to meet expectations of growing dividends and profits from owners who have no commitment to its long-term future. There are City rumours that takeover predators are circling, with the Emirates most frequently cited. Willy Walsh might have cut costs to the bone as morale has crashed - a recent staff survey alarmingly reported that nearly 30 per cent of staff claim they had been bullied - but he is trying to secure his airline&apos;s independence.  Equally, BAA suffered years of neglect as it vainly tried to preserve its independence. Shareholders did not hesitate over it being taken over, with a crippling \u00a39bn of borrowed money by Spanish construction company Grupo Ferrovial, which knew next to nothing about the economics and politics of British airports.  Its principal interest now is raising passenger landing charges and raising traffic to service the crippling debt rather than improving infrastructure. In the circumstances, nobody should be surprised. A sane government would have overruled the merger because it implied too much debt. That, however, would have been considered &apos;anti-business&apos; because it would have constrained investment bankers&apos; bonuses by preventing a stupid takeover that was plainly against the travelling public&apos;s interest. To force BAA&apos;s management to think long term would have been &apos;interventionist&apos;.

No", "article": "The dinner party theory of conflict prevention runs like this: the world is getting richer, hundreds of millions of people are being borne up the social ladder by unprecedented global economic growth and as they get wealthier, these new planetary middle-class masses are inevitably going to become more like nice, educated, reasonable, middle-class people elsewhere - i.e. here. In short, they become the sort of people you&apos;d invite to dinner. I would like to believe this theory. As I would also like to believe the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention, the contention of American commentator Thomas Friedman that no two countries that both have McDonald&apos;s have fought a war against each other since those McDonald&apos;s arrived. Sadly, travelling through Europe, Asia and Africa over the last 10 years has left me increasingly sceptical about both of them. The dinner parties are certainly likely to be cosmopolitan affairs - the fast-growing Asian market is seen as a potential saviour of ailing Gallic viticulture and Britain&apos;s artisan cheeses are the joy of the world&apos;s foodies - but do not necessarily mean the dawning of a new era of global stability and peace. Why? First, because the internationalist, optimistic vision of Friedman and others relies heavily on a rejection of out-dated allegiances to &apos;the nation&apos; or any of the other myriad variety of imagined and constructed communities based, to paraphrase Ernest Renan, on having done great things together and wishing to do more and their replacement by a new, softer, more peaceable and more open international identity. Sadly, there is precious little evidence that this is happening. Yes, nation states might be weaker, but our attachment to them seems stronger than ever. A sense of national chauvinism appears often to be a corollary of a society developing economic wealth, rather than its opposite, and the last decade has been a period of identity politics of a sort never seen before. In Europe, and not just as a result of the credit crisis, protectionism is back with a vengeance. In Russia, Vladimir Putin is the expression of a new nationalist - even imperial - identity which owes much to confidence stemming from recent economic growth. Pictures of the bare-chested Russian leader on holiday strike a chord. Nobody cares about draconian media control, a travesty of a judiciary and endemic corruption. Putin embodies a vision of modern Russia and what it is to be Russian shared by tens of millions. The key people here are not the ultra-rich who, whether in Moscow, Shanghai, S\u00e3o Paulo or Knightsbridge, are perhaps the only ones to inhabit something approaching a genuinely globalised and thus uniform world of the same designers, the same brands, the same sports cars and the same holiday destinations. The key is the swath of the population beneath: those whose parents or grandparents were poor, who have just traded the family motorbike for a family car, just swapped the flat for a house, who are scared that their gains could disappear and who are, often, innately conservative as a result. So, in Pakistan, the true winner of elections last month was Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League whose potbelly, receding hair, taste for rootsy food, conservatism, and chauvinistic Islamo-nationalism resonate with exactly those people who have done well out of Pakistan&apos;s 10 years of straight economic growth - the massed ranks of the new urban middle classes in Karachi, Faisalabad or Rawalpindi. In Thailand, never colonised, with a huge tourist industry and lots of happy, smiling people who have got much richer in the last decades, the middle classes now vote en masse for Thaksin Shinawatra, the richest businessman in the country with a terrible human-rights record whose respect for democracy is, at the very least, questionable. Many Thais believe that without a strong state and a strong leader, they would never have made the money they now have. They are unlikely to want to change either in the near future. It is easy to dismiss Putin, Thaksin and Sharif et al as mere populists. But we would be wrong to. The reason for their success runs deeper - not in economics but in emotion. Each leader represents their nation - or at least a good chunk of the more vocal elements of its population - in a very real sense. And their popularity is evidence of an underlying trend: the return of difference. For, since the end of the Cold War, we have been lulled into a complacency based in the idea that, with the exception of an extremist fringe of the bad and the mad, most people are like us or, if they are not like us, they would want to be. But the truth is that not everyone, given the means, wants to dissolve their own identity in a global pick&apos;n&apos;mix, particularly one that is actually far from global but actually American-European. Aspirations to live in security, health and prosperity are universal. But so is the desire to live with a sense of cultural, national and personal independence. History shows us how often people are prepared to sacrifice the former for the latter. There are innumerable examples of people causing harm - to themselves as well as others - simply out of a bloody-minded desire to cling to what they believe defines them. It might be a bit of land, a flag, a collective memory of humiliation or triumph. But it is very strong and it is not entirely rational either.  There are benefits in having confident, proud states and leaders as negotiating partners - only the strong can bring peace - but there is no certainty that these new players will want to negotiate. The world might be a smaller and richer place these days, but we forget the desire for difference at our peril, however much Bordeaux or cheddar is on the planet&apos;s tables. \u00b7 Nick Cohen is away", "tags": ["Global economy", "Russia", "Pakistan", "Thailand", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-03-30T00:03:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/30/hillaryclinton.uselections2008", "sentences": ["Perhaps the risk is too great that President Clinton (Mark 2) would feel gripped by a sudden worry that she was boring the Chinese ambassador and spice up the occasion by claiming she had just nuked Shanghai."], "title": "Victoria Coren: Me misspeak? Now you mention it ...", "article": "It was hard not to enjoy Hillary Clinton&apos;s &apos;misspeaking&apos; last week. Talking about a visit she made to Bosnia in 1996, Senator Clinton described a dramatic adventure in which her plane landed under fire and she was obliged to sprint heroically along the runway, between the bullets, in the manner of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, before diving into a rescue vehicle. She stopped just short of telling us that she then drank a glass of water which came spouting out of her bulletholes like a sprinkler. All very impressive. The problem arose when reporters looked back at old TV footage of this daredevil entrance to Bosnia. This showed the aircraft landing smoothly and the senator (then First Lady) disembarking with smiles and waves, before strolling in leisurely fashion across the Tarmac while a child read a welcoming poem. No guns. No sprinting. Not so much as a spot of rain. Less Butch and Sundance, more Newman and Redford in their trailer having a martini. Confronted with this evidence, Clinton admitted: &apos;I did misspeak the other day.&apos; She learnt a thing or two about language from her husband, eh? She didn&apos;t lie. She didn&apos;t exaggerate. She didn&apos;t deceive, dissemble, pretend or even mislead - she simply misspoke. Like when a policeman says: &apos;Have you had anything to drink?&apos; and the words: &apos;Two bottles of chablis&apos; accidentally come out as: &apos;Haven&apos;t touched a drop since Christmas, officer.&apos; These slips of the tongue are so easily made. An enthralling etymological debate is raging online regarding the meanings of &apos;misspeak&apos; in its original Old English form (&apos;to grumble&apos;), in Chaucer&apos;s day (&apos;to speak insultingly&apos;), and in 19th-century America (&apos;to speak unclearly or fail to tell the whole truth&apos;). But we all know what went on in Hillary&apos;s case, don&apos;t we? I&apos;m not sure there is a word that specifically means &apos;embellishing an anecdote in order to make oneself sound more interesting&apos;, but we need a word for that and &apos;misspeak&apos; will do as well as any. (&apos;Embell-self-glamming&apos; would be more fun, but its construction sounds a little German. And the Germans probably don&apos;t do it. They&apos;re more likely to need a word which means &apos;downplaying an anecdote in order to make oneself sound slightly less efficient&apos; and I expect they&apos;ve got one. Coined years ago, neatly prepared in case of future-use requirement.) We&apos;ve all worried that our own true selves aren&apos;t exciting enough to cut the mustard. I like Hillary Clinton much more for the endearing attempt to jazz herself up than I would if she had really hurtled down a bullet-riddled Bosnian runway. That&apos;s exactly the kind of thing I might say at a dinner party, for fear that my real holiday anecdotes (&apos;I got a bit of sunburn and tasted various local fish recipes&apos;) will send the person next to me to sleep. But I suppose that&apos;s not what people are looking for in a national leader. Perhaps the risk is too great that President Clinton (Mark 2) would feel gripped by a sudden worry that she was boring the Chinese ambassador and spice up the occasion by claiming she had just nuked Shanghai. Nevertheless, the insecurity signified by Hillary&apos;s Bosnian tale makes me feel much closer to her. I am inspired to go on the record myself and apologise for all the instances of &apos;misspeaking&apos; that I can remember. To Michelle Hello Michelle. Do you remember when we were eight and I told you that I had been born a boy? I wasn&apos;t born a boy. I was just a tomboy. And tomboys were a bit too predictable because the Famous Five were big on TV at the time, so I thought I&apos;d go one better. I&apos;m sorry I fooled you. But I must say, I hope you&apos;re a bit less gullible these days. To Clare Hi Clare. Here&apos;s the thing. I didn&apos;t meet Gary Numan on holiday. I simply saw a man who looked a bit like Gary Numan in a cafe. To be fair, I did think it was him for about five minutes. Until I saw the birthmark. I&apos;m assuming you don&apos;t still have that autograph on your bedroom wall? If you do, I suppose you&apos;d better take it down. It isn&apos;t Gary Numan&apos;s signature, it&apos;s mine. To Jess Let me take you back to the postcard I once sent you from Africa. I&apos;ll come right out and say it: we weren&apos;t chased by an elephant. We just saw an elephant. It was a safari holiday and we had paid to see an elephant and there one was. I was a bit scared because it was big, but I appreciate that is not exactly the same as being &apos;very nearly trampled to death&apos;.  To Robert I don&apos;t really think Tom Jones propositioned me. He just told me he had a nice suite at the MGM. And he twinkled a bit. But he&apos;s a twinkly man. And I was interviewing him about the series of concerts he was giving at the MGM. Now I come to think of it, I probably asked where he was staying. I should not have given the impression, therefore, that I have been desired by one of the world&apos;s great sex gods. I just sat near him.  To the man in the blue tie from the wine tasting I do not work at MI6. I was trying to seem at home in that high-powered gathering. I realised my mistake immediately, because if I really did work at MI6, then I would have to pretend that I didn&apos;t. The fact is, I don&apos;t actually work anywhere.

Prior to the first match of the Chinese season, blue-shirted fans packed in for pre-match noodles, rice and tofu. Inside the stadium, Shanghai Shenhua fans were already warming up. &quot;I am Ben,&quot; one said. &quot;I am a Hammer,&quot; he laughed. He then turned to his friend, who was sporting a fake Manchester United shirt under his blue Shanghai one, threw his head back and shouted &quot;West Ham till I die!&quot; in a passable cockney accent stolen from the hooligan-glorifying movie Green Street. Soon after, the Blues were on easy street as they led Shenzhen Shangqingyin 2-0, roared on by 15,000 fans on a chilly and murky Saturday night. Shenhua are one of the biggest clubs in Shanghai, itself one of China&apos;s biggest cities with a population approaching 20 million. They may not be short of supporters but staying power has been lacking in the past. One title and seven runners-up spots since 1996 suggest Shenhua&apos;s reputation for fading near the finish line is deserved. The quest for a first championship since 2003 had head coach Wu Jingui desperate for a good start, and with three home games to start the season, the pressure was on to take advantage. &quot;Always before a new season, the feeling is the same,&quot; said Wu at the club&apos;s training ground deep in the south of the city. &quot;We are excited, a little bit nervous and we also have a vision about the season ahead.&quot; The vision of the season behind is not a pleasant one. The past three years have been turbulent for football in Shanghai - a city that enjoys an intense rivalry with Beijing to the north. &quot;Beijing can have the Olympics, we get all the good sporting events - formula one, tennis and golf,&quot; a reporter told me. In 2005, there were three top flight teams. Then Shanghai International relocated to Xi&apos;an. Blues fan Ben missed the fights but was even more unhappy in February 2007 when Shanghai United and Shanghai Shenhua merged. Zhu Jun was the man behind it all. The flamboyant businessman made big money in online gaming and tales are still breathlessly told of bags of cash handed to players before and after games at Shanghai United. Whatever the truth of that, he handed over around $20m to buy a controlling interest in Shanghai&apos;s other top flight club, Shenhua. He merged the two and replaced Wu with United&apos;s Uruguayan boss Osvaldo Gimenez. United had little history and few followers, so the name Shenhua and the blue shirts were retained, but the team was a mess. The fans, already unhappy at having to vacate the Hongkou Stadium for a season as it was renovated for the Women&apos;s World Cup, booed Zhu and the ex-Shanghai United players. The Asian Champions League campaign was a disaster and rivals Beijing Guoan won their first ever game in Shanghai. Gimenez was soon out and Wu reinstated. &quot;I am Chinese and knew the team and the club and knew what we needed - in my head at least!&quot; said the coach. Wu is diplomatic about the owner these days. That may change if reports that Zhu intends to bow out of business and take a more hands-on role at the club turn out to be true, though as Zhu already trains with the team on a regular basis, it is difficult to know how much more involved he could be. For now however, Wu has more pressing concerns with the new season ahead. The launch of the professional league in 1994 was supposed to be the stimulus that finally woke the sleeping dragon of China&apos;s 1.3 billion-strong population. It started well and by the turn of the century, Chinese football was booming. Attendances were high, players were swapping clubs for over a $1m, big business was enthusiastic and in 2002 the national team qualified for their first ever World Cup. That, however, turned into a disaster. China returned from South Korea pointless and goalless. Things had already started to go wrong domestically; the 2001 promotion play-offs saw to that. The Black Whistles Affair may sound like a slick Raymond Chandler novel but actually concerned blatant match-fixing. With five minutes of the season remaining, Changchun Yatai needed to score four goals to get promoted on goal difference. They did just that. There was much more besides and before long coaches were suspended, a referee was behind bars, players fired, league sponsors Pepsi quit and attendances started to fall. Suspicion of corruption has been hard to shake. The 2004 season saw two teams penalised for walking off the pitch in protest at refereeing decisions that were perceived to be biased. Finding sponsors for the league is an annual battle. But Shanghai&apos;s ex-Middlesbrough marksman Hamilton Ricard believes that things are slowly improving. &quot;I have heard rumours about money,&quot; said Ricard. &quot;That makes it difficult to become a strong power in football but now they are trying to clean everything up and this is a new start for football in China.&quot; Chinese football journalists blame the Chinese FA, one of the few public bodies open to criticism, and accuse it of lacking direction, intelligence and leadership. Many of the locals hardly have a good word to say about the domestic league, preferring to watch European football. This is not unique in Asia but it is hard to blame the fans when most clubs are owned by the government and they change names and locations on a frequent basis. Instead then of Zheng Zhi and Li Weifeng, it is the faces of Michael Owen, Kaka and David Beckham that light up the sides of buses and buildings in Shanghai. Yet despite the popularity of the English football, loyalty is not deep. The Premier League&apos;s decision last summer to sell live TV rights to a Pay-TV station has reportedly seen viewing figures fall from millions to tens of thousands. Whether the Premier League maintains its popularity or not, Coach Wu believes that the Middle Kingdom needs to look to England for inspiration. &quot;Chinese players are good physically but we need to change the way we play and think. The Premier League brought in Ferguson from Scotland, Wenger from France, Ben\u00edtez and Ramos from Spain and Mourinho. If we want to progress and improve, we also have to bring in high-level coaches from outside.&quot; The 2,000 or so Blue Devils, Shenhua&apos;s largest fan group, look to Korea for their role models. The hardcore had watched the Korean derby in the same stadium three days previously and were as moved as everybody else when, at the end of the game, southern players bowed to the northern fans and the northern players did the same to the Red Devils. The Shenhua fans view the Korea fans as a benchmark, and study videos of them in action. It is easy to see the similarities - non-stop singing, jumping up and down, clever flags, cute banners and goal celebrations that involve fans ending up some distance from their seat before dancing back again. And the faithful had two opportunities to dance as former Celtic loanee Du Wei headed Shanghai into the lead and midfielder Yu Tao sealed the win in the second half. The performance of the fans was smoother than those of the players though perhaps it was due to early-season rustiness. The opposition tried to pass their way to success but the final ball was lacking - Shenzhen, champions in 2004, are a shadow of their former selves. It was a deserved win in a decent game and Ricard was happy. &quot;It is not easy to score. Technically, the standard of the league is pretty good and I am enjoying it.&quot; He certainly seemed to be having a good time with his team-mates. On Thursday they had gone to the cinema, and Friday was coffee night. Carpet bowls is only a matter of time. Despite the activity on and off the pitch, the 34-year-old still thinks of Blighty. &quot;I miss Middlesbrough. The traffic is much better than here,&quot; he laughed. A new subway station made it easier for fans and they went home happy at the end of a disappointing week for Chinese football. On Wednesday, the national team drew 0-0 at home to Australia in a qualification game for the 2010 World Cup. Midfielder Shao Jiayi wasted a penalty with two minutes left with the tamest of efforts. With two points from two games, even progressing to the final round of qualification is far from guaranteed. Many of the headlines in the newspapers on display in the stand by People&apos;s Square station in Shanghai were of a similar vein - &apos;Same old story&apos;. But Wu Jinqui is quietly optimistic that there is light at the end of the tunnel. &quot;Chinese football is improving but it is like the high jump, once you reach 2.20m, it is difficult to jump higher but that&apos;s what we must do.&quot;", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-01T15:26:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/apr/02/intellaunchesmightyatom", "sentences": ["The New York Times says: &quot;Introducing products at the Intel event in Shanghai will be Asus, BenQ, Clarion, Fujitsu, Gigabyte, Lenovo, LG-E, NEC, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, WiBrain and Usi.&quot; All of those should give Engadget and Gizmodo plenty of material to work on."], "title": "Intel launches mighty Atom", "article": "If you read my column last week -- Are subnotebooks stepping out of the shadows at last? -- then you already know about Intel&apos;s hopes for new chips &quot;which will be sold under the Centrino Atom brand name&quot;.

It looks a bit more robust than the previous 7-inch version but still has a Celeron M processor, not a new Atom. Intel&apos;s Classmate PC site has side-by-side specifications. AP says:  Classmates are based on Intel&apos;s design and include its processors, but they are built by other manufacturers and sold under a variety of brand names. The first generation went on sale in March 2007 with the 7-inch screen and fewer functions. Intel said it has sold &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of the machines but declined to provide more specific data.    CNet has a review, Intel Classmate PC (9-inch), which says:  Compared with the original, this Classmate PC looks less like a toy and more like a traditional laptop computer, even as it keeps a somewhat thick, plastic chassis with slightly rounded corners. The new Classmate also keeps the removable snap on leather cover, which doubles as a convenient carry handle. The rugged design makes it more than a pound heavier than the Eee PC, but it also feels significantly sturdier.   The keyboard is about the same size as on the original Classmate and is designed for those with smaller fingers. However, the keys have been rearranged into a more traditional layout, correcting a few niggling problems with the older version, such as a missing right-shift key. The touch pad is now a traditional rectangular surface, instead of the visually interesting, but hard-to-use round version on the older Classmate. Intel added a Webcam, positioned above the screen, in this revision, which is a cool extra for such an inexpensive system.    The major disappointment is that the larger screen still has the same old resolution: 800 x 480 pixels. Still, says CNet, it has more ports than a MacBook Air.... Forbes magazine compares the $489 Classmate 2 with the OLPC XO, saying: &quot;the Classmate hardly feels like a leap forward in educational hardware as much as a gray, shrunken version of any typical Intel-powered laptop&quot;. (Harsh? In real life, the XO looks amazingly naff.) Still:  In Forbes.com&apos;s tests, the XO&apos;s Wi-Fi connection was weak and finicky. When it did connect, Flash or Java-based sites like YouTube or Yahoo! Games suffered from crippling sputters and stalls, thanks to the XO&apos;s small memory capacity.   Intel&apos;s Classmate, on the other hand, connected to the same Wi-Fi network and was playing 9-inch videos of Korean break dancing within seconds. Other dynamic Web sites, like games and photo sites, also loaded without a hitch. That means that as the computing world shifts to the Web from the increasingly irrelevant desktop, Intel&apos;s Classmate could flourish while the XO is left behind. For all of OLPC&apos;s brilliant bells and whistles, the nonprofit has created a closed platform that isn&apos;t capable of using Windows programs -- not to mention a constantly evolving ecosystem of Web applications.

In 2002, the Tibetan choreographer Sang Jijia was funded by the Swiss company Rolex through a four-year apprenticeship with the world-class American choreographer William Forsythe. It not only changed Sang&apos;s life, but had an equally catalytic impact back home. &quot;Everyone here has been very excited by what I&apos;ve brought back,&quot; he says. &quot;The physical standard of dancing is very good in China, but the level of original thought still feels very low. It&apos;s amazing that in this enormous country, we only have three modern dance companies.&quot; In fact, there are now four - still very few in proportion to the nation&apos;s size. Modern dance was banned in China until 1980, and it has only grown through the efforts of a few exceptional individuals, and the importing of western ideas. One early pioneer was Willy Tsao, a choreographer who had trained in the US. After setting up his own company in Hong Kong, Tsao helped to develop the first two modern dance companies on the communist mainland in the 1990s: one based in Guangdong, the other in Beijing. Another key figure was Jin Xing, who now has her own company based in Shanghai. Jin was not only one of the first of the post-Mao generation to go abroad and study modern dance, but this formerly male classical dancer was also one of the first Chinese to gain public acceptance as a transsexual, after undergoing surgery to become a woman. When Chinese modern dance started to be seen outside the country, many critics in the west had a hard time judging it fairly: it seemed both alien and derivative. One flagship production by Beijing Modern Dance Company, Rear Light, based on the 1982 Alan Parker/Pink Floyd film, seemed an exhilarating challenge to authority for Chinese audiences. But to western eyes it appeared a mish-mash of choreographic and ideological cliches. In 2005, the New York Times critic John Rockwell called it &quot;an odd duck of a dance&quot;. Sang Jijia&apos;s career offers a window on the creative frustrations faced by the Chinese modern dance community. He grew up in a remote province and knew little about dance until the age of 12, when he was spotted by talent scouts and moved 3,000 miles to Beijing to train with China&apos;s national folk troupe. He was a gifted student - elegant, musical, responsive - but when he first saw a performance by the Guangdong Modern Dance Company in 1999, he lost interest in the tradition. &quot;Suddenly I saw that I wanted to make dance from my own body, not repeat what I was shown,&quot; he says. Sang&apos;s dancing and early attempts at choreography were celebrated both at home and abroad: he won a three-month scholarship to study in New York, and was invited to choreograph work for Tsao in Hong Kong. But Sang still feared that being based in China would prevent him from fulfilling his true potential. Sure enough, his apprenticeship with Forsythe changed everything. He was overwhelmed by his first encounter with the choreographer&apos;s work, by its virtuosity and slippery fluency, and the contrast with Chinese habits of obedience and imitation. &quot;I came out of the theatre shaking,&quot; Sang says. &quot;I could not imagine how you could do such things with the body.&quot; When he went back to China in 2006, his peers were thrilled - not because he had brought back another western style for them to borrow, but because he had brought tools to help them develop their own. But the climate for modern dance in China remains harsh. Funding is limited to state-sponsored companies, and at least one party official has to approve a production before it can be performed in public - and, unlike with ballet and folk dance, audiences for modern dance are small: the very concept of the art form is all but meaningless outside the major cities. &quot;My parents cannot imagine what I was doing when I went away,&quot; Sang says. &quot;They have never seen my choreography. Once I brought them a DVD of my work and after two minutes they asked if it was all right to watch the TV.&quot; But there are also currents of change in China, as the range of Chinese choreography that is being performed in Britain this year suggests. Zhao Ruheng, director of the National Ballet of China, recently commissioned Bahok, a work by the British choreographer Akram Khan in which three NBC dancers perform alongside members of Khan&apos;s company. It is the first collaboration of its kind in China, and Khan was impressed at how quickly the three dancers adapted to western working methods. &quot;They were very open,&quot; he says, &quot;and they started to create movement as quickly as my own company.&quot; The audience were equally receptive when Bahok was premiered in Beijing in January. &quot;The first night, I think we had the ballet audience - it was quite formal,&quot; Khan says. &quot;But by the third night, it had changed: it was the kind of crowd I&apos;m used to here, very mixed, with a lot of visual artists as well as dance people.&quot; Bahok opened to equal acclaim in Liverpool in March, and is shortly to continue the rest of its UK tour along with performances by Sang Jijia, the Guangdong Modern Dance Company and Living Dance Studio, a new mixed-media ensemble. What makes Chinese dance stand out is its distinctive energy. Choreographers are passionate about moving forwards, and are increasingly confident about channelling their native culture, incorporating traditional tai chi, acrobatics and Chinese opera techniques into their work. Khan, for one, is impressed and intrigued by what he has seen of modern dance in Beijing. &quot;It is so fresh,&quot; he says. &quot;At first, choreographers had to do a lot of copying from the west, but now they are developing their own aesthetic. The culture, the political situation - all those things will eventually make dance here very different from the west&quot;.  \u00b7 Bahok is at the Dome, Brighton (01273 709709), from May 9, then tours.

Bad luck, Murray Head. Researching the list led me to investigate Alice Coltrane, Guitar Wolf and Puffy AmiYumi for the first time, and thus reminded me what a seismic impact this column has had on my music tastes. When time is tight - and it feels like time is always tight - anyone can be forgiven for making snap decisions about what music they think they&apos;ll like. Nobody can be expected to try everything, and then try it again in case they missed something. But RR forced me to do just that. In attempting to keep up with the influx of recommendations, I ended up having the biggest musical education of my life. It wasn&apos;t a case of coming across people I&apos;d never heard of, so much as taking the time to properly assess artists and genres I knew of only superficially: Tom Waits, Steve Reich, Gillian Welch, Ella Fitzgerald (jazz standards generally), Blind Willie Johnson (early blues generally), Creedence Clearwater Revival, Randy Newman, Fela Kuti, the Modern Lovers, Eels, the Pogues, Peggy Lee, Smog, McCarthy, Loudon Wainwright III, Yo La Tengo, the Cramps, Cab Calloway, Bruce Springsteen (only the depressing stuff), Miles Davis (beyond Kind of Blue), Roxy Music (beyond the Eno years), Charles Mingus, the Adverts, Julie London, the Langley Schools Music Project, the Ink Spots, Cowboy Junkies, Tom Lehrer, Baby Huey, Jorge Ben, Neutral Milk Hotel, Townes van Zandt, Jacques Brel, Goblin, Felt, Galaxie 500, the Gun Club, Burning Spear, Laurie Anderson, Hawkwind, the Replacements, Appalachian music, Ye-Ye girls, Stan Tracey, Arvo P\u00e4rt, Ali Farka Toure and Judee Sill. Thanks to everyone who recommended the right songs that unlocked those artists for me. It&apos;s also made me more sure about what I dislike. When you&apos;ve tried and failed week after week to see the point of certain artists, you realise that it&apos;s not just kneejerk prejudice -- you really can&apos;t stand them. So here we go: Frank Zappa, the Wedding Present, Al Stewart (sorry, Beltway), the Grateful Dead (sorry, GTDITL), most prog-rock (sorry, Kalyr), H\u00fcsker D\u00fc (sorry, fellow music journalists), Peter Hammill&apos;s singing voice, Bruce Springsteen&apos;s E Street Band, the Doors (apart from The End), Queen (apart from Don&apos;t Stop Me Now and Under Pressure), Jethro Tull, James, Duran Duran, Cat Stevens, Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, most Elvis Costello, most Van Morrison, Prefab Sprout and, oh yes, Steely Dan. The only downside to being saturated in music for 32 months is that you tend to go wide instead of deep. I&apos;m looking forward to getting off the treadmill of new discoveries and moving further into the catalogues of certain artists at my own pace. But I&apos;ll miss the sheer unpredictability of hosting RR: not just the prospect of hearing something new and wonderful each week, but the wit, candour, insight and sheer good company that characterises every discussion. In one sense the column is the whole point of the blog; in another, it&apos;s just a footnote to a long and open conversation. Thanks for making it a joy to be a part of. You know where to find the RR archive, A-Z and Overspill blog and you surely know that the deadline is midday on Monday. The estimable Maddy Costa starts next week, so treat her nicely.

The Human Spider (Channel 4) Someone should probably tell Alain Robert it&apos;s so much easier to go up buildings if you go inside them first. They have these amazing little boxes with buttons that whisk you effortlessly to your desired level. Some even talk to you, if you&apos;re lonely, or blind. And if that&apos;s not your thing, there are staircases, by which height can be achieved in managable increments and at a reasonable angle. If you fall, you&apos;re likely to lose your dignity and possibly your latte, but not your life. That&apos;s not Alain&apos;s way, though. Instead, he stakes out buildings for days, through binoculars. Then, like a tiger stalking his prey, he creeps up, getting as close as he can without being noticed - and suddenly he&apos;s off! He runs at them, dodging security guards, then leaps, wedging his fingers into thin cracks between steel and glass, pulling his wiry body up with his enormous strength. Up and up, higher, colder, windier. He has no rope, just a bag of chalk dust and a pair of rubber-soled shoes to provide a bit of friction between himself and the smooth modern materials of the world&apos;s tallest buildings. If it rains, he&apos;ll probably fall. Oh, and he has epilepsy - he could have a seizure at any moment. Plus, he&apos;s scared of heights! And the reward for Alain, The Human Spider (Channel 4), when he reaches the top? He&apos;s generally arrested and carted off to the nick in a police van. It&apos;s a thankless task, being an urban free solo climber, which is what he is. He may be a headache to the authorities, but the public love him. They come out on to the streets in their thousands, to point and cheer. Look, there&apos;s Spider-Man - a real-life superhero. And from inside their air-conditioned offices they applaud as he passes, heading upwards, a refreshing human-shaped two fingers to health and safety. It&apos;s not great for Alain&apos;s family: Daddy spends most of the time away, either hanging off skyscrapers or in jail, and when he does come home to the Languedoc, he&apos;s mostly hanging off the ceiling, practising for the next climb. I don&apos;t think you tell Alain what to do, though. He&apos;s a typical climber: single-minded to the point of selfishness, totally focused with a far-away and slightly scary look in his eye. And he has the same kind of screw-the-world Gallicness that Eric Cantona had. &quot;I love, you know, kicking the ass of the society,&quot; Alain says before taking on Shanghai&apos;s 1,380ft Jin Mao tower dressed as Batman. His teenage son seems to have already inherited some of Alain&apos;s attitude. &quot;I don&apos;t like these questions,&quot; the long-haired lad says disdainfully to the poor interviewer. &quot;They are stupid questions.&quot; The baby meanwhile is free-soloing a corner of the living room in a nappy. Alain may be a bit of a cock. And this isn&apos;t actually a brilliant film - there&apos;s too much bigging him up - he&apos;s so brave, it&apos;s so dangerous, he&apos;s such a rebel, blah blah blah. The sports psychologist banging on about how this is about as extreme as it gets is ridiculous. It would have been so much cooler just to let his climbing speak for him. But I&apos;m still a sucker for anything that involves shots of people doing crazy things, and I loved it. The action is amazing. Alain&apos;s grace is in his climbing. It&apos;s beautiful to witness - measured, rhythmic, balletic almost. And absobloodylutely terrifying. The bridge in Portugal is the hardest one to watch. There&apos;s something about a suspension bridge&apos;s delicate structure, and the long downward sweep of its cables, that suggest plunging acceleration, like a rollercoaster ride. And from the top of the towers, there&apos;s a double drop - down to the road, and then the water. I can&apos;t even think about it without feeling a bit giddy. But Alain just shins up a couple of vertical wires, climbs on to the main cable, and walks up the steepening slope to the top of the tower. Then it&apos;s a stroll down to the bottom of the central span, and the inevitable waiting police car. Easy. And beautiful. On second thoughts, maybe don&apos;t tell him about elevators and stairwells. You wouldn&apos;t want to be stuck in a lift with him, but watching him climb up the outside of a building is a joy.", "tags": ["Television industry", "Media", "Culture", "Alain Robert"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-03T23:06:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/04/1", "sentences": ["Even in translation, the lyrics are as coherent as a Scrabble board (&quot;Volcano, Magellan, Shanghai, malaria&quot;) but &quot;yellow Chinkees&quot; are blessedly absent."], "title": "Readers recommend ... songs about Asia", "article": "In 1969, Blue Mink&apos;s Melting Pot offered the world a multi-racial &quot;recipe for a get along scene&quot;, numbering among its ingredients some, er, &quot;yellow Chinkees&quot;.

Even when not capsized by crassness, the visions of Asia offered by western pop bear only a glancing resemblance to reality. India is the land of the Maharishi and the sitar, as decorously exotic as a gap-year wall-hanging.

Some songwriters can&apos;t even be bothered to consult an atlas: Alex Chilton&apos;s Bangkok tells, confusingly, of &quot;a little town down in Indonesia&quot;. Sofia Coppola&apos;s Lost in Translation concerned itself less with the actual Japan than with a land made unreal by jetlag and culture shock.

On Hong Kong, he sounds like he&apos;s just invented Tom Waits. Japan&apos;s David Sylvian approached China rather more soberly on the classic Tin Drum album, although he over-egged the fried rice somewhat by appearing on the cover eating noodles beneath a picture of Chairman Mao. Cantonese Boy is an austere snapshot of Red China. Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was Pakistan&apos;s breakout star in the 90s, thanks in part to this marvellously sensitive Massive Attack remix: Sufi mysticism to a dub bassline. Journey in Satchidananda doubtless qualifies as the &quot;ethnicky jazz&quot; that the Dead Kennedys were complaining about, but never mind them: this is a captivating trip. Of course, while westerners seek mystery and that slippery concept, authenticity, in the east, Japanese musicians tend to embrace the trashier aspects of occidental culture. J-pop duo Puffy AmiYumi&apos;s massive 1996 hit is an exuberant mishmash of vocoders, synths and glam-rock guitars.

Be sure to read the small print In December, I decided to sell my Scottish Life policy to LSA Endowments. It offered me \u00a38,549 against the \u00a38,136 surrender value. It said this was a &quot;firm offer&quot; and as I could not deal with anyone else - you send the original policy document - I assumed I would get \u00a38,549. But then it withdrew the offer and substituted \u00a38,090. Is this fair?GT, Monmouthshire  LSA Endowments, a traded endowment firm, justified the cut by referring you to the small print that LSA may, &quot;at its absolute discretion withdraw its offer&quot; if &quot;bonus rates are changed.&quot; It argues it would otherwise have losses if rates go down - and in the currently unlikely event of bonuses rising, it would increase payments. It says this is a standard practice, but only happens very rarely. Capital Letters argued the phrase &quot;firm offer&quot; referred to the amount offered and not just the fact there must be an offer at some price. And we pointed out the seller would now end up with less than the original \u00a38,136 surrender value in December - the new Scottish Life value was \u00a37,632. LSA took these points on board - especially the second, referring to the loss you would have to accept. It will rewrite its contract to clarify what happens if bonus rates fall, while offering a better description of what a &quot;firm offer&quot; is. More importantly, it found the surrender value, when you agreed to sell, was \u00a342 higher than quoted. You will now receive an ex gratia cheque for \u00a3917 - \u00a3546 difference on your surrender value between December 2007 and the end of January, and the \u00a3371 you would have received for the policy if the bonus rates and surrender value had not changed. This is a good deal. All I wanted was my own tax haven ... I tried to open the much-publicised Barclays Bank Tax Haven Isa account - after Guardian Money said it was a best buy. But when I went to my local branch, the bank staff said the account was only on offer for the coming tax year. This is advertised as &quot;an Isa account with nothing to hide,&quot; so why was I turned down?LB, London  You were told this 6.5% Isa was only available for the tax year which starts tomorrow (Sunday). Why is unclear. There would be little point advertising an account which is not yet available.  After Capital Letters called, Barclays admitted it was wrong to send you away, although it did not explain why the mistake was made. It tried to contact you, but you are out of the country. Before you went, you opened a lower rate Isa - at Skipton building society - to ensure you used this tax year&apos;s allowance. Barclays says it does not accept transfers into its Tax Haven but will make an exception, promising a special &quot;high level process&quot; on your return. And it will offer you \u00a350 compensation for your time and trouble.  So who&apos;s on the sucker list, now? I was conned by a boiler room scam from Charles Fleming, based in Tokyo, losing $25,000 in a shares investment in a Vietnam leisure company.  Since then, various approaches have been made offering to buy these shares, including one from Clinton Parker, which you wrote about a fortnight ago. While I was stupid to fall for the original scam, I won&apos;t be parting with more money. Are Charles Fleming and Clinton Parker the same company? And will I get my money back?DH, Dubai Charles Fleming was closed down in Tokyo in 2006 for &quot;operating a boiler room scam&quot; following a complaint from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). But that has not stopped Charles Fleming from staying in business and conning others. Its website proclaims it operates out of Shanghai and Seoul. As there are no addresses or phone numbers, it is unlikely to be found in either China or South Korea.  Clinton Parker is legally sited in the British Virgin Islands and there does not appear to be any Fleming connection. But that&apos;s not necessary. Company owners simply swap information on losers - they call it a &quot;sucker list&quot;. Money that simply went off the rails In January I attempted to book four rail journeys for a trip to India, using the Indian Railways website. Credit card payments were taken, but immediately refunded due to a lack of seat availability. My statement shows the debits and credits were at different exchange rates, leaving me \u00a31.65 out of pocket. Where has my money gone and who profited?KK, North Yorkshire  There are two ways of refunding foreign transactions. You can pay the 2.75% foreign currency usage fee twice - once for each direction. But more usually, as here, you get a credit of the money you spent so you avoid the fees because the deal did not take place.  Your loss is due to short-term changes in the sterling/Indian rupee exchange but it could have been a profit if it moved the other way. Indian Railways does not benefit as it gave back the same number of rupees as it took in the first place. Your \u00a31.65 has ended up with speculators on the foreign currency market. Update on ... Mansion House Securities The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has fined Mansion House Securities \u00a3122,500 for giving customers unsuitable and inaccurate advice when selling higher-risk shares - including stocks on Aim, the lightly regulated stock market, and US shares which were difficult to sell.  The watchdog found its advisers failed to highlight the risks associated with the recommended shares and used inappropriate sales practices to pressure customers into buying. It did not ensure staff were properly trained. And it referred to &quot;analysts&quot; on its staff, when none were registered. This is the third recent fine against a UK regulated broker for similar shortcomings. Mansion House would have faced a \u00a3175,000 fine had it not co-operated.

There are nine types of dragon; they have nine times nine scales; they like eating swallows; they ascend to heaven on waterspouts but can also shrink to the size of a silkworm. There are celestial dragons who protect the gods, and treasure dragons who guard the pearl of wisdom. Dragons can misbehave - one of the Taoist Immortals carries a dragon-slaying sword, and Monkey had to deal with a disobedient dragon - but they are on the whole a good thing for humanity. It is very different from the western view which, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics, seems to have become obligatory for publishers and their marketing departments. Here be dragons, eight of them in the current bunch - only one short of the auspicious nine - a fearsome brood with claws outstretched and mostly coloured red. Generalisations about China, the great historian John King Fairbank once wrote, are &quot;the sort of thing we should learn in the eighth grade&quot; and then spend a lifetime breaking down into reality. By this standard the persistence of the dragon clich\u00e9 means we still have a lot of work to do. The most frightening dragon is offered by Erik Durschmied, who urges us, simply, to beware: while China was regarded for centuries as &quot;an ancient dragon enfolded in a sleep of ages&quot;, it was really writing &quot;pages in blood in the world&apos;s chronicle&quot;. This 1,000 years of bloodshed - the subtitle of his book - dates from the Mongol invasion of Europe to the &quot;Chinese hordes&quot; in the Korean war. Durschmied acknowledges (a) that this is a period of only seven, not 10, centuries, and (b) that the Mongols were not Chinese at all - but we should still beware. Long before the Kaiser spoke of the &quot;yellow peril&quot;, China gave us what Durschmied calls the yellow scourge - the black death which, contrary to the accepted view, originated in the putrefaction of unburied corpses after a Chinese earthquake. Western civilisation then had a narrow escape when the Ming dynasty naval explorer Zheng He was ordered to turn back by a poorly advised young emperor. If Zheng had continued sailing westwards, he would have annihilated the merchant fleets of Venice, Genoa and the Sultan of Istanbul. Finally we arrive, via years of Chinese &quot;chaos and carnage&quot;, at the 21st century, when the age-old quest of emperors and khans may come true and China will rule the world. Unless the menace of Chinese bird flu gets us first, flying across the world on &quot;unstoppable wings&quot;. Chairman Mao would have praised this book as a &quot;negative example&quot;, well worth studying to understand the continuing depths of anti-China prejudice, and that is how it should be read - if at all. The dragon presented to us by Jonathan Spence (who may be regarded as the Fairbank of our times) is a much more sympathetic one. Dragon Mountain, in whose shadow the historian Zhang Dai grew up and where he returned (hence the title) after the Ming dynasty collapsed in 1644, was a friendly place nestling next to the city of Shaoxing south of the Yangtze. We would call it a hill: it only took 15 minutes climbing past shrines and temples to reach the top. Zhang is best known for his nostalgic essays - his &quot;dream recollections&quot;, which he wrote in middle age - about the pleasures of a younger life spent organising lantern festivals, staging amateur operas, in poetry reading, cock-fighting and watching the moon in company with courtesans. Zhang&apos;s father may have died after too many goose-eating competitions. In later life Zhang would write his own obituary: &quot;As a youth he was a real dandy,&quot; he began, &quot;in love with the idea of excess.&quot; But when he turned 50, his world was obliterated and he sought refuge in the mountains, wearing cotton clothes and eating coarse vegetables. His life becomes a personal metaphor for dynastic decline. Eventually Zhang returned to Shaoshan and lived a more modest life, again on the slopes of Dragon Mountain. He also resumed work on a history of the Ming dynasty which he had carried with him on his flight. In an un-squeamish epitaph which might be applied to the end of every Chinese regime right up to the fall of Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang wrote that &quot;the flies and maggots were already writhing in the privies before the bandits got there&quot;. The last emperor, Chongzhen, had left his frontier troops unpaid for years while he filled the treasury with huge sums, and sent eunuchs to gouge more taxes out of the rural heartland. Zhang failed to add that the luxurious lifestyle of the elite to which he belonged - many of them absentee landowners who ignored the peasants&apos; plight - also helped to bring down the dynasty. My only criticism of Spence&apos;s fluent narration is that he sometimes seems a shade too indulgent towards their excesses. The Manchu emperors, like those of the Ming, sat on the Dragon Throne, and their imperial robes were embroidered with five-clawed dragons. Yet this identification with the mythical creature was based not on terror but on a shared role in promoting life and welfare &quot;within the four seas&quot;. It was a dragon, assisted by a giant tortoise, who had helped the Great Yu, founder of the first Xia dynasty, to tame China&apos;s floods. He did so by dragging his tail behind him to score the paths of rivers and dykes (the tortoise followed behind, carrying the excavated mud on his back). It is no wonder that the great rivers are themselves compared to dragons: Shanghai boasts that it is the &quot;head of the (Yangtze) dragon&quot;. The first page of Treasures of China shows a dragon-like Yellow river, splendidly sinuous as it winds through remote Qinghai province (birthplace of the Dalai Lama). John Chinnery has taught and inspired British students - I was once one of them - for more than half a century, and his guide to &quot;the glories of the Kingdom of the Dragon&quot; is a fluent and authoritative cultural history with superb illustrations. Buddhism has always inspired China&apos;s greatest art, and Chinnery includes a special section on Dazu, the Buddhist caves in Sichuan rediscovered in 1945, with their quirkily lifelike faces of humans as well as gods. There is also a beautifully sensual Buddha from the Qingzhou hoard, found by workmen digging up a school playing-field in Shandong 12 years ago. Jonathan Fenby&apos;s The Dragon Throne, also of coffee-table size, focuses more on China&apos;s history than its culture - ideal for those who want to sort out their Qin from their Qing. More than 150 emperors sat on the throne, and they are nearly all listed here. Fenby has the journalist&apos;s ear for an entertaining anecdote, though these can be less than accurate when recorded by a succeeding hostile dynasty. We are told that the fifth-century AD emperor Wendi was succeeded by a string of incompetent rulers: one was a drunkard, the next was killed by his own officers, the third poisoned 33 family members, and the fourth &quot;amused himself by shooting blunt arrows at a target daubed on the stomach of a sleeping minister&quot;. The Dragon Throne has some fine pictures of emperors and beauties, paintings and porcelain, fierce warriors and foreign foes, though the captions are less informative than those in Chinnery&apos;s volume. Draconologists should be aware that the horned beast on Fenby&apos;s frontispiece is actually a qilin - sometimes referred to as the &quot;Chinese unicorn&quot;. The same image is correctly identified in Treasures of China. Everyone thinks they know that China - Zhongguo - means the Middle Kingdom, and this is the starting-point of China&apos;s sino-centrism, still supposedly characteristic today. In fact Zhongguo is better translated as the &quot;central country&quot;: as Chinnery tells us, it originally meant the principalities in the Yellow river region. Later Zhongguo came to represent the political legitimacy of the ruling state rather than a geographical location. It was the 18th-century European missionaries who gave the term its sino-centric gloss. Harry Gelber urges us in The Dragon and the Foreign Devils to look at China not in isolation but connected to the outside world. The interest of other states and societies in China ebbed and flowed over the centuries, just as China at different times showed interest or lack of interest in them. By the time that western mercantile imperialism came knocking at China&apos;s door, the Qing dynasty was in a more inward-looking mood, over-extended by earlier expansion and troubled by population pressure on land. But keeping the west at bay also seemed prudent, even prescient: Gelber quotes the great Kangxi emperor who, in 1717, when Russia was the only foreign power nudging China&apos;s borders, warned that &quot;in centuries or millennia to come China may be endangered by collision with the nations of the west&quot;. Gelber&apos;s approach is informative and wide-ranging, and his new paperback edition is modestly priced. Kerry Brown in The Rise of the Dragon also reflects, at a rather staggering price, on the ebb and flow of China&apos;s external relations. This study of inward and outward investment in China - the future, he argues, depends on how far China will invest abroad - begins with a lively sketch of its modern economic history, reminding us that &quot;on a longer view China had the world&apos;s largest economy for 18 of the last 20 centuries&quot;. Brown sees the Maoist period of self-reliance as an aberration: since 1978 China has returned &quot;to its default position, as an increasingly free, open economy, restarting a process that was begun in the 1920s and 1930s&quot;. This standard view of post-1949 Chinese history is now shared within China by its 21st-century modernisers. We may overlook too easily the extent to which Mao&apos;s China and Mao himself were driven into deeper isolation because they were, to put it simply, isolated by the west. Mao&apos;s offer to fly to Washington in 1945 to talk with President Roosevelt, and the overtures to the US which he authorised a decade later, suggest at least the potential for a different outcome. All of this is usually ignored. Margaret Macmillan&apos;s much-acclaimed study of Sino-US relations, Seize the Hour, refers only in passing to Zhou Enlai&apos;s offer in the mid-50s of &quot;a settlement of outstanding issues, especially Taiwan&quot;. Today&apos;s Chinese dragon is associated with entrepreneurs rather than em-perors, and US businessman Jack Perkowski believes he has learnt how to ride it. Managing the Dragon is subtitled &quot;How I&apos;m building a billion-dollar business in China&quot;. Perkowski says that any company that misses out on the China market is doomed to a second-class future, and that it is crucial to find the right Chinese managers - not necessarily the ones who speak the best English. The son of a blue-collar family in Pittsburgh, he is impressed, and rightly so, by how incredibly hard Chinese people will work. He also argues that China may have more incentive to develop new energy-saving technologies than the west. Perkowski&apos;s approach to China, like that of many western business people, is a mixture of insight and arrogance. Don&apos;t make a fuss if you don&apos;t get your coffee the way you want it, he advises new arrivals, or there is no ice in your drink. The fact is that China is still &quot;going through its adolescent stage&quot;. In Silicon Dragon, Rebecca Fannin talks to a dozen or so of these &quot;adolescents&quot;, all successful entrepreneurs in China&apos;s hi-tech revolution. Her interviews are breathless but revealing. All of her subjects were born during or just before the cultural revolution, often in poor families or with parents who were sent to the countryside. Some have studied at Silicon Valley or elsewhere in the US but the latest generation of technological innovators, whom US venture capitalists are lining up to back, are entirely home-grown. Liu Yingkui, 31-year-old inventor of software for selling insurance and other financial products via mobile phones, calls his company Oriental Wisdom, and says he wants to combine Confucius with capitalism. Yes, this is definitely a new sort of dragon.", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-04T23:15:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview1", "sentences": ["In the next-but-one story, The Blue Lotus, we see Tintin snap the cane with which an American oil magnate is beating a Chinese rickshaw driver in Shanghai, telling the bully: &quot;You conduct is disgraceful, Sir!&quot; By the final (complete) adventure, Tintin and the Picaros, the hero is sporting a CND sign on his moped helmet and plotting a revolution in South America."], "title": "\"Your conduct is disgraceful, Sir!\"", "article": "March was an eventful month in Tintin Land. On the 21st Raymond Leblanc, founder of the magazine that brought out the cartoon adventures of Herg\u00e9&apos;s tufted boy reporter in weekly instalments for three decades, died aged 92. The debonair, sport-loving publisher had played a vital role in Tintin&apos;s destiny: a wartime Resistance hero, he had single-handedly rehabilitated after World War Two the career and reputation of Herg\u00e9 the &quot;incivile&quot; - indeed, some would say &quot;collaborator&quot;. To the fury of the Fondation Herg\u00e9, who trade on Tintin&apos;s clean, boy scout-ish image, this story won&apos;t play dead. It goes like this. When Germany invaded Herg\u00e9 and Leblanc&apos;s native Belgium in May 1940, most newspapers closed down immediately. Some, however, continued publishing in &quot;stolen&quot; form, as mouthpieces for the occupier. It was in one of these, Le Soir, that Herg\u00e9 started publishing his work that same October. This decision led, after the liberation, to his arrest and the removal of his civil status, including his right to work - until the unimpeachable Leblanc&apos;s intervention one year later. Summarising the cartoonist&apos;s wartime conduct in his Guardian obituary of Leblanc last week, Michael Farr argued that the fervently royalist Herg\u00e9 was merely heeding King Leopold III&apos;s call to keep the country working - and claimed, moreover, that he &quot;realised the role Tintin could play in maintaining morale&quot;. I would suggest that Farr, a friend of Herg\u00e9, was being much too kind. There&apos;s a difference between stoking coal factories or baking bread (on the one hand) and (on the other) propagating race hatred, which is what Herg\u00e9 did. Appearing alongside Nazi propaganda, the Le Soir Tintin instalments of The Shooting Star contained a grossly antisemitic portrait of a Jewish banker named Blumenstein and showed the gaberdined shopkeeper Isaac dancing for joy on hearing the announcement that the world will end - because, as he announces to his friend Solomon, &quot;I owe 50,000 francs to my suppliers, and this way I won&apos;t have to pay them.&quot; My principal interest in dragging all this up is not to condemn Herg\u00e9 (although I find an eliding of the facts more than a little ethically distasteful). It is rather not to lose sight of the fascinating political trajectory the Tintin cartoons follow over the six decades of their production, from the 20s to the 70s. To say that the adventures&apos; origins lie on the right would be an understatement. The editor of the newspaper whose children&apos;s section first hosted them, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, kept a photograph of Mussolini on his desk. Tintin&apos;s first missions, to the Soviet Union and Belgian Congo, see him beating up evil commies and cajoling lazy, backward Africans into doing their duty and building their colonial masters&apos; railways. But no sooner has this right-wing strain got going than a left-wing one pops up to counteract it. The third adventure, Tintin in America, mounts scathing assaults on capitalist production (meat-packing plants that grind cats, dogs and even people in their machinery) and American racism: in the original version, a bank-clerk tells the police who show up after a heist that the townsfolk &quot;immediately lynched seven negroes, but the culprit got away&quot;. In the next-but-one story, The Blue Lotus, we see Tintin snap the cane with which an American oil magnate is beating a Chinese rickshaw driver in Shanghai, telling the bully: &quot;You conduct is disgraceful, Sir!&quot; By the final (complete) adventure, Tintin and the Picaros, the hero is sporting a CND sign on his moped helmet and plotting a revolution in South America. For me, what&apos;s ultimately telling is the way Herg\u00e9 undermines all politics. In Russia, Tintin sneaks behind what seems to be a factory in the healthy throes of full production to discover two-dimensional stage-fronts and a man hammering a sheet of metal to produce sound effects; he also unearths the gramophone with which the regime scares its people by transmitting ghost noises. But then he avails himself of the very tricks that he himself exposes: in Africa, he bamboozles a technologically illiterate tribe into believing he has magic powers by playing a record and projecting cinematic images to them. Even as the narrative advocates colonial power, it also suggests that the whole thing&apos;s a big scam. Both left and right get treated to the same debunking. The Alcazar of the Picaros may look like Che Guevara, but Herg\u00e9 takes great pains to let us know his politics are as artificial as the masks and decorations of the carnival during which his revolution takes place - or, indeed, as the fake walls and two-way mirrors of the hotel room in which Tintin spends half the book being photographed and recorded. Herg\u00e9&apos;s whole world, it seems, is one that&apos;s continually being emptied out, turned into simulation, into a film set. In this respect, the other big item of Tintin news to emerge in March is fitting. As The Guardian announced last Friday, the Spielberg adaptation of the cartoons has been cast, with Thomas Sangster in the title role; it should be released in 2010. Spielberg tried to acquire the film rights to the books in the late 70s, but failed - then promptly went off and made the suspiciously Cigars of the Pharaoh-evoking Raiders of the Lost Ark (as one critic delicately put it, Indiana Jones &quot;is basically a Tintin who fucks&quot;). With Herg\u00e9 out of the way and the Fondation in the driving seat, though, Hollywood&apos;s money is good, and the project is back on. I hold out little hope for Spielberg&apos;s film. I suspect it will be sanitised and anodyne, devoid of the complexities that make Tintin so compelling. Herg\u00e9 complained in his last years that his creation was killing him. The final sequence in the incomplete Tintin and Alph-Art shows, in what I&apos;ve always seen as a cryptic cry of desperation on its author&apos;s part, the hero being led off to have plaster poured on him and thus be turned into an artwork called &quot;Reporter&quot; - condemned, that is, to die inside his own simulacrum. This is dark stuff, Dorian Gray territory. If I had my way, the film would be directed by David Lynch.", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Tintin"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-04T23:15:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/06/london08.livingstone", "sentences": ["By contrast, for Livingstone the future will depend on ensuring the capital keeps ahead of New York, Frankfurt and Shanghai by becoming ever more business-friendly."], "title": "Which way will the wheel spin for London?", "article": "Each night, London&apos;s West End heaves with crowds swarming to bars, clubs and restaurants. Shoppers in Covent Garden, Oxford Street and Knightsbridge spill off the pavement while the tube sags under the weight of passenger growth. Theatres and music venues enjoy record receipts, the city&apos;s universities are attracting more international students than ever and London&apos;s Premier League football matches routinely sell out. So it&apos;s hard to believe that the world&apos;s financial centre is standing on the verge of an economic downturn. &apos;It&apos;s like walking around in September or November 1939,&apos; says the London School of Economics&apos; urban guru, Tony Travers. &apos;War was declared, then nothing happened.&apos; However, Des Gunewardena, whose firm D&amp;D runs the largest group of upmarket restaurants in the capital, including Skylon, Pont de La Tour and the Orrery, says: &apos;We are doing a lot better than you might guess from the papers. There&apos;s a definite cutback on spending from City firms on parties and events, and some easing off on expensive wine, but overall February was our best month since before the credit crunch.&apos; An elite group of private equity financiers, hedge fund tycoons and property speculators have created a wave of wealth that has enabled artists, advertisers and high-end retailers to enjoy unprecedented growth. That growth has been encouraged by Mayor Ken Livingstone, neck-and-neck with Boris Johnson in his bid to win another four-year term. Since 2000, Livingstone has assiduously courted property developers to ensure the City of London and Canary Wharf have enough skyscrapers to house international banks, law firms and other professional service firms. At the same time he has encouraged housing development - the number of homes built in London has nearly doubled since 1999 - to cope with surging demand and an affordability crisis. Rival mayors and local government officials marvel at Livingstone&apos;s ability to persuade central government to pour cash into projects he has championed: the Olympics, the East London Line and Crossrail. He has looked east to meet projected population growth. The reason he persuaded the government to support the Olympics bid was to kick-start development in the Lower Lea valley, where more than 30,000 homes will be built. But as London plans for growth, most analysts agree that a shake-out is coming. Last week, the Confederation of British Industry said the deepening credit crunch could cost up to 11,000 jobs in the UK&apos;s financial services sector as profitability, confidence and business volumes fall. Employment and profitability have fallen at the sharpest rate in five years and optimism has dropped for the third successive quarter. For Livingstone, a downturn in the City threatens to unravel his grand vision of a city at the forefront of financial innovation. He has undertaken high-profile missions to India and China to encourage firms from the emerging economies to float in the capital. His officials have also gone out of their way to tempt Russian companies to list here. It has paid off. London accounts for half the trade in global equities and overwhelmingly dominates the international bond market. But fears are growing that an over-reliance on the financial sector, now more vulnerable than at any point in 15 years, could see a domino effect on London&apos;s other business sector and, most significantly, its housing market. Livingstone&apos;s challenge is to ensure that there are other viable industries to sustain the capital, though his officials believe the downturn will be temporary. He is pushing ahead with plans to make London a centre of green technology as chair of a collection of 40 of the world&apos;s most powerful city mayors who have come together to fight climate change. Livingstone believes the bulk-buying power of cities can stimulate markets in green technology, and a series of programmes are in place to advance this. Meanwhile, plans for a major sustainable industries&apos; business park in Dagenham, north of the Thames as it passes into Essex, are under way and will form a large part of a third term if he is re-elected. Likewise the life science sector, thanks to breakthroughs at Imperial and King&apos;s College.  For 50 years from 1939, London&apos;s population fell. The end of its docks, decentralisation of key public-sector functions, lack of investment in housing and transport, and waves of immigration into the inner-London boroughs prompting &apos;white flight&apos; into the suburbs, created a sense of a city unable to cope with the post-industrial age. It was the decision by Margaret Thatcher to deregulate the Square Mile, as even &apos;Red Ken&apos; himself concedes, that sparked a revival in London as a global contender. The Office for National Statistics projects that London&apos;s population will grow by 11 per cent between 2006 and 2026 to 8.7 million as it continues to attract people from overseas. However, there are many who believe the city has reached its zenith, particularly as youth unemployment remains higher than in almost any other part of the country. Business leaders worry that Livingstone, who they say has been &apos;pragmatic&apos; and &apos;business-friendly&apos;, may run out of energy if he wins a third term. On the other hand, they worry that Johnson will be a &apos;figure of fun rather than a figurehead&apos;. The Tory candidate&apos;s manifesto for growth and the London economy is sketchy at best. He has watered down his proposals to cut back on London representative offices in key international centres and has made great play of ensuring that the classic views in the city&apos;s skyline remain unimpeded by skyscrapers.  By contrast, for Livingstone the future will depend on ensuring the capital keeps ahead of New York, Frankfurt and Shanghai by becoming ever more business-friendly.

Levet, who pipped England&apos;s Oliver Fisher in a play-off, was on hand to shower Bourdy with champagne after Forsyth hit into a bush on the second play-off hole and Howell missed the green to take five at the 3rd. The trio ended one ahead of the Marbella-based Englishman, Miles Tunnicliffe. Bourdy had looked in control when he teed off four clear of the pack but in the space of six holes he had slipped two behind. He fought back with four birdies in seven holes from the turn for a 70 to match Howell&apos;s tally of 266. But it was his playing partner, Forsyth, who stole the show with seven birdies in his last 12 holes to match Bourdy&apos;s 31 on the back nine. The Scot, who had missed the cut on all five previous Tour outings before beating the South African Hennie Otto in a play-off on his sixth appearance to win the Madeira Open a fortnight ago, downed putts of 15ft and 30ft - the latter tumbling into the back of the cup after dithering on the brink - for threes at the par-four 17th and 18th. It sealed a second successive 66 for Forsyth, whose caddie, Dave Renwick, guided Jos\u00e9 Maria Olaz\u00e1bal (twice) and Vijay Singh to Masters victories.

He capitalised coolly by skimming a deft low chip six inches past the pin, 40 yards distant, to save par.

Researchers for the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) found vice-chancellors were often under intense pressure from their governors to climb the league tables at the cost of other objectives, like widening access to students from poor families. This pressure is likely to increase if tuition fees in England rise after 2009. &quot;It is possible that ranking position will affect an institution&apos;s ability to charge the highest fees across all its courses,&quot; said the report by the Open University and Hobsons Research. The report is critical of all the tables analysed - national rankings by the Guardian, the Times and the Sunday Times, and international rankings by the Times Higher Education magazine and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The tables do not provide a full picture of the sector, said the report, &apos;Counting what is measured or measuring what counts?&apos; There was not enough transparency about the way the tables were compiled. &quot;The resulting rankings largely reflect reputational factors and not necessarily the quality or performance of institutions,&quot; said the researchers. They have stayed away from recommending one table as better than another in case Hefce was seen as endorsing an official league table. The report further says the tables could be made more accessible and interactive. (The Guardian&apos;s online tables have been interactive since they were first published.) &quot;The influence of league tables is increasing both nationally and internationally, and cannot be ignored despite serious methodological limitations,&quot; concluded the report. But it is the extent to which universities are apparently being blown off course by their attempts to climb league tables which is likely to concern the funding council. David Eastwood, Hefce chief executive, urged universities to think for themselves and be more diverse rather than trying to copy each other. At one post-1992 university, which did badly in league tables, the researchers found that although senior managers criticised them as &quot;irrational&quot; and based on Oxbridge models, the governors were strongly influenced. &quot;The board has set an institutional key performance indicator of improving the position in the league tables. This preoccupation with league tables I perceived as giving rise to pressure to move away from widening participation commitments. &quot;League tables are seen as encouraging &apos;gaming&apos;&quot;. Institutions are &quot;over-engineering&quot; their data submissions to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the official body from whom newspapers buy data for their league tables. A university in the Russell group of large research-intensive institutions that was consistently near the top of national tables and in the top 30 of the world rankings, nevertheless set up a league tables working group when some departments did les well in subject rankings. At a new university doing reasonably well in the tables found that governors were getting &quot;quite exercised&quot; about its rankings and discussed proposals for large targeted expenditure to drive it up the tables. However, they decided not to undertake &quot;risky spending&quot; in this way. The university was particularly concerned about the impact on international student choices, especially as overseas fees now made up 12% of total teaching income. While universities resent league tables, smaller higher education colleges that are left out of some of the institutional rankings complain that this makes them &quot;invisible&quot; to students. Alice Hynes, GuildHE chief executive, said: &quot;GuildHE universities and colleges provide much top quality teaching in particular subjects, and yet they are invisible in many league tables. This leaves students and other stakeholders with a distorted view of where the best higher education can be found in those disciplines.&quot; Eastwood said, &quot;There clearly is a demand for league tables, and they draw attention to important issues such as the student experience, retention and employability.&quot; However, there are also questions about league tables&apos; quality, impact and their possible perverse incentives. The league tables also have a much wider impact - for example, on institutions&apos; reputations and potentially on the behaviour of academics, businesses, and potential benefactors. Governing bodies take an interest in them as a means of measuring institutional performance, sometimes seizing on them in default of other, more appropriate, indicators of institutional performance. &quot;Our purpose in commissioning this research was not to create an authorised &apos;official&apos; league table or to endorse any particular approach, but to stimulate informed debate about league tables across the HE sector. We hope that this will lead to improvements in league table methodologies and enable users to understand their complexities better and avoid misunderstandings. We also want to help higher education institutions to develop approaches that satisfy the legitimate information needs of their stakeholders.&quot; \u00b7 Click here for the Hefce conference blog", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-08T13:43:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/10/china", "sentences": ["He also gave details on a second alleged ring uncovered in January, saying they had been manufacturing explosives and were plotting to attack hotels, government offices and military targets in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities."], "title": "China claims to have foiled Olympic kidnap plot", "article": "China has uncovered two terrorist gangs aiming to kidnap athletes at this summer&apos;s Olympics and attack tourist hotels, the Ministry of Public Security said today - prompting calls for officials to reveal more of their evidence.  Security forces have detained 45 suspects and seized explosives and firearms from the groups in raids in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, a spokesman announced.  Militants in the northwestern region, which has a large Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighur population, have been agitating for an independent &quot;East Turkestan&quot;.  But human rights groups have warned that the authorities have a history of exaggerating the threat of violence to strengthen their control over the region and justify repressive measures.  &quot;The problem is that because China has made such extravagant claims with respect to terrorism in Xinjiang - and because their definition of terrorism includes peaceful dissent and protest - it has become impossible to ascertain with any degree of certainty these types of claim,&quot; said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch.  &quot;At the same time it&apos;s perfectly possible that certain groups will stage attempts - China is not immune to terrorism and there&apos;s sufficiently large number of disaffected populations within China to make terrorism a serious threat.  &quot;The best thing they can do is to be as straightforward as possible with the facts and not interpret them immediately in a way that is overtly politicised,&quot; he said.  &quot;It will be interesting to see if they conflate this risk with unrest in the Uighur population. If these are genuine plots, it is no excuse for hardening repression against people in Xinjiang,&quot; said Bequelin. According to the Ministry of Public Security, 35 people were arrested in raids in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, between March 26 and April 6. It claimed they had been plotting to kidnap athletes, foreign journalists and other visitors to the August Olympics.  &quot;At the end of last year an overseas East Turkestan terrorist group issued an order requesting its members to enter the country to be ready to launch terrorist attacks at the Beijing Olympics,&quot; spokesman Wu Heping told a news conference.  &quot;At the same time it asked them to closely observe hotels that receive foreigners, government buildings and military bases.&quot;  He said the group also asked members to do trial runs using poisoned meat, poison gas and remote control explosive devices, adding that police had confiscated almost 10kg of explosives, eight sticks of dynamite and &quot;jihadist&quot; literature.  &quot;We face a real terrorist threat,&quot; Wu said. He urged residents to raise their awareness and to contact the police about anything they think is suspect.  He also gave details on a second alleged ring uncovered in January, saying they had been manufacturing explosives and were plotting to attack hotels, government offices and military targets in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities.  Wu said the gang had been acting on orders from a radical Xinjiang independence group, East Turkestan Islamic Movement.  Initial reports in the official media said that raid in Urumqi - in which two men were killed and 15 arrested - had foiled attempts to launch attacks in February. Last month Xinjiang&apos;s communist party chief said the group&apos;s purpose was &quot;specifically to sabotage the staging of the Beijing Olympics&quot; but offered no evidence.  In a separate incident, authorities have blamed Uighur separatists for an alleged hijack attempt on a flight from Urumqi last month. Western embassies told the Associated Press news agency they had requested more information but none had been forthcoming.  The security of competitors at the games has been a serious concern for organisers since the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes in the botched attempt to rescue them from kidnappers at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  The East Turkestan Islamic Movement has been designated a terrorist organisation by both the US and the UN. But many experts believe that its links to overseas groups - including al-Qaida - have been exaggerated and are mostly historic and suggest that its numbers have dwindled since the 90s, when it was said to be responsible for violent attacks.  Rebiya Kadeer, president of the Uighur American Association, has urged China to allow an independent UN investigation into alleged terrorism in the region.  Many believe the government has also conflated terrorism with wider disenchantment at its policies. Simmering resentment in the region - which covers an area three times the size of France - led to anti-government protests in the city of Hotan last month.", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "China", "World news", "Tibet", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-10T11:47:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/11/globaleconomy.creditcrunch", "sentences": ["That contrarian instinct was reinforced this week by the way that Asian stockmarkets, including those in Mumbai, Shanghai and Hong Kong, reacted to markets in America and Europe by going through wild gyrations of their own.", "So sub-prime losses in America, bank frauds in France and panics in London are irrelevant to developers in Beijing or in Shanghai."], "title": "Bill Emmott: Asia is not immune to the financial malady of the west", "article": "It is so nice when a consensus forms among the economic commentators. There is going to be a recession in America, the pack says, and probably in Britain too, for we have both sinned with our debt, our deficits and our soaring house prices. But the world as a whole won&apos;t suffer, as the great emerging economies of Asia - ie China and India - will carry on booming regardless. News that China&apos;s gross domestic product expanded by an extraordinary 11.4% last year - its fastest rate for 13 years - only strengthens this view. When a consensus is so clear, it is always time to wonder whether it might be wrong. That contrarian instinct was reinforced this week by the way that Asian stockmarkets, including those in Mumbai, Shanghai and Hong Kong, reacted to markets in America and Europe by going through wild gyrations of their own. A widely followed measure of such shares, the MCSI Emerging Asia index, was down 25% at one point this week from its October high. Why should that be, if Asia&apos;s boom is unaffected? The answer is, in part, that stock market traders are wild, emotional creatures, and we risk going mad if we try to understand their every move. But another part of the answer is that the sanguine consensus is likely to be only half right. The half that is wrong offers some good reasons for concern about Asia. The half of the consensus view that looks right is the half that says that China, India and the surrounding countries are not dependent on exports to America any more, and neither are they dependent on foreign capital. Exports to America account for about 8% of China&apos;s GDP and only 2% of India&apos;s, so while a big drop in those exports would have some effect, it is not going to be crippling. Moreover, a drop is already happening: exports to the United States from China have been declining for several months now, but overall growth keeps barrelling on. The reason is that capital is abundant, and it is being spent on new buildings, roads, stadiums, bridges, airports - you name it. In economic crises of old, the developing countries got hit twice over: by the loss of their export markets in the west, and by the withdrawal of their capital by panicky international bankers and investors. In the past decade the tables have been turned: China, other Asian economies (though not India) and the Arab oil producers have been the providers of capital to the west, not the receivers of it. One of the most extraordinary statistics about the Chinese economy is that capital investment accounts for 45% of GDP. The equivalent figures for America and western Europe are 15%-20%. That investment is being financed by China&apos;s own savings. So sub-prime losses in America, bank frauds in France and panics in London are irrelevant to developers in Beijing or in Shanghai.  As long as those developers keep on investing in new roads and buildings, the Chinese economy will keep on growing. Perhaps declining exports to America and Europe could reduce China&apos;s growth rate from 11.4% to 9%, say. But that is still pretty good, and would still mean that China offers a strong market for its Asian neighbours. That is the correct half of the consensus. It doesn&apos;t really apply to rich Japan, for its domestic economy is weak, and the loss of exports to the United States will injure it more. Things are also a bit different in India, which does need to import capital, because - unlike China - it runs a deficit. But India too has an investment boom, and so far its companies have been finding it easier to raise capital since the credit dramas began last August, as investors desert the loss-making markets of the west. Where the consensus is likely to be wrong, however, is in its implicit assumption that these Asian economies are not going to be facing problems of their own - problems that do have some link to the difficulties facing America and Europe. And chief among these problems is inflation. Rising prices for food, energy and other commodities, partly caused by strong Asian demand, lie behind the high interest rates and inflation worries that were spooking the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and, until its big interest cut, the US Federal Reserve. They are also a big worry for India and, even more so, China. In recent years China has followed a policy of keeping its currency cheap against the dollar in order to help exports. To do that, its central bank has had to focus its monetary policy on the currency and not domestic inflation, building up vast foreign exchange reserves (now $1.4 trillion, the world&apos;s largest) and allowing credit inside China to be ultra cheap. Hence all that investment in buildings, and by speculators in Chinese share markets. But hence, too, rising inflation. Now, consumer-price inflation is over 6%. Wages are also rising rapidly. Inflation last got badly out of control in China in 1988-89, which encouraged workers to join the student protests in Tiananmen Square. To avoid any repeat of that, government policy is beginning to change. The currency is being allowed to appreciate more rapidly against the dollar, thus reducing import prices. Interest rates are being raised. The revaluation is likely to accelerate, and the clampdown on credit growth is likely to get tighter. The danger is that China&apos;s investment bubble could then burst. The best parallel for China today is Japan in 1970. At that time Japan had been using a cheap yen to boost exports, cheap capital encouraged an investment boom, and environmental degradation prompted popular protests (remember Minamata disease?). Then, in 1971, Japan was forced by Richard Nixon to revalue the yen, and in 1973 the global oil shock brought inflation. The result? Not a disaster for Japan but a wrenching change: revaluation and rising industrial costs forced the economy to shift from the era of the motorcycle to that of the microchip. China faces the same sort of pressures now: currency revaluation, inflation, environmental damage. China needs to move its economy sharply upmarket. As Japan showed during the 1970s, this can be done. But it won&apos;t be easy. Which is why those stockmarket traders in Asia were right to turn a bit wild and emotional this week. \u00b7 Bill Emmott is a former editor of the Economist; his new book, Rivals - on the power struggle between China, India and Japan - is published this month bill@billemmott.com", "tags": ["Global economy", "Credit crunch", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-10T23:19:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/apr/11/golf.willbuckley", "sentences": ["There will be a clamour for Shanghai or Calcutta."], "title": "Will Buckley: Smug, snippy and Peed off in Augusta", "article": "Not, by any calculations, a huge response to the first blog, although it is always heartening to hear from the Mouth.

In many countries, he would be considered a gadfly. But in China, during this Olympic year, he is treated like a threat to national security. One police surveillance camera captures on tape whoever enters or leaves his Shanghai apartment. Another monitors whoever presses the elevator button. A third records people in the building&apos;s elevator. Lest the cameras prove unreliable, plainclothes police officers lounge in one corner of Zheng&apos;s landing throughout the day, smoking, sipping tea and playing cards. Often, Zheng said, they prevent him from leaving his building. When he tried in February to go out to buy dumplings, the guards beat him up. In recent months, he said, they have been allowing him to attend church services most Sunday mornings. But sometimes not. He never knows exactly why. &apos;That&apos;s the way things are for me,&apos; he said, smiling haplessly as if embarrassed by his fate. &apos;It&apos;s been going on for the last two years.&apos; As Beijing prepares to host the Olympic Games in August, the grinding controls imposed by the Chinese government on Zheng and other civil rights activists over the last decade are coming under growing scrutiny abroad. China&apos;s security forces have extensive experience and little legal restriction in suppressing dissent. But domestic challenges to Communist rule are playing out today within a rising international debate over what place China&apos;s human rights record should have in the Olympics. Beijing insists that the Games should have nothing to do with politics. Foreign activists, however, argue that the desire to celebrate athletic achievement should not be a reason for the world to ignore the dark side of Chinese policies. But while much focus has been on China&apos;s record in Tibet, little mention is being made of the daily challenges - from monitoring to arrest - risked by Zheng and any of China&apos;s 1.3 billion residents if they question the party line. Zheng, a 57-year-old native of Shanghai, first encountered trouble during the Cultural Revolution at the age of 17. He was sent to far northern Heilongjiang province, just south of what was then the Soviet Union, interrupting his secondary school studies.  When he arrived back in Shanghai six years later, he had no diploma and no place to live. Zheng quickly caught up with his studies, however, and entered Fudan University to study economic administration. Before the Eighties were out, he had also taught himself law and qualified for a licence to practise. Sensitised by his past, he started defending Shanghai families expelled from their homes to make way for the explosive development that would turn the city into China&apos;s largest, richest and most modern. &apos;Why did I worry about those people who lost their homes?&apos; Zheng asked, sitting in his living room in front of a wall full of legal manuals and case files. &apos;Because I had the same experience.&apos; Feng Zhenghu, a friend and fellow activist, said Zheng started out like any other lawyer, but began to see his clients&apos; problems as the result of government corruption and misconduct. As a result, Feng said in an interview, Zheng gravitated increasingly towards human rights cases and confrontation with Shanghai authorities.  His tactic was to use the letter of Chinese law, which offers broad guarantees in theory, to harass city officials who were seeking to plough ahead with their development deals. By asserting that the deals were often driven by officials&apos; desire for self-enrichment, Zheng became known as an adversary up and down the Shanghai government and party bureaucracy. &apos;In such cases, it&apos;s their own interests they are protecting,&apos; Feng said. &apos;Why are they so concerned? It&apos;s just speaking out and writing articles, right? Well, it&apos;s because people respond to these ideas. They want change. They can produce a lot of pressure on the government.&apos; Zheng converted to Christianity along the way and started attending services at a Wesleyan church about a 15-minute walk from his home. His wife, Jiang Meili, also became a member. Their faith, Zheng said, has given them values that inform his legal activism. In recent years, several dozen lawyers have made it their business to use Chinese law to defend people against the government. Like Zheng, a number have suffered retaliation.  One, Li Heping, was kidnapped and beaten in September. His car was recently rammed by a police vehicle as he took his son to school. Another, Teng Biao, was kidnapped for about 40 hours last month, presumably because of his friendship with Hu Jia, the internet essayist who was sentenced on 3 April to three and a half years in prison. Gao Zhisheng, a lawyer who became famous defending practitioners of the spiritual movement Falun Gong, has been under house arrest for months. In defending homeless families caught up in land confiscation, Zheng got into trouble by suggesting publicly that corruption had infected senior officials in the Shanghai leadership.  He specifically pointed a finger at Huang Ju, a former mayor who rose to the Politburo&apos;s elite Standing Committee; Chen Liangyu, the Shanghai party secretary; and two sons of Jiang Zemin, the national party leader and President before Hu Jintao. &apos;Corruption is a large-scale problem in China,&apos; Zheng said. &apos;But the biggest problem of all is corruption in land seizures. So that&apos;s why they&apos;re always after me.&apos; The Shanghai authorities acted first to invalidate Zheng&apos;s law licence. Undeterred, he kept taking cases. Then came the criminal prosecution. Zheng had been given a New China News Agency dispatch describing the Shanghai land disputes. Unknown to him, he said, it was an &apos;internal&apos; article, distributed only to officials above a certain level. He gave the dispatch to local reporters for the BBC and Agence France-Presse and faxed a copy to a US-based human rights organisation.  For that, he was convicted of revealing state secrets and sentenced to three years in prison. After serving his time, he was released in 2006. That, he said, was when the surveillance cameras were installed and plainclothes police from the local Public Security Bureau were stationed on the landing. The Zhabei District Public Security Bureau, queried by telephone, said it knew nothing about the team monitoring Zheng. &apos;Don&apos;t disturb us,&apos; a woman said before hanging up. An official at the city Public Security Bureau&apos;s information office said he would investigate and call back, but did not. Zheng also has been unable to return to work because of the restrictions, which include disabling his land line and mobile phones. He said he relies on his wife&apos;s pension and contributions from sympathetic lawyers in Beijing and the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group in Hong Kong. Police cited Zheng as a suspect because his wife&apos;s younger brother has been accused of evading taxes on an adjacent apartment, Feng said. He has repeatedly been called in to testify. &apos;But the more they try to pressure him, the more he sticks his neck out,&apos; Feng said, smiling. In what was interpreted as a gesture of US government support, Zheng&apos;s daughter, Zheng Zhaojia, 22, was granted a US visa last year and has gone to the United States to study. &apos;We are dismayed by the restrictions on Mr Zheng&apos;s freedoms, including his inability to leave his residence and meet with other people,&apos; the US Consulate here said in a statement. Long after Zheng&apos;s accusations irritated officials, party secretary Chen was fired and tried for massive corruption; he was sentenced to 18 months&apos; imprisonment on Friday. Huang Ju died of cancer last year, but his secretary, Wang Weigong, was taken into custody on charges of corruption in the same case. The Shanghai government, however, still appears to be concerned with Zheng. A pair of civilian officials visited him on Wednesday last week, he said, and urged him not to post anything on the internet about the troubles in Tibet because of the &apos;sensitive situation&apos;. On Friday, the plainclothes police squad upbraided him for trying to leave for the evening services at the church down the street. &apos;Why are you trying to surprise us?&apos; he quoted them as saying, suggesting that they had orders that the Sunday morning leave was all he was going to get. The rights champion Yang ChunlinJailed for five years for subversion An unemployed former factory worker from Heilongjiang province, Yang Chunlin, who was jailed for five years for subversion, was accused of accepting money from foreign organisations, writing critical articles and organising a petition for farmers who had lost their land to developers. The petition said: &apos;We don&apos;t want the Olympics, we want human rights.&apos; His sister, Yang Chunping, said: &apos;He might have criticised the party and some officials, but all he did is improve the development of democracy. What he said is based on freedom of speech.&apos; The husband and wife activists Hu Jia and Zeng JinyanJailed for subversion and under house arrest respectively Internet essayist Hu Jia, 34, has received much international attention since his jailing, with critics of China alleging that his sentence is part of a crackdown to silence dissent before the Olympics. Hu Jia was jailed for posting articles on overseas websites, including one criticising China for breaking its promise to improve human rights ahead of the Olympics, and for interviews he gave to foreign journalists. Although Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has denied a crackdown on dissidents, the cases of Hu and Yang Chunlin - jailed for five years - have drawn condemnation. Hu first rose to prominence as an Aids campaigner, later fighting for democratic rights, religious freedom and self-determination for Tibet.

She argues with shopkeepers in New Delhi over prices and quarrels with her husband, a casual labourer, over his wages - about 50 rupees (60p) a day. &apos;When I go to the market and see how little I can get for my money, it makes me want to hit the shopkeepers and thrash the government,&apos; she says. A few months ago, Kamla - who is 42 - decided she and her husband could no longer afford to eat twice a day. The couple, who have already sent their two teenage sons to live with more prosperous relatives, now exist on only one daily meal. At midday Kamla cooks a dozen roti (a round, flat Indian bread) with some vegetables fried with onions and spices. If there are some left, they will eat them at night. The only other sustenance that the couple have are occasional cups of sugared tea.  &apos;My husband and I would argue every night. In the end he told me it wouldn&apos;t make his wages grow larger. Instead we went down to one meal a day to cut costs.&apos; It is a grim, unsettling story. Yet it is certainly not an exceptional one. Across the world, a food crisis is now unfolding with frightening speed. Hundreds of millions of men and women who, only a few months ago, were able to provide food for their families have found rocketing prices of wheat, rice and cooking oil have left them facing the imminent prospect of starvation. The spectre of catastrophe now looms over much of the planet. In less than a year, the price of wheat has risen 130 per cent, soya by 87 per cent and rice by 74 per cent. According to the UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation, there are only eight to 12 weeks of cereal stocks in the world, while grain supplies are at their lowest since the 1980s. For the Devi family, and hundreds of millions of others like them, the impact has been calamitous, as Robert Zoellick, the World Bank President, warned at this weekend&apos;s G7 meeting in Washington. Brandishing a bag of rice, he told startled delegates from the world&apos;s richest nations that the world was now perched at the edge of catastrophe.  &apos;This is not just about meals forgone today, or about increasing social unrest, it is about lost learning potential for children and adults in the future, stunted intellectual and physical growth,&apos; he said. Without urgent action to resolve the crisis, he added, the fight against poverty could be set back by seven years. Not surprisingly, these swiftly rising prices have unleashed serious political unrest in many places. In Dhaka yesterday 10,000 Bangladeshi textile workers clashed with police. Dozens were injured, including 20 policemen, in a protest triggered by food costs that was eventually quelled by baton charges and teargas. In Haiti, demonstrators recently tried to storm the presidential palace after prices of staple foods leaped 50 per cent.  In Egypt, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal and Cameroon there have been demonstrations, sometimes involving fatalities, as starving, desperate people have taken to the streets. And in Vietnam the new crime of rice rustling - in which crops are stripped at night from fields by raiders - has led to the banning of all harvesting machines from roads after sunset and to farmers, armed with shotguns, camping around their fields 24 hours a day. But what are the factors that led to this global unrest? What has triggered the price rises that have put the world&apos;s basic foodstuffs out of reach for a rising fraction of its population? And what measures must be taken by politicians, world leaders and monetary chiefs to rectify the crisis? Not surprisingly, the first two of these questions tend to be the easier ones to answer. Economists and financiers point to a number of factors that have combined to create the current crisis, a perfect storm in which several apparently unconnected events come together with disastrous effects. One key issue highlighted at the G7 meeting was the decision by the US government, made several years ago, to give domestic subsidies to its farmers so that they could grow corn that can then be fermented and distilled into ethanol, a biofuel which can be mixed with petrol. This policy helps limit US dependence on oil imports and also gives support to the nation&apos;s farmers. However, by taking over land - about 20 million acres so far in the United States - that would otherwise have been used to grow wheat and other food crops, US food production has dropped dramatically. Prices of wheat, soya and other crops have been pushed up significantly as a result. Other nations, including Argentina, Canada and some European countries, have adopted similar, but more restrained, biofuel policies. But without mentioning any countries by name, Zoellick clearly pointed the finger of blame at the US. Everyone should &apos;look closely at the effects of the dash for biofuels&apos;, he said. &apos;I would hope that countries that, for whatever reason, energy security and others, have emphasised biofuel development will be particularly sensitive to the call to meet the emergency needs for people who may not have enough food to eat.&apos; This point has also been stressed recently by the UK government&apos;s chief scientific adviser, Professor John Beddington. &apos;It is very hard to imagine how we can see the world growing enough crops to produce renewable energy and at the same time meet the enormous demand for food,&apos; he said. &apos;The supply of food really isn&apos;t keeping up.&apos; For his part, Hank Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary - asked about the impact of US energy policies on food prices on Friday - tried to bat away the question. &apos;This is a complex area, with a number of causes,&apos; he told reporters. The first priority, he added, was to get food supplies to people who need them, before considering the longer-term reasons for the rising prices. It was not a point shared by the chief of staff in the United Nations trade and development division, Taffere Tesfachew, who flew to London last week ahead of a vital meeting of the leaders of the world&apos;s poorest nations in Accra, the capital of Ghana. Instead of an agenda designed to achieve economic progress in the developing world, the meeting will instead focus on the pressing issue of food. Tesfachew said that decades of aid has been skewed to ambitious industrialisation programmes and that the World Bank and others have failed to invest in the agricultural sector. &apos;We believe these high food prices won&apos;t disappear in the next two years, so now is the time to redress imbalances in terms of ethanol subsidies,&apos; he said. Zoellick was also clear that action was now urgently needed. &apos;In the US and Europe over the last year we have been focusing on the prices of gasoline at the pumps. While many worry about filling their tanks, many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs. And it&apos;s getting more and more difficult every day,&apos; added Zoellick, who made an impassioned plea to the world&apos;s rich nations to provide emergency help, including $500m in extra funding to the UN World Food Programme. This call was backed by finance ministers from the G24, who represent the leading developing countries, who also demanded extra cash to help cushion the poor against the shock of rising food prices. As well as causing hunger and malnutrition, the rising cost of basic foodstuffs risks blowing a hole in the budgets of food-importing countries, many of them in Africa, they argued. As to the other factors that have combined to trigger the current food crisis, experts also point to the connected issue of climate change. As the levels of carbon dioxide rise in the atmosphere, meteorologists have warned that weather patterns are becoming increasingly disturbed, causing devastation in many areas. For several consecutive years, Australia - once a prime grower of wheat - has found its production ruined by drought, for example. Scarcity, particularly on Asia&apos;s grain markets, has then driven up prices even further. Some campaigners see climate change as the most pressing challenge facing the world while others now say that biofuels - grown to offset fossil fuel use - is taking food out of the mouths of some of the world&apos;s poorest people. The net result will be eco-warriers battling with poverty campaigners for the moral high ground. On top of these issues, there is the growing wealth of China and its 1 billion inhabitants. Once the possessor of a relatively poor rural economy, China has becoming increasingly industrialised and its middle classes have swelled in numbers.  One impact has been to trigger a doubling in meat consumption, particularly pork. As the country&apos;s farmers have sought to feed more and more pigs, more and more grain has been bought by them. However, China has only 7 per cent of the world&apos;s arable land and that figure is shrinking as farmland has been ravaged by pollution and water shortages.  The net result has been to decrease domestic supplies of grain just as demand for it has started to boom. Again the impact has struck worst in the Third World, with wheat and other grain prices soaring. And finally there is the issue of vegetable oils. Soya and palm oils are a major source of calories in Asia. But flooding in Malaysia and a drought in Indonesia have limited supplies.  In addition, these oils are now being sought as bio-diesel, which is used as a direct substitute for diesel in many countries, including Australia. The impact has been all too familiar: an alarming drop in supplies for the people of the Third World as prices of this basic commodity have soared.  One such victim is Kamla Devi. She has already had to abandon dhal, a central, protein-rich dish of lentils that was a key part of her family&apos;s diet for several months. Now the cooking of fried food - in particular, pooris: hot, puffed, oil-soaked bread - has had to follow suit for the simple reason that cooking oil has become unaffordable. &apos;It has affected my health,&apos; she says. &apos;The rich are becoming richer. They go to shopping malls and they don&apos;t need to worry. The problem with prices only matters for the poor people like me.&apos; \u00b7 Additional reporting by Amelia Gentleman and Nick Mathiasson Four key factors behind the spreading fear of starvation across the globe Growing consumption Six months ago Zhou Jian closed down his car parts business and launched himself as a pork butcher. Since then the 26-year-old businessman&apos;s Shanghai shop has been crowded out - despite a 58 per cent rise in the price of pork in the past year - and his income has trebled. As China&apos;s emerging middle classes become richer, their consumption of meat has increased by more than 150 per cent per head since 1980. In those days, meat was scarce, rationed at around 1kg per person per month and used sparingly in rice and noodle dishes, stir fried to preserve cooking oil.  Today, the average Chinese consumer eats more than 50kg of meat a year. To feed the millions of pigs on its farms, China is now importing grain on a huge scale, pushing up its prices worldwide. Palm oil crisis The oil palm tree is the most highly efficient producer of vegetable oil, with one acre yielding as much oil as eight acres of soybeans. Unfortunately, it takes eight years to grow to maturity and demand has outstripped supply. Vegetable oils provide an important source of calories in the developing world, and their shortage has contributed to the food crisis.  A drought in Indonesia and flooding in Malaysia has also hit the crop. While farmers and plantation companies hurriedly clear land to replant, it will take time before their efforts bear fruit. Palm oil prices jumped nearly 70 per cent last year, hitting the poorest families. When a store in Chongqing in China announced a cooking-oil promotion in November, a stampede left three dead and 31 injured. Biofuel demand The rising demand for ethanol, a biofuel that is mixed with petrol to bring down prices at the pump, has transformed the landscape of Iowa. Today this heartland of the Midwest is America&apos;s cornbelt, with the corn crop stretching as far as the eye can see.  Iowa produces almost half of the entire output of ethanol in the US, with 21 ethanol-producing plants as farmers tear down fences, dig out old soya bean crops, buy up land and plant yet more corn. It has been likened to a new gold rush.  But none of it is for food. And as the demand for ethanol increases, yet more farmers will pile in for the great scramble to plant corn - instead of grain. The effect will be to further worsen world grain shortages. Global warming The massive grain storage complex outside Tottenham, New South Wales, today lies virtually empty. Normally, it would be half-full. As the second largest exporter of grain after the US, Australia usually expects to harvest around 25 million tonnes a year. But, because of a five-year drought, thought to have been caused by climate change, it managed just 9.8 million tonnes in 2006. Farmers such as George Grieg, who has farmed here for 50 years, have rarely known it to be so bad. Many have not even recovered the cost of planting and caring for their crops, and are being forced into debt. With global wheat prices at an all-time high, all they can do is cling on in the hope of a bumper crop next time - if they are lucky.  Food in figures 93,000,000 Acres of corn planted by US farmers last year, up 19 per cent on 2006.  76% Amount of US corn used for animal feed.  8kg Amount of grain it takes to produce 1kg of beef. 20% Portion of US corn used to produce five billion gallons of ethanol in 2006-07.  50kg Quantity of meat consumed annually by the average Chinese person, up from 20kg in 1985.  10% Anticipated share of biofuels used for transport in the EU by 2020.  $500m The UN World Food Programme&apos;s shortfall this year, in attempting to feed 89 million needy people.  9.2bn The world&apos;s predicted population by 2050.

Maybe I need to qualify the remark by acknowledging that I have never met China&apos;s rulers or secret policemen. What is happening in Tibet is repugnant. China is a tyranny, in which personal rights and freedoms are non-existent. Yet, having visited the country several times lately, most recently in January, I feel a goodwill towards its people that makes me unwilling to join the chorus that wants this summer&apos;s Olympics to prove a fiasco. China has suffered so much for so long - from nature, western barbarians, the Japanese, Mao Zedong - that it seems overdue for some good fortune. During my last trip, I met several academics who are bitterly critical of the Beijing government. Yet not one advocated a western boycott of the Olympics. Most suggested that the games might be a force for at least some small good.  While China remains a tyranny, since the 1970s it has become a significantly less brutal one. Li Datong, a journalist who was sacked last year as a magazine editor for crossing the low threshold of political criticism that the government will tolerate, said: &quot;We have progressed. For instance, it is possible for you to meet me, which could not have happened in Mao&apos;s time. This is still a dictatorship, but it is much less violent and cruel.&quot;  The scale of repression has moderated. Though the Beijing regime professes indifference to world opinion, it is increasingly sensitive to it. Huge numbers of Chinese are being educated abroad. They return home keenly aware of how others do things, and eager to share their freedoms. This must influence China&apos;s future. Beijing invests massive resources in efforts to control the internet, but the monitors are swamped. In the 1960s Shanghai residents were kept in ignorance of events in Beijing, and vice versa. This is now unthinkable. Educated people know much more about what is happening in their own country and abroad. A wise economist, Mao Yushi - a 74-year-old who has taught at Harvard - suggested to me in January, with some prescience: &quot;This could be a year of troubles for China. The [Communist] party concentrates so much on its own self-interest that it tries to ignore the host of contradictions which have accumulated in this country.&quot; Yet he welcomes the Olympics as a historic milestone. He is heartened by progress, albeit at snail&apos;s pace, towards acknowledging China&apos;s past. It is still forbidden to avow the horrors of the great famine of the 1950s, or of the cultural revolution in the ensuing decade. But Mao Yushi says: &quot;I think we are approaching the time when we shall be able to talk about Mao Zedong and the enormous damage he inflicted upon China and the Chinese people.&quot; He thinks it is right to encourage foreign criticism of China&apos;s absence of human rights, but argues &quot;blame should be tempered with praise when something improves&quot;. He cherishes hopes that the example of Hong Kong, where the rule of law more or less prevails, will extend elsewhere in the country. More and more people, he said, understand that law is indispensable to progress.  Mao Yushi&apos;s relative optimism about the future is founded upon the fact that he has been around a long time, and has lived through China&apos;s bloodiest decades. He says: &quot;Mao&apos;s regime maximised pain. Now, we maximise money. The real gulf in Chinese society is not between rich and poor; it is between those with power, and those with none.&quot; To be sure, some Chinese take a bleaker view. Professor Qin Hui, of Tsinghua University, argues that before the Tiananmen Square massacre there was more freedom and greater hope than there is today. He expresses scorn for western intellectuals who, in the 1960s, regarded Mao as an enlightened despot and supposed that the cultural revolution was a bracing spiritual renaissance. Do not allow yourselves to be deluded twice, urged the professor. He is appalled by the plight of millions of migrant workers, some of whom are building the Olympic facilities. They possess only slave status, he said bitterly. Li Datong said China&apos;s rulers exist in a permanent state of terror about losing control, and sometimes it happens. Disasters occur without any conscious act of will by the politburo ; in 1989 nobody in Beijing, he said, believed troops in Tiananmen Square would be so stupid as to fire on protesters. Yet he is still hopeful: &quot;Give us another 30 years, which is nothing in the span of Chinese history. You will see big changes.&quot;  China was ghastly when I first visited, in 1971, with a BBC crew. Open dialogue was impossible. At Beijing University the government paraded before us an elderly professor, who spoke perfect English. He parroted a script about how the experience of being sent to labour in the fields had made him understand how much he needed to learn from the peasants. During a break, the producer and I found ourselves beside the old man, and unobserved. &quot;You can&apos;t really believe all that nonsense,&quot; we demanded. He looked at us with an expression of infinite pain and muttered: &quot;You don&apos;t understand how things are here.&quot;  That exchange sharpens the contrast with 2008 when, as a foreigner, I could listen to Chinese people expressing their hopes and fears with frankness and often wit. China is still ruled by clumsy, ruthless apparatchiks, but beneath them is a vast hive not merely of industry, but also of ideas and imagination. It is hard to believe that the politburo can indefinitely hold down a lid upon the ferment.  I am not foolish enough to anticipate China&apos;s emergence as a liberal democracy, smiling upon the west. But its people are remarkable, and inspire sympathy, not least for their pride in having come so far so fast. There still seems a chance that the games in Beijing will force China&apos;s rulers to behave a little better, rather than merely serve as a showcase for the success of repression. comment@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "China", "Human rights", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-13T23:03:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/14/tibetslaststand", "sentences": ["The Chinese have exported their version of modern development to Tibet not only in terms of architecture and infrastructure, but also people - wave after wave of them: businessmen from Sichuan, prostitutes from Hunan, technocrats from Beijing, party officials from Shanghai, and shopkeepers from Yunnan."], "title": "Tibet's last stand", "article": "Are the Tibetans doomed to go the way of the Native Americans? Will they be reduced to nothing more than a tourist attraction, peddling cheap mementos of a once-great culture? That sad fate is looking more and more likely, and the Olympic year has already been soured by the Chinese government&apos;s efforts to suppress resistance to it. The Chinese have much to answer for, but the fate of Tibet is not just a matter of semi-colonial oppression. It is often forgotten that many Tibetans, especially educated people in the larger towns, were so keen to modernise their society in the mid-20th century that they saw the Chinese communists as allies against rule by holy monks and serf-owning landlords. In the early 1950s, the young Dalai Lama himself was impressed by Chinese reforms and wrote poems praising Chairman Mao. Alas, instead of reforming Tibetan society and culture, the Chinese communists ended up wrecking it. Religion was crushed in the name of Marxist atheism. Monasteries and temples were destroyed during the cultural revolution (often with the help of Tibetan red guards). Nomads were forced to live in ugly concrete settlements. Tibetan arts were frozen into folkloric emblems of an officially promoted &quot;minority culture&quot;. And the Dalai Lama and his entourage were forced to flee to India. None of this was peculiar to Tibet. The wrecking of tradition and forced cultural regimentation took place everywhere in China. In some respects, the Tibetans were treated less ruthlessly than the majority of Chinese. Nor was the challenge to Tibetan uniqueness typical of the communists. General Chiang Kai-shek declared in 1946 that the Tibetans were Chinese, and he certainly would not have granted them independence if his Kuomintang party had won the civil war. If Tibetan Buddhism was severely damaged, Chinese communism has barely survived the ravages of the 20th century, either. But capitalist development has been even more devastating to Tibetan tradition. Like many modern imperialist powers, China claims legitimacy for its policies by pointing to their material benefits. After decades of destruction and neglect, Tibet has benefited from enormous amounts of Chinese money and energy to modernise the country. The Tibetans cannot complain that they have been left behind in China&apos;s transformation from a developing world wreck to a marvel of supercharged urban development. But the price in Tibet has been higher than elsewhere. Regional identity, cultural diversity, and traditional arts and customs have been buried under concrete, steel, and glass all over China. And all Chinese are gasping in the same polluted air. But at least the Han Chinese can feel pride in the revival of their national fortunes. They can bask in the resurgence of Chinese power and material wealth. The Tibetans, by contrast, can share this feeling only to the extent that they become fully Chinese. If not, they can only lament the loss of their own identity. The Chinese have exported their version of modern development to Tibet not only in terms of architecture and infrastructure, but also people - wave after wave of them: businessmen from Sichuan, prostitutes from Hunan, technocrats from Beijing, party officials from Shanghai, and shopkeepers from Yunnan. The majority of Lhasa&apos;s population today is no longer Tibetan. Most people in rural areas are Tibetan, but their way of life is not likely to survive Chinese modernisation any more than the Apaches&apos; way of life survived in the US. Since Chinese is the language of instruction in Tibetan schools and universities, anyone who wishes to be more than a peasant, beggar, or seller of trinkets must conform to Chinese norms, that is, become Chinese. Even Tibetan intellectuals who want to study their own classical literature must do so in Chinese translation. Meanwhile, Chinese and other foreign tourists wear traditional Tibetan dress to have their souvenir pictures taken in front of the Dalai Lama&apos;s old palace. Religion is now tolerated in Tibet, as it is in the rest of China, but under strictly controlled conditions. Monasteries and temples are exploited as tourist attractions, while government agents try to ensure that the monks stay in line. As we know from the recent events, they have not yet been entirely successful; the resentment among Tibetans runs too deep. In the last few weeks, that resentment boiled over, first in the monasteries, and then in the streets, against the Han Chinese migrants, who are both the agents and main beneficiaries of rapid modernisation. The Dalai Lama has repeatedly said that he does not seek independence. And the Chinese government is certainly wrong to blame him for the violence. However, as long as Tibet remains part of China, it is hard to see how its distinct cultural identity can survive. The human and material forces arrayed against Tibet are overwhelming. There are too few Tibetans, and too many Chinese people. Outside Tibet, however, it is a different story. If the Chinese are responsible for extinguishing the old way of life inside Tibet, they may be unintentionally responsible for keeping it alive outside. By forcing the Dalai Lama into exile, they have ensured the establishment of a Tibetan diaspora society, which might well survive in a more traditional form than would have been likely even in an independent Tibet. Diaspora cultures thrive on nostalgic dreams of return. Traditions are jealously guarded, like precious heirlooms, to be passed on as long as those dreams persist. And who is to say that such dreams will never come true? The Jews managed to hang on to theirs for almost 2,000 years.

As one of the guilty men on the wanted list, I should declare an interest. (I will be there and, yes, will be wearing a flak jacket.) Around 150 well-informed people - senior university planning officers and the like - will come to the Universities UK conference armed with an exhaustive report on league tables, published last week by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). The title, Counting What Is Measured or Measuring What Counts?, gives some idea of the approach. With a 64-page report backed up by seven chunky appendices, you might think the last word on the subject had been said; but there is one striking omission: there&apos;s no ranking of the five newspaper league tables analysed - the Guardian, Times, Sunday Times and two international ones, from the Times Higher Education magazine and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This is deliberate. Hefce&apos;s brief to the Open University&apos;s Centre for Higher Education Research and Information (Cheri) and Hobsons Research was to avoid endorsing one set of rankings as &quot;official&quot;. I might feel the authors&apos; enthusiasm for interactive tables - a feature of the Guardian&apos;s online tables since their inception - suggests approval, but they couldn&apos;t possibly comment. This determination by UK universities to hold their noses when approaching league tables contrasts with what has happened in Germany, where the universities themselves dictated the rules of the game by evolving their own (interactive) rankings, which are published by Die Zeit. The Hefce report notes that the German rankings combine subjective data such as student feedback with objective data such as student/staff ratios or the average number of years to complete a degree. In Australia, too, the government has engineered league tables it is happy with by offering funding for good teaching that universities had to compete for. That&apos;s not going to happen in England. David Eastwood, Hefce&apos;s chief executive, told his annual conference at Warwick University last week that the funding council had no intention of producing authoritative league tables. The point of commissioning the Cheri research was to launch and frame a debate on improving existing tables and how they are used - especially by university governors. Eastwood was also concerned about universities altering their policies in an attempt to climb the league tables, and the report will have confirmed his fears. It found that vice-chancellors were often under intense pressure from their governors to move up the league tables at the cost of other objectives, such as widening access to students from poor families. Concerns about the impact on governors also surfaced at the Hefce conference. One vice-chancellor said he had arranged a day&apos;s seminar for his governors on league tables; after which they decided not to use them to set strategic objectives. At one post-1992 university, which did badly in league tables, the researchers found that although senior managers criticised them as &quot;irrational&quot; and based on Oxbridge models, the governors set an institutional key performance indicator of improving the league-table position. One university in the Russell Group of large, research-intensive institutions - which was consistently near the top of national tables and in the top 30 of the world rankings - set up a league-tables working group when some departments did less well in subject rankings. &quot;League tables are seen as encouraging &apos;gaming&apos;,&quot; noted the report - and, in a wonderful euphemism, said institutions were &quot;over-engineering&quot; their data submissions to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the official body from whom newspapers buy data for their league tables. This pressure is likely to increase if tuition fees in England rise after 2009. &quot;It is possible that ranking position will affect an institution&apos;s ability to charge the highest fees across all its courses,&quot; noted the report. &quot;The influence of league tables is increasing both nationally and internationally, and cannot be ignored despite serious methodological limitations,&quot; added the authors William Locke and Line Verbik, who complained that there was not enough transparency about the way the tables were compiled. &quot;The resulting rankings largely reflect reputational factors and not necessarily the quality or performance of institutions.&quot; Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire University, urged Hefce to go on the offensive over league tables. &quot;Given the amount of damage these league tables are doing to UK higher education ... isn&apos;t it time that the funding council took a much more robust view of exposing these commercial league tables as damaging to the UK and damaging to our overseas students.&quot; It is presumably a quite different Les Ebdon who boasts on Bedfordshire University&apos;s website: &quot;Our recent league table successes have also been cause for celebration. We have seen a massive 41.2% increase in applications to Ucas, the Guardian has placed us third for media and 12th for sport, we have jumped 24 places in the Times league table and our students rated us at 28th in the UK for student satisfaction in the National Student Survey.&quot; It was left to Eastwood to point out that universities themselves were legitimising league tables by plastering the results on their websites. Hefce&apos;s search for better methodologies and better understanding by users is one the Guardian is happy to engage in, and it has been for some time - through our review group, drawn from universities, for instance, which has tendered helpful, if robust, advice. So I&apos;ll be there at the conference - complete with flak jacket.

That will sum up what many Labour party members feel as Digby Jones&apos;s (private) revelation that he intends to leave the government before the next election is splashed across the newspapers this morning. It is a good principle of low politics to treat defectors well, &quot;pour encourager les autres&quot;. Quentin Davies has made effective attacks on Conservative Euroscepticism. Shaun Woodward presides over Northern Ireland from the cabinet. The difference with Jones is that he was always clear he was not joining the Labour party, still less the Labour tribe. He took up the offer from Gordon Brown to go out and bat for Britain and British business worldwide - a West Midlands version of Prince Andrew, perhaps - as long as he did not need to sully himself with the world of party politics. This insistence on being a semi-detached and apolitical member of the government partly explained the discontent among trade unionists and Labour peers over his appointment, along with his vociferous opposition to the minimum wage before 1997. In office, Jones has never been prepared to defend the full range of government policy, and broke with collective responsibility entirely over the taxation of non-doms. It would have made more sense to make him a trade envoy or part of an expert group than to appoint this kind of crossbench minister. So news of Jones&apos;s future departure is not much of a surprise, though the timing of it will not please Downing Street at all. Jones may be irked that at least two of just 12 participants in a private discussion seem to have spilled the beans. A great many Westminster and Whitehall discussions take place on a private basis or under the Chatham House rule. Perhaps 99% of the time it is observed. But the only way to be sure that something won&apos;t get out is not to stay it. Never Jones&apos;s strong point. However, Jones&apos;s larger-than-life persona can also lead people to underestimate how his views have changed in recent years. He had moved a fair way from advocating the &quot;slash the state&quot; Thatcherite politics than many in the labour movement associate him with. He has become evangelical about one of Gordon Brown&apos;s core political ideas - the need to improve skills and to unlock potential if Britain is to compete in the global economy. And his commitment to trade promotion abroad highlights the importance of government acting to attract inward investment: an issue which has tripped Boris Johnson up in the London mayoral election after his ill-judged plans to close down London&apos;s inward investment offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Delhi, Mumbai and Brussels came under fire from the City. For some in small business, this shift in Jones&apos;s outlook will simply prove that the CBI and the big corporations never look out for the little guy. But it is indicative of a more interesting - and underrated - political shift. Despite 30 years of anti-government rhetoric, on issues from climate change to global financial instability, the call is always for government to act. The Tory modernisers believe they have become electable because they are running on Labour spending plans and eschewing tax cuts. Perhaps this will lead them to mirror Bill Clinton&apos;s move to the centre in acknowledging the end of big government: in their case they could announce that, in the age of climate change, &quot;the era of small government&quot; is over. (And what a shame Gordon Brown probably won&apos;t do so first). But the Jones episode also demonstrates the pitfalls of &quot;big tent&quot; politics. Reaching across party boundaries can be good politics; and can offer a wider range of inputs to policy too. But Gordon Brown&apos;s difficulty has been in giving his government a clear sense of political direction. A big tent cannot do that because definition cannot be achieved without saying things with which some people will disagree. Politics is also about picking the right fights. We don&apos;t know yet which one Gordon Brown will choose. To stick to the tactics of triangulation is to fail to adapt to the fact that the Conservatives are now learning from three successive defeats. As the opposition ape progressive language and aspirations, this is to offer to fight a general election on David Cameron&apos;s terms. If voters believe there is little difference between the parties, the election is simply a referendum on the incumbents, not a choice between alternative governments. And that would be an election - with or without Jones on the campaign trail - that Gordon Brown would struggle to win.", "tags": ["Gordon Brown"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-15T13:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/apr/16/fashion.china1", "sentences": ["The People&apos;s Court of Shanghai Pudong District ordered the Chinese firm to hand over 180,000 yuan (\u00a313,000) in compensation - enough to buy 45 pairs of Gucci sandals, or 962 pairs from Senda."], "title": "Gucci stamps out shoe scam", "article": "Like many luxury brands, Gucci is used to seeing its products copied by counterfeiters.

India, the land of asylum for the Dalai Lama and the angry young hotheads of the Tibetan youth congress, finds itself on the horns of a dilemma. On one hand, India is a democracy with a long tradition of allowing peaceful protest, including against foreign countries when their leaders come visiting. It provided refuge to the Dalai Lama when he fled Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959, granted asylum (and eventually Indian citizenship) to more than 110,000 Tibetan refugees, and permitted them to create a government-in-exile (albeit one that India does not recognise) in the picturesque Himalayan hill town of Dharamsala. On the other hand, India has been cultivating better relations with China, which humiliated India in a brief border war in 1962. Though their bitter border dispute remains unresolved, and China has been a vital ally and military supplier to India&apos;s enemies in Pakistan, bilateral relations have grown warmer in recent years. Trade has doubled in each of the last three years, to an estimated $20.3bn this year; China has now overtaken the US as India&apos;s largest single trading partner. Tourism, particularly by Indian pilgrims to a major Hindu holy site in Tibet, is thriving. Indian information technology firms have opened offices in Shanghai, and Infosys&apos;s headquarters in Bangalore recruited nine Chinese people this year. India has no desire to jeopardise any of this. India&apos;s government has attempted to draw a distinction between its humanitarian obligations as an asylum country and its political responsibilities as a friend of China. The Dalai Lama and his followers are given a respected place but told not to conduct &quot;political activities&quot; on Indian soil. When young Tibetan radicals staged a march to Lhasa from Indian soil, the Indian police stopped them well before they got to the Tibetan border, detaining 100. When Tibetan demonstrators outside the Chinese embassy in New Delhi attacked the premises, the Indian government stepped up its protection for the Chinese diplomats. Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee - who was noticeably less forthcoming on Tibet than his American counterpart during a press conference with Condoleezza Rice - has publicly warned the Dalai Lama against doing anything that could have a &quot;negative impact on Indo-Sino relations.&quot; The Dalai Lama&apos;s curious position has complicated India&apos;s diplomatic dance with China. He is simultaneously the most visible spiritual leader of a worldwide community of believers, a role that India honours, and a political leader, a role that India permits but rejects in its own dealings with him. As a Buddhist, the Dalai Lama preaches non-attachment, self-realisation, inner actualisation, and non-violence; as a Tibetan he is admired by a people fiercely attached to their homeland, with most seeking its independence from China and many determined to fight for it. He is the most recognised worldwide symbol of a country that he has not seen for nearly five decades. The Dalai Lama&apos;s message of peace, love, and reconciliation has found adherents among Hollywood movie stars, pony-tailed hippies, Irish rock musicians, and Indian politicians. But he has made no headway at all with the regime that rules his homeland, and he has been unable to prevent Tibet&apos;s inexorable transformation into a Chinese province. His sermons fill football stadiums and he has won a Nobel prize, but political leaders around the world shirk from meeting him openly, for fear of offending China. Indians are acutely conscious that, on this subject, the Chinese are easily offended. While India facilitated the highly publicised visit by Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US house of representatives, to the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala last month, it almost simultaneously cancelled a scheduled meeting between him and Indian vice-president Mohammed Hamid Ansari. When China summoned India&apos;s ambassador in Beijing to the foreign ministry at two in the morning for a dressing-down over the Tibetan protests in New Delhi, India meekly acquiesced in the insult. Though prime minister Manmohan Singh has publicly declared the Dalai Lama to be the &quot;personification of nonviolence&quot; India has let it be known that it does not support his political objectives. Tibet, India&apos;s government says, is an integral part of China, and India lends no support to those who would challenge that status. That position is not without detractors. The opposition Bharatiya Janata party (the BJP, which led the previous government) has criticised the current administration for not &quot;expressing concern over the use of force by the Chinese government&quot; and instead &quot;adopting a policy of appeasement towards China with scant regard to the country&apos;s national honor and foreign policy independence.&quot; But few observers believe that the BJP would have conducted itself differently. The stark truth is that India has no choice in the matter. It cannot undermine its own democratic principles and abridge the freedom of speech of Tibetans on its soil. Nor can it afford to alienate its largest trading partner, a neighbour and an emerging global superpower, which is known to be prickly over any presumed slights to its sovereignty over Tibet. India will continue to balance delicately on its Tibetan tightrope.

The financial instability that just a few months ago put Super Aguri&apos;s entire season in doubt has returned as potential backers the Magma Group have walked away from a buy-out. Depending on when you&apos;re reading this blog, Sato and Davidson may well have found out that the team&apos;s trucks won&apos;t be leaving Leafield. Or Honda will have thrown team boss Aguri Suzuki a lifeline, along with a few spare parts, to tide them over until they find a new buyer. In that scenario they&apos;ll be hoping to make good in the race, despite lacking the preparation that everyone else will boast after this week&apos;s test at the Circuit de Catalunya. In more ways than is healthy, formula one isn&apos;t a game for weaklings. Any driver or team bold enough to take on the Piranha Club must stand on his own four wheels. The fat cats of the paddock won&apos;t give a damn if one of the championship&apos;s smallest teams can&apos;t find the money to race. Others will shake their heads at the way the cost of competition has swollen to gross proportions, squeezing out all but the very rich or well-connected whether it be manufacturers or investment groups. The teams at the tail-end of the grid are affectionately referred to as minnows. It&apos;s a cute title, highlighting their modest means and lack of ostentatious Wendy houses (hospitality units to them), but firmly placing them downstream in the formula one food chain. Without the smaller outfits, many young drivers would lack the opportunity to race at the highest level. Think about where some of the sport&apos;s biggest stars came from: Fernando Alonso got his break with Minardi, Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen at Sauber F1 (now owned by BMW). True, Lewis Hamilton, Heikki Kovalainen and Nelson Piquet Jr have all debuted with top teams - but they&apos;d either been picked up by them earlier in their racing careers or, like Piquet, had unusually good financial support and a famous name. There are many reasons to love Super Aguri. Their Japanese fans are absolutely bonkers and wear crazy hats. If formula one is going to desert Europe and head to new continents then we need at least a handful of teams with a different cultural flavour. They&apos;re the only possibility right now for Brit Davidson to prove, after some near misses and bad luck, that he&apos;s worthy of a seat (which he is). Sato may have had numerous feral moments on track, but there have been some loveable occasions - like the mania when he scored his first points, for Jordan, with fifth at Suzuka in 2002. You would have thought he&apos;d won while driving one-handed with a blindfold on, given the fans&apos; reaction. And Super Aguri are one of the few teams to have the traditional heritage of being set up by a former driver - McLaren is the other - modest though Aguri Suzuki&apos;s success was (the third-place finish for Larousse at Suzuka in 1990 being the high point). Although other sports have come to rely on the dollar - there been a suggestion that the Magma Group&apos;s backer is Dubai International Capital, which has just pulled out of a bid for Liverpool FC - the consequences seem far less extreme. Despite being awash with different championships, motor sport has no real structure. There&apos;s no promotion-relegation-promotion scenario to be played out. If Super Aguri aren&apos;t on that Barcelona grid, it&apos;s unlikely we&apos;ll see the team drop down to GP2 before reappearing in formula one a season or two later. They&apos;ll simply join minnows such as Minardi, Jordan and Spyker in the list of teams brash enough to take on the world&apos;s most expensive sport and find themselves caught short. Get up close to the new Lewis on the karting circuit If you fancy hunting the autograph of a future Lewis Hamilton (let&apos;s face it, once a driver enters formula one the gates close behind him and it&apos;s practically impossible to get a scribble on your cap) then keep an eye out for karter Will Stevens. Honda has just inked a long-term contract with the 16-year-old, who is races with top outfit TonyKart in Europe&apos;s karting series KF1, as well as in Japan. He&apos;s got several titles to his name and his next step is likely to be in a junior category - think Formula BMW or Formula Renault - in Europe in 2009. Provided you&apos;re happy to brave the wilds of Snetterton or Croft, the racing is usually more fun to watch than formula one and you can skulk around the open paddocks and quiz the drivers yourself. McLaren signatory karter Oliver Rowland will be another name to look out for once he makes the move to single seaters. Patronage from a formula one team does not necessarily result in a seat (both teams keep their promises vague) but after Hamilton&apos;s fairytale story, it could pay to predict the next dream signing. Alonso gets testing boost Fernando Alonso finally had something to smile about this season (apart from, you&apos;d guess, from Lewis Hamilton&apos;s errors in the Bahrain GP) when he made it to the top of the time sheets during testing at Barcelona this week. Back with his championship-winning team, he must have felt despair at being unable to extricate himself from the midfield in the R28. Unpromisingly, Renault&apos;s technical director has apparently admitted that there&apos;s no problem holding the car back, it simply needs more work, hence some new mechanical and aerodynamic parts. No quick fix then, but the testing success will have helped boost morale, and the Spanish fans will be hoping the home fixture might gift him a podium. Alonso, incidentally, was trying out the slick tyres the series will move to - amid near unanimous pleasure - next year. Michael Schumacher did the same for Ferrari, too. Last weekend&apos;s action \u00b7 Ralf Schumacher, the DTM&apos;s newest ex-grand prix star, debuted at Hockenheim with, erm, a 14th-place finish. Sure, the German had pre-empted such a dismal result and, yes, the Mercedes were way off Audi&apos;s pace (the A4s locked out the podium with Mattias Ekstrom winning ahead of Timo Scheider and Tom Kristensen). But Mercedes&apos;s 24-year-old rookie Oliver Jarvis, also in a 2007 spec car, finished inside the top 10. Will Schumacher redeem himself at Oschersleben this weekend? \u00b7 Turns out I got it wrong last week when I predicted that round two of the British Touring Car Championship in Rockingham would be dominated by elder statesmen Fabrizio Giovanardi and Jason Plato. Neither scored a win from the day&apos;s three races. I was right about one thing, though, Mat Jackson (along with Gordon Shedden and Matt Neal) took a win. In fact he almost left the weekend leading the championship, but collided with Colin Turkington while running second in the final race and ended up in the gravel. Giovanardi remains at the top of the standings, seven points ahead of Jackson. Plato, meanwhile, had a day to forget and despite two great comeback drives has dropped to sixth overall. \u00b7 Team Switzerland came within inches of taking the A1GP crown in Shanghai, when pole-sitter Neel Jani took victory in the sprint race as title rivals New Zealand wilted. Jonny Reid tangled with Jonathan Summerton of the US before the first corner and the pair went out. Summerton rubbed salt into New Zealand&apos;s wound by taking his debut win in the feature race, although Jani finished fifth and so failed to clinch the title. Baring incident, it should be a formality for him at the Brands Hatch season finale in May. This weekend&apos;s action \u00b7 The FIA GT championship gets under way at Silverstone with the classic Tourist Trophy, and rivals of the Vitaphone Maserati MC12 team will be hoping to end its recent dominance of the series. After finishing second in the drivers standings last year, the Jetalliance Racing squad - featuring ex-formula one driver Karl Wendlinger and Scot Ryan Sharp - look like a solid bet in their Aston Martin DBR9. After leaving his single seater aspirations behind, Sharp has been a hit in his subsequent outings in World Touring Cars (2006) and FIA GT (2007). The 28-year-old has really clicked with Wendlinger, the pair taking three wins last year, despite his lack of sports car experience. Unsurprisingly it was Vitaphone, however, that claimed the Tourist Trophy victory last year.", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula One"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-18T09:40:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.bjork1", "sentences": ["You can see how this sort of thing might have upset the Chinese authorities just over a month ago when Bj\u00f6rk added a chorus of &apos;Tibet, Tibet!&apos; to &apos;Declare Independence&apos; at her Shanghai gig."], "title": "Pop: Bj\u00f6rk, Hammersmith Apollo, London W6", "article": "Bj\u00f6rkHammersmith Apollo, London W6, touring until 4 May  If gonzoid children&apos;s illustrator Dr Seuss had ever dreamed up a political animal, it might have looked rather like Bj\u00f6rk.

In the background, bursts of flame almost chargrill Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s backdrop of flags decorated with frogs, birds and the endangered caiman crocodile. She ends the show trying to foment revolution. The encore is &apos;Declare Independence&apos;, a track from Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s last and sixth album, Volta. Raucous and sloganeering, it marks an abrupt shift away from her usual swooping soundcraft.

Green rave lasers cut through a shower of gold glitter as the crowd air-punch back, shouting: &apos;Higher, higher!&apos; in response to Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s: &apos;Raise your flags!&apos; It&apos;s a stupidly exhilarating climax to a fabulous gig, fusing the energies of punk and rave culture with Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s own bloody-mindedness.

Serbia&apos;s music festival, Exit, promptly dropped her from its bill, proving that pom-pom-clad creatives can still touch raw nerves. There&apos;s no explicit dedication tonight to any bit of Britain trying to shrug off the imperial yoke, but Welsh-speakers and Cornish separatists will have gone home even happier than the rest of us. In between, Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s politics are implicit, rather than explicit. Billed as Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s return to the dance floor after an absence of nearly a decade, Volta is actually more of a world music piece in which artificial borders are trampled over by stamping feet. Tonight&apos;s first unannounced guest is the feted Malian kora player Toumani Diabat\u00e9, who arrives in a gust of robes and coaxes origami arpeggios out of his instrument on &apos;Hope&apos;. (&apos;Hope&apos;, lest we forget, is about a pregnant female suicide bomber.) One of a slew of old favourites she plays tonight, &apos;Army of Me&apos; has martial club overtones. With the stage bathed all in red, and Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s core players - LFO&apos;s Mark Bell on digitals, avant-garde drummer Chris Corsano on percussion, musical director Damian Taylor on more gear - jacking their bodies to beats so hard they are almost nauseating, it feels like the rave at the end of the world. The term &apos;life-affirming&apos; is so often a euphemism for sentimental old tripe, but Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s works demand it. &apos;Hunter&apos; is redder in tooth and claw than usual, with innard-resonating bass, but Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s grasp of drama is a joy. As the musicians and machines build to a crescendo, Bj\u00f6rk ejaculates streams of silly string out of her hands like Spiderman. It gets caught in her hair puffs. Another old favourite, &apos;Hyperballad&apos;, starts off with the crowd bawling the verse, then turns the beats and bass up even further. From austere beginnings, &apos;Wanderlust&apos; turns into a Rio carnival tune, punctuated by Bj\u00f6rk hissing &apos;Relentlessly! Restless!&apos; - a concise summation of this gig, and her art. The quieter segments are no less mesmerising. Accompanied by suited and bespectacled harpsichordist Jonas Sen, who spends the gig looking like he ought to be playing keyboards on Phoenix Nights, she sings &apos;Vokuro&apos;, an Icelandic song from her 2004 album Medulla. Antony Hegarty turns up for &apos;Dull Flame of Desire&apos;, looking like a cross between the Cure&apos;s Robert Smith and a bag lady, but crooning powerfully in his effeminate husk as the Wonderbrass trump along. On the record, the song really takes flight at the end, when Antony and Bj\u00f6rk trade wordless ululations. Regrettably, he scampers off before that can happen. But some of the most skin-prickling moments of the night find Bj\u00f6rk at her most post-verbal, just opening her mouth and issuing sound. She trades notes with the organ on &apos;The Pleasure is all Mine&apos;, and gives voice to some unnamed beast on &apos;Vertebrae by Vertebrae&apos;.

As part of the Cumberland Ale Keswick Mountain Festival, local chef Peter Sidwell (owner of the Good Taste Cafe in Keswick) is setting up a restaurant on the top of Skiddaw, which soars to 931m.

Diners can expect a spectacular feast using local ingredients such as lamb and damsons, with dramatic views of the Lakelands. Tents will be set up, and diners will be escorted up the mountain by local guide Tim Mosedale.

The banners fly high in the breeze. Everything from a public bathhouse to a derelict factory may be a venue. Artists have flown in from as far as New York and Shanghai and the place is thick with international curators pounding the streets. The Gi, as they call it, is once again active. There was no festival last year. Things faltered; biennials were discussed. But new money was found for commissions. And these are now the backbone of an event that combines big, public shows, smaller ones in private galleries and assorted weird spots, plus a succession of performances, debates and parties of the sort for which the Glasgow art scene is undeniaby famous. At the astounding Centre for Contemporary Arts - where a row of Alexander &apos;Greek&apos; Thomson&apos;s grand houses is glassed over, a neoclassical street turned inside out - the space is made terrifying in Catherine Yass&apos;s new work. Yass filmed high-wire artist Didier Pasquette preparing to walk the wire between two towerblocks at Glasgow&apos;s Red Road flats last year. She shows him from four perspectives. You see him way above you, from the top of the opposite building, close-up, and then you see what he saw - a horrifying void, with the wind swaying the high wire as if taunting him with instant death. Time compresses and you are back there, like the tiny crowd far below, heart thudding as Pasquette steps out into space. Then your heart stops as he suddenly wavers. Glancing back and forth between the screens, you eventually deduce that he is stepping backwards to safety, a retreat that looks even more frightening than continuing forwards. His failure becomes Yass&apos;s success. Her installation is appallingly vertiginous; I saw one spectator topple to the floor. But it also crystallises the beauty of the moving image in art, the way it may take one back and forth in time as well as space, multiplying your view, letting you see through the mind&apos;s eye of both artist and subject. Yass is a Turner nominee; Simon Starling, who won the prize in 2005, was commissioned by Gi to make a silver sculpture that may or may not epitomise the decline of Trongate - for technical reasons, the piece can&apos;t yet be shown. But in the local bathhouse, you can see another of his maddeningly laborious yet elegiac projects: the resurrection of a boat called Dignity from the bottom of Windermere which is lovingly restored only to be fed into its own furnace spar by spar on the waters of Loch Long. Dignity becomes its own pyre in a burial, so to speak, at sea. The trouble with Starling&apos;s work or, rather, the visual record of it, in this case, dull slides, is that it never adds anything to the original idea, whereas Jim Lambie keeps on recycling his idea, applying sticky tape to gallery floors to create optical and spatial illusions. Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art has been done out in black-and-white, windscreen-wiper stripes so that the floor seems to ripple and whirl. Shipwrecked on this tide are old LPs entombed in concrete blocks - Harry Secombe, David Bowie - a Sputnik made of the sleeves of stuffed leather jackets and sundry references to the art of the past (Donald Judd, Robert Gober). It&apos;s a retro-environment, a late-pop milieu and, given that Lambie is in his mid-forties, wryly autobiographical. Which is exactly the undertow you should - but don&apos;t - feel across the Clyde in Jonathan Monk&apos;s nugatory show for the Tramway. Monk has gilded the tramlines so that the vast, white terminus feels a yard closer to heaven, but his display of other people&apos;s works (&apos;questioning notions of originality&apos; and so forth), for all the wit of its titles, strikes as simply secondhand. Go instead to Stephen Hurrel&apos;s wonderful installation next door in which data from seismic events coming in live from around the world are transformed into a modern son-et-lumi\u00e8re: an abstract topography of alps and glaciers, endlessly reforming on screen, visualises a soundtrack that sounds like Brian Eno crossed with supernatural ambience. It&apos;s the world beneath our feet, if only we had eyes and ears to perceive it. See the festival and you see Glasgow. Alasdair Gray&apos;s collages are down by the quayside. Dani Marti&apos;s fine film of a beggar&apos;s worldview reduced to receding feet on concrete is next to the Saltmarket pawnbroker&apos;s where wedding rings sell for a tenner. Kalup Linzy, all the rage in Manhattan, is showing his blaxploitation-cum-hip hop parodies in a disused shop by the Tron. Up a dark tenement, hard by the private detective and the Highland factor&apos;s office, the Modern Institute has a post-postmodern show of texts and photographs. In the sweeping splendour of Woodlands Terrace, Douglas Gordon&apos;s townhouse is home to an Algerian artist&apos;s films, which almost miss a trick by being so lightsome in their political nuance. In St Mungo&apos;s museum, you can see the sublime landscapes of the American photographer Thomas Joshua Cooper. Cooper teaches at Glasgow School of Art; Starling and co, so internationally successful, still live here. What you experience throughout Gi is the strength of the city&apos;s art community. But the most haunting work here concerns a Glaswegian tragedy - the rape and murder of Polish student Angelika Kluk. Her compatriot, the award-winning painter Wilhelm Sasnal, wrote a ballad about her death and then filmed it, performed first by a Polish punk and then by a poor naked girl. The song is powerful enough, but the film is shown in the dark cellar of a desolate printworks. Kluk was buried beneath such floorboards; going back up through the decaying limbo above feels terribly melancholy. This is a deathless memorial and does exactly what it should: it makes Angelika Kluk unforgettable.", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "Art and design", "Festivals"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-19T23:02:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/20/china.chinathemedia", "sentences": ["That was a reference to April 2005, when demonstrators attacked Japan&apos;s embassy in Beijing and consulate in Shanghai, burned Japanese goods and beat Japanese citizens because of Tokyo&apos;s bid to join the UN Security Council and over Japanese textbooks that downplayed Tokyo&apos;s wartime aggression."], "title": "Beijing gags anti-Western online anger", "article": "As Chinese nationalism flares across cyberspace, the government is growing concerned that passions could spill over into the real world, and that anger directed against foreigners could turn inward. Critics contend that Beijing has had a role in fanning the xenophobic sentiment to counter international condemnation of its crackdown on Tibetan rioters, but now Chinese officials appear to be trying to reduce the vitriol. Chinese censors have quietly warned cyber-police and internet businesses to delete all information related to protests against Western policies, nations or companies that have proliferated in the wake of demonstrations surrounding the global Olympic torch relay and high-level calls to boycott the opening ceremony of the summer games in Beijing. A notice issued last week by China&apos;s &apos;Internet Inspection Sector&apos; instructs recipients to reset the keywords used to block access to certain websites, relay the instructions through all internet distribution channels and then delete the notice in a timely manner. &apos;Such information has shown a tendency to spread and, if not checked in time, could even lead to events getting out of control as they did with the 9 April incident against Japan,&apos; says the censors&apos; notice.  That was a reference to April 2005, when demonstrators attacked Japan&apos;s embassy in Beijing and consulate in Shanghai, burned Japanese goods and beat Japanese citizens because of Tokyo&apos;s bid to join the UN Security Council and over Japanese textbooks that downplayed Tokyo&apos;s wartime aggression. A planned event to give away patriotic T-shirts near Beijing&apos;s Qinghua University reportedly was halted by police. The growing resentment towards foreigners comes during a year when China is hoping to showcase its hospitality to the world for the Olympics in August. The government has to curb criticism of foreigners without appearing weak in they eyes of angry Chinese. France has become a particular target of mass Chinese anger after pro-Tibet, Darfur and other human rights activists attacked the Olympic torch this month in Paris, forcing bearers to retreat to a bus and shorten the route. Earlier, French President Nicolas Sarkozy became the first world leader to suggest that he might boycott the opening ceremony. Several Western reporters have had death threats since their phone numbers and other details were posted online. Chinese internet users called for a boycott of Carrefour, the French supermarket chain that has more than 90 stores in China, after a rumour spread that shareholders supported the Free Tibet movement. Carrefour has denied any such support, but one online survey found 210,000 supporters for a boycott. &apos;The French really make Chinese people angry,&apos; said Zhou Shuyang, a 22-year-old student. &apos;And we don&apos;t want to be treated this way by the Western media, which lies. If we were allowed, a lot of people would join in protests, and I would as well.&apos; Chinese have called for boycotts of French products made by Herm\u00e8s, Louis Vuitton, Airbus, Renault and others, fuelled by rumours that the companies support the Dalai Lama, Tibet&apos;s spiritual leader, and donate sizeable sums to pro-Tibet groups. &apos;This is totally groundless,&apos; Bernard Arnault, chief executive of Louis Vuitton&apos;s parent company, LVMH, told the French daily Le Figaro &apos;These young people get very emotional,&apos; said Li Datong, former editor of the Freezing Point, an influential newspaper supplement. But &apos;it&apos;s unthinkable for the government to let demonstrations happen before the Olympics&apos;. In recent weeks China&apos;s propaganda department has tolerated and even fuelled an outpouring of internet postings and blogs against Western media. China&apos;s state-run media have featured articles on Western &apos;bias&apos; prominently. CNN has been singled out for using a photograph in March on its website that cropped out Tibetan rioters attacking Chinese targets, focusing instead on a Chinese military vehicle.

It&apos;s just a shame that we couldn&apos;t come home with a better result behind us. The state-of-the-art Shanghai International circuit is probably one of the best in the world and the facilities are second to none, so it&apos;s a relatively easy venue at which to set up office for the week. However, I do feel that the vastness of the modern site means there&apos;s a real lack of atmosphere in comparison to many of the other more intimate circuits at which we hold events. Each year it&apos;s amazing to see how much Shanghai changes as it continues its rapid development into one of the world&apos;s modern-day cities. But unfortunately, with the exception of the Ignition reception, this time I didn&apos;t get a chance to make the hour-long trip into the centre to experience the numerous world-class restaurants which keep opening each year or visit one of the fantastic markets (although there were plenty of bike, watch and hand-bag sellers happily wandering around the A1GP paddock selling their goods, which was an alternative lunch break activity). Much of my week in Shanghai was actually spent preparing for our home race at Brands Hatch on May 3-4. There&apos;s been a lot of work going on behind the scenes to ensure the British round is once again a contender for the best A1GP event of the season - although Durban or Zandvoort always manage to beat us to this prize each year. But at least we&apos;re definitely in contention for the best A1 team \u2013 you just need to get voting on www.a1gp.com now! Rather than the usual support race programme, A1GP held a Ferrari festival throughout the weekend to showcase the brand ahead of next season&apos;s partnership. In addition to demonstrating top-line models, Ferrari road cars and F1 cars, Ferrari also used the time to trial run some of the potential support events for 2008/09. It&apos;s really exciting to see the Ferrari/A1GP partnership starting to gain momentum. But credit must go to Lola and Zytek, who have delivered an extremely reliable package for A1GP from the start. You see so many other start-up series plagued by reliability issues and fortunately A1GP has managed to avoid this. It will certainly be the end of an era for A1GP when the original Lola-Zytek cars race for the last time at the Brands Hatch event but, with Ferrari waiting in the wings, the series is set to get even more exciting.  With expectations so high ahead of the race weekend, it was unfortunate that Shanghai turned out to be one of our more disappointing weekends. With France bringing in a new driver, albeit an ex-F1 driver in the form of Franck Montagny, we knew we had a really good chance to take valuable points and move up to third in the Championship. For some reason, all our main rivals (France, South Africa, Germany and the Netherlands) didn&apos;t perform in qualifying. But unfortunately, having shown pace in practice, we didn&apos;t quite get it right either \u2013 qualifying 10th and 8th for the races respectively. This meant we were on the back foot throughout Sunday; despite defending well against the constant pressure from behind in both races, we didn&apos;t quite have the competitiveness to move up significantly. But at least our sister team, Portugal, had a fantastic weekend, taking two podium finishes. Felipe Albuquerque is definitely one to watch and has played a big part in improving the teams&apos; competitiveness since he joined the Portuguese squad in Durban, where he became one of a few drivers to achieve a podium in his first ever A1GP race weekend. It was also great to see USA become the 10th nation to win an A1GP race this season, but more importantly that the Championship will go all the way to the season finale, something that didn&apos;t happen in the previous two seasons when one nation dominated. Great Britain has always been strong at Brands Hatch, and we haven&apos;t given up on our main focus of reclaiming bronze in the Championship \u2013 the position we have held for the previous two seasons of A1GP. I&apos;m confident that we&apos;ll be up there and give the home crowd something to cheer about.

The authorities announced late on Wednesday that they were cutting stamp tax on share transactions from 0.3% to 0.1% - reversing an increase made 11 months ago, when the government was trying to cool surging prices. &quot;In recent weeks, expectations have been mounting on the government to take decisive steps to prop up the domestic markets,&quot; Jing Ulrich, chairwoman of China equities for JP Morgan Chase, said in a note for clients. &quot;The lowering of stamp duty ... is among the most aggressive steps the government could have taken to improve sentiment.&quot; While the reduction will have only a small effect on all but the largest traders, it sent a strong signal to the market. Officials know that confidence in the Chinese stock market and the savings of large numbers of small investors are both at risk. Today&apos;s rise will be particularly reassuring for the authorities after share trading restrictions announced at the weekend gave only the slightest boost to the Shanghai index on Monday, raising it by 0.7%. An almost 10% rise in PetroChina shares, which account for about one-fifth of the benchmark&apos;s total value, helped account for today&apos;s increase. Officials announced earlier this week that they would compensate oil companies for losses due to price caps.

Why does China ban free elections while Indians vote in officials with criminal records? These are just some of the questions the Harvard Business School professor Tarun Khanna takes up in his book, Billions of Entrepreneurs: How China and India Are Reshaping Their Futures and Yours. Listen to Mark Tran&apos;s interview with Tarun Khanna The soft-spoken Khanna, who talked to hundreds of business people and policymakers for his book, has offered an optimistic take on the rise of India and China with their combined population of 2.4 billion. Not for him the scaremongering found among commentators such as the CNN anchor Lou Dobbs, who warns about the loss of American jobs to China, as well as defective Chinese products. In a sense the growing economic might of these two Asian giants - although some would say with feet of clay - is a case of back to the future. In the 1800s as much as 50% of world GDP was accounted for by China and India. Khanna is pragmatic about both countries: they have achieved economic success through very different methods and he lays out the strengths and weaknesses of the two &quot;petri dishes&quot; of economic development. As befitting a Harvard business professor, Khanna is a market liberal. But he acknowledges the effectiveness of China&apos;s top-down approach, a capitalism (of sorts) imposed from above that has lifted millions out of poverty, while creating new cities that rival New York and London. Yet he takes note of the downside; the lack of clear property rights and democratic freedoms that could hinder further economic progress. India&apos;s economic model is a messier affair. In a sometimes raucous democracy, where the voters regularly vote in MPs with criminal records, the task of central government, more often than not, is to get out of the way and let the private sector drive growth and create jobs. India can&apos;t build gleaming cities overnight because the government is too weak to bulldoze slums to make room for skyscrapers. China&apos;s approach to economic development - centred on manufacturing and big infrastructure projects, from dams to rail - and to foreign policy typifies &quot;hard power&quot;. India, with its software industry and Bollywood films, represents &quot;soft power&quot;. Khanna coins the term &quot;mutualism&quot; to describe the synthesis of these two economic approaches that will benefit not just China and India but the rest of the world. He cites the case of GE Healthcare, the health arm of the US corporate giant General Electric. GE was unique because it succeeded both in China and India and its operations are more than a sum of its parts.  GE Healthcare took the best from both countries to develop its medical equipment and has opened research and development centres in Shanghai and Bangalore. Since writing the book, Khanna says he has discovered hundreds more examples of cross-fertilisation. &quot;The ability to set up parallel groups of highly skilled engineering talent in both countries is invaluable,&quot; a GE executive told Khanna. &quot;It raises the efficiency of product development and fits in with a competitive culture within GE.&quot; Not all commentators buy this &quot;rosy scenario&quot;. In his book, Rivals: How the Power Struggle Between China, India and Japan Will Shape Our Next Decade, Bill Emmott, the former editor-in-chief of the Economist, offers a bleaker vision of the rise of Asia.  &quot;An array of disputes, historical bitternesses and regional flashpoints weigh down on all three countries. Conflict is not inevitable but nor is it inconceivable. If it were to occur - over Taiwan, say, or the Korean peninsula or Tibet or Pakistan - it would not simply be an intra-Asian affair. The outside world would be drawn in.&quot; Khanna acknowledges the existence of such security concerns, but thinks it bad social science to extrapolate from the past 40 years of tension between India and China. &quot;It is equally plausible to see the rise of economic development between two friendly countries,&quot; says Khanna, a self-avowed optimist who thinks increased human contact between India and China can only be positive. &quot;There is nothing to suggest hostility between India and China beyond the occasional sabre-rattling over border disputes.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "India", "China", "Economics", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-25T07:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/apr/26/worklifebalance.workandcareers", "sentences": ["It&apos;s about building a system to replace yourself, outsourcing life and using virtual assistants - people in Bangalore or Shanghai who will do a range of laborious tasks for you, from scheduling meetings or managing recruitment to proofreading or market research."], "title": "Timothy Ferriss on how to find happiness by outsourcing yourself", "article": "So, what do you do?&quot; The most commonplace question is hard for me to answer these days, and luckily so. Assuming you can find me (hard to do), and depending on when you ask me (I&apos;d prefer you didn&apos;t), I could be racing motorcycles in Europe, scuba diving off a private island in Panama, resting under a palm tree between kickboxing sessions in Thailand, or dancing tango in Buenos Aires. The beauty is, I&apos;m not a multimillionaire, nor do I particularly care to be. I never enjoyed answering this small-talk question because it reflects an epidemic I was long part of: job descriptions as self-descriptions. If someone asks me now and is anything but absolutely sincere, I explain my lifestyle of mysterious means simply.  &quot;I&apos;m a drug dealer.&quot; That&apos;s pretty much the end of the a conversation. It&apos;s only half true, besides. The whole truth would take too long. How can I possibly explain that what I do with my time and what I do for money are completely different things? That I work less than four hours a week and make more per month than I used to make in a year? Here, I&apos;m going to tell you the real story. It involves a quiet subculture of people called the &quot;New Rich&quot; - those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of time and mobility. This is an art and a science and my journey from grossly overworked and severely underpaid office worker to member of the New Rich is simple to duplicate.  Life doesn&apos;t have to be so hard. Most people, my former self included, spend too much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to nine-to-five drudgery in exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation. The truth, at least the truth I live, is quite different. You can separate income from time and create your ideal lifestyle in the process. There is a way to get the rewards for a life of hard work without waiting until the end. It begins with a simple distinction most people miss - one I missed for 25 years. People don&apos;t want to be millionaires - they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy. Ski chalets, butlers, and exotic travel often enter the picture. Perhaps rubbing cocoa butter on your belly in a hammock while you listen to waves rhythmically lapping against the deck of your thatched-roof bungalow? Sounds nice. A million in the bank isn&apos;t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly allows. The question is then how to achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without first having \u00a31m? In the last five years, I have separated income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the process, travelling the world and enjoying the best this planet has to offer. How did I go from 14-hour days and \u00a325,000 a year to 4-hour weeks and \u00a325,000 a month? Strangely enough, it started in a class of soon-to-be investment bankers. In 2002, I was asked by my former professor of high-tech entrepreneurship at Princeton University to come back and speak to the same class about my business adventures in the real world. I was stuck. There were already deca-millionaires speaking to the same class, and even though I had built a profitable sports supplement company, I marched to a distinctly different drummer.  Over the ensuing days, however, I realised that everyone seemed to be discussing how to build large and successful companies, sell out and live the good life. Fair enough. The question no one really seemed to be asking or answering was: why do it all in the first place? What is the pot of gold that justifies spending the best years of your life hoping for happiness in the last? The lectures I ultimately developed, titled Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit, began with a simple premise: test the most basic assumptions of the work-life equation. \u00b7  How do your decisions change if retirement isn&apos;t an option? \u00b7  What if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your deferred-life plan reward before working 40 years for it? \u00b7  Is it really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire? Little did I know where questions like these would take me. The conclusion? The commonsense rules of the &quot;real world&quot; are a fragile collection of socially reinforced illusions. The vast majority of people will never find a job that can be an unending source of fulfilment, so that is not my goal; my goal is to free up time and automate my income. It is not just about working smarter. It&apos;s about building a system to replace yourself, outsourcing life and using virtual assistants - people in Bangalore or Shanghai who will do a range of laborious tasks for you, from scheduling meetings or managing recruitment to proofreading or market research. Getting a remote personal assistant is a huge departure point and marks the moment that you learn how to give orders and be commander instead of the commanded. It is small-scale training wheels for the most critical of skills: remote management and communication.  It is time to learn how to be the boss. It isn&apos;t time-consuming. It&apos;s low-cost and it&apos;s low-risk. Whether or not you &quot;need&quot; someone at this point is immaterial. It is an exercise. It is also a litmus test for entrepreneurship: can you manage other people? Given the proper instruction and practice, I believe so. Most entrepreneurs fail because they jump into the deep end of the pool without learning to swim first. Using a virtual assistant as a simple exercise with no downside, the basics of management can be covered in a two- to four-week test costing no more than \u00a3200. This is an investment, not an expense, and the return on that investment is astounding. It will be repaid within a fortnight, after which it is pure timesaving profit. Even if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur, this is an invaluable exercise. Preparing someone to replace you (even if it never happens) will produce an ultra-refined set of rules that will cut remaining fat and redundancy from your schedule. Lingering unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them. But what about the cost? This is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I can do it better than an assistant, why should I pay them at all? Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.  It is absolutely necessary that you realise that you can always do something more cheaply yourself. This doesn&apos;t mean you want to spend your time doing it. If you spend your time, worth \u00a310-\u00a320 per hour, doing something that someone will do for \u00a35 per hour, it&apos;s simply a poor use of resources. It is important to take baby steps toward paying others to do work for you. Few do it, which is another reason so few people have their ideal lifestyles. Time is time, and if you&apos;re spending time on chores and errands that could be spent better elsewhere, a virtual assistant will improve life, and the management learning curve is similar. Much of what I recommend will seem impossible and even offensive to basic common sense - I expect that, but think of it as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you try it, you&apos;ll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won&apos;t ever go back.  \u00b7  Timothy Ferriss is the author of the New York Times bestseller The 4-hour Work Week, published by Vermillion.

Mediterranean round trip Most cargo passengers love being at sea but don&apos;t like the crowds and organised fun of cruising; it&apos;s a simple, laid-back life of reading, chatting to the crew and dolphin-spotting, with good deals for single travellers. Cargo cabins usually combine plenty of drawer and wardrobe space with fridge, television, video/DVD/CD players and internal phones. Grimaldi Lines of Italy operates a 27-day voyage from Southampton, visiting Salermo in Italy, Piraeus, Izmir, Limassol, Alexandria and Israel before returning to Portbury near Bristol, with stops every few days, and around 12 hours in each port (this may be overnight).

Stopovers include Vasteras near Lake Malaren, from where you can get a train into Stockholm for the day, or even a couple of nights, rejoining the boat up the coast at its next port of call, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, which boasts a number of museums. Other stop-off points include Skagen, the Kiel Canal and Oxel\u00f6sund, a steel port on the Baltic Sea.

But although Rick Stein&apos;s freshly refurbished restaurant is across the water, Padstow could be a million miles away from what has been created here. The St Moritz overlook s Daymer Bay, the site of an elegant 1930s predecessor of the same name, now gone. In those heady, pre-charterflight days, families would have taken their main holiday there, returningsummer after summer to sample grand buffets prepared by Swiss-trainedchefs and enjoying a very British seaside experience. Somehow, in the intervening decades, we&apos;ve lost that in all but a few pockets of inspired hoteliership. As an island with strong design credentials, you&apos;d think we would be at the forefront of the large, classy, coastal hotel scene. A couple spring to mind: St Bride&apos;s in Saundersfoot - a beacon of hope on the shores of south-west Wales - and the Tresanton, which spearheaded the lengthening of the Cornish season by keeping its doors ajar all year round. But finding anything else with more than a dozen rooms is a struggle. St Moritz could be a much needed new member of this exclusive club - the half-decent seaside holiday hotel.  &quot;Looks all white,&quot; I say to Tim as he negotiates still-barren flowerbeds to park at the dazzling curved frontage which swirls into a rooftop terrace.

Apartments, privately owned but rentable, are on the upper floors. Tim&apos;s compact double overlooks the car park (which won&apos;t worry him, since the telly will be on whenever he&apos;s in residence). The suite is where all the action takes place. Bedroom (a haven of pale blue and white), and open-plan sitting room (with dining area and great kitchen) have a vista across the Camel estuary to Steps Point and the Atlantic. The windowless bathroom lacks a wow factor and there are irritations - thiefproof hangers, no full-length mirror or slippers - but even this early in the season it&apos;s warm enough to sit out on the private balcony with the papers and tea. By July, an outdoor pool will punctuate the outlook, and it will feel like an apartment abroad. We sip cocktails in the bar above the lobby, feeling for all the world like we&apos;re on a cruise ship. In the restaurant, behind a glass screen, music struggles against the onslaught of air con, but our food is beautifully presented and full of flavour. &quot;Him serving up there is fantastic,&quot; says Tim, gesturing at the head chef in the open kitchen, though we wish the waitresses would pick their feet up and stop squirting pink cleaning fluid all around us.

Portofino in North Wales This extraordinary Italianate village, famously the setting for the surreal 6os TV drama The Prisoner, was begun in 1925 by the architect Sir Clough Williams-Ellis. It took him half a century, but today the domes and spires that spill down to Cardigan Bay do so with just the Mediterranean charm he was seeking. Far from being a village, however, Portmeirion has always been a holiday complex. The Hotel Portmeirion, with 42 rooms and suites, boasts an art deco dining room and sea-shore location, while Castell Deudraeth, a converted Victorian folly 10 minutes walk away, has a further 11 rooms. Then there are 17 self-catering cottages, built by Williams-Ellis. If strolling in the sub-tropical gardens doesn&apos;t convince you that you&apos;re on the Med, you can always don a replica Patrick McGoohan jacket (\u00a399 from the Prisoner Shop), pose in the village square and kid yourself you&apos;re on TV.

This despite the fact that they had been battered off the park and Kalou had beetled off to the corner flag as if his team were leading, rather than trailing 1-0. Far better, surely, to have had a good old belly-laugh. The duo should have stood there doubled over as they did impromptu John Arne Riise impersonations.

The whole joy of an undeserved result is pissing oneself laughing at those who deserved to win. That&apos;s elementary mind games. The other story of the week was Ian Wright. It seems I may have been unfair when I described Wrighty as being less an analyst and more a shouty dad watching Sprowston under-14s who was in the habit of withdrawing his punditry in a huff whenever his son was substituted at half time. Not a bit of it. Ian was, as he explained to the comedian&apos;s friend Jonathan Ross, actually attempting to take punditry into the new millennium. To rid it of its stuffy shirt-and-tie image and inject it with a bit of the old pizazz. He continued the argument with an interview, in the paper to which he contributes a column, during which he said: &apos;They [the BBC] put out sinister ads about the licence fee then serve up a load of rubbish and an unbelievable amount of repeats.&apos; Ian Wright, in contrast, is hosting a series of Gladiators on Sky One.

Imagine how hard it would be to stay awake in front of Dead Snooker or, even, Ailing Snooker. As it is, match-ups such as Graeme Dott versus Joe Perry have seriously tested the stay-awake snooker fan. Those who did hang on received their reward when Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan made his entrance in a match against Liu Chuang, who could not have looked more like a Chinese Stephen Hendry if he had been cloned. The underjaw is there, as is the acne, with every spot identically placed. It&apos;s uncanny. And consider this. Chuang is 17 and Hendry won the Asian Open in 1989 and 1990. The window of opportunity was there for a Chinese Barry Hearn to finagle a sample from the Scot, bomb back to Shanghai and start manufacturing oriental Hendrys.  Someone, almost certainly Kevin Keegan, once said a team of Bertie Vogts would be unbeatable.

You don&apos;t have to be in the US to take part - or even be registered with the university. &quot;It makes sense in the era of globalisation and in a time of global information to make the knowledge we create more available and more broad-ranging,&quot; says Diana Kleiner, director of the Open Yale courses and a professor of history of art and classics at Yale (open.yale.edu/courses). &quot;It seems to us that a university like ours has a responsibility to continue to democratise knowledge.&quot; Taking part Seven departments - astronomy, English, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology and religious studies - offer introductory courses via the website that anyone anywhere in the world can take part in via the internet. Students looking to build on their studies, parents seeking to expand their knowledge, or retirees wishing to keep mentally active can all log on to the seminars that bring them face to face with Yale&apos;s top lecturers. Along with the video lessons, students are offered audio materials and supplementary transcripts to assist their learning. The structure, reading notes and homework assignments given out on the courses are just the same as any student on campus would be given, making the lessons as authentic as possible. Kleiner says that when the idea was brought to the table, the organisers made it clear that all the professors who took part would be on camera. No remote cameras are used and the filming is all done manually to capture fully the atmosphere of the lectures. And there are no concessions made for the camera, nor are corners cut: the aim is to convey the individual style of each professor. &quot;This is a real opportunity for people across the world to come in and experience the feel of our classrooms,&quot; says Kleiner. &quot;Part of the engagement of this project was keeping the individual teaching methods of each faculty. So with the physics lectures, for example, we follow the professor as he roams around the classroom and get right in there with the students.&quot; Students also benefit from that commitment to individual style, adds Kleiner. &quot;Students are able to create their own activity by downloading and remixing the course materials to suit them.&quot; The most striking feature of the Open Yale courses is how easily they fit into hectic schedules. After a busy week at work and a rather lively Friday night out, a weekend of lectures may not sound like the most appealing idea. However, on Saturday morning as I sit in my living room in Highbury, having just crawled out of bed, I find myself logging on to the site. A few clicks away and it is surprising how effortless it feels to take in a few lessons on modern poetry at my own leisure and feel a bit more cultured on a lazy Saturday that might otherwise have been unproductive. Through the courses, Yale has established partnerships with universities around the world in countries including Mexico and China. The Yale courses do not count as credits towards a degree with the university, but the partnerships mean that the other institutions can build Yale-standard education into their own provision. Raul Morilo, a high-school physics teacher from Ecuador, often uses the courses as part of his class. &quot;The lecturers are very clear,&quot; he says. &quot;And some of them have a great sense of humour. It really feels like you are there in the classroom. They&apos;re so easy to follow because they&apos;re constantly giving you examples to work with.&quot; He adds that Open Yale allows many of his students to experience what the subject might be like at university level. &quot;Also, we do not have much money or equipment here to teach more than the basics,&quot; he says. Overwhelming response But while virtual learning may seem like the next easy and natural step for global, accessible education, the programme has had to overcome a few obstacles. &quot;The internet materials that we use don&apos;t always belong to us,&quot; says Kleiner. &quot;So it&apos;s raised questions on how we might deliver them. A lot of the modern poetry for instance is already on the internet but due to property rights we have to be careful what we can put up on our sites.&quot; It may be some time before this type of education becomes the norm, but Kleiner and the other professors have been overwhelmed by the response. &quot;I find it enormously moving reading feedback from people who haven&apos;t had the chance to get a high-school diploma who have taken up our courses,&quot; she says. Back in Shanghai, Pan says: &quot;It&apos;s exciting to learn more and see differences in education systems. In China, the teacher takes the major role and you listen to him. From the look of these courses, students in the US are encouraged to take more notes. I like the discussion part of the lectures very much.&quot; &quot;It is rewarding to hear that people think that taking our courses are an asset to their CVs or knowledge,&quot; says Kleiner. &quot;We are a university that encourages leadership, so we need to be a leader in education.&quot;", "tags": ["Further education", "Online learning", "Education", "Higher education", "UK news", "Technology", "Internet"], "publicationDate": "2008-04-29T12:52:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/apr/30/photography", "sentences": ["Her camera moves beyond Burtynsky&apos;s frame to show the wider context: the photographer setting up a complicated crane shot; a nervous company rep referring to her script; an old woman who resisted ruthless Shanghai developers."], "title": "Clare Birchall talks to film-maker Jennifer Baichwal about the photographer Edward Burtynsky", "article": "Blink and you won&apos;t miss a thing. The opening shot of Manufactured Landscapes, Jennifer Baichwal&apos;s film about Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky, lasts for a whole eight minutes. The camera tracks along an endless Chinese factory floor, like a supervisor slowly pacing the assembly line. Not only does the shot communicate the scale of Burtynsky&apos;s work - which features huge factories, cavernous quarries, giant carcasses of defunct ships, and gleaming mountains of waste - it also shows what movies can do that photography can&apos;t. Films about photographers often fail to acknowledge the difference between the still and the moving image. Baichwal is aware of the problem. &quot;Despite the fact that film and photography are both visual,&quot; she says, &quot;it is difficult to intelligently represent one in the other. If we were going to make a film about Ed that just said, &apos;Here is this person and these are his photographs,&apos; I would consider that a failure.&quot; Baichwal&apos;s solution was to travel with Burtynsky, to China mainly, as he photographed the effects of industrialisation on the landscape. Her camera moves beyond Burtynsky&apos;s frame to show the wider context: the photographer setting up a complicated crane shot; a nervous company rep referring to her script; an old woman who resisted ruthless Shanghai developers. The film&apos;s main tactic is to home in on the human figures dwarfed by the vast environments caught in Burtynsky&apos;s lens. In one of his photographs, a woman making circuit-breakers is an anonymous worker in a giant assembly line; in the film, she is seen in close-up and is asked her name, thus conveying something of the human stories within the photographs. Not that anyone is saying much. It&apos;s not easy, Baichwal says, to get Chinese workers to talk. However, their terseness can be illuminating. One old man on a fag break leans over the Three Gorges dam, where he works. He is asked if he is proud to be working on an engineering project of this size. &quot;We are just working for our boss,&quot; he says. Staying true to Burtynsky&apos;s photographs meant maintaining their ambiguity. &quot;They&apos;re aesthetically seductive,&quot; says Baichwal. &quot;They can hang in the hall of a corporate office - and on the wall of the environmentalist fighting that corporation. Most people would find that ambiguity intolerable, but I think that&apos;s where the power comes from.&quot; Although he is referred to as an environmentalist photographer, Burtynsky says he is pleased that Manufactured Landscapes &quot;guides you, but doesn&apos;t give opinions&quot;. It would have been easy for Baichwal to call on a bevy of experts to talk about the unsustainability of hyper-consumption, and to rustle up some art critics to discuss Burtynksy&apos;s craft. But Baichwal has no time for that; she wanted to make something that was more a work of art in its own right. &quot;The &apos;portrait of the artist&apos; film is riddled with cliches,&quot; she says. &quot;They all have a darkroom moment, a thoughtful walking moment, a taking-the-photograph moment.&quot; Consequently, she has made a film that transforms the cinema auditorium into the meditative space of an art gallery. There are no simple answers here. Because the film is so closely aligned with Burtynsky&apos;s vision, I suggest he could have made it himself, but he dismisses the idea, saying: &quot;Jennifer thinks in film.&quot; Still, he is responsible for one short section of footage: an extraordinary aerial shot of a knot of freeways that makes Spaghetti Junction look like a suburban roundabout. And he emphasises that he is still convinced of the power of photography, even in this YouTube era: &quot;It lodges itself in our consciousness in a very different way to film.&quot; He mentions the Vietnam war, how everyone remembers a picture such as Hu&apos;ynh C\u00f4ng \u00dat&apos;s The Killing Fields, of a naked girl screaming as she tries to escape a napalm attack.

With only 100 days to go before the Olympics begin in the city, the final preparations are underway. At the entrance, workmen heft paving slabs, eager to finish one of Beijing&apos;s last beautification projects. There&apos;s just one problem: Sun&apos;s house is in the way. Three years ago, this wasteland was a bustling village. But grassy slopes, lakes and walkways will soon erase all trace of his house. Hundreds of his neighbours have already made way for the new park. Last week officials threw out Wang Lianmin and tore down his home. Days later, Su Xiangyu caved in to the pressure and left. With even those diehards gone, Sun is the last man standing. The Olympic construction boom has displaced tens of thousands of Beijingers and destroyed numerous traditional neighbourhoods. Most residents gave up the fight long ago. But as a bulldozer rakes what remains of his neighbours&apos; homes, Sun continues to watch and wait for the first glimpse of an eviction party. &quot;They might demolish the house at any time. I feel very scared in my heart - scared and lonely,&quot; he says. &quot;If they come by force I will try my best to negotiate with them. If they don&apos;t negotiate with me, I have no other way. I can only pour petrol [around] and be burnt together with the people who have come for us. &quot;I can&apos;t let them do this - take my things so easily and cheaply.&quot; He speaks calmly, but has covered the building with dry branches and stored jerry cans of petrol in a sideroom. His parents in law and young son have been sent to the countryside for safety. Now only Sun, his wife Chen Zongxia, her cousin and his wife are left. The family were doing well before the demolition notice arrived. His mother in law was born here and the house has sheltered four generations, providing not just a home but a livelihood. Renting out the spare rooms earned enough to support the household of seven. But Yangshan is opposite the main Olympic park and the Chaoyang district government said the village had to go. It offered Sun&apos;s family 4,300 yuan (\u00a3310) a square metre in compensation, but he says housing nearby costs 12,000 yuan and even further out in the countryside it would be 8,000 yuan. &quot;Renting out our rooms meant I could stay at home to look after my parents and children. If we went to the countryside, I would have to try to find a job and there would be no one to care for them,&quot; said Chen. &quot;Our son&apos;s school is here and we would have to pay new fees for a school in the countryside - and it wouldn&apos;t be as good.&quot; Most of the village&apos;s 550 households moved away three years ago, but a handful of homeowners were determined to fight. They hoped that a legal claim for increased compensation might resolve the situation. But while the offer increased slightly, the forced evictions also began. &quot;One day in 2006, four families were forced out. Ambulances and fire trucks came and in all there were about 200 people,&quot; he recalled. &quot;The situation was very frightening. Some villagers tried to film what was happening but the police grabbed their cameras away.&quot; Then, last month, a notice arrived to warn the last households they had three days to leave. Their water was cut off at the start of April. The bulldozers arrived days later. &quot;Everything started shaking - it was like an earthquake. Parts of the ceiling fell in,&quot; Sun said, showing the hole where a lump of plaster broke off. &quot;I feel very anxious every day. I spend all my time waiting.&quot; North Star, the company developing Yangshan, told the Guardian it had strictly followed the government&apos;s policies. Its spokesman Mr Luo, who did not give his full name, added: &quot;We are very careful about this job and we accept supervision. There should not be problems if the residents accept the government&apos;s regulations. If there is a problem, it is usually because they asked more than the government&apos;s policies promised. Both sides can negotiate within the policies.&quot; Some Beijingers have welcomed resettlement, even if it meant exchanging homes in the centre for housing in the suburbs. Those who got adequate compensation could swap cramped, dilapidated conditions for clean, new flats with modern facilities. At a briefing on the issue earlier this year, Beijing officials said that compensation was set at market rates and that some people gained extra rights to welfare by being allowed to register as urban rather than rural residents for the first time. But in the same month, the grassroots organisation Citizens&apos; Rights and Livelihood Watch warned: &quot;Although the government made some efforts to compensate for the losses of these villagers, many incidents of deprivation and abuses occurred and villagers&apos; efforts to seek redress were suppressed. Reportedly, villagers were not compensated fairly and adequately.&quot; To add to their anger, those removed from Yangshan - and other areas - fear that Olympic projects are clearing the way for lucrative future schemes. Sun says that the developers plan to build on the south side of the new park, and that the first resettlement notice made no mention of the Games. &quot;When the Olympics were given to Beijing we were extremely happy,&quot; he said. &quot;But this area is neither a stadium nor an Olympic park. It&apos;s only a business project. &quot;When the local government acts like this under the name of the Olympics, my feelings are inexpressible.&quot; Staying put Michael Forbes The Scottish farmer and salmon fisherman refused to sell his 23-acre plot of land to Donald Trump, thwarting plans for Trump&apos;s multimillion pound golf course near Balmedie, north of Aberdeen.

When he asked her in old age why she hit him so much, she replied: &quot;It didn&apos;t do you any harm.&quot; Oh yes it did, says Sebag Montefiore in this lively and accomplished account of Stalin&apos;s &quot;gangsterish&quot;, pre-revolutionary youth, which draws on material from newly opened archives.

Ian Pindar Bright Earth: The Invention of Colour, by Philip Ball (Vintage, \u00a310.99) An odd beast, this: art history meets popular science, as if we are all models of consilience and have moved on from CP Snow&apos;s &quot;Two Cultures&quot; debate. Yet it is a rare reader, perhaps, who has read Vasari&apos;s Lives of the Artists and Newton&apos;s Opticks; who wants to study Titian&apos;s Bacchus and Ariadne and a diagram of the chemical structure of indigo. Still, the whole point of this impressive guide to the chemistry of art is that the distinction between artists and scientists was less clear-cut in the past (think Leonardo da Vinci), and that painters had to be practical chemists, grinding and mixing their own colours. In fact, Ball shows how art has always been determined by its materials, from the earliest cave painters using charcoal for black and ground bones or chalk for white, to the great colourist Matisse &quot;delighting in the cobalt, chromium and cadmium hues of 19th-century chemistry&quot;. All artists throughout history have been limited by the prevailing chemical technology of their era, and, as Ball points out, most of the colours readily available today are the by-products of industrial chemical processes. IP Wild: An Elemental Journey, by Jay Griffiths (Penguin, \u00a38.99) This angry book flaunts its passion for wildness and those who live there. Lost in a &quot;wasteland of the mind . . . a long and dark depression&quot;, Griffiths sets off on a journey to look for &quot;the will of the wild&quot;. Desperate to experience the elements and learn about unfettered landscapes, she listens to the peoples who know them best. It takes her seven years. Her overwrought style has won praise, but for me it veers between the gruelling and the grotesque. I prefer it when she tells it straight: a careful account of Inuit hunters&apos; intimate knowledge of ice; harsh tales of atrocities visited upon the West Papuans; an exquisite description of the tones of colour in the Australian sands, shifting through the day. Her relentless, repetitious assaults on Europeans, Christians and suburbanites become wearisome and set up a polarity as reductionist as any posed between the &quot;savage&quot; and the &quot;civilised&quot;. Her use of scattershot quotes across epochs and genres is maddening, but suits her case: that the wild oral world lives without boundary or tragedy in natural time until missionaries, miners and soldiers interrupt with measuring and massacre. Judith Rice This is Your Brain on Music: Understanding a Human Obsession, by Daniel Levitin (Atlantic Books, \u00a38.99) There cannot be many former record producers who work as neuroscientists, but Daniel Levitin, who spent a decade working with the famous and the &quot;no-names&quot; (often just as good) in California, now runs the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Recognition and Expertise at McGill University in Canada. He sets out to tell us about the science of music and to explain how it is perceived by the human brain. Asking simply &quot;What is music?&quot;, he starts with definitions of pitch and timbre and moves on to denser discussions of the way the &quot;exquisite orchestration of brain regions&quot; leads to musical pleasure. He explains how our brain imposes structure and order on a sequence of sounds and how cultural conditioning informs our musical experience; he runs us through the controversies over whether music is an evolutionary by-product of language or an essential human attribute. His generous assumption that we know nothing means he has a lot of detail to fit in, but he encourages us with manageable examples, anecdotes and interesting facts. And, unsurprisingly, we learn that to become a world-class expert in anything takes a lot of practice. JR Getting Rich First: Life in a Changing China, by Duncan Hewitt (Vintage, \u00a38.99) &quot;Some regions and some people may get rich first,&quot; said Deng Xiaoping, &quot;in order to help and bring along other places and other people, and to gradually achieve a common prosperity.&quot; Since then China&apos;s government has focused more on the first part of this historic decree than the second, Hewitt notes, and his engrossing study of social changes over the past 20 years shows the results: a country both far wealthier and far more unequal, with casualties including the rural poor, migrant workers, those forced to rely on a collapsing welfare state, and city-dwellers relocated to make way for new developments. The book is particularly good on today&apos;s urban teenagers, at once pampered beneficiaries and stressed-out victims of the one-child policy: westernised, independent, freer than previous generations as their values take over mainstream culture, but put under unprecedented pressure to succeed by social-climbing parents. A former BBC correspondent now based in Shanghai, Hewitt is adept at finding interviewees who talk candidly and illuminatingly, and individual stories that illustrate wider trends.

The big news for me is that my team, Tech3 Yamaha, have decided to take up the option to extend my contract with them after only two races. Immediately after qualifying in Portugal, where I put the bike on the second row, I was called into a meeting with the team and told the news - which I must say came as a complete surprise. We weren&apos;t due to discuss next season until September, so for them to sew up my future five months ahead of schedule is obviously a fantastic boost and shows that I am performing well and even exceeding their expectations of me. It goes without saying that I&apos;m delighted by the news that I&apos;m guaranteed to be on the MotoGP grid next season. Having said that, I then produced my first below-par performance in Estoril, where I finished seventh. It was the first track I&apos;ve raced on this season that I didn&apos;t really know, and I felt that hampered me as, in light rain, I simply braked too early heading into the first corner, which shunted me quite a long way back in the pack - it ruined my race. When you do that it&apos;s hard to come back to challenge at the front of the grid. I was particularly annoyed as it was the first time out for our new engine, and I felt I wasn&apos;t able to do it justice as I spent my race bunched in the middle of the field. Hopefully, this weekend will be different. As I&apos;ve said before, this is a top-class bike we&apos;ve got now, and we hope to prove that on race day. This is another track that I haven&apos;t raced on before - as are the next three after this - so I&apos;m going to have to learn, and learn quickly, so that I don&apos;t make any mistakes similar to that in Portugal. I&apos;ve been told there is an 80% chance of rain for Saturday and Sunday; that really tests your knowledge of the track, so I&apos;m preparing to step up my game. I&apos;ve been after a podium finish for a while now - where better than China? If it does rain it will be another lesson I have to learn this year, as I&apos;m yet to race in the wet this season. Colin Edwards, my team-mate, has been really helpful when it comes to adapting to MotoGP, and at the very early stages of my time with Tech3 he was invaluable. He has made the step up from World Superbikes to the top level, and we spent a lot of time talking about the differences I would encounter. He gave me lots of little tips, from how to handle the tyres and how the carbon brakes are so much more responsive, to how the rigidity of the bike affects your riding style. I can&apos;t thank him enough for that, but it&apos;s noticeable that now I&apos;ve started doing quite well and competing with him that the tactical talk has dried up! We&apos;ve just been getting on well as friends, and it&apos;s vital that we do get on. Teams can be ripped apart if the riders fall out, as their mechanics then often won&apos;t talk to each other and it creates a horrible atmosphere - not one conducive to success, at any rate. As for the other riders, it can be difficult to build up relationships with a lot of them. You are together for a lot of the time, but it&apos;s always so competitive that everyone tends to remain with their team. In Portugal, I had a disagreement with Nicky Hayden - I got in his way while he was on a qualifying lap - and I went to apologise afterwards. He wouldn&apos;t accept it at first, but came to see me later on and we shook hands and put it behind us. It&apos;s noticeable that as I&apos;ve been doing well people have had less to say to me! It&apos;s not an unsociable atmosphere - and everyone I have spoken to has been perfectly nice - but it is undeniably competitive. One guy I have spent a bit of time with is Valentino Rossi. We are part of the same team, so we have done some promotional stuff together and we&apos;ve chatted at airports and the like. He&apos;s a great guy, and reading some of the nice things he&apos;s said about me has been brilliant. We&apos;ve spent a bit of time talking about music, actually. Although he doesn&apos;t play an instrument he really likes his tunes, and he wishes he could play something. He seemed a bit jealous about my piano playing - it means that I&apos;ve got one thing over on him so far. Let&apos;s hope the next time I get one over on him it&apos;s on the track!

But this is Georgetown, capital of Guyana. With a population of just over 200,000 in a country of 750,000, it has a small-town, everyone-knows-everyone feel.  The party is being held at Buddy&apos;s International Hotel, built for last year&apos;s cricket World Cup. There&apos;s nothing exclusive about the event and half the city seems to have turned up. Most, including the president, are hanging around the pool, although a small payment of G$1,000 (\u00a32.50) gets you entry into an exceedingly hot room resembling a school disco hall. Unfortunately, the president doesn&apos;t treat us to any moves, and neither is he my travel-networking contact.  I&apos;ve come to the party with Anna, a 29-year-old member of couchsurfing.com, plus a group of her friends, predominantly expats with a handful of Guyanese. Originally from the UK, she&apos;s been in the country for a year and a half on a work placement in the government&apos;s department of finance, where she is trying to encourage businesses to set up in the country, reverse the brain drain, and &quot;basically let people know that Guyana exists&quot;. Guyana is a country that almost all backpackers leave off their continent-spanning itinerary, a place that induces blank looks even from most South Americans. Geographically, it is firmly rooted on the South American mainland, east of Venezuela and north of Brazil, yet it is also part of the Caribbean common market and has a colonial British heritage. Combine all that with a mixed African, Indian and Amerindian population, and it&apos;s not an easy place to get your head round. It&apos;s even more of a shock after coming through Venezuela and Brazil. One bumpy bus through the rainforested interior and, suddenly, everyone speaks English and drives on the left. I even spot a billboard advertising Marmite. Georgetown is a city unlike any other I&apos;ve visited on this trip. Downtown comprises of whitewashed, detached wooden houses on wide roads, many with grass verges instead of pavements and big greens dividing the two lanes of traffic.  I first meet Anna at what she describes as &quot;the best roti shop in town&quot;. Shanta&apos;s (225 Camp Street) is a simple deli counter set-up, but the food is, indeed, delicious. Over her recommendation of local staple of roti and boulanger choka (an aubergine dip), she informs me that to experience Georgetown properly I need a night of &quot;wining and liming&quot;. I have no idea what this means, but arrange to meet again on Friday to find out.     Vicky with couchsurfer Vidya    Anna is one of just a handful of travel-networkers registered in Guyana. She is listed as being available &quot;for a coffee or a drink&quot; with passing travellers, although she mainly just gets people tentatively expressing an interest in the place. It&apos;s an experience shared by my first couchsurfing contact in the country, 37-year-old Vidya, although he also gets the occasional request for a postcard of his mysterious and exotic homeland. Vidya saved me from a tragic fate of spending my first night in Georgetown cooped up in a hotel room eating a takeaway and watching grainy television pirated from the US. &quot;There&apos;s a Jamaican film screening and discussion happening at a jazz bar downtown. Fancy it?&quot; he says when I call him. Within half an hour, I am sipping rum in the Sidewalk Cafe, an open-fronted bar decorated with pot plants and cane furniture.  Vidya arrives after me, so we have just a short, hushed conversation over the film and the chorus of frogs and crickets outside. &quot;There aren&apos;t any cinemas here,&quot; he whispers, &quot;so a small group of us started organising these screenings among ourselves.&quot;  The next morning, I have a proper chance to get to know Vidya over coffee in one of the two branches of the city&apos;s popular Oasis Cafe, a cosy joint for the cappuccino-and-Wi-Fi set. When not working in the IT department of an NGO, he&apos;s volunteering for an organisation fighting domestic violence, making short films, running a local book club and curating the city&apos;s gay and lesbian film festival, now in its fourth year.  Guyanese, born and bred, with fifth-generation Indian heritage, he makes me feel at home with mannerisms that seem decidedly British, such as saying &quot;crikey&quot; and doing the awkward &quot;shall we shake hands, kiss or hug?&quot; goodbye. He&apos;s a busy man, but promises to make time to meet up again and gives me some valuable tips. Thanks to him I discover the little-known city-based bird tour with Guyana Feathered Friends (\u00a315, gff_birdingtours@yahoo.com), and the launch party for Carifesta, a celebration of Caribbean arts that is returning to Guyana this August for the first time since its 1972 inauguration (carifesta.net).  As Vidya can&apos;t make it to the Carifesta, I decide to invite another contact I made in the city, Kathryn from wayn.com. The site is currently aimed more at sharing tips and online chat than meeting in person, but it does have a function for showing you who&apos;s been looking at your profile. When a Georgetown resident popped up in my list, it seemed like fate and we arranged to meet.  A 47-year-old data-entry clerk, she is shy and softly spoken, but there&apos;s little opportunity for conversation anyway, with steel bands and Trinidadian limbo dancers on the stage, and we still manage to enjoy our brief time in each other&apos;s company.  But what of wining and liming? Reuniting with Anna on Friday, I discover &quot;wining&quot; is slang for raunchy dancing to Trinidadian soca music, while &quot;liming&quot; is simply drinking rum and chatting. The combination makes for a very entertaining evening, starting in Roopa&apos;s Rum Shop, a karaoke bar in a villa on Station Street, and ending up at Palm Court, an open-air club on Main Street.  Guyana has been the destination I have been most excited about getting to know, and, so far, I haven&apos;t been disappointed. Here&apos;s hoping the second week in the country lives up to the first.  Vidya&apos;s tips The arts scene of Georgetown Pictures and politiciansThe art gallery at Castellani House (Vlissengen Road), an ex-prime minister&apos;s home, has local works. Coffee, cakes and booksThe two Oasis Cafes (Carmichael Street and South Street) have great ambience, coffee and pastries. You can join in the book club&apos;s discussions on Saturdays, even if you haven&apos;t read the book. Screen saverSidewalk Cafe (ariantzesidewalk.com) shows a Tuesday night film, followed by discussions. There are monthly Caribbean jazz performances too. Business travel networkers Federico Barbieri, a Nokia retail director currently based in Shanghai, is one of a growing number of business travellers using social networking sites to escape the boredom of another lonely evening in a hotel room. His site of choice is dopplr.com, which allows you to share your travel plans with your circle of contacts. &quot;Before that, I used to always call all the contacts I know in a city but it was like a job on the top of the one I was already struggling with. Also, that didn&apos;t help me know who was in town from other parts of the world - people who may be more willing to go out.&quot; Similarly popular is tripit.com, which goes one step further and will automatically compile an online schedule based on your confirmation emails (hotels, flights, trains etc), so your friends can know exactly where you are going to be and when. vicky.baker@guardian.co.uk", "tags": ["Guyana holidays", "Travel", "Social networking", "Travelling solo"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-03T16:11:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/04/digitalmedia.mediabusiness", "sentences": ["Forget expanding Dubai, forget sprawling Las Vegas, forget the mushrooming skyscrapers of Shanghai."], "title": "Creator Philip Rosedale tells David Smith that Second Life can only grow", "article": "Forget expanding Dubai, forget sprawling Las Vegas, forget the mushrooming skyscrapers of Shanghai. There&apos;s a city state which, at just five years old, has enjoyed such turbocharged growth that its square mileage already dwarfs New York. Not bad for a place that doesn&apos;t exist. Second Life is a virtual world that lives only on the worldwide web. Sitting at their real-life PCs, its users pilot a digital character, or avatar, around a 3D simulation of the real world. It even has its own economy in which people design virtual items such as clothes, jewellery or furniture, or buy and develop land, then sell to other users in Linden dollars, which can be converted to real money. There are around 55,000 people making money from Second Life, a few of them millionaires, but there are con artists and fraudsters too. This Matrix-like world was the childhood dream of Philip Rosedale, the 39-year-old founder of Linden Lab, the San Francisco-based company which plays god by running it all. His not inconsiderable ambitions including redefining the entire web and helping to save the planet by reducing the need for business air travel. When he&apos;s asked how big Second Life is now, Rosedale doesn&apos;t miss a beat: &apos;Four hundred and sixty-two square miles. The land mass, which is growing at 5 per cent a month, is so big now that if you had a helicopter and flew around the edge of the island, so to speak, it would be expanding too fast to really figure out what was going on.&apos; As websites go, this requires a gigantic electronic brain: thousands of servers crunching a staggering 100,000 terabytes (100 million gigabytes) of user-generated content. &apos;Each server [covers] 16 [virtual] acres, about the size of a city block, and they sit next to each other and connect like puzzle pieces,&apos; says the personable Rosedale, reclining on a sofa at the Soho Hotel during a recent visit to London. &apos;So when you&apos;re walking around in Second Life you can&apos;t see the servers start and stop. There are 18,000 of those machines: some private islands, some big connected areas.&apos; Companies such as BMW, Coca-Cola, Ikea, Sony, Peugeot and Reebok have opened offices and Sweden and the Maldives set up virtual embassies. Reuters has its own &apos;in-world&apos; correspondent, while Sky News bought an island where presenter Adam Boulton interviewed David Miliband. There are an estimated 50 live music gigs a night, some by well-known artists. Schools and universities have signed up, the Globe Theatre has been reconstructed and last November the British Legion built a virtual Cenotaph. But Second Life&apos;s spectacular growth has tailed off over the past year. Critics have been quick to challenge its user figures, noting that while more than 12 million Second Life accounts have been created, the vast majority are no longer active. Rosedale doesn&apos;t pretend otherwise: &apos;It&apos;s true most of the people who sign up don&apos;t come back, but the people who stay are still growing steadily, which is driving the usage up. The amount of use per person that happens is unbelievable. There was a time in 1996 when everybody said: &quot;This internet thing is a total bust, it&apos;s a fad, it&apos;s full of porn ... &quot; But the internet kept growing at 10 per cent a month.&apos; A million hours a day are spent in Second Life, with America, Germany and Britain the heaviest users. &apos;The big thing that&apos;s going to happen really soon is that people are going to start have business meetings in there, which means a big impact on travel. When you want to interview me, why do you want me to fly to London? It&apos;s 11 hours.&apos; Eventually, he contends, Second Life will change the way we search, network or do anything else online. &apos;It will become the web. I believe that what we are working on right now will become a more common way of using the internet to retrieve information, or interact or transact. The reason for that is it has no language dependencies; you don&apos;t have to click hyperlinks. It always has other people there, which is just inherently more appealing to us - no matter who&apos;s around, there&apos;s always someone around you can question.&apos; In the meantime, Second Life&apos;s version of the US Presidential campaign may be entertaining enough, with plenty of bad behaviour, known as &apos;griefing&apos;. During a recent rally of Barack Obama supporters, virtual gunmen appeared and opened fire. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Obama backers escaped by teleporting to the CNN hub, a public space, to continue their rally. But it was only a brief respite - before long, a picture of Obama next to one of Osama bin Laden was flying all over the screen.", "tags": ["Digital media", "Media business", "Media", "Second Life", "Internet", "Virtual worlds", "MMORPG"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-04T00:01:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/04/motogp.motorsports", "sentences": ["Valentino Rossi ended his longest spell without a victory by winning the Chinese GP in Shanghai."], "title": "Rossi ends winless run in Shanghai", "article": "Valentino Rossi ended his longest spell without a victory by winning the Chinese GP in Shanghai.

Zou will be 27 later this month, stands just under 5ft 5in, and looks boyish enough to be a teenager, but wrinkles form beside his eyes when he smiles. The speck of a scar by his left eye is not from boxing but from a girl who once bullied him in school. He has sharp cheekbones, a thick brush of black hair, and a long, aquiline nose. His fighting weight is 48kg, and before each competition he spends most of a month famished. He gets grumpy and irritable, and then apologises. For distraction, he gnaws on watermelon slices and spits out the pulp. Or he pulls up pictures of lamb noodles and posts them on his blog. His team-mates were still outside, window-shopping, but Zou took a seat at an empty table. He laid out a Chinese newspaper and scanned the headlines, with little interest. The bridge of his nose was puffy and blue from his last bout, a few hours earlier. He was still in his red-and-white team warm-up suit with &apos;China&apos; embroidered in gold thread across the back. On his left breast he wore a small brass pin of Mao Zedong&apos;s head - a gift from his coach, Zhang Chuanliang, whom he calls Teacher Zhang. After eight days of competition, Zou&apos;s cheeks had hollowed, and his smile was tired. &apos;I&apos;m hungry,&apos; he said in Chinese. Zou could feast now. He had won his second world title earlier on that November day, confirming his place as the first boxer in Chinese history to be considered a contender for an Olympic gold medal. A few years ago, it was hard to imagine that a Chinese boxer could win anything. The sport was banned for decades, because Mao&apos;s government considered it too violent and too Western. It was not allowed until 1986, after sports authorities made a calculation: boxing has 11 weight classes, thereby providing dozens of medal opportunities. That means a lot to a government that has elevated the hunt for Olympic medals to a state religion, a faith never more fervent than today, as China prepares to host the 2008 Olympics, in Beijing. Chinese boxing officials have a name for their objective: the &apos;zero-gold-medal breakthrough&apos;. &apos;Our target for the 2008 Olympics is explicit: one gold medal,&apos; Chang Jianping, the president of the Chinese Boxing Association, told me. When the Beijing News asked Teacher Zhang, the team&apos;s head coach, what he thought of that prospect, he replied: &apos;The entire team has only one person really capable of capturing the gold - Zou Shiming.&apos; Zou&apos;s first fight in Chicago fell during lunchtime, and the crowd was sparse. Only muffled thuds and the polyglot shouts of opposing cornermen broke the stillness of the arena, at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Two rings had been erected side by side, so that simultaneous fights could speed up the opening rounds. The world outside had intruded already. The Cuban team, from which two fighters have defected in recent years, were boycotting the competition, saying that they suspected a conspiracy by the &apos;most vile interests of the United States and some of its allies: the theft of athletes&apos;. Separately, two Ugandan fighters, including the team captain, had vanished from their hotel with their suitcases. One later called the coach to say, with apologies, that he was in Canada, but made no mention of returning home. Zou walked silently to the ring. The announcer stumbled over his name (&apos;Sheeming Joe!&apos;), to a polite flutter of applause. Zou slipped through the ropes. In his corner, in a hooded sweatshirt, stood Teacher Zhang, who looked so unprepossessing that he might have been a spectator who had stepped up for a closer look. Zhang coached martial arts until 1986, when he switched to boxing. At 54, he is trim and good-looking, with a brush cut that, like many Chinese men his age, he dyes an inky black. He has little appetite for conversation, but if he is asked about fighting his eyes sparkle and he embarks on long, precise paragraphs. He has done more than anybody else to define China&apos;s boxing style, yet he is so averse to attention that he can sometimes be found napping in the locker room during medal ceremonies while his fighters are on the podium. Zhang&apos;s indifference to formality is unusual, to say the least, in China&apos;s sports bureaucracy. &apos;The leaders don&apos;t like him,&apos; a coach who has known him for many years says. &apos;He has never kissed the leaders&apos; arses.&apos; A trio of Chinese sports officials had filed in and taken ringside seats. Zou turned toward Zhang and embraced him for a long moment over the top rope, his glove curled around the older man&apos;s head. After more than a decade with Teacher Zhang, Zou mentions him more often than he does his parents. &apos;We&apos;re like father and son,&apos; Zou says. The hug is a pre-fight ritual. &apos;It calms me down.&apos; Zou turned back to his opponent, Constantin Paraschiv. At the bell, the Romanian came out in a hurry, his fists clamped beside his face. He was energetic and aggressive, firing jabs and prompting Zou to backpedal or list from the waist. Zou looked uninspired. He threw few punches. He drifted around the ring, pursued by the Romanian. As they went back to their corners at the end of the first round, Paraschiv led, three points to two. Teacher Zhang stood close to Zou&apos;s face, spoke softly, and tipped a trickle of bottled water into his mouth. When the bell rang, Zou sprang forward and buried a left-right combination to even the score. He set his stance farther apart than before and bounced lightly on the balls of his feet. He scissored his legs, a homage to his idol, Muhammad Ali. His first round, it seemed, had been a warm-up. He glided around Paraschiv, pausing only to flick a combination into the Romanian&apos;s padded brow. Every time Paraschiv swung his fist, Zou eased out of the way and counterpunched. Paraschiv, pivoting and swinging in vain, did not score another point in the round. Or, for that matter, in either of the two rounds that followed. Zou rarely knocks opponents out. He batters them and darts out of reach, like an angry sparrow. Sometimes he holds his fists so low that they drop below his waist, a caricature of Ali. Zou fights at light-flyweight, the lightest Olympic class. But, even among boxers his size, Zou is known for exceptional speed. After he beat Paddy Barnes, I asked the Irishman what had happened. Zou&apos;s left hand, he replied. &apos;It&apos;s that fast. I could hardly see it coming.&apos; When the American Rau&apos;Shee Warren was on his way to losing to Zou in the 2004 Olympics, in Athens, Warren told his corner that he could not keep up: &apos;I&apos;m telling the coach, &quot;Dang, he can move, and I can&apos;t catch him!&quot;&apos; By the final bell, Zou had scored 13 punches on Paraschiv in a row, to win 15-3. The Romanian was flushed and slumped. He had spent three rounds slugging air. After the referee held Zou&apos;s arm aloft, Zou bowed to the judges and ducked through the ropes. He climbed down from the ring and headed for the front row, where the officials were seated. China&apos;s boxing boss, Chang, a jolly, broad-faced man in a maroon blazer, sat with provincial sports officials. Zou greeted each with a two-handed shake, nodded at their comments, and thanked them. I came to recognise the ritual after every one of his fights: the beeline to the officials at ringside, the two-handed shakes. Sweat pouring down his face, Zou listened closely to the men in suit jackets. Sports officials in China are among those who have a hand in shaping an athlete&apos;s future: where he lives, the terms by which he goes pro. On the evening news, they march in hard hats around new stadiums or huddle over blueprints. I wondered what they could possibly tell Zou about his fight that he did not know already. Zou&apos;s emergence startled American boxing purists, who have been slow to warm to his style. After Zou&apos;s fight, I asked the United States&apos; head coach, Dan Campbell, what he thought. &apos;I didn&apos;t think anything of him,&apos; Campbell said. &apos;He did the thing that he did in the Olympics, hitting with this part of his hand, and this part,&apos; Campbell went on, gesturing dismissively to the sides of his fist. That criticism does not bother Teacher Zhang. Zou&apos;s medals are the evidence he needs. &apos;If he can win points,&apos; Zhang said, &apos;even if he can fight with you he won&apos;t waste his energy.&apos; Zou was born on 18 May 1981 in the mountain city  of Zunyi, in Guizhou, one of China&apos;s poorest provinces. His parents lived and worked in a factory district that produced defence equipment under the ministry of aerospace. His father, Zou Jianguo (his given name means &apos;build the nation&apos;), was an engineer. He was gentle and remote, and worked relentlessly. Now in his fifties, Zou Jianguo is slender, with a ripple of tidy black hair. At one point, he considered joining the Communist Party. &apos;I tried, but I did not meet the Party&apos;s standard,&apos; he said. &apos;I always tried. I always tried.&apos; Zou&apos;s mother was as outgoing as her husband was reserved. She was a kindergarten teacher in the factory school. She excelled at table tennis; he preferred basketball. Their son, an only child, was small for his age, and they kept him close to home. When I met her in Zunyi and asked about Zou&apos;s upbringing, she laughed. &apos;When he was little, he looked like a little girl, with his head of curly hair,&apos; she said. &apos;My mother raised me too much like a girl,&apos; Zou told me. &apos;I couldn&apos;t talk too loud. I couldn&apos;t run or play around like other boys. Characteristics that should come out didn&apos;t come out. I didn&apos;t like to talk to people, maybe because my spirit was suppressed.&apos; As he grew up, Zou discovered television martial-arts dramas about fabled swordsmen. One of his favourite heroes was Zhang Sanfeng, a Taoist mystic of the 13th or 14th century, who is considered the father of Tai Chi. Legend describes him as seven-feet tall, with immense eyes and ears, and a fondness for clothes made of leaves. When Zou was 12 his parents enrolled him in a private school to study wushu, a modern hybrid sport based on traditional martial arts. They expected him to end up as a physical-education teacher with a stable job and a pension. But Zou was bored by wushu, which he thought emphasised form over fighting. He was attracted to boxing, which seemed explosive and free. When Zou asked his mother if he could switch to boxing, she thought the idea was preposterous. &apos;You are too delicate,&apos; she recalls saying. &apos;How can you train as a boxer?&apos; And she added: &apos;If you don&apos;t want your mum to sleep at night, then go box.&apos; Zou told his parents that he would stick to martial arts, but he began training with the school boxing team. &apos;I fell madly in love with boxing,&apos; he said. &apos;In the ring, I could truly let myself go. I wasn&apos;t subject to my mother&apos;s or anyone else&apos;s control.&apos; In 1995, Zou transferred to the Zunyi Sport School, one of China&apos;s Soviet-style sports institutes. One July day, he showed up with 1,900 other children to try out for the school&apos;s athletic teams. The boxing team had only four spots. First, the young athletes faced the measuring tape. Chinese coaches put extraordinary faith in assessing a child&apos;s dimensions, sometimes with the help of X-rays, to deduce athletic potential. It was the system that identified the basketball star Yao Ming when he was a child. Boxing coaches were interested only in athletes with a long reach - that is, children whose wingspan exceeded their height by three centimetres. Zou&apos;s outstretched arms measured a full centimetre less than his height, and the coaches discarded him in the first round. Two weeks later, Zou showed up again, and stood with the other applicants. &apos;I thought, &quot;This kid&apos;s clever and he&apos;s willing to suffer,&quot;&apos; Liang Feng, the coach who was running the try-outs, told me. Coach Liang put gloves on the boy and sent him in for a round. It was an unremarkable debut. &apos;He was frightened, timid,&apos; Liang said. But Zou&apos;s martial-arts training had given him good footwork, and he seemed to have a natural sense of distance, knowing how to lunge and withdraw to stay just out of his opponent&apos;s reach. He was nimble and willing to train harder than the other rookies. &apos;He was like a machine, just running without stopping,&apos; Liang said. The coach took a chance and put Zou on the team; a year later, in his first big tournament, he made it to the finals against a strong competitor. And then he buckled. &apos;The whole fight, he ran around,&apos; Liang said. &apos;He didn&apos;t dare to fight.&apos; Still, Liang was not ready to give up, believing that fear could be a form of protection. Besides, Zou was at the gym all day, every day, except for a few hours on Sunday. When nobody else showed up on the eve of Chinese New Year, he trained alone. When the arena was locked for the holiday, he and a friend jumped a fence to run on the track until a security guard chased them away. Coach Liang recommended him for the provincial team, and failed to mention his arm measurements. &apos;If I didn&apos;t hide that, it would be over,&apos; Liang said. Zou&apos;s parents continued to disapprove of his boxing, and demanded that he stop. A coach paid them a visit at home. He emphasised the safety of the headgear that is designed to protect amateur boxers against injuries. He argued that Olympic boxing is not like the heavyweight prizefights on television. Whereas professionals pound each other in search of a knockout blow, Olympic boxers win most often on points, relying on speed and accuracy to land the most punches during four two-minute rounds. The coach also mentioned that his own son was boxing, which Zou&apos;s mother found reassuring. &apos;He told us that in strong boxing countries, like the United States and Cuba, children from the age of two or three can go to the boxing gym to train,&apos; she said. &apos;It&apos;s like ping-pong in China.&apos; Zou&apos;s parents had no reason to be familiar with the sport. Western boxing, as it was known, had first appeared in China in the 1920s, in the port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, where foreign sailors were pitted against local fighters. The sport grew, unsupervised. In 1953, at a big competition in the northern city of Tianjin, a boxer died after a bout. Sports authorities were unnerved and in 1959, as China organised its first national games, it dropped boxing from the line-up. Mao was driving his nation deeper into isolation: the Great Leap Forward, his disastrous push for an industrial breakthrough, was already heading towards a famine that killed more than 30 million people. The political atmosphere was increasingly hostile to Western imports. As Fan Hong, a scholar who specialises in China&apos;s athletic history, puts it: &apos;People believed that boxing was very brutal, very ruthless, and those were said to be the characteristics of capitalism. So it was banned.&apos; When the Cultural Revolution engulfed China, in 1966, the Communist Party banned competitive sports and athletes who had won medals in the past found themselves accused of jinbiao zhuyi, or &apos;trophy mania&apos;, a charge of pursuing victory more zealously than Mao&apos;s vision of mass fitness. The table tennis champion Rong Guotuan, who had been greeted with parades a few years earlier, was detained on a trumped-up charge of spying and later hanged himself. Before his death, he wrote: &apos;I love my reputation more than my life.&apos; After the Cultural Revolution subsided, in 1969, China used table tennis to reconnect with the world, sometimes throwing matches to promote a friendlier mood. It was not until the late 1970s that Deng Xiaoping decided that competition might be as good for athletics as it was for the economy. In December 1979, Deng invited Muhammad Ali to the heavily guarded compound housing China&apos;s top leaders. The champ hugged him. They sat. And the word went out. &apos;Now the message was: &quot;If we want to win friends, if we want to win respect, we have to win medals&quot;,&apos; Fan said. In the following decade, Chinese boxers began training again, after a fashion. &apos;We had no bag or gloves,&apos; Liu Gang, one of the earliest recruits and now a promoter, said. &apos;In three months, I wore out two pairs of white cotton shoes. We punched sandbags.&apos; Liu went on to the 1992 Olympics, in Barcelona, where competitors were delighted to be drawn against Chinese opponents. The best that their coaches hoped for was that each fighter might stay on his feet a bit longer than the one before him. Today, as China transforms itself for the Olympics, Beijing is determined to broadcast a picture of prosperity. It is overhauling parts of the city that had not changed much since the 13th century, razing miles of one-storey brick alleys that Mongol conquerors designed to uniform widths of 12 or 24 paces. It is building a new world of vertical apartment complexes, with foreign names such as the Greenwich and the Upper East Side. Underground, a web of subway lines has more than doubled in length in barely six years. Olympic guests will step through an airport terminal that will be the largest in the world. In this atmosphere, any feat of preparation seems plausible. One Chinese pork supplier vowed to produce specially pampered pigs, to ensure that hormone-fed meat would not cause athletes to give false positives in doping tests. Only after Chinese citizens began wondering about their own pork did a Beijing Olympic Committee spokesperson issue a &apos;Clarification on Olympic Pig-Related Reports&apos;, denouncing the pork story as an &apos;exaggerated falsehood&apos;. In the Games proper, China hopes to win more gold than ever before. At the founding of the People&apos;s Republic, in 1949, no Chinese athlete had ever stood on an Olympic podium; by the close of the 2004 Summer Games, in Athens, China trailed only the United States, 32 to 36, in that year&apos;s gold medals. Chinese sports officials scrutinise, dissect, and forecast the medal race with an intensity that lends it the air of science - convinced that sufficient analysis will eventually engineer away the frailty of a diver in mid-air or a fighter in the ring. In 2000, Chinese officials launched the Project 119, a campaign to win more gold medals in the Summer Games&apos; most competitive events - a list that by China&apos;s calculation totalled 119 medals. In Athens, China&apos;s gold tally reflected its focus on producing an elite cadre of championship-level performers. Most Olympic delegations return home with more bronzes and silvers than golds. Out of the top 15 nations in the medal table at Athens, only China had more golds than bronze and silver combined - albeit by the margin of 32 to 31. China now cultivates sports that it never cared about before, events that (like boxing) increase a medal count because they include various weight classes or categories. Chinese athletes and coaches have also begun to defy their long-held belief that they can never best larger, taller Western competitors. And doing so is particularly glorious, as the sprinter Liu Xiang indicated after he won a gold medal in the 110metres hurdles in Athens. &apos;I believe I achieved a modest miracle for the yellow-skinned Chinese people and the Asian people,&apos; he said afterwards. The elite athletes who bear the responsibility for realising the country&apos;s ambitions live in privileged isolation. Their talents are treated as public goods, but while they are practising they live in secluded sports complexes, where they eat, sleep, and train under coaches&apos; instructions. If national-team members have commercial endorsements, they are required to share the money with their team staff and the state. When the Olympic diving champion Guo Jingjing was criticised, two years ago, for having too many &apos;commercial activities&apos;, she appeared on state television to apologise. &apos;I belong to the country,&apos; she said. As a boxer, Zou is even more cloistered, because his sport sanctifies monastic training. At times, coaches confiscate his mobile phones to eliminate distractions. Soon after Zou made his provincial team, in 1996, Teacher Zhang began to notice his extraordinary work ethic. Zhang had set out to develop a distinct Chinese style of boxing. He was studying fighters from Cuba, Russia, and the US. &apos;Asian people have different abilities and body types than Americans or Europeans,&apos; Zhang told me last autumn. &apos;We have to fight with flexibility and fight with speed. Because, after all, you don&apos;t often win by knocking people out. Fight with your mind. Fight with strategy.&apos; In 2003, Zou won his first national championship and drew political recognition; he was named one of the 10 outstanding young persons in Guizhou province and, later, a national advanced worker. Like other national champions, he joined the Communist Party. Chinese reporters nicknamed him the Dark Horse at first. Later, they tried the Knight of Lightning or the Fox or, sometimes, the Pirate, all celebrating his knack for snatching points and peeling away from his opponents&apos; reach. That strategy was helping him win international matches. In Athens, Zou made it to the semi-finals, so winning a bronze, China&apos;s first medal in boxing. He captured headlines, but when he returned home his achievement paled against the frenzy over Liu Xiang&apos;s gold in the hurdles. Zou&apos;s loss in the semis began to feel like a failure. &apos;Making a mistake in an event as grand as the Olympics, and to come so close to a gold medal, is a feeling that is inscribed into your bones and printed on your heart,&apos; he told me. It was another year before Zou won his first gold medal, at the 2005 world championships, held in the western Chinese city of Mianyang. He was the nation&apos;s first amateur boxing champion, and China celebrated. For him, the lesson was unmistakable: &apos;You must win the championship in order to get acknowledgment.&apos; The following year, Zou started a blog where he posted his diary entries and photographs. Entering the site triggers a twinkling piano tune, the first in a long loop of his favourite songs. A few hours after he posted his first message, a fan wrote: &apos;You are the pride of the Chinese people!&apos; Some days, Zou writes about fighting (&apos;I&apos;m fully confident that in tomorrow&apos;s combat I cannot fail!&apos;). On others, he posts a picture of himself strolling on a beach or flying a kite. He writes of his struggles: &apos;Often, when I sleep, my legs don&apos;t know where to go. No matter how I lie, I can&apos;t sleep comfortably. Worst of all, in a flash, the whistle blows and it&apos;s time to get out of bed again to train.&apos;  After midnight one night in the winter of 2006, he wrote: &apos;This week&apos;s training has been really tough, and the added intensity is bringing out accumulated years&apos; worth of pain, to the point that my back hurts so much it is keeping me awake.&apos; It was a week before the Chinese New Year, the most important family holiday, and he was spending it, once again, at a training centre far from home. &apos;The thought of the pain and homesickness troubles my mind. It&apos;s late at night, I&apos;m still unable to sleep, and I really want to find a good friend to chat with, but I feel bad to bother them. So I&apos;ll just pour out my heart to everyone, and hope people encourage me to shake off this spell of being down!&apos; He received five comments immediately. Someone using the name A Secret Supporter wrote: &apos;I, too, am far from home, and I know what you are experiencing.&apos; Zou won the Chicago championship with ease. In his final match, he routed a Filipino, 17-3. Even Dan Campbell, the American coach, said that he was impressed. After the national anthems, Zou wandered through the halls of the arena but drew little attention from the American fans streaming past. China&apos;s state news service once ranked him number four on the list of the nation&apos;s top athletes, three places behind Yao Ming, but outside China Zou remains virtually unknown. In addition to Zou&apos;s gold medal, China had won four bronzes, its best finish ever. When the team returned to Beijing, after an all-night flight, Chinese reporters were waiting for Zou in the terminal. They gave him bouquets of flowers and launched an impromptu press conference around his luggage cart. The next morning&apos;s Beijing News carried a story about his return, headlined with a quote: &apos;We Told the World with Our Fists That China Is Strong.&apos; If Zou&apos;s home town were in the United States, its seven million people would make it America&apos;s second-largest city, but Zunyi doesn&apos;t have an airport, so when teams from China, Kazakhstan, and the United States arrived in late November for a friendly competition they landed in Chongqing, a three-hour flight from Beijing. From there, they took a three-hour bus ride through mountain tunnels and gullies, around terraced fields, and into the clanging centre of Zunyi. Zou&apos;s picture was on the front page of the Zunyi Evening News, on cardboard cutouts beside restaurants that serve bumblebee larvae, a local delicacy. The fa\u00e7ade of the Fuyuan Hotel was plastered with two huge posters of Zou in the ring. In English and Chinese, they said: &apos;Welcome to the Return of the King from Victory.&apos; It was Zou&apos;s first competition here in years, and the event was to last three days. His face was printed on the tickets. His first opponent was a Kazakh. The match was lopsided and brief; midway through the second round, Zou was pummelling the hapless man, 20-0, when the referee stopped the fight. Zou waved to the audience and jogged back to the sanctuary of his locker room. Fights were still under way, but a frenzied crowd of kids began to mass outside the locker-room door, which was guarded by police, except for the police who wandered inside to ask Zou for his autograph. &apos;Get changed!&apos; Teacher Zhang murmured. &apos;If you wait until the end, it will be hard to leave. This is a small town.&apos; The door opened a crack, revealing a wall of young, reddened faces pressed against a policeman&apos;s outstretched arm. The door slammed shut. Zou stepped out of his trunks and pulled on jeans and a Brazil soccer jersey. The room smelled of sweat and garlic. From the sound of it, the crowd outside was growing. He looked at his coach. They were, for the moment, trapped. Well-wishers had left giant bouquets of flowers on the table in the locker room, so Zou grabbed two of them and held them in front of his face as a shield. And then he and his coach pressed into the maw of the crowd. Teenagers swarmed, jostling and shouting. Zou smiled and thanked them, but pushed forward. By the time he had squeezed into the stairwell and down to a waiting bus, the bouquets were shredded. The next day, Zou and his parents visited relatives in town. They climbed the steps to a modest two-bedroom apartment where the entry hall was filled with a large, empty fish tank and a folded treadmill. The apartment was decorated, more or less, with Zou: a wall poster of his face beneath the phrase &apos;Everything for 2008&apos;; a poem written in calligraphy by another relative, which ended: &apos;Surprise the whole world in year 2008.&apos; Looking at it, I wondered how they would redecorate once the Olympics were over. As we walked to lunch that day, I asked Zou if his body was holding up. His back and his foot have been bothering him for months. (He had told a Chinese reporter: &apos;After endurance runs, I lie on the ground, and I can&apos;t tell the tears from the sweat.&apos;) &apos;It&apos;s painful,&apos; he said. &apos;But there&apos;s no time for surgery before the Olympics. That will have to wait.&apos; I once asked him how it felt to live his life suspended between future success and failure. &apos;I absolutely can&apos;t allow such a heavy burden to feel like it&apos;s suffocating me, or I will bring those worries into the ring,&apos; he said. The following night, in the final, Zou faced Luis Yanez, a confident, experienced 19-year-old from Duncanville, Texas, who had won a succession of amateur titles on his way to the American Olympic team. After years of hearing about Zou, he had a strategy: &apos;He drops his hands a lot and holds his hands down, and I got a quick jab, so if I just keep my jab out there in his face he won&apos;t have them down there no more,&apos; Yanez told me. &apos;But he&apos;s a good little fighter. He&apos;s slick.&apos; The arena holds about 5,000 people, and that night it was packed. The walls did not meet the roof, and it was cold inside; the ring-card girls huddled in parkas during the rounds. The city had made special preparations for its foreign guests: officials were identified with signs intended to be bilingual. A Chinese sign indicated the &apos;Arbitrator&apos;s Seat&apos;. The English letters below read &apos;Arditrator eat&apos;. Not that the American team was unaccustomed to communication trouble; team members had spent part of the day at a pharmacy trying to mime the symptoms of a stomach ailment. Zou jogged out of the locker room draped in a golden robe, his face hidden beneath the hood. Only his gloves were visible, firing jabs into the cool night air. High over his head, a banner along the rafters ran the length of the stadium wall, with an enormous picture of him in mid-fight. When the announcer said his name, the crowd went berserk. On the upper deck, a man unfurled a red Chinese flag as big as a bedsheet, and Zou&apos;s cardboard blown-up face danced in the crowd. Teacher Zhang had warned him before the fight not to let the attention affect him. &apos;Don&apos;t try to prove anything or show off,&apos; Zhang said. &apos;Be yourself, and you&apos;ll be fine.&apos; Yanez came out with no robe, jogging and sidestepping toward the ring, flicking his gloves over his shoulders as if trying to shoo away an insect. He climbed through the ropes, jogged in place, and settled into a half-crouch to wait for the bell. The two surged into each other. They wrestled and bear-hugged, tying each other up in headlocks. The referee pulled them apart, and Zou buried a combination into Yanez&apos;s head. The crowd loved it. Yanez responded with a broad hook that missed by a foot. Zou settled into a rhythm, and his fists dropped to his waist, his gloves rolling loosely up and down, as if he were a timpani player, rising only to peck at Yanez&apos;s temples. Yanez grew frustrated. He lunged, angrily, but landed few punches. When the first round ended, Zou led, 8-1. He turned back to his corner. He waved away his stool and stood facing into the ring, his arms splayed comfortably on the top rope. He looked at home there. It occurred to me that he has been boxing almost half his life. The second round drifted farther out of Yanez&apos;s grasp. Zou racked up points, setting his feet to hit hard now, intent on landing a big punch. He held his hands so low that they dropped behind his back, pleading with Yanez to open himself up. As the third round ticked down, Yanez was frantic, swinging broad hooks through the air. He looked, suddenly, like a child. Zou stretched his lead to 19 points. The bell sounded. With his chest heaving, Yanez plodded back to his corner, but the American coach was already nodding to the referee. Zou thrust his fists into the air. The audience erupted and began pouring towards the ring. The fighters shook hands and Yanez slipped away, unnoticed. Zou put on his golden robe, brilliant in the ring lights, and stood alone, arms raised in the centre of the canvas. He turned and faced the crowd of his countrymen, hundreds of them pressed against the edge of the ring, mobile phones aloft, snapping pictures. Zou seemed at peace with the knowledge that his country&apos;s self-regard hinges on a single fight in his future, on a single medal. He has come of age in China&apos;s system and, if it chafes him, he does not readily admit to it. Like the pressure born of his talent, his role as a political symbol seemed to be something he accepted long ago, something larger than he is. The 10 best Chinese athletes 1 Liu Xiang (Athletics) The world and Olympic 110m hurdles champion broke Colin Jackson&apos;s 13-year-old world record in 2006. Aged 24, he should be reaching his peak. 2 Yang Wei (Gymnastics) Yang fell off the high bar in Athens in 2004, ruining his chance of gold, but in 2007 became the first all-round world champion to defend his title in 81 years.  3 Shen Xue &amp;Amp; Zhao Hongbo (Figure skating) Shen and her partner Zhao won gold at the Asian Games and the world championships last year, then announced their engagement. 4 Zhu Qinan (Shooting) Broke the world record to win gold in the 10m air rifle at Athens aged 19 and, after smashing it again in October last year, he will be favourite to retain his title. 5 Guo Jingjing (Diving) A gossip-magazine staple with a string of high-profile boyfriends, Guo, 26, won double gold in Athens and will bid for a repeat in Beijing before retiring. 6  Zhang Guozheng (Weightlifting) The reigning world champion will be defending his 69kg Olympic crown in Beijing. 7 Zhu Lin (Badminton) With China aiming for a clean sweep of the badminton medals, even 24-year-old world singles champion Zhu will have to see off tough competition to qualify for the three-strong team. 8 Zou Shiming (Boxing) The light-flyweight is China&apos;s first genuine Olympic boxing contender. The Athens bronze medallist successfully defended his amateur world title in Chicago last year. 9 Wu Peng (Swimming) The man most likely to deny Michael Phelps a seven-gold Beijing haul. He is on a $25,000 bonus if he pips the American to victory in the 200m butterfly. 10 Guo Yue (Table tennis) The 19-year-old world champion is a household name in China, and even her press conferences are broadcast live on state television. China expects Never mind the taking part, for China it&apos;s all about the winning. Since they rejoined the Olympic family in 1984, having previously boycotted the Games in protest at Taiwan&apos;s participation, their progress has been extraordinary - China have gone from nought to 60 medals in just six Olympics. The remarkable aspect of China&apos;s rise has been the proportion of golds: in Athens, they constituted more than half of their total, putting them second in the medal table. This time, no medal avenue is being overlooked.  In 2000 the authorities launched Project 119, a scheme aimed at challenging for gold in some of the most medal-rich sports: athletics, swimming and water sports. Chinese officials will be quietly confident of overhauling the USA, but even they probably have no idea how high they can go. We reckon 43 golds, 11 up from Athens, is a fair estimate, based on linear performance trends, and the effect of home advantage; then again, we really have no idea either.Jonathan Liew", "tags": ["China", "Sport", "Boxing", "Olympics 2008", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-04T10:12:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/may/04/uk.theatre", "sentences": ["&apos;Dialogues of Wind and Bamboo&apos; is a multi-media production combining talents from around the world - performers will include Scottish artist-musician ensemble Found (who use electronic sounds sampled from &apos;talking plants&apos;), Thai bamboo percussion group Harmony Ensemble and the Shanghai Jazz Project."], "title": "Alfresco arts: A guide to outdoors arts events in the UK", "article": "Visual arts Sculpture Park, YorkshireSet in 500 acres of parkland on the 18th-century Bretton Hall estate near Wakefield, the Yorkshire Sculpture Park thinks of itself as a &apos;gallery without walls&apos;, housing changing exhibitions of works by the likes of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth in the picturesque grounds and four galleries.

The 34-year-old Dubliner found the inspiration to birdie four of the last six holes to be home in 32 for a final round of 67, only to see the Spaniard Ignacio Garrido down a 30-foot putt to birdie the last and match his 15-under-par tally of 273. Lawrie&apos;s frantic Irish jig to celebrate sinking a 35-foot birdie putt at the first extra hole proved premature as Garrido, who had put the pressure on by hitting to within a yard of the pin, coolly matched his three.  Lawrie&apos;s luck seemed to have run out when he drove into a bunker on the second extra hole but he floated his recovery shot to within 25 feet and squeezed home as Garrido&apos;s second shot toppled back into a lake. It was a sweet moment for Lawrie, who lost a play-off in the 2003 Spanish Open to England&apos;s Kenneth Ferrie. His first tour triumph earned him \u00a3262,750 and completed a hat-trick of Irish successes after Damien McGrane&apos;s nine-shot win in the China Open in Beijing a fortnight ago and Darren Clarke&apos;s last-putt victory in Shanghai last week. &quot;Damien was my room-mate and Darren&apos;s comeback win was just great for Irish golf,&quot; said Lawrie, who jumps past Clarke and his compatriot Padraig Harrington into 12th place in the moneylist. &quot;I was just trying to put in a good finish and after making great birdies at 13, 15 and 16 I holed from 30 feet for a two at 17 - when I looked at the leaderboard at the last, I discovered I was leading. &quot;I still had a few bullets to dodge but I made it and there&apos;s no doubt I was spurred on by what the other Irish lads did.&quot; Lawrie, whose previous best pay cheque was \u00a3105,000 for losing the 2003 play-off, grabbed his chance after Garrido, three ahead at the start and last a winner that same year after a play-off against the recent US Masters champion Trevor Immelman in the PGA Championship at Wentworth, stumbled to the turn in 39. The Ryder Cup Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, 14 times a winner on the tour, took over as pacesetter, only to hit two balls into the lake at the 10th to run up a triple-bogey seven.

Valentino Rossi ended a seven-race winless streak, his longest dry spell in MotoGP, with a convincing victory in the Chinese GP on Sunday. &quot;I&apos;m very, very happy,&quot; the Italian said after the race, in a statement of the most obvious \u2013 Rossi is one of the happiest sportsmen I&apos;ve ever met, even when things aren&apos;t going his way. Until China, the 2008 season had tested even Rossi&apos;s sunny side. Based on the evidence of the first three grands prix, his decision to switch from Michelin to Bridgestone tyres \u2013 a decision forged during a frustrating 2007 campaign, when Casey Stoner&apos;s Bridgestone-equipped Ducati destroyed all-comers \u2013 could be summed up in one word: backfired. Rossi&apos;s rookie team-mate, Jorge Lorenzo, had outperformed him, to the tune of three pole positions and one race victory \u2013 that should not happen to a multiple world champion. And how galling for Rossi that Lorenzo&apos;s Yamaha, which appeared to enjoy superior handling, was equipped with Michelins. The French manufacturer not only closed the gap on Bridgestone over the winter, they came into the 2008 season with what appeared to be a superior tyre, especially in cool conditions. I reserve judgment on which manufacturer has the edge, at least until those races where the sun usually shines, such as Laguna Seca (United States GP) and Phillip Island (Australian GP). But Rossi, though impatient, is not a man who knows how to feel sorry for himself. It&apos;s a trait that has served him well throughout his career. So it would not occur to him, even when surrounded on the grid by fearless, talented rookies, that his time as The Man might be over, or that he might never end the winless streak. Shanghai is a wonderful, monstrous circuit, defined by two long straights, where some riders clock a scary 215mph, and corners that seem to go on forever. It presents a stiff test in dry conditions, let alone the damp conditions riders faced yesterday. Rossi passed the test with distinction. He rode a near-flawless race. Only Dani Pedrosa got near him. The little Spaniard led the race in the early laps, but could not stay with Rossi \u2013 who set a new circuit record on lap 18 \u2013 as the race entered its final quarter. With three laps to go, Rossi broke Pedrosa. The latter admitted after the race: &quot;In the end I just slowed down because I saw that I couldn&apos;t get Valentino, and just decided to keep the engine alive and finish second.&quot; Four winners in four races \u2013 Casey Stoner, Pedrosa, Lorenzo and Rossi, in that order \u2013 is the perfect recipe for a season that is shaping up to be the most exciting in MotoGP history. Rossi and Pedrosa had better days than Stoner and Lorenzo, who finished third and fourth respectively. Stoner wrongly chose a soft compound tyre on a track that dried faster than many expected (he blamed his team for the decision after the race), whilst the fact that Lorenzo raced at all was amazing, given his spectacular crash in practice on Friday. On a good day, there is very little to separate this brilliant quartet. One of them will win the championship.

Diplomatic ties between the Catholic church and Beijing were severed shortly after the Communists took power in 1949 and Catholics in China had to worship underground.  But last year Pope Benedict XVI issued a 55-page open letter saying he wanted to restore full diplomatic links. Shortly afterwards, the Vatican approved the installation of a new state-approved Catholic bishop in the Chinese capital. Now Beijing has arranged for the China Philharmonic Orchestra to play at the Vatican, in an offer that the conductor, Yu Long, compared to the table tennis matches played by US players in China in 1971 which helped revive Sino-American relations.  &quot;If music as a universal language can make a contribution to diplomacy or world peace, I will be very happy,&quot; he said, adding that there were parallels with the New York Philharmonic&apos;s ice-breaking concert in North Korea in February.

A double bogey by his nearest challenger had left Clarke two shots clear with four holes to play but, at that moment, his concentration on a draining last day began to unravel. The Ulsterman&apos;s thoughts returned to his wife, Heather, who died 21 months ago from cancer, as well as their sons, Tyrone and Conor, aged 10 and eight, who he knew were back home and watching him on television. &quot;As a human being it was understandable I should think of Heather and the boys as I left the 14th green. Heather died in August 2006, but she was diagnosed with the cancer four years before that. We&apos;ve been in this black hole a long time and I&apos;ve had an awful lot on my mind, trying to make sure the boys are OK and simply keeping on top of everything. It&apos;s little wonder my golf suffered. To be a winning golfer you need to be fully focused, and that&apos;s not been possible. So there I was, closing in on a first victory in ages and my concentration flew out the window again.&quot; Clarke chuckles dryly, as if to curb any lingering irritation with himself. But, out on the course in China, he was reeling. He dropped two shots over the next three holes to leave himself level with Robert-Jan Derksen as they approached the 18th tee. &quot;I wanted to win it for me, like any good and selfish golfer would say, but I also wanted it for Heather and the boys. My head was full of them, but in golfing terms I needed to be on my own again on that hole.&quot; The intensely solitary business of professional golf, one of the loneliest trades in the sporting world, is stripped bare in that last phrase as Clarke shut out the three people who have mattered most to him. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to let the boys down, and that allowed me to get back inside myself. Knowing I was still in a great position, tied for the lead, I hit a solid drive. I followed it with another good shot on to the green and that left me with a putt to win.&quot; Descriptions of Clarke&apos;s winning putt have seen the distance stretch from 30 to 40 feet. The big man laughs: &quot;It could have been 100 feet for all I care. It went straight down the middle. There might be a bit of skill involved but, in moments like that, there&apos;s destiny at work. That&apos;s what it felt like - it was my turn to win again after so long on the rack.&quot; Jetlagged and hungover, Clarke arrived back in England last Monday afternoon. By the time he got home it was just after six. &quot;Conor was at home, full of smiles, and then we picked up Tyrone because he had a late day at school. It was a very special moment being back with them after finally winning again. All the hard work I&apos;ve put in these last few months suddenly felt worth it.&quot; Clarke is thoughtful when asked if the boys understood the significance of that victory, as much in psychological as golfing terms, for him. &quot;I think they did,&quot; he eventually says. &quot;They&apos;re growing up, and they&apos;ve seen me over the last year coming home down in the dumps because I&apos;ve missed another cut. They understood I was battling so they can appreciate what this win means to me.&quot; The image of two young boys looking up at their grieving father, struggling at home and in work, is wrenching and poignant. But, typically of both Clarke and the demands of parenthood, he had little time to linger over the impact. &quot;Whenever I got back home early from a tournament they tried to console me. They&apos;d say, &apos;Hard luck, Daddy,&apos; and I&apos;d appreciate it. But then normality descended and they&apos;d be thrilled at the chance of playing football with me. Missing the cut was a bonus in that sense to them. They&apos;d haul me outside and we&apos;d have a kickaround - which is just how it should be because, really, they just want to have fun at that age.&quot; The less entertaining parts of being a parent can usually be shunted aside by the selfish golfer, and absorbed by an overstretched wife, but everything has changed for the 39-year-old Clarke. He jokes that he has often felt so caught up in his role as a single parent that, on trips to America, he hesitates over the box marked &apos;Occupation&apos; when filling out a landing card. &quot;Sometimes I&apos;m about to write &apos;Father&apos; rather than &apos;Golfer.&apos; But the boys are in a good place at the minute and it&apos;s almost as if we&apos;re getting back to normal.&quot; Clarke&apos;s grief left him in such emotional turmoil that, a few months after Heather&apos;s death, he found himself in a brief relationship with a woman called Nicola Regan. She had been a friend of the family but Clarke was startled by the way in which his personal life turned him into a tabloid celebrity. His tear-streaked exploits in helping Europe retain the Ryder Cup at the K Club, just outside Dublin, pushed him to the forefront of sporting fame - and the combination of his wife&apos;s death and another woman in his life, however fleeting their liaison, was irresistible to some newspapers. After Clarke ended the relationship, explaining to Regan that he was nowhere near ready to be seeing anyone else, a newspaper printed a blow-by-blow account of the breakup - including his text messages.  &quot;I was really taken aback by the intrusion. I got this attention because of what happened to Heather and that made me uncomfortable. I&apos;ve never seen myself as some celebrity. I&apos;m just a normal guy who likes to have some fun, drink a few pints and smoke my cigars. I didn&apos;t feel I should be splashed all over the newspapers when it had nothing to do with golf.&quot; Clarke is now in a low-key relationship with Kerry Schiller, who works for a London law firm. &quot;Things are quieter and on an even keel which is how I like it. I just want to work hard and haul myself up the rankings - especially in a Ryder Cup season.&quot; At his worst last year, after he missed 10 out of 20 cuts on the European Tour, Clarke plummeted to 236 in the world, a distressing ranking for a former top 10 golfer who spent eight years amongst the world&apos;s leading players before Heather&apos;s illness took hold. &quot;I&apos;ve since worked hard on my swing with [the golf commentator and coach] Ewan Murray and on the sports psychology side with Karl Morris. Shanghai is a step in the right direction but I&apos;ve got a long way to go to get into the Ryder Cup team.&quot; Has Nick Faldo, Europe&apos;s captain, contacted him during the last few difficult months - or even after Shanghai? &quot;No. Not at all - nor would I expect him to at this stage. After the Open the make-up of the team starts taking shape and that&apos;s when Nick might make the odd call. I don&apos;t really know him that well because Nick&apos;s one of those guys who has always kept himself to himself. But he&apos;s achieved an immense amount in the game - winning six majors and being European No1 so long. He will bring a lot to the captaincy even though he&apos;ll be different to Woosie [Ian Woosnam, Clarke&apos;s captain in 2006]. &quot;The whole thing is bubbling up nicely because the US, under Paul Azinger, badly want to win it. Zinger&apos;s always been a fiery character and so that&apos;s totally down to him. I like that and I&apos;ve always got on well with Zinger. So it&apos;s set up for a massive week in Valhalla [in Kentucky] this September. I definitely want to be there but I need to keep doing what I did in Shanghai.&quot;  At last week&apos;s Spanish Open, still suffering from the aftermath of victory, Clarke was reasonably happy shooting seven under for a tie of 22nd place. He now stands at 113 in the world rankings, still too far adrift for a place in the prestigious Players Championship which begins at Sawgrass in Jacksonville on Thursday. &quot;I&apos;ll be at home, avidly watching it,&quot; Clarke says, &quot;but it&apos;s hard not being there. As players we consider it the fifth major and it&apos;s a tournament you really want to feature in because it&apos;s a demanding course, which can punish you, but the aim is to make sure I&apos;m back there next year.&quot; Yesterday afternoon Clarke sat peacefully with his fishing rod on the banks of the River Test in Hampshire. &quot;It&apos;s a beautiful river, and it is the official start of the fishing season this week, so that&apos;s one consolation for missing Sawgrass. Then [tonight] I&apos;m in Vienna, for a Breast Cancer dinner, which my foundation supports in memory of Heather, before it&apos;s a quiet week at home with the boys, in the gym, and in front of the telly. After the win in China it&apos;s probably what I need most - and I&apos;m going to make the most of it. But, at the same time, I want it to be another small step on my road to winning again. After Shanghai I&apos;ve got the taste. And it&apos;s sweet, really sweet.&quot;  The Players Championship is exclusively live on Setanta Golf and Setanta Sports 1 from Thursday to Sunday", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "Darren Clarke"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-06T02:15:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/06/pearson.pearson", "sentences": ["Textbook and newspaper publisher Pearson is poised to buy a chain of private schools in Shanghai to tap into the growing demand for English language teaching from increasingly affluent Chinese families."], "title": "Pearson poised to buy Shanghai schools chain", "article": "Textbook and newspaper publisher Pearson is poised to buy a chain of private schools in Shanghai to tap into the growing demand for English language teaching from increasingly affluent Chinese families.

Road, rail, air and phone links to the epicentre of the 7.8 magnitude shock were cut, hampering relief efforts and the flow of information on the scale of the catastrophe. Some Chinese troops were marching up to 100 miles through the night to reach affected areas.  Earlier this morning, authorities put the death toll in the worst affected province, Sichuan, at almost 10,000, with more than 7,000 in one county alone. The estimated toll - across Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan and the huge city of Chongquing - is thought to make the disaster China&apos;s deadliest since 1976, when 240,000 were killed. Among those known to be trapped are 900 teenagers who were inside a three-storey school in Dujiangyan city when the quake struck at 2.28pm in Wenchuan county, 57 miles north-west of the provincial capital, Chengdu. At least 50 bodies were pulled out of the rubble. Eight other schools, a hospital and chemical plants in the area also collapsed.  Yesterday&apos;s quake and aftershocks caused panic and mass evacuations in cities across the country, including Beijing, 930 miles away, Shanghai and Wuhan. They were felt as far away as Vietnam and Thailand, 1,300 miles to the south.  Prime minister Wen Jiabao flew to the scene while thousands of troops and paramilitary police headed there after President Hu Jintao ordered an &quot;all out&quot; rescue effort. State TV showed a clearly emotional Wen vowing not to waste a moment. At one point he was shown shouting into a hole: &quot;Everyone hang in there. We&apos;re rescuing you.&quot; The authorities and rescue teams were attempting to make contact with areas cut off, but forecasts of rain added to the scale of the challenge. The state broadcaster CCTV issued tips for anyone trapped. It said: &quot;If you&apos;re buried, keep calm and conserve your energy. Seek water and food and wait patiently for rescue.&quot; In Beichuan county, just east of the epicentre, 80% of buildings collapsed and an estimated 3,000-5,000 died. Local radio reported 15,000 people were still trapped, but added that 4,000 troops had arrived to help relief efforts. Local journalists warned the rescue operation was short of tents and medical equipment. The airport in Chengdu was closed and flights cancelled while state TV reported heavy traffic jams in the city. Calls from anxious residents quickly overloaded the phone system. Heavy rain set in early this morning, complicating efforts.  Mobile telecommunication converters had jammed and thousands of servers were out of service, according to Sha Yuejia, an executive of China Mobile. But one Israeli student, Ronen Medzini, sent a text message to the Associated Press reporting: &quot;Traffic jams, no running water, power out, everyone sitting in the streets, patients evacuated from hospitals sitting outside and waiting.&quot;  Melissa Block, a reporter for America&apos;s National Public Radio, was in Chengdu when the quake struck. &quot;I was in a building, the building started to shake, there was a huge rumble and everybody ran,&quot; she said. &quot;There are still many, many people out in the streets. They don&apos;t want to go back into the buildings because there are rumours of aftershocks and possible secondary quakes.&quot; The state news agency Xinhua reported that buildings collapsed in at least six counties near the epicentre. But details were only beginning to trickle out from mountainous Wenchuan county, which has a population of 100,000. Phone lines to the area were brought down. A website for the region&apos;s Aba prefecture said the quake had hit highways and felled communications in 11 counties.  Yesterday in Fuying, 660 miles east of the epicentre in Anhui province, patients were evacuated from a hospital and lay on beds in a parking lot.  In Shanghai, China&apos;s financial centre, skyscrapers swayed as the tremor hit and office workers rushed into the streets. Many more were evacuated from tall buildings in Beijing. &quot;I&apos;ve lived in Taipei and California and I&apos;ve been through quakes before. This is the most I&apos;ve ever felt,&quot; said James McGregor, a business consultant. &quot;The floor was moving beneath me.&quot; President George Bush sent condolences to the families of victims. &quot;The United States stands ready to help in any way possible,&quot; he said.

If the buildings are poorly constructed, you can get 10 or 20,000 deaths. &quot;This is a very big earthquake in a place with a history of them, it could have done a lot of damage. From what I&apos;ve seen of modern building techniques I would have thought any building from the last 20 years would be reasonably secure, but older ones may be a problem.  &quot;The time of day also makes a difference.

While insurance firms led the fallers, shares in steel and cement makers jumped as traders anticipated a major rebuilding programme as a result of the earthquake, which measured 7.8 on the Richter scale. Throughout the day, firms based in the Sichuan region revealed how badly the earthquake had hit them. Officials at the index said 66 companies had been suspended while it tried to contact them, the biggest trading halt in its history. Tower blocks in Shanghai were evacuated after the shockwave from the epicentre, some 1,700km away, reached the city. The disaster comes just four months after snowstorms shut down parts of China&apos;s transport system. China Life, the country&apos;s biggest life insurer, said it expected claims as a result of the quake to far exceed the cost of the snowstorms. Sichuan is rich in natural resources, and contains around 40% of China&apos;s natural gas reserves. It is also a major agricultural area, producing rice, wheat, pork, citrus fruits, sugar cane and sweet potatoes. Analysts at Merrill Lynch predicted the disaster would have a limited impact on Chinese exports, but said supply shortages were likely to add to domestic inflationary pressures. &quot;As an inland province, Sichuan is not relevant for China&apos;s external trade, so we don&apos;t think China&apos;s exports and imports will be noticeably affected by the earthquake,&quot; Merrill Lynch said.  Lehman Brothers agreed that Chinese inflation, which rose to 8.5% last month, could be pushed higher. &quot;While the quake is an enormous human tragedy, we expect its impact on China&apos;s economic growth to be temporary and limited.

The death toll has been rising steadily throughout the day. The disaster has left thousands more people trapped in the rubble of collapsed schools, factories, hospitals and homes. Road, rail, air and phone links to the epicentre of the 7.9-magnitude quake were cut, hampering both relief efforts and the flow of information about the scale of the catastrophe. Rain was impeding rescue efforts and a group of paratroopers called off a mission to the epicentre due to heavy storms, Xinhua reported. Some Chinese troops were marching up to 100 miles through the night to reach affected areas.  It is feared that the quake was China&apos;s deadliest since 1976, when 240,000 people were killed in the city of Tangshan, near Beijing. At least 4,800 people remained buried in Mianzhu, 60 miles from the epicentre of the quake. Chinese rescue workers reported that 3,629 people had been confirmed dead in Mianyang city, with 18,645 still buried under debris. The Chinese ministry of health issued an appeal for blood donations to help the victims. &quot;There is a large demand for blood in quake-hit areas, and we hope the public actively donate blood,&quot; said Mao Quan, a ministry spokesman. Xinhua said up to 5,000 people were killed and 80% of buildings had collapsed in Beichuan, in a region of small cities and towns amid steep hills north of Sichuan&apos;s provincial capital, Chengdu. The government had sent more than 16,000 troops to the area, and tens of thousands more were on the way. Just east of the epicentre, 1,000 students and teachers were killed or missing at a collapsed high school in Beichuan county. The building, more than six storeys high, was reduced to a pile of rubble. The deaths were separate from those at another collapsed school, in Dujiangyan, where 900 students are feared dead.

This from Matt Henry &quot;Are bets being taken on how many foul throws will be committed by that hack of a footballer, Broadfoot?&quot; he asks. &quot;I have to say I sympathize with you being stuck watching this drivel but at least you&apos;re getting paid, I assume. Although that must not be much solace when you consider what you are about to witness. Maybe a flask full of Bushmills would ease the pain? Not that I condone drinking on the job or anything.&quot; I don&apos;t drink whiskey, Matt, although I did get invited to An Evening Of Bushmills And Irish Rugby Legend Keith Wood earlier this year, prior to the Six Nations rugby kicking off. The Bushmills master distiller, Colum Egan, was there giving a talk and tasting session and I have to say he was a very interesting bloke. I feel compelled to say that I think you&apos;re being a bit harsh on Kirk Broadfoot - he&apos;s no Pele, but he is a centre-half by trade who&apos;s done a decent job of filling Alan Hutton&apos;s big boots.  Pre-match niceties Uefa&apos;s ambassador for the night, Denis Law, brings out the trophy and places it on the official Uefa plinth, then the teams emerge from the tunnel to the soundtrack of Best Of You, by the Foo Fighters. It&apos;s a lovely sunny evening in the City of Manchester Stadium, which is bulging with the 25-30,000 Rangers fans who weren&apos;t lucky enough to get a spot watching the game along side 100,000+ fellow supporters on the big screen in Manchester&apos;s Albert Square.  1 min: Rangers kick off, playing in their usual light blue shirts, blue shorts and blue socks. They&apos;ll line up in a 4-1-4-1 formation, with Jean Claude Darcheville ploughing a lone furrow up front. Zenit St Petersburg, the favourites, play in all white. Seven of their side are Russians, while there are six Scots on the Rangers side.  2 min: Deep in Zenit territory, Sasa Papac concedes the first free-kick of the night, catching Anatoly Tymoschuk with his knee.  3 min: Fifteen yards outside his own box, Barry Ferguson puts his side in trouble with a loose ball into a crowded midfield that puts Brahim Hamdani in trouble. Igor Denisov robs him and plays the ball to Zenit&apos;s star-turn Andrei Arshavin, who takes it into the Rangers penalty area before rippling the side netting. It was a good scoring opportunity for Zenit, who already look lightning quick on the break.  5 min: Rangers attack, launching a sortie into the Zenit box with some great one-touch passing from Hemdani, Thomson and Ferguson, who picks out Darcheville in the right-back position. The Frenchman does well to hold off Alexander Anyukov before squaring the ball, prompting centre-half Roman Shirokov to hack clear. There&apos;s been more exciting play in the opening five minutes than there has been in Rangers entire Uefa Cup campaign to date this season.  9 min: Andrei Arshavin sends a speculative cross-field ball into the Rangers box, but there&apos;s no Zenit player nearby to get on the end of it.  10 min: Kevin Thomson concedes a free-kick about 35 yards out from his own goal, right of centre. Zenit left-back Radek Sirl has pop, which bounces on the ground in front of Rangers keeper Neil Alexander, but doesn&apos;t cause him too many problems.  12 min: &quot;After their first Euro win was ruined by a riot, could Rangers be the first team to win a trophy and have it withheld due to their fans choice of song?&quot; wonders Div. &quot;So far today on TV we&apos;ve had The Billy Boys, The Sash, Derry&apos;s Walls and the new dodgy &apos;the famine&apos;s over, why don&apos;t you go home&apos; song, as sung to Irishman Noel Hunt on Saturday, and the entire Celtic support in previous weeks.&quot; Ah I dunno, Div. Do you ever think maybe the famine was exaggerated a bit? As Alan Partridge once said about us Irish: &quot;If you could afford to emigrate during the famine, then surely you could afford to eat in a modestly priced Chinese restaurant?&quot;  17 min: Radek Sirl tries a piledriver from distance, which Kirk Broadfoot blocks, then clears. Good defending, although I&apos;m not sure how much he knew about the initial block. He knows all about it now, that&apos;s for sure. I&apos;d say it reddened his arse for him.  18 min: Zenit, who are dominating possession, attack down the right wing courtesy of Viktor Fayzulin. Rangers full-back Sasa Papac dispossesses him and hacks clear.  22 min: Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... hack! Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... hoof! Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... Zenit pressure ... hoist!  23 min: Konstantin Zyrianov is dispossessed by a crunching tackle by Kevin Thomson, who was rushed back from injury to take his place in the Rangers side tonight.  25 min: &quot;I find the Guardian&apos;s coverage of tonight&apos;s showpiece event completely appalling,&quot; writes Archi Campbell. &quot;It&apos;s far too detailed. Why are you even doing a minute-by-minute report on it? You&apos;re wasting valuable internet space on this which could be used for something that&apos;s actually useful - like one of those guides to birds of Northern Europe that Big Paper seems to be so fond of. I don&apos;t even care that I ended the last sentence on a preposition.&quot;  26 min: Ineffectual Zenit probing ... Ineffectual Zenit probing ... Ineffectual Zenit probing ... Ineffectual Zenit probing ... Ineffectual Zenit probing ... hack ... hoof ... bosh!  27 min: Zenit right-back Alexander Anyukov, who is one of those Russians whose nationality you could guess just by looking at his sensible no-frills haircut, drills a 25-yard shot from right-to-left on the fly. Rangers goalkeeper Neil Alexander saves easily enough.  30 min: Going for a 50-50 ball, Igor Denisov and Carlos Cuellar clash heads over by the side line, but both live to tell the tale.  31 min: &quot;This is like the Cold War expressed through the medium of football!&quot; writes Andrew Brookes. &quot;Both sides threatening to come to life but spending most of the time firmly behind the Iron Curtain of the half way line. Roll on the Glasnost and Perestroika of extra time and penalties.&quot; That would be a great anology, Andrew, except the only Zenit player&apos;s who&apos;s spent more than 30 seconds in his own half in this half is the goalkeeper, Vyacheslav Malafeev.  35 min: My PC takes three minutes to save and launch that small bit of text, during which time Steven Whittaker puts in two good tackles on Konstantin Zyrianov. Zenit are enjoying about 80% of the possession here, but they only chances they&apos;ve created thus far have been a couple of long-range pot-shots on goal.  37 min: &quot;Bet you wish you were covering Hull v Watford rather than this snoozefest,&quot; writes Bob Gill. &quot;It&apos;s 0-1 and Hull have got the wobblies.&quot; Thanks for the update, Bob. I&apos;ve had \u00a310 on Watford to go through in that game at 9-1. They were ridden senseless by the referee in the first leg and could have won ... or lost by five or six.  39 min: George Templeton has a high horse and somebody&apos;s just given him a leg up. &quot;Big Paper reporter Kevin McCarra may be right, but that doesn&apos;t change the fact that if Rangers win it will be a setback for world football because it will only encourage this kind of nullifying anti-football that Rangers practice so well,&quot; he writes. You may have a point, George, but the fact of the matter is they&apos;re going about winning a Uefa Cup in the only way a team as limited as they are can manage. Surely it&apos;s up to other teams to come up with a way of breaking them down and beating them.  43 min: Free-kick for Rangers, a couple of yards outside the Zenit box, well left of centre. Kevin Thomson fires it straight into the wall. That&apos;s their chance for this half wasted, only three more left before the penalty shoot-out starts.  45 min: Classic Rangers already; I reckon that they&apos;ll keep it tight and then start to come out of their shell during the 3rd or 4th penalty,&quot; writes Steve KDS. There&apos;ll be one minute of added time.  HALF-TIME: THAT&apos;S ONE HALF DOWN, THREE TO GO  News from an interesting football match &quot;Hull 1 (Barmby) - Watford 1&quot; writes Kevin Hastings. Bah!  Half-time analysis &quot;I have to disagree with Archi Campbell,&quot; writes Daniel Bainbridge. &quot;Your minute-by-minute report is an invaluable alternative to the true waste of time on offer tonight \u2013 ITV&apos;s Jon Champion wasting air time, as usual, with his pre-scripted soundbites and clich\u00e9s. One wonders whether he&apos;s got something worse up his sleeve than his semi-final &apos;Rangers are coming!&apos; effort.&quot; I&apos;d say you can count on it, Dan. I can assure you, however, that I have nothing up my sleeve except my arm. Scripting soundbites and cliches would involve effort. Not much effort, mind. But effort nonetheless.  Unlike Rangers, Archi Campbell is good on the counter-attack &quot;Jon Champion&apos;s improved his Peter Drury impression no end since the last time I heard it,&quot; he writes. &quot;It almost sounds like he is Peter Drury.&quot;  45 min: Having spent an entertaining 15 minutes watching the grass on the pitch grow, the assembled throng settle down to the comparatively tedious spectacle that is the second half. Zenit kick off.  47 min: For all the difference it&apos;ll make, Rangers&apos; lone frontman Jean Claude Darcheville is forced to leave the field of play to get a rogue stud screwed back into his boot. Assorted Rangers player dawdle to give him time to come back on, because without him there they&apos;ve nobody to hoof the ball in the general direction of. And then what would they do?  50 min: The camera pans to Pavel Pogrebnyiak, Zenit&apos;s star striker who&apos;s suspended tonight. He can feel hard done by, unlike Rangers striker Daniel Cousin who got suspended for being - to borrow a phrase from our Scottish friends - a bit of a numpty.  52 min: &quot;Your commentary is providing welcome respite from exam revision - although as I&apos;m studying climate change, it all seems the same: very slow, but in the end, ultimate doom,&quot; writes Kirsty Macleod.  55 min: Rangers have a half-decent shout for a penalty turned down when Barry Ferguson kicks the ball off Igor Denisov&apos;s arm, after Zenit goalkeeper, Vyacheslav Malafeev had fumbled a low, diagonal drive from Jean-Claude Darcheville. The ball was pinging around the Zenit penalty area and eventually went out of play off the upright.  56 min: &quot;Oh you Guardian elitists with your love of the beautiful game,&quot; scoffs Trevor Kenmure. &quot; You have no appreciation of the hoof and crunch. Unlike the Chinese commentators on Shanghai Gsports, who had a big laugh when Cuellar paneled Denisov a minute ago. You can&apos;t beat a well timed forearm smash.&quot; If I want to see well-timed forearm smashes, Trevor, I&apos;ll watch wrestling or gaelic football.  58 min: &quot;There&apos;s been a bit of a to-do in town in Manchester with the big screen at Piccadilly Gardens not working,&quot; writes Dave Maloney, with what I am guessing is thinly disguised jubilation. &quot;More interesting than the match? There were tens of thousands of people there who&apos;ve been moved on... the telly seems to suggest they&apos;ve been pushed north.&quot; Look out Blackpool!  60 min: Corner for Zenit St Petersburg. Andrei Arshavin pings it in towards the near post, where Carlos Cuellar heads it clear for another corner. When this one is sent in to the mixer, Neil Alexander punches it back out for a throw-in. It&apos;s taken and Rangers eventually clear.  62 min: Steven Whittaker finds himself in a couple of yards of space with the ball at his feet, prompting ITV commentator Peter Drury to lose the run of himself completely. &quot;WHITTAKER!!!&quot; he screams, as the midfielder pulls the trigger and sees a tame shot deflected off Zyrianov&apos;s foot and into Malafeev&apos;s arms.  65 min: Malafeev sends a long punt down towards Arshavin, which prompts Neil Alexander to charge out of his penalty area and miss it completely. With two defenders between him and the goalkeeper, Arshavin tries to chip it in under the crossbar, but Papac heads clear. Alexander deserves a bollocking for the rush of blood which prompted that moment of insanity, but credit for not taking down Arshavin and getting himself sent off.  67 min: Now Peter Drury is riffing about how &quot;the politics of Zenit might be questionable&quot;. As opposed to the politics of Rangers, which are not.  69 min: Zenit defender Alexander Anyukov appears to have twisted his ankle and is currently hobbling. His likely replacement, were he to be forced off, would be Rangers old boy Fernando Ricksen ... who once attended the Sporting Chance clinic for help with a drink problem, then moved to the home of vodka.  GOAL! Zenit St Petersburg 1-0 Rangers (Denisov 72) The Rangers defence is carved open. Zenit attacked down the right and got the ball into the centre, where Andrei Arshavin split the Rangers centre-halves with a through-ball that actaully went through Cuellar&apos;s legs for Denisov to run on to. The youngster only needed only one touch to slot it past Neil Alexander and into the Rangers goal.  74 min: What will Walter Smith do now that Plan A - don&apos;t concede any goals and hopefully score before they do - has been foiled? Another striker wouldn&apos;t go amiss, but at the moment he&apos;s in the dug-out struggling with the administration and paperwork.  76 min: Viktor Fayzulin - or some other Zenit player, I&apos;ve forgotten who already - misses a glorious opportunity to put his side two up. After more good work by Arshavin, the ball came to him about five yards out and he blasted it high and wide from a good position, when it looked easier for him to hit the target.  79 min: Rangers substitutions: Papac and Hemdani off, McCulloch and Novo on. Rangers switch from their 9-1-0 to a 4-3-3, with McCulloch playing as a centre-forward and Novo and Darcheville playing either side of him.  82 min: &quot;While you&apos;re complaining about having to deal with Peter Drury&apos;s screaming, spare a thought for us Scots who have to deal with Bluenose Archie MacPherson and his inspired pieces of commentary such as &apos;Woof!&apos;, &apos;Woooooooof&apos; and &apos;It&apos;s like we&apos;re on the San Andreas Fault!&apos;&quot; writes Phil Midddleton. Archie McPherson, eh? So that&apos;s who podcasting and TV&apos;s non-Sony Award-winner James Richardson has been copying.  84 min: A large, rectangular porcelain receptacle with a cast-iron tap at two of it&apos;s four corners makes its way into the Zenit penalty area - that&apos;s Rangers throwing the kitchen sink at their opponents. Actually, I tell a lie - it&apos;s more Kris Boyd-shaped. He comes on for Steven Whittaker, who&apos;s played well tonight. And before you all start typing in, I know most of you peasants probably have stainless steel kitchen sinks, but I prefer a classier porcelain number.  87 min: Corner for Zenit, who have sent one player forward to try and get on the end of it. He won&apos;t, because it&apos;s taken short, but David Weir dashes over, sticks out a leg and wins a throw-in off Arshavin. Weir then sends the ball on its way towards the halfway line.  89 min: Anatoly Tymoshuk tries a shot from distance which fizzes high over the bar.  90 min: Free-kick for Rangers, just inside their own half. They send everyone bar Alexander into the Zenit penalty area, but the ball is cleared. Rangers now have a throw-in deep in Zenit territory, which Barry Ferguson sends in long. The ball breaks for Nacho Novo on the edge of the six-yard box, but he sends a good scoring chance blazing high and wide. He then gives Lee McCulloch a dirty look because his fellow substitute inadvertently got in his way. At least that&apos;s Novo&apos;s story and he&apos;s sticking to it.  90+2 min: Zenit&apos;s goalkeeper Malafeev gets booked for time-wasting in the second of three minutes of injury time. Zenit substitution: Fayzulin off, Kim Dong Jin on.  GOAL! Zenit St Petersburg 2-0 Rangers (Zyrianov 90+3) Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Konstantin Zyrianov pokes the ball home from 18 inches out after another Andrei Arshavin-inspired move helps Zenit eviscerate the Rangers defence with some sublime short one-touch passing.  Peep! Peep! Peep!  It&apos;s all over. That goal was the last kick of the game and Dick Advocaat&apos;s Zenit St Petersburg are the 2007-08 Uefa Cup champions. The Rangers fans look suitably depressed in the stands, but there&apos;s no doubt that the better team won tonight. As the Zenit players, some of them carrying children (which I presume are their own) head up to get their medals from Michel Platini, it&apos;s time for me to say good night and thanks for your emails. Oh, and Hull beat Watford 4-1 (agg: 6-1). They&apos;ll duke it out with Bristol City to see who gets to enjoy the privilege of finishing bottom of the Premier League next season.", "tags": ["Europa League", "Rangers", "Zenit St Petersburg", "Football", "Sport", "Uefa Cup 2007-08"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-14T09:23:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/15/motogp.motorsports", "sentences": ["Not that I had that excuse in Shanghai, of course."], "title": "Talking to Suzi won't take my mind off the job", "article": "At around five to two on Sunday afternoon, I fully expect to be standing talking to the BBC&apos;s Suzi Perry on the grid at Le Mans. About two minutes later, I fully expect to have completely forgotten anything I&apos;ve just said. Every athlete gets themselves into a state of mental readiness before any race, and I&apos;m no different. Those interviews are part of my job, and I often get asked how I manage to cope with them. You see certain riders who aren&apos;t in any sort of mood to talk - their focus is on the race ahead, and they&apos;re just visualising that first corner, and the jostling for position that will, inevitably, decide how your afternoon is going to go. I&apos;m a little different. I can stand and chat away quite happily to someone such as Suzi because, on the outside, I seem perfectly normal and relaxed. On the inside, believe me, it isn&apos;t quite the same. I can answer all of the questions \u2013 &quot;how&apos;s the bike?&quot;, &quot;where do you hope to finish?&quot; and so forth - without taking my mind off what&apos;s in front of me. In fact, I get asked those questions so often I think I could answer most of them in my sleep (&quot;the bike is great, definitely capable of a podium spot&quot; and &quot;I go into every race to win&quot;, in case you haven&apos;t seen me up there before). Because of that I find answering them on the grid does little to affect my concentration, and I forget what I&apos;ve said almost immediately. After so long doing this job, I find it quite easy nowadays to get into &apos;the zone&apos; in the build-up to a race. For me it&apos;s quite simple - I need to spend time on my own beforehand, just quietly thinking about what lies ahead. I don&apos;t need any music to motivate me. I used to, but I found it altered my mood too much. If I was listening to something with a big beat, for example, that would really get my adrenaline going, and I could almost be too aggressive. If it was something slower, I&apos;d find I was too relaxed. So now I don&apos;t really listen to music; instead I find it easier to get into the right mental state almost at the flick of a switch. And the interviews with Suzi really don&apos;t affect that. She is a good friend of mine and knows what to ask and what not to ask on the grid, which really helps. I&apos;m also aware that everything I do (hopefully) raises the profile of my sport back home in the UK. With this being my first season in MotoGP - and my first season of on-the-grid interviews as a result - I&apos;m happy to do whatever I can to help out. Not that it did me much good in China. It goes without saying I was disappointed with my 12th place finish. Quite simply, with the weather changing so regularly, we took a gamble on how we set up the bike and it didn&apos;t pay off. I could tell within the first lap or two that it wasn&apos;t right. The suspension, for example, wasn&apos;t how I would have liked - but by then it&apos;s too late. At this level, that is more than enough to put you out of the top 10. Jorge Lorenzo has got a lot of praise for coming fourth with both ankles broken, and that took my mind back to a race exactly a decade ago where I raced with two screws in each ankle. It&apos;s definitely uncomfortable, but as the adrenaline kicks in you&apos;re OK - it&apos;s when you get off the bike at the end that it really begins to hurt. It is, though, an occupational hazard. Not that I had that excuse in Shanghai, of course. Another issue was that I found it quite tough on another new track. A lap in China took more than two minutes, compared to the normal length, which is somewhere around one minute 35 or 40 seconds. If you&apos;re learning a track for the first time then it means there is a lot more of it to remember. And if you&apos;re learning it in conditions that are completely different to those you end up racing in then it&apos;s pretty tough. It will be exactly the same this week in Le Mans - another track I haven&apos;t raced on before. Luckily my manager, Roger Burnett, has so I&apos;m hoping he will be able to give me a couple of hints and tips before we get there. It&apos;s been a busy couple of weeks as well, so I&apos;m glad to be getting back to what I like doing most. In the past week alone I&apos;ve gone from my house in Nice to Luxembourg, then Bologna, onto Venice, then through to Poland and finally onto Le Mans. It&apos;s been a hectic schedule. But doing the PR work that goes with doing the job I love is all part of it. And the same goes for my chat with Suzi on the grid - but don&apos;t worry, I know where my mind&apos;s really going to be.", "tags": ["MotoGP", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-15T14:23:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/may/17/genetics.health1", "sentences": ["In 2003 a team at the Shanghai Second Medical University fused human cells with rabbit eggs."], "title": "Q&A: Hybrid embryos", "article": "What is a human-animal embryo?  True hybrid embryos are the result of fertilising an egg with the sperm of another closely related species; for example, a mule is the hybrid offspring of a donkey and a horse. Chimeric embryos are made by injecting cells or genetic material from one species into the embryo of another. Scientists at Stanford University in California plan to use this technique to create a mouse with 10% human brain cells. The third type are human transgenic embryos, made by injecting a segment of animal DNA into a human egg. The fourth type of hybrid, the kind being developed in British universities, is called cytoplasmic. It is created by transferring the nuclei of human cells, such as skin cells, into animal eggs from which almost all the genetic information has been removed. The resulting embryo would contain only a tiny amount of animal DNA \u2013 around 0.1% \u2013 and the rest would be human. The embryo would be grown in a lab to a size of around 200 cells. Why create human-animal embryos?  Scientists developing these embryos say they will provide a plentiful source of stem cells \u2013 immature cells that can develop into many different types of tissue \u2013 for use in medical research. Researchers believe that, by producing stem cells carrying the genetic defects of diseases, they will be able to work out how a cell&apos;s molecular machinery goes awry and perhaps find new cures for diseases.  The research has been hampered by the severe shortage of &quot;spare&quot; human eggs donated by couples undergoing fertility treatment. By using animal eggs, which are far more readily available, British research teams hope to make more rapid progress. Their experiments have shown that the stem cells harvested from hybrid and chimeric embryos behave identically to human ones. Who are the scientists?  A team led by Professor Stephen Minger, director of the stem cell biology laboratory at King&apos;s College London, has been offered a licence by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to use human-bovine embryos to study degenerative neurological diseases such as Parkinson&apos;s and Alzheimer&apos;s. Dr Lyle Armstrong, of the North-east England Stem Cell Institute, Newcastle University, has a licence to use cow eggs to research replacement tissues for use in treating conditions such as diabetes and spinal paralysis. His team has successfully created such embryos: one developed for three days until it had 32 cells. The research has not yet been published, but the team plans to submit the work for peer-review in the next few months. A third team, led by Professor Ian Wilmut, the Edinburgh-based creator of the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, wants to create human-rabbit embryos to develop treatments for motor neurone disease, although the team has yet to apply for a licence. What are the objections?  There were 300 responses to the government consultation, with 277 opposed to the research, many of them from pro-life groups opposed to any intrusive study of embryos. Many Catholics object to the idea of mixing human and animal DNA within the same entity and to the notion of creating what they regard as a life for the purposes of research \u2013 a life that will then be destroyed. Cardinal Keith O&apos;Brien denounced the research as experiments of &quot;Frankenstein proportion&quot;.  But some scientists are also sceptical. Professor Sir John Gurdon, a Cambridge University researcher who has injected human DNA into frogs&apos; eggs, told the Guardian: &quot;Scientifically ... I&apos;m not persuaded it will work. If you put cells from one species into the egg of another, the egg may divide, but you could get a lot of genetic abnormality that won&apos;t lead to good-quality stem cells.&quot; What does the law say?  The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 does not clearly set out the parameters of human-animal embryo research. The HFEA approved such research after it decided that the embryos being created were in effect human and thus fell under the remit of the current law. However, if the HFEA were to decide hybrid embryos were not human, the research would fall outside the law and escape regulation. The human fertilisation and embryology bill will define the parameters of embryo research. It proposes that hybrid embryos could not legally be implanted into a woman&apos;s womb, or an animal&apos;s. What is the situation in other countries?  Chinese scientists were reportedly the first to successfully create human-animal embryos. In 2003 a team at the Shanghai Second Medical University fused human cells with rabbit eggs. The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory dish before being destroyed to harvest their stem cells. Later that same year, a US scientist, Panayiotis Zavos, announced he had created &quot;human-cow&quot; embryos that lived for around a fortnight and could theoretically have been implanted into a woman&apos;s womb.  In 2004 researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota produced pigs with hybrid pig-human blood cells. In 2005 Parkinson&apos;s disease researchers at the Salk Institute in San Diego reported they had created mice with 0.01% human cells by injecting about 100,000 human embryonic stem cells per mouse. Last year a Yale researcher, Eugene Redmond, led a project injecting millions of human neural stem cells into the brains of monkeys afflicted with Parkinson&apos;s disease.

Taxi-maker Manganese Bronze said this morning that its joint venture in Shanghai has now landed orders for 3,000 TX4s, its latest cab model, for delivery over the next three years. This is equivalent to the company&apos;s total production of cabs at its Coventry plant last year, a company spokesman said. They are thought to have been sold to customers in several regions, including eastern Europe, South America and the Middle East. Chief executive John Russell cited Mexico City as a key target market last year, where there are over 100,000 unlicensed taxis. But the company declined to say who the customers are \u2013 except that they are not based in China or the UK \u2013 claiming this could harm its chances to secure further sales. The joint venture with China&apos;s Geely Automotive, called Shanghai LTI, is meant to help Manganese cut costs and expand its international business. In 2006 it only sold 92 cabs abroad.  The subsequent credit crunch has made these international ambitions more important. Taxi drivers have long profited from City firms, whose offices traditionally sport a long line of black cabs ready to take staff home after a long day, on expenses.

The retailer also outlined plans to start selling branded food alongside its M&amp;S own-label ranges, and said it was keen to re-establish a presence in France, seven years after closing down its Paris store. The retailer, which has more than 600 British stores and 21 million customers a week, reported annual profits up 4.3% at \u00a31.007bn. The last time the retailer made more than \u00a31bn was in 1998, but the business then went into freefall amid boardroom rows and disastrous sales. M&amp;S is now being battered by rising household bills and declining consumer confidence, and is not expected to make another \u00a31bn next year. Guidance it issued to City analysts yesterday suggest \u00a3100m will be wiped off the bottom line in the coming year.

He said M&amp;S was determined to carry on investing for the future, opening stores in Britain and overseas and expanding its online business. The first weeks of the new financial year had been &quot;mixed, with a difficult April followed by a &quot;marked improvement&quot; in May. The shares, which peaked at 759p last April, closed down 21p at 396p. Despite making \u00a31bn profit, the retailer missed its internal sales and profits targets. As a result bonuses to staff are being slashed from \u00a391m to \u00a316m. The 62,000 store staff will receive up to \u00a3250 each, down from \u00a3500 each last year. All bonuses at head office have been axed, apart from staff in the online and international divisions, who will share \u00a33.8m. The group&apos;s directors, including Rose, who last year received a \u00a32.6m bonus, will not receive performance-related payouts. Rose said the store had slashed clothing prices last year and was &quot;now offering customers better value than at any time in the last decade&quot;. Prices of general merchandise were down 6%. Rose said he now intended to focus more on the higher priced ranges such as Autograph and Limited Collection. The retailer hopes to increase its share of the grocery market from 4.3% to 5% and plans to open 70 Simply Food outlets this year. It is to start stocking brand name foods from next month. About 350 &quot;must-have brands&quot; will be tested in 19 stores in the north-east, including Marmite, Weetabix, Stella Artois and Tabasco sauce. It has launched a new advertising campaign for food, with the emphasis on value. The online business is growing fast, up 60% in the past year. Rose intends the website to generate \u00a3500m of sales by 2010. Overseas, the retailer now operates 278 stores in 40 countries, including new outlets in Libya, Ukraine and Saudi Arabia. It has recently done deals to open substantial numbers of stores in India, Greece and eastern Europe and will open its first outlet in Shanghai in the autumn. Rose said he would also like to reopen in France. &quot;If we could find the right sized store in Paris, we would take it,&quot; he said. Analysts were divided on the figures. David Jeary at Investec said the \u00a31bn profit was &quot;unlikely to be a springboard to greater things in the current difficult consumer environment&quot;, but added that the group &quot;remains one of the increasingly small handful of retailers with substantial and quality asset backing&quot;. Tony Shiret at Credit Suisse said: &quot;This is in our view the classic M&amp;S &apos;wait and hope&apos; type of statement.&quot; He said he believed M&amp;S is &quot;significantly overstocked&quot; and the chain &quot;needs a major improvement in its fortunes to hit the levels of profit that we believe it is guiding the market to today (\u00a3890-900m)&quot;.  This month Shiret urged Marks &amp; Spencer to &quot;get real&quot; about the credit crunch, saying Rose&apos;s strategy was &quot;at best challenged and at worst failed&quot;. He urged the company to stop buying back shares and to reconsider its overseas expansion plans. He forecast profits could fall to nearer \u00a3750m in 2009/10.

The show&apos;s subject, over and above the medium and conventions of photography, is really ourselves, in a multitude of guises. Grace Kelly jumps in the air for Philippe Halsman&apos;s camera in 1955. Weegee jumped, and so did Marilyn, and now they&apos;re suspended forever. David Bailey throws himself to the floor to photograph Veruschka, while Bert Stern nabs them both in an arty 1960s image. Last year South African photographer Pieter Hugo shot Nigerian Abdullahi Mohammed beneath an elevated section of highway in Lagos. Abdullahi holds a muzzled hyena on a chain. The moment is full of power and danger. Caught on camera, a well-groomed lawyer on the corner of West 41st Street totes his laundry and eyes Joel Sternfeld warily in 1988. The world feels full. From beginning to end of this compendious and not altogether successful show, like a kind of insistent background din, is the roar of the city. You can hear it above the silence of the images themselves - in the clatter of a Paris street in the rain by Alfred Stieglitz, in the footsteps of commuters heading for work in Paul Strand&apos;s 1915 Wall Street, in the drunken shouts and murmurs of Boris Mikhailov&apos;s alcoholics. The exhibition calls itself an urban history of photography, and it takes us from mid-19th century Paris and London to present-day Shanghai and Mexico City. In many respects, it covers familiar territory: histories of photography are 10 a penny. Some of the work here just feels unnecessary. The city, after all, is where the people are. It&apos;s where the business is, where photographers have mostly earned their living, some taking street life as their subject, others in the studio, with their controlled lighting and fanciful backdrops. But the street is a studio, too. And there&apos;s traffic all day up and down the stairs to the studio. With its chance encounters, its collisions of class and circumstance, the street has provided inspiration for the photographer, the artist and the writer since at least the 19th century. One of the first images in this show is an 1863 portrait of Charles Baudelaire, who stares out from the beautiful tonal gradations of his formal photographic portrait with an uncontainable look, and as though he&apos;d like to climb out of the picture - probably to borrow some money. In his famous essay, The Painter of Modern Life, Baudelaire identified the quintessential, heroic figure of 19th-century urban life: the fl\u00e2neur, &quot;the impassioned observer&quot;, who feels &quot;at home in the waves of the crowd, in movement, in the fugitive and the infinite&quot;. This attitude worked for Brassa\u00ef on his long nocturnal walks, and for Henri Cartier-Bresson, ever alert for his decisive moments in Paris, Mexico and Seville. Catalan photographer Joan Colom&apos;s marvelously atmospheric nocturnal images capture the prostitutes, drunks and sleaze of Barcelona&apos;s El Raval neighbourhood in Franco&apos;s Spain. Colom just had to walk to the corner and look; the world is always there. At the turn of the 20th-century, Louis Vert photographed a set of images, the Small Tradespeople and Vagrants of Paris - rag pickers, glaziers, tinsmiths. In the 1870s, John Thomson compiled image after image of picaresque Londoners - &quot;the Dramatic Shoe-Black, &apos;Caney&apos; the Clown, and the Temperance Sweep&quot;. All conform to the malodorous music-hall type: folkloric they may have seemed, but what they really were was desperately poor. For his project People of the 20th Century, August Sander later itemised the organist, the war veteran, the washerwomen and the worker&apos;s gaunt children. There are people struggling with panniers, bowed by immense loads, people just off the bus, people pretending to be other people, people trying to be themselves (the last being the trickiest of all to pull off). Juergen Teller in Go-Sees (1998-1999) photographed prospective models sent by their agents to come calling at his door. He shot them framed in his west London doorway, caught between anonymity and potential fame, looking apprehensive, disarmed and disconcerted. They are types to the same degree as Friedrich Seidenst\u00fccker&apos;s burly workmen. In fact, it is impossible to avoid the feeling that one is looking at people acting out roles for the camera just as much as they are being themselves. When Teller has photographed me, he has rattled and goaded me into behaving in extreme and theatrical ways, and it was through this that a sort of photographic candour emerged. For all the stagey artificiality of his photographs of debutantes, society beauties and grande dames, Cecil Beaton managed to coax something wonderful from the likes of Wanda Baillie-Hamilton and Lady Bridget Poulett as they posed in a world of tin-foil, cardboard, balloons and cellophane. There was no Photoshop, no Botox: glamour couldn&apos;t be airbrushed in. Today, we question the veracity of the images we see, but photographs have always been calculated, manufactured in some way. Their light is engineered, their tones and surface qualities a matter of choice. &quot;The ubiquity of image-making has created the visual equivalent of white noise,&quot; Michael Bracewell writes in the exhibition catalogue. But we are accustomed to seeing through this perpetual blizzard of static. What we find there is the ghost in the machine: ourselves. Here we are then, in all our vainglory, posed, rehearsed, interrupted, caught off guard, spied on, framed and captured, the willing and unwilling participants in this game of images. At one extreme, we have the playacting of Cecil Beaton or Robert Mapplethorpe, with his man in a rubber suit and restrictive breathing apparatus. At the other, the corpse on the pavement, leaking blood into the gutter, in Mexican Manuel Alvarez Bravo&apos;s 1934 Striking Worker, Assassinated. It&apos;s hard not to think, looking at this supine and bloody corpse, not to think of Eduard Manet&apos;s dead matador. In 1946 Lee Miller photographed the Fascist ex-Prime Minister of Hungary, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e1rdossy, as he faced the firing squad in Budapest. He stands below us in a courtyard against the sandbags. It occurred to me that he is maintaining his dignity, not daring to break down or plead for mercy, precisely because he knows he is being photographed. He&apos;s being shot for posterity, after all. Everyone likes looking at photographs and almost everyone collects them in one way or another. Most of us enjoy taking them and appearing in them. Photographs are personal as well as public. Often, they tell us things we know but ignore. In 2000, Wolfgang Tillmans insinuated his camera between the colliding bodies on crowded London Underground trains. The images are a wealth of accidental, fragmentary intimacies. Strap-hangers&apos; armpits fill the frame, bulging cloth and a cleavage, bits of bodies and attitudes of studied indifference. The best of these images defamiliarise the world for us, making it more mysterious rather than explaining it. Something strange happens in a 1928 view of the street by Umbo (Otto Umbehr). The camera looks straight down from a balcony. People pass by below, casting long afternoon shadows on the street. The shadows appear more real and substantial than the figures they belong to, as if they have lives of their own, and might slip away from their owners at any second. Setting up an image like this in the studio could produce only something ersatz and artificial. Umbo found it on the street, lit by sunlight. It is a haunting image, one that makes us feel insubstantial. If only the rest of the show was this good. \u00b7 Street &amp; Studio is at Tate Modern, London SE1, tomorrow until August 31.

Two Chinese sons of a London bus driver grow up on a Croydon council estate. One makes a fortune by staying in south London. The other achieves fame by moving to his parents&apos; homeland on the other side of the world. Throw in a mysterious grandfather, an Asian financial crisis, a divorce, a child and several jobs, and what you get is the thoroughly modern, globally complicated life of Edward Law. A familiar face on the English channel of state-run Chinese Central Television, where he presents a leading business programme, Law&apos;s accent and passport are British, but Beijing is home. The 35-year-old returned to the land of his parents for many reasons: because he is an international businessman and this is the land of opportunity; because he is influenced by Confucian traditions and believes his move made his grandfather happy; and because of a disillusioned father who always wondered what might have been had he stayed in China. And not least because of a rivalry with his older brother, Richard, who built a property portfolio and owns a country estate near Gatwick. &quot;When we were children, he always used to beat me in Monopoly and we laugh that now he does the same in real life,&quot; grins Edward. And migration is in the blood. Law is a Hakka, a culturally distinct group often persecuted in China, so willing to venture overseas for a new life. Three of his four grandparents were Hakka and grew up in the villages of the New Territories in the 60s and early 70s, when it was the poorest area of Hong Kong and the biggest source of migrants to Britain. The family&apos;s move to Britain started in 1961 and continued throughout the next decade. His mother arrived in 1966 to work in a Chinese restaurant. She was the eldest of nine siblings, almost all of whom moved to Dover where they pooled resources to buy their first takeaway. Other ventures followed. Law&apos;s paternal grandfather, born in Shanghai, had lost his trucking business when the communists took power in 1949. That forced his move to Hong Kong, then Britain, where he worked in a restaurant. His son, Law&apos;s father, was a driver for London Transport. &quot;We used to watch [TV comedy] On the Buses. He thought it was hilarious, just like reality ... people always skiving off, drinking tea and wasting time&quot; - a culture shock after Hong Kong. The neighbours on their Croydon estate were friendly enough, but Law found that racism was a fact of life outside. &quot;I think that is a large part of the reason I am in China - I felt that the message was that foreigners are not welcome.&quot; China was a distant but reassuring presence. Then, in 1986, an uncle took him to Hong Kong. His first encounter with the mainland, on a trip to Shenzhen, left a deep impression.  &quot;When people say the word &apos;motherland&apos;, it sounds strange, but it made sense,&quot; he recalls. &quot;When I took that first step into China, I had a sense of peace.&quot; In 1990, he enrolled at Leeds University to do a BA in Modern Chinese Studies, which included a year&apos;s language study in Beijing. After graduating, he moved to Hong Kong. &quot;I really started enjoying myself and getting into this idea of being Chinese.&quot; In 1998, when the Asian financial crisis hit, Law was a futures trader in Hong Kong. In two days, he lost a large sum of money. &quot;I had the feeling of wanting to throw myself off a building.&quot; His brother called him back to Britain and his family stepped in to help him cover his losses, but by 2001 he was feeling the tug of the motherland and its huge business opportunities. &quot;A friend told me I must come to Beijing. It&apos;s the place.&quot; Law has been there ever since. He has his career in television, and a child, although he is now divorced. He still feels connected by blood. &quot;My future is inextricably tied to China. I have a four-year-old son who will live here and be a part of this new China.&quot; Even so, identity remains a complex matter: &quot;I ask myself, how far can I go in this society as an outsider?&quot;  \u00b7 Interview by Jonathan Watts Rabbi Walter Rothschild, 54From Bradford to Berlin &quot;I&apos;ll never know the whole story,&quot; says Rabbi Walter Rothschild, describing how his grandfather, also called Walter, was rounded up in November 1938 with all the other Jewish men of his town, Baden-Baden, and sent to Dachau concentration camp. He managed to get out a year later (Rothschild believes his grandmother, Charlotte, bribed somebody) but suffered permanently from brain tumours and disabilities as a result of the beatings from his Nazi tormentors. He died in the 50s of his injuries.  His son, Edgar, had earlier been sent to safety from Nazi Germany as a 15-year-old; he ended up in Bradford as a refugee and classed as an &quot;enemy alien&quot; because of his German passport. He learned English by reading detective novels with a dictionary and met his Bradford-born Jewish wife Esther at a summer school of the Youth Association of Synagogues in Great Britain. Walter Louis, who was born to Edgar and Esther in Yorkshire in 1954, was always aware of his origins. &quot;I knew I was named after my grandfather, and I knew I had a foreign name because I came from Germany and I knew that Daddy had left Germany because of the Nazis,&quot; says Rothschild, over mugs of Yorkshire tea and biscuits in his flat in Berlin, where he now lives. &quot;But I was never taught to think of Germany as a dreadful country,&quot; he adds. &quot;To me it was a place of big adventure.&quot; At school, &quot;all the other kids were called John Robinson or Robert Smith and they took their holidays in Bridlington or Blackpool, whereas I was called Walter Rothschild and we took our holidays in Lugano or Baden-Baden,&quot; he recalls. &quot;It was obvious to me that we were different.&quot; He associated Germany with the three-day minibus ride there, with German locomotives, the Black Forest, with the exotic apple juice, mustard and herring salad that they brought home. &quot;The Holocaust is something that is with me every second of every day, but when I was a child we didn&apos;t go to concentration camps,&quot; he stresses. &quot;Father would say: &apos;That&apos;s where the synagogue was&apos;, or &apos;That&apos;s where the cantor lived&apos;, or &apos;There used to be a sign saying, Jews are not allowed here,&apos; ... the Holocaust was always there but as part of the background scenery.&quot; He also learned &quot;that not all Germans were Nazis and not all Nazis were Germans&quot;. Before starting his theology degree at Cambridge University in the 70s, Rothschild combined his love of Germany with his love of trains, spending six months in Hamburg working in a signal box for the German railways. This was not something that his fellow members of the Jewish Society at Cambridge were able to relate to. &quot;I was the only one who wasn&apos;t scared of Germany,&quot; he says, &quot;while most of my contemporaries were of the view that you don&apos;t buy a Mercedes, or a Siemens fridge.&quot; It is his openness from an early age towards the country that had persecuted his forefathers that allowed him to take the decision 12 years ago to switch from working as a rabbi in Leeds and Bradford, to Berlin, where the growing and ever more challenging array of Jewish communities - whose fastest-growing section comes from the former Soviet states - are desperately short of rabbis. &quot;We dithered as to whether we should go,&quot; he admits. &quot;My ex-wife&apos;s late father had been an Auschwitz survivor, so she had more difficulties with the idea than me.&quot; He took up a post in 1995 and, despite his initial lack of German, he decided to stay. &quot;I had a strong feeling, which is hard to explain, that this is where I belong and this is where I&apos;m needed and the &apos;boss&apos; wants me here.&quot; He finds working as a rabbi for Germany&apos;s diverse Jewish communities &quot;physically exhausting, [but] mentally very stimulating&quot;. He is helping the new communities to acquire everything from Torahs to cemeteries, trying to restore some small part of that which his grandparents&apos; generation witnessed being destroyed. He is also trying to compile his own family&apos;s history - boxes of it fill the shelves of his flat. &quot;There will always be gaps,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&apos;m trying hard to piece them all together.&quot; \u00b7 Interview by Kate Connolly Vanda Moscardini, 62From Glasgow to Barga, Tuscany Vanda Moscardini can recall the moment she began to float between two cultures. It was her first day at the Convent of Mercy school in Glasgow. She was four and a half years old, and the nuns had set her an aptitude test. &quot;I left the book with nothing done in it. The nuns thought I had something wrong with me.&quot; In fact, she could not speak English. &quot;We all spoke Italian at home. My grandmother got through most of her life in Scotland speaking very little English,&quot; she recalls. We are sitting at the table of her ice-cream parlour in the walled Tuscan hill town of Barga, from which her father and her mother&apos;s parents both emigrated and where today she is known as la signora scozzese (the Scottish lady). Moscardini&apos;s grandparents all arrived in Britain after the first world war. &quot;They were simple people from the mountains around Barga. My grandfather on my mother&apos;s side was a cobbler. He was one of the first to make old-fashioned Italian ice-cream in Scotland, served in &apos;pokey hats&apos;. That&apos;s what they called cones in those days. My grandfather on my father&apos;s side was more a man of means. He had land in Italy and I don&apos;t think he farmed it. He went into the fish and chip trade.&quot;  After school, she did a secretarial course at Glasgow Technical College and then got a job with an engineering firm. In 1969, she married a man from Barga who had come to work in Glasgow and they started to build what they originally conceived as a holiday retreat back in his home town. &quot;In 1976, he decided to go home. And I emigrated,&quot; she says. &quot;I felt I was going into an adventure. Our children were still of nursery age, so it didn&apos;t disrupt their education. If we&apos;d moved a few years later, it would have been disastrous for them.&quot;  Speaking to others - and there are several in Barga - who have gone back to their families&apos; roots, you notice a difference. Some refer to Scotland as &quot;back home&quot;. Others say &quot;over there&quot;. Moscardini repeatedly crosses and re-crosses this invisible, linguistic frontier. &quot;When I&apos;m in Scotland I say &apos;back home&apos; about Italy and when I&apos;m here I feel at home in Barga&quot;, she says. &quot;Barga has welcomed me. &quot;Perhaps there was more bigotry back home. We lived in a Protestant part of Glasgow, near St George&apos;s Cross. And it wasn&apos;t always friendly. The Catholic holidays of obligation were particularly difficult, when we were playing outside and the Protestant children were going to school. I was embarrassed about my name. I&apos;d turn Moscardini into Moss. Even in the companies where I worked I was always &apos;the Italian girl&apos;.&quot; Are there things she misses now? &quot;Something always ties you to the other country,&quot; she says. &quot;I still have my mother and sister there. But apart from my family, I don&apos;t know what I miss. Perhaps dressing up on a Saturday night to go out for an evening meal. It&apos;s more formal, and more fun, back home. &quot;Would I go back? Well, it&apos;s not in my plans. But then I never thought I&apos;d come to live in Italy. Life is funny. It takes funny routes. Never say never.&quot; \u00b7 Interview by John Hooper Andrew Kasrils, 43From Golders Green to Johannesburg  In 1987, when Andrew Kasrils was 22, he volunteered to fight for the African National Congress in South Africa. It was, he acknowledges, a romantic decision for a north Londoner to make - but he had a romantic example to follow. Both his parents had been politically active in South Africa before coming to England. His mother had been one of the first people detained without trial under the apartheid regime&apos;s notorious 90-day rule; she had managed to escape - disguised as a boy. His father, a leading member of the South African Communist party and a founding member of the armed wing of the ANC, was known as the &quot;red pimpernel&quot; in the apartheid years because he was so skilled at using disguise to evade capture by security services (he is now the country&apos;s intelligence chief). So Kasrils left the family home in Golders Green and trained in Angola for two years in preparation for his return to the &quot;home&quot; he had never seen. It didn&apos;t seem strange to him, he says, because as part of a sizeable exiled South African community in London, he and his brother had always hung out with other ANC kids. South Africa, he says, was always in the background of his London childhood, along with the telephone threats and MI5&apos;s uncovering of a plot to wipe out the family. As his training was coming to an end, the South African Defence Force invaded Angola. The fighting was bloody and many people were killed, but Kasrils survived, and returned to the UK. When the ANC&apos;s breakthrough did eventually come - with the ban on the organisation being lifted and the release of Nelson Mandela - it caught Kasrils by surprise. It was decision time. He had never been to South Africa, although there was no technical reason why not. He and his younger brother, Christopher, had been invited out often enough by relatives still living there, but, he says with a touch of indignation: &quot;It would have been like saying, &apos;Let&apos;s go to Nazi Germany for a holiday.&apos;&quot; And so, with the ANC victory assured, he opted to stay in London.  In the end, it was reggae, not politics, that took him to the country his parents were born in. He had been into the London reggae scene since his teens and when he finally visited South Africa to see what it was like, he found himself quickly caught up in the music scene. First, he helped produce an album supporting the ANC in the 1994 elections. Then a friend asked him to stand in for a session as a DJ on a Soweto community radio station. He played some dancehall reggae he had brought from London and the station&apos;s switchboard was jammed.  The ANC also offered him a job in foreign affairs, and he took it. But the music scene was exploding around him, and he wanted to be part of it. A club night he started in Johannesburg&apos;s Rocky Street on Thursday nights became the focus of a reincarnation of Sophiatown - the legendary cultural centre of the 1950s and 1960s. Kasrils had to carry a suit in the boot of his car, playing the DJ until the early hours and then hurriedly changing to get to the foreign office by 7am. Eventually, he gave up the day job.  Kasrils is now a celebrity in Johannesburg: the Thursday night sessions are still going on, he started acting, cut his own albums and is now branching out into film-making. But he hasn&apos;t changed much. He still has London in his voice and tries every year to make a pilgrimage there, to watch the Gunners kick off the season, to see Hendon play and to join in the Notting Hill Carnival.  Over the past couple of years, he confesses, touching down in South Africa feels more like coming home than touching down in London. &quot;I identify with South Africa,&quot; he says. &quot;The black people in a place like Soweto are like your typical working-class Londoners - the same irreverent humour and outlook on life, the cheekiness, the getting pissed at the local when you&apos;re out of work. &quot;But you know there is a fucked-up side to South Africa as well. This place is scarred. You have no idea, until you&apos;ve been in the developing world, what poverty is about. Thankfully, because of the music I have been able to get to know the rich, cultural life of South Africa.&quot; \u00b7 Interview by David Beresford  Amelia Bandlish, 41From Walton-on-Thames to Delhi &quot;What I do miss is the driving,&quot; says Amelia Bandlish, recalling how she would enjoy taking off in her car from her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, a pleasure too risky to contemplate in Delhi, where traffic is &quot;so disrespectful of any rules and regulations&quot;. Instead, she has a chauffeur. Which is nice, except that it makes you confront an aspect of middle-class life in India that growing up in England doesn&apos;t quite prepare you for - the dependence on servants. For nearly a year after Bandlish moved to Delhi in 2005 with her husband Sanjiv and their two young children, the family also employed a live-in maid. &quot;We lost our privacy,&quot; says Bandlish. &quot;Moreover, we&apos;ve always encouraged our kids to do their own work, but with a full-time maid around, they expected to be served even a glass of water. This was not how we wanted to live.&quot; Out went the live-in maid, to be replaced by a part-time cleaner in the mornings and a cook in the evenings. The Bandlishes religiously sit down for supper at 5pm, rather than 9pm or 10pm like most middle-class Indians. And the food on the table isn&apos;t Indian; it&apos;s English. &quot;I miss the eating out in England, the roast and the ham and the variety of cheeses,&quot; Bandlish says. &quot;I don&apos;t like spicy food. This is hilarious, isn&apos;t it?&quot; Bandlish was born in Bristol in June 1967 and was named after the daughter of English friends of her parents. &quot;My older brother and I owe the fact of our being British entirely to my parents&apos; aim to provide the best education for their children,&quot; she says. Schools in Britain, her parents felt, were the best. So the couple moved from India to Bristol, where her father did a PhD in structural engineering. Her mother worked as a secretary in an office overlooking the city&apos;s imposing Clifton College, announcing to her colleagues that one day her son, a toddler she had left behind in Delhi, would study there.  &quot;My mother&apos;s boss mocked her, since a secretary did not make the sort of money to send her son to Clifton College,&quot; says Bandlish. The boss was proved wrong. Bandlish&apos;s brother did go to Clifton before moving to Rugby, while Bandlish later studied at Clifton High School for Girls and then Roedean. &quot;While I look Indian, I know many people I run into here see me as different. Maybe it&apos;s my accent, maybe it&apos;s my attitude to life. To be honest, I still don&apos;t know where I belong,&quot; Bandlish says. &quot;In India, I have problems understanding the way religion is practised, for instance. Women are worshipped as goddesses, but mistreated and beaten at home. There&apos;s no respect for time either. &quot;But living in India has also taught me to be a lot more patient and tolerant,&quot; she observes. The decision to relocate to the land of their parents was made in somewhat dramatic circumstances by Bandlish and her husband, a satellite TV broadcast engineer who was also born in England. &quot;I remember the day vividly,&quot; recalls Bandlish. &quot;First we heard that a friend in London had been diagnosed with tongue cancer. Then we got the news that another close friend holidaying in Thailand had drowned. It really jolted us. Suddenly we were overwhelmed by questions - what are we doing here? Are we really enjoying life? Are we getting enough time as a family? Are we working too hard just to pay the mortgage and maintain our lifestyle? &quot;I sat up the whole night checking on schools in Delhi on the internet,&quot; she adds. She discovered that the British School in Delhi offered the International Baccalaureate, something Bandlish wanted for her children: &quot;It costs a quarter of what an equivalent school would charge in London.&quot; Life, she says, &quot;just changed overnight&quot;. Within months the family made the move. She had worked in lingerie sales in Britain, and set up an e-business selling imported lingerie. More than two years later, Bandlish believes they made the right decision. &quot;I feel Britain has peaked, things are now going down,&quot; she says. &quot;Whereas despite all its problems, India is moving ahead really, really fast. We want to be part of the future. &quot;If someone said to me today, &apos;Do you wanna go back?&apos;, I&apos;d say, &apos;No!&apos; I know India can sometimes be frustrating, but it&apos;ll get there. I want to be here when it does&quot;. \u00b7 Interview by Maseeh Rahman", "tags": ["Immigration and asylum", "UK news", "Social trends", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-21T23:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/may/23/elevatorpitchilohosplayfor", "sentences": ["Founded and chaired by businessman and frequent flyer Richard Archer-Perkins in June last year, the site employs ten people at its bases in Shanghai and Hong Kong.", "We&apos;re just finishing work on the technology to provide advertisers with extremely targeted advertising solutions, and are in discussions with interested airlines.&quot; \u2022 What&apos;s your background?&quot;I qualified as a chartered accountant from Deloitte &amp; Touche, and from there headed a number of firms including my own import and export company ET2C in Shanghai.", "If you come to Shanghai you can meet me at The Long Bar and I&apos;ll tell you all about it!&quot; \u2022 Where do you want the company to be in five years?&quot;In five years&apos; time I&apos;d like us to be the top networking and travel planning platform for travellers worldwide, offering unrivalled advertising solutions and at the forefront of cutting-edge web and travel technologies.&quot; \u2022 Are you the next big thing?&quot;We hope so!"], "title": "Elevator Pitch: iloho's play for the travel community", "article": "The latest candidate for the niche social networking space is iloho, which hopes to combine travel services with community features.

It was from author Simon Winchester - who really should know better. It was in the New York Times rather than the Daily Telegraph, but the genre was the same. Why oh why, he pontificated, &quot;if the Chinese had come to know so much about earthquakes so early on in their immensely long history, were they never able to minimize the effects of the world&apos;s contortions - to at least the degree that America has? Why did they leave the West to become leaders in the field, and leave themselves to become mired, time and again, in the kind of tragic events that we are witnessing this week?&quot; China, he lamented, &quot;in its headlong attempts to modernize, has often demonstrated a dismayingly cavalier attitude toward the well-being of its people: skyscrapers are built with little attention to safety standards and are invariably far from earthquake-resistant; huge dams ... are erected in a slapdash fashion; subways, like the system burrowing through the waterlogged alluvium beneath Shanghai, are built with incautious haste; freeway tunnels are bored through earthquake fault zones.&quot; Now while I would certainly question Beijing&apos;s weak attachment to human rights, and lament that progress there can mean a bullet in the neck instead of the death of a thousand cuts, it really does not behoove the people who gave us the Minnesota bridge, the collapsing apartment blocks of New York, the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown, to sermonise about this disaster. While the Three Gorges dam is very likely a disaster waiting to happen, how many American dams are in a similar position? A lot. Should the society which kept people at gunpoint from fleeing New Orleans across a bridge during Hurricane Katrina really have the chutzpah to hector the Chinese? Should a society that uses taxpayers&apos; money to build non-hurricane proof homes on the coast in flood zones really lecture Beijing? No more, one suspects, than Army Corp of Engineers who have carved the Mississippi basin into a series of serial disasters-in waiting. Within a week of the Winchester whine a British coroner reported that the Nimrod aircraft the RAF had been flying had been unsafe for four decades. One only has to think of the appropriately Thatcheresquely-named Herald of Free Enterprise ferry that drowned so many passengers, to remember the Cumbrian nuclear reactor whose name keeps changing to induce forgetfulness about its sequential radioactive leaks. China has launched humans into space. Britain, unlike Japan, China and India, has no independent launch facility, and has cut back its commitment to the European programme. It has recently been forced to pull out of science programmes because of government cuts. So why oh why, the &quot;Why oh Why&quot; whine? Simon Winchester has an excuse. He is clearly plugging his new biography of Joseph Needham, the magisterial author of the Cambridge History of Chinese Science. But one suspects that Winchester&apos;s subject would not have been so disdainful of modern China. His biographical work should have helped him to &quot;see oursel&apos;s as others see us&quot;.

Terence Stamp, Jack O&apos;Halloran and Sarah Douglas have fun as the superhoods, and Margot Kidder&apos;s Lois Lane is back again. Mean Girls (Mark S Waters, 2004) 9pm, Channel 4 The dark side of high-school life is explored with chilling precision in this superior comedy. It stars Lindsay Lohan as Cady, a 15-year-old brought up in Africa by anthropologist parents and now transplanted to a gruesome Chicago educational institution where the terrifying &quot;plastics&quot; - a cute-looking, utterly evil gang - rule the roost. Frightening fun. Be Cool (F Gary Gray, 2005) 10pm, ITV1 The return of Chili Palmer, 10 years after John Travolta first played the Miami loan shark turned Hollywood wheeler-dealer in Get Shorty. Despite being adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel, and the presence of Uma &quot;I&apos;ve Finally Killed Bill&quot; Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Vince Vaughn among the starry cast, it&apos;s a colourless follow-up; as Chili himself says, &quot;I hate sequels.&quot; An Officer And A Gentleman (Taylor Hackford, 1982) 10.50pm, Channel 4 Richard Gere saunters through gruelling training to fly navy planes but is scared of being taken for a ride by Debra Winger&apos;s gutsy factory girl. Does she really love him, or would any immaculately uniformed top gun do? A silly but very watchable romance. Blind Flight (John Furse, 2003) 12.05am, BBC2 They don&apos;t come much more claustrophobic than this, an account of the four years-plus that Brian Keenan and John McCarthy spent as hostages of Arab guerrillas in Lebanon. Based on the books they wrote about their ordeal, it has superb, odd-couple central performances from Ian Hart as the Ulster protestant Keenan and Linus Roache as ex-public schoolboy McCarthy and is an extraordinary, moving testament to the pair&apos;s will to survive. Sunday May 25 Seabiscuit (Gary Ross, 2003) 3.20pm, BBC1 The real-life story of the depression-era geegee that battled its way to victory and lifted the hearts of a gloomy US. According to this schmaltzy but winning movie, the horse made up in courage and spirit what it lacked in classic stature, and also helped a trio of wrecked men to redeem themselves: jockey Tobey Maguire, trainer Chris Cooper and owner Jeff Bridges. Walk The Line (James Mangold, 2005) 9.15pm, Channel 4 This impressive biopic of country legend Johnny Cash is energised by a riveting performance from Joaquin Phoenix. From the difficult early years, the wooing of fellow singer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) although both were already married, through the drug trouble and the Folsom prison recording, Phoenix is mesmerising. Into The Blue (John Stockwell, 2005) 9.15pm, Five An enjoyably silly yarn about a group of divers discovering sunken treasure and cocaine in the Bahamas. There&apos;s moderate suspense and some violence as the friends fall out over what to do with their riches, but the film exists chiefly to show off the beautiful bodies of swimsuited stars Jessica Alba and Paul Walker as they do their underwater stuff. Buffalo Soldiers (Gregor Jordan, 2001) 11.45pm, Channel 4 Jordan&apos;s subversive and very funny comedy about the hell that is peace for soldiers. Joaquin Phoenix is Ray Elwood, an infantryman stationed in late-80s Germany with nothing much to do except trade in drugs, automatic weapons, and anything else that comes his way. But his cosy lifestyle gets fubar when hardass sergeant Lee (Scott Glenn) starts instilling a little army discipline. The Clandestine Marriage (Christopher Miles, 1999) 12midnight, BBC1 Heaving bosoms to the fore in this deliciously corrupt period comedy; it&apos;s 18th-century England, and Nigel Hawthorne&apos;s aged fop Lord Ogleby, fallen on hard times, aims to get his son John (Tom Hollander) wed to nouveau riche Betsy (Emma Chambers), although the young man fancies Fanny (Natasha Little). A highly enjoyable farce. Kontroll (Nimr\u00f3d Antal, 2003) 1.40am, Channel 4 Good place for a black comedy, the underground; and Hungarian director Antal makes the most of it by setting the whole film in the benighted environs of the Budapest metro. Leading this wittily gripping tale is Sandor Csanyi as Bulcsu, whose team of ticket inspectors are as sad and weird as the fare-dodgers they pursue. Monday May 26 A Bug&apos;s Life (John Lasseter, 1998) 1.20pm, BBC1 Dave Foley voices the maverick ant Flik, who is out to rescue his colony and in particular Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) from a gang of marauding grasshoppers (led by Kevin Spacey&apos;s Hopper): he mistakes a troupe of six-legged thespians for warriors in a plot that&apos;s Seven Samurai writ small, and sent up big time. The Sound Of Music (Robert Wise, 1965) 2.50pm, BBC1 The high-soaring screen version of Rodgers and Hammerstein&apos;s musical won best film and best director Oscars for its exuberant tale of singing nun Maria (Julie Andrews), who is attached first to the seven Von Trapp children, then the Von himself (Christopher Plummer), in eve-of-war Austria. Irresistible. The Four Feathers (Shekhar Kapur, 2002) 9pm, BBC2 Lacks the elan of Zoltan Korda&apos;s 1939 classic adaptation of the AEW Mason novel, but a lively British imperialist adventure nevertheless. The late Heath Ledger leads impressively as the young officer trying to clear his name of cowardice; the support - including Kate Hudson, Wes Bentley and Spooks&apos; Rupert Penry-Jones - is a little stilted, but it&apos;s all about the do-or-die desert battles. Basic (John McTiernan, 2003) 10.35pm, Channel 4 A messy military thriller in which investigators John Travolta and Connie Nielsen try to find out why a US Rangers exercise in the Panamanian jungle left most of the platoon dead. The actors - including Samuel L Jackson&apos;s brutal sergeant - are game, but the mystifying plot twists leave them lost in the undergrowth. The Mexican (Gore Verbinsky, 2001) 10.50pm, BBC1 Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts make an impressive A-list double header, but the conjunction of these stars isn&apos;t a huge success. He&apos;s a mafia bozo sent to collect a priceless antique pistol for don Gene Hackman; she&apos;s Brad&apos;s put-upon girlfriend, kidnapped as insurance against him failing to do the job. The snappy script keeps it wryly amusing. Wall Street (Oliver Stone, 1987) 11.05pm, Five Stone turns a hard eye on the wheeler-dealers of America&apos;s money market. Characteristically trenchant, with a brilliant Oscar-winning performance from Michael Douglas as lizard-like corporate hustler Gordon Gekko. Featuring Charlie and Martin Sheen. The Lady From Shanghai (Orson Welles, 1947) 12.05am, BBC2 An exotic, hybrid film noir from Welles, who as well as directing, produced, wrote and stars as the movie&apos;s fall guy Michael O&apos;Hara. In true noir style he&apos;s seduced by a femme fatale (an astonishing Rita Hayworth, AKA Mrs Welles) and framed for murder. Brilliant. Tuesday May 27 It Happened One Night (Frank Capra, 1934)10.50am, BBC2 Oscars all round for Capra&apos;s classic screwball comedy - it scooped best picture, best director, best script, and of course, best actors: Clark Gable&apos;s hard-headed newshound and Claudette Colbert&apos;s runaway heiress were a perfect love-match. Wednesday May 28 Born Yesterday (George Cukor, 1950) 11.20am, BBC2 A clever, beautifully crafted comedy. Judy Holliday won an Oscar for her dumb-blonde decoration on the arm of junk-metal magnate Broderick Crawford: when he sends her to intellectual William Holden to get educated, sparks fly. Educating Rita (Lewis Gilbert, 1983) 11.15pm, BBC1 She&apos;s Mary Whitehouse at 9pm on BBC2; here, Julie Walters reprises her stage success in Willy Russell&apos;s adaptation of his play about a young Liverpudlian hairdresser seeking enlightenment at the Open University; Michael Caine is a picture of shaggy disillusionment as her alcoholic Eng Lit tutor who gets lessons in life in return. Thursday May 29 Born Free (James Hill, 1966) 12.40pm, Channel 4 Beautifully adapted from Joy Adamson&apos;s bestseller, this story of how Joy (Virginia McKenna) and husband George (Bill Travers) bring up lion cub Elsa and struggle to return her to the wild is irresistible. In The Bedroom (Todd Field, 2001) 11.35pm, BBC1 Actor-turned indie director Todd Field&apos;s first feature is a profoundly moving study of grief. Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek are the middle-aged New England couple concerned about son Nick Stahl&apos;s imminent move to college and his relationship with an older woman (Marisa Tomei); but a terrible act of violence drives them to the brink. Beautifully acted and handled with rare restraint. Riding Giants (Stacy Peralta, 2004) 2.05am, Channel 4 Peralta, who made the hugely enthusiastic skateboarding doc Dogtown And Z-Boys, turns his attention to the even wilder world of surfing. Again it&apos;s a thrilling sports history, that charts the cult of the big wave in all its physical and spiritual glory. Think Point Break without the bank robbing. Friday May 30 Scary Movie 3 (David Zucker, 2003) 11.40pm, BBC1 David &quot;Airplane!&quot; Zucker is really slumming it in this teenie horror pastiche. Leslie Nielsen, plays a slow-on-the-uptake president (goodness knows where they found the model for him), Anne Faris is a journo and Charlie Sheen a farmer. The jokes cover topics from vomiting to farting to Michael Jackson. The War Of The Roses (Danny De Vito, 1989) 1.45am, Carlton/Granada; 12.35am, Scottish A hilariously wicked account of the end of a marriage.

He is currently ranked No9 in the world, although unless he can repeat that Wimbledon run he is likely to fall outside the top 50 this summer. And that will be a great pity. As the French Open grew nearer, so the pressure on the 21-year-old&apos;s shoulders appeared to become unbearable, and yesterday morning, to nobody&apos;s huge surprise, he withdrew just before the start of his first round match. A left knee injury was cited - &quot;a blockage of the knee&quot; was the translation. The blockage is in his head.  Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, winner of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles, regularly turned to jelly in front of her home fans, who can be some of the most critical in the tennis world even to their own, and especially on Philippe Chatrier court, the equivalent of Wimbledon&apos;s centre court.  At least she managed to get to the quarter-finals on a couple of occasions whereas Gasquet, in six attempts so far, has only managed four victories, his best run being three years ago when he reached the third round. It is paltry record for a player of such immense talent who, like Mauresmo, possesses one of the most sublime one-handed backhands in the world. Like Britain&apos;s Andy Murray he has a chip on his shoulder concerning the media, though goodness knows the French newspapers and television are far more forgiving and paternal than the British. Gasquet was a wunderkind, appearing on the covers of tennis magazines when he seemed barely old enough to hold a racket steady.  And so the pressure has grown, although his parents attempted to cocoon him from life&apos;s more difficult problems, namely that of growing up. Many perceive this to be precisely the problem. His mother, who lost a previous child in infancy, always told him not to worry if matters did not go entirely to plan, cosseting and comforting him, and ensuring he never lost the belief that, in the end, his talent would be enough. This is not to say that Gasquet has failed to work hard. His progress, without being spectacular in the way of Rafael Nadal, the three-time French Open champion, has been impressive enough. In 2005 he reached the top 20; last year he made the top 10, winning a place in the end-of-season Masters Cup in Shanghai, reserved for the world&apos;s eight leading players.  All appeared to be well as this year began but then came a fourth round defeat in the Australian Open by fellow Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga who, famously, went on to reach the final. Suddenly, or so it seemed, all the pressure of being expected to be a grand slam winner piled down on Gasquet once again.  Suggestions were made that he should break free of his parents&apos; emotional influence, and that they were killing him softly with kindness. Where was the fight? Where was the steel? When would he grow up? Those questions were being asked again yesterday. Before the tournament began Tsonga pulled out with a serious knee injury that will keep out of Wimbledon.  Then came the news of Gasquet&apos;s precipitous withdrawal. Eyebrows were raised; Gallic shrugs abounded. No Frenchman has won the title in Paris for 25 years, when Yannick Noah triumphed, and they are not about to this year, despite France&apos;s relative strength in depth with 13 players in the top 100.

Offices set up in Delhi, Mumbai, Beijing, Shanghai, Brussels and Caracas, as well as a consultant based in Moscow, were part of former mayor Ken Livingstone&apos;s strategy of promoting London as an international destination for business investment and tourism.  But Johnson pledged to &quot;curtail&quot; spending on what he called Livingstone&apos;s &quot;embassies&quot; during his election campaign.  After less than a month in post, Johnson has put his new deputy for government relations, Ian Clement, in charge of a value-for-money exercise to see whether the offices, which cost close to \u00a31.5m to run, perform a &quot;useful strategic function&quot; for the capital.  The Caracas office, which costs \u00a367,000 to run, is already earmarked for closure in August after Johnson announced earlier this week his decision to scrap an energy deal with Venezuela&apos;s state-owned oil company, which cut 20% of the fuel bill for London buses in return for transport advice. The savings were used to offer discount fares to about 250,000 people on income support.  Johnson said his review, launched today, would consider handing over some of the international office functions to the UK&apos;s foreign embassies.  It would also consider sponsorship deals to increase foreign investment and employment.  The Tory mayor said: &quot;We have started the process of considering which of the Greater London authority&apos;s international offices perform a useful strategic function and deliver value for money.  &quot;We will look at the Brussels office and its role in pre-empting potentially harmful European legislation. We will consider the role of the Indian and Chinese offices in encouraging inward investment and business opportunities for London. We will also look at which functions could be performed by the UK&apos;s foreign embassies.&quot; Johnson added: &quot;We are eager to get on and review the international office&apos;s role in increasing foreign investment and employment, delivering value for money and ensuring London takes full advantage of emerging international markets. We will also assess whether other sources of funding including sponsorship should be used.&quot; The move is part of the mayor&apos;s determination to make savings in city hall.  Earlier this month he announced that the free newspaper, the Londoner, is to be scrapped and some of the money saved used to plant 10,000 trees across the capital. Johnson&apos;s staff claim \u00a32.9m would have been spent on the Londoner this year if Livingstone had been re-elected.  Stands to promote the GLA at the three autumn party conference, which cost \u00a380,000, have also been scrapped. And the mayor has already made clear the number of staff being sent to the Beijing Olympics will be scaled back so that only those whose presence at the games is &quot;absolutely crucial&quot; to the interests of London will go. Johnson has come under fire after it emerged that one of his key transport manifesto policies - replacing the capital&apos;s bendy buses with a new generation of Routemaster buses - may never happen. Two weeks ago, his director of transport policy, Kulveer Ranger, said that a design competition would be launched for the new buses - but if no bid was good enough they would look again at the pledge.  Johnson made phasing out bendy buses a priority, initially saying new Routemasters with conductors would cost \u00a38m to run.

The Year of Getting to Know Us, the first of Stone&apos;s films to be affected by the ban, has been described by a user of the internet film site IMDb as &quot;one of the five worst films I have seen in my lifetime&quot;.", "tags": ["Film", "China earthquake", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-28T12:12:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/29/educationnews", "sentences": ["In the rival rankings produced by China&apos;s Shanghai Jiao Tong University, only Oxford and Cambridge make the top 10."], "title": "Timothy Garton Ash: Can we have world-class universities as well as social justice in education?", "article": "I divide my academic life between two universities, Oxford and Stanford. In 2006, Stanford announced a fundraising &quot;challenge&quot; with a target of $4.3bn, or about \u00a32.2bn at today&apos;s exchange rates. This week, Oxford launched a campaign to raise at least \u00a31.25bn, the largest ever by a European university. Behind Oxford&apos;s bid to play in the US-style university funding superleague there hovers a larger question: will Europe, the cradle of the modern university, have any truly world-class research universities in 10 years&apos; time? That is itself part of a still bigger conundrum: how can Europe hold its own in an increasingly non-European world? At the moment, Europe is represented in the top 10 of the Times Higher Education Supplement ranking of world universities by four institutions, all of them British: Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, London and University College, London. In the rival rankings produced by China&apos;s Shanghai Jiao Tong University, only Oxford and Cambridge make the top 10. The other eight are American, but China intends to have one up there soon. Oxford cites as the context of its campaign &quot;a world of uncertain state funding and growing global competition&quot;. I see that fierce competition for the best academics and students every week, whether I&apos;m in Oxford or Stanford. This is as much a global market as that for computers, oil or financial services. Oxford is hanging in there but, frankly, only just. For the best and brightest younger academics from all over the world, honeystone quadrangles, high table and an incomparably rich intellectual tradition will go only so far to compensate for lower salaries, higher house prices and heavier teaching burdens than you would find at, say, Stanford.  Money is by no means the only key asset in this globalised market, but it helps. Public funding of higher education has increased under New Labour, after a terrible decline under Margaret Thatcher, but it can&apos;t do the whole job for a greatly expanded university sector. It brings with it bureaucratic and political strings, and will probably fare badly in the current public expenditure squeeze. Anyway, financial and intellectual independence march together, as Oxford&apos;s campaign brochure notes in a paragraph pithily entitled Freedom. Defeatists look at Harvard&apos;s $35bn endowment and say &quot;we can&apos;t possibly match that&quot;. But Harvard is in a league of its own. Stanford has just over $17bn, Princeton nearly $15bn. If you add together the endowments of the Oxford colleges, the university and its associated trusts and funds, and capitalise the average annual transfer from the profitable Oxford University Press, you can reach a figure of around $11bn. And that estimate ignores the fact that the holdings of land in some Oxford endowments are valued at 15th- or 16th-century prices (a surreal wrinkle worthy of that Oxford classic, Alice in Wonderland). Add a successful campaign that nets another $2.5bn, and you&apos;re running Princeton close.  Yet endowments, together with public and private research funding and commercial partnerships and spin-offs, are only part of the story. America&apos;s top universities also have more fee income. Although Oxford can be pricey for students from outside the EU, its fees for British undergraduates are capped by the government, along with those of all other British universities, at a maximum of just over \u00a33,000 a year - already a nearly threefold increase on the pre-2006 figure, and higher than in most continental European countries. Even allowing for special government funding flows which help support its unique, college-based tutorial system, the University of Oxford reckons that it subsidises the cost of educating a British undergraduate to the tune of some \u00a37,000 to \u00a38,000 a year. If it were really to &quot;go American&quot; in its funding model, Oxford would have to quadruple - at least - its fees and then, to maintain &quot;means-blind&quot; admission, provide bursaries from an expanded endowment for students from poorer families. That may well be, arguably should be, Oxford&apos;s direction of travel over the next decade, but it won&apos;t happen fast, completely, or without a series of complex arguments and negotiations - for Oxford is in Europe, not America. Its scholars and students do not merely operate in a European political context which is both liberal and broadly social democratic; they are themselves part of it, sharing many of the same values. They recognise that even to go some of the way down, so to speak, the Stanford road, throws up difficult issues of access, equity and social justice. I can&apos;t begin to cover all those issues, but here&apos;s a taste. The capped fee-level of \u00a33,000 and the student loan system that accompanies it will be the subject of a government review that should start next year but may not report until after the next election since neither Labour nor the Tories want this to become an election hot potato. Government links the fee/loan issue to improved access for university applicants from state schools and less advantaged backgrounds. Oxford is scrupulously meritocratic at the point of admission (far more so than some leading American universities, which give privileged access to the dimmer kids of generous alumni, hence Yalie George Bush) but too many such pupils are deterred from applying to Oxford by unfamiliarity, downbeat teachers and the university&apos;s hard-to-shake-off image of Brideshead Revisited privilege. If, to mix our metaphors in the way no undergraduate should, this hot potato lands in the court of David Cameron, if and when he becomes the country&apos;s 26th Oxford-educated prime minister, it will be doubly explosive. Bullingdon Club favours Brideshead is not a headline the new Tories will want. But beyond the image politics, there are real policy dilemmas. If the fee cap were lifted, would government increase the student loans to match? That would mean both more graduate debt and more public expenditure. Or would government foot the bill directly - taking the money from hospitals, state schools and social spending? Or would it ask universities to make up the difference themselves? If Oxford&apos;s campaign is successful it could probably fund this from its enhanced endowment, giving those bursaries to less well-off students, as Harvard and Stanford do. But Oxford and Cambridge are the only two major universities in Europe who could even dream of doing such a thing.  The endowments of Imperial and University Colleges in London are nowhere near that point, let alone those of other leading British universities. So if the fee cap were lifted, and those universities charged higher fees - which their outstanding academic records would certainly enable them to do, even in a very competitive market - who would make up the difference for their students from poorer homes? Or would these non-Oxbridge elite universities become finishing schools for well-heeled and increasingly foreign students? I don&apos;t know the answers. I haven&apos;t even spelled out half the questions. But I do know that this is the debate we must have over the next couple of years, not just in Britain but in Europe as a whole. The fundamental question - call it the Oxford Question - underlying all the others is this: can we, in Europe, have social justice in higher education and world-class research universities? Or must we choose? timothygartonash.com", "tags": ["UK news", "Education", "University funding", "Higher education", "Research funding", "Access to university", "University guide"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-28T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/29/chinaearthquake.china", "sentences": ["Dior&apos;s Shanghai office said images of Stone, who models the firm&apos;s skincare range, would disappear from stores all over China.", "Last year, while attending the Shanghai Movie Festival, the Basic Instinct star said, she had felt &quot;deeply the Chinese people&apos;s wisdom and hospitality.&quot; Her back-peddling may have come too late, however."], "title": "Dior drops Stone from Chinese marketing after 'karma' comments", "article": "The luxury goods retailer Christian Dior said today it had dropped Sharon Stone from its Chinese advertisements, a day after the actress provoked widespread anger for suggesting that the earthquake in south-west China was the result of &quot;bad karma&quot; over Beijing&apos;s occupation of Tibet.

The Kyodo news agency quoted Japanese government sources as saying that a self-defence force [SDF] C-130 transport plane could be sent to Sichuan province to distribute tents, blankets and other vital supplies by the end of the week. Qin told reporters: &quot;Given the magnitude of this disaster, if some countries or militaries are ready to provide us with material in urgent need, we will express our welcome.&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Nobutaka Machimura, said Beijing had approved the use of military aircraft to bring in supplies, adding that there were no plans to keep Japanese troops on the ground.

Things don&apos;t work in such straight lines and she seems to have neglected that Tibetans suffered in the quake.&quot; Dhammadassin, a senior dharma [Buddhist law] teacher at the London Buddhist centre, said: &quot;There are ideas of collective karma, but I find it difficult to see how it could be proved at that scale.&quot; In April, French retailer Carrefour faced protests as rumours circulated that it supported the Dalai Lama.

By which I think Bradshaw meant that Lee - still only in his early 50s - gives more sense of urban possibilities than of his own obsessions. In other words, with nearly every film Lee is saying to us: &quot;Look, I could do this or that in such a way that a Gehry innovation could exist across the town square from a Gothic cathedral in a state of lively conversation - not hopeless contradiction.&quot; And so the man who got hip suburbia in the 70s (The Ice Storm), the instability of Kansas in the Civil War (Ride the Whirlwind) and that magical fantasia on martial arts and special effects (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), did Shanghai noir with Lust, Caution, and now proposes a film about Woodstock. Does he have any limits? Well, yes, by common consent The Hulk was a dead end, but one easily forgiven when it was followed by the audacious yet relaxed view of gay cowboys in Wyoming, Brokeback Mountain, as derived from Annie Proulx. This is an age in which, increasingly, film directors travel to work, and with results that sometimes show how very difficult multiculturalism can be. But Lee seems possessed by an intelligence, an openness and an engagement with human nature that can take any human story, and tell it with ease. Except that, as soon as I say that, I pause over Lust, Caution. It&apos;s not that I didn&apos;t like the film, and don&apos;t find something different waiting there every time I go back to it. But still I&apos;m not quite sure what that film wants to be. Is it a mark of reverence for the Eileen Chang story on which it is based? Is it a homage to films such as The Conformist? Or is it, exactly as the title says, a kind of mathematical theorem attempting to balance abandon and control in the human spirit? We know the Ang Lee story because the world insists on telling it: how the Taiwan kid came to the universities of Illinois and New York, met James Schamus as a working partner, and went from those exquisite films about the Taiwanese and food (The Wedding Banquet, Eat Drink Man Woman) to maybe the best Jane Austen film we have ever had (Sense and Sensibility). Such prowess leaves ample room for a &quot;failure&quot; like The Hulk, though in hindsight there may be something interesting in so complete a loss of touch. Lee has been industrious and pleasing in ways that make his work and its coherence seem easy or natural - and there is a risk that we admire the versatility and miss the lack of argument. The one thing that troubled me with Brokeback Mountain was that it seemed facile. If anything had been lost it was the sense in Proulx&apos;s language that the great adventure by the two cowboys was very hard for them. Lee is such a master of visual storytelling that sometimes he leaves the depth of his characters more indicated than revealed. Well, of course they&apos;re profound, he seems to suggest - aren&apos;t people profound? Well, yes, I hope so, but the reason I find Lust, Caution so impressive is that I&apos;m not sure Lee had come to a clear conclusion about his characters. Is this simply the story of a paranoid spy who is too intelligent for his pursuers? Or is it a story about a would-be killer who loses her way in the raptures of her own body? Is it even a film in which the obsession with sex finally eclipses political purpose? Is it a way of saying that anyone beset by both lust and caution is in a perilously self-denying situation? We are used to film-makers proceeding in their careers by trial and error, desperate to find the statue in the stone. Whereas Lee simply presents us with a new building with every film - and if The Hulk is a ruin, well, who is to say that a rounded city doesn&apos;t need ruins, too? But Lust, Caution was a film in which you could get lost, and I think I find that even more exciting than the customary experience with Lee of having the perfect map with the movie.

The relocation to higher ground was started as fears grew that a huge lake may flood down from the mountains where water has built up behind an unstable landslide. It is the first stage of a plan to move up to 1.3 million people who live downstream of the Tangjiashan &quot;quake lake&quot;, the largest of the 34 bodies of water formed by the seismic disruption on 13 May. Chinese engineers have been trying to dig and blast a channel that would allow the lake to drain safely, but their efforts have been hampered by rainfall and the inaccessibility of the location. Despite flying 30 giant earthmovers to the site by army helicopter, the water has continued to build up behind the newly formed dam. At one point below the barricade, it is 23 metres (72ft) deep. Officials said it was unlikely to burst today but the risks will increase in the days ahead as heavy rain and big aftershocks are forecast. According to the Mianyang government information office, the authorities have started implementing a two-stage evacuation plan. The first stage - which has been under way for several days - will see the moving of 197,500 people living in areas likely to be inundated if a third of the dam collapses. The town of Beichuan - one of the worst affected areas downstream of the lake - is now out of bounds for everyone but soldiers. Under the second stage, 1.3m people will be moved to higher ground in case more than half the dam gives way. The Xinhua news agency reported today that this had been put into practice, but officials in Mianyang denied this. &quot;We haven&apos;t started the full evacuation, but we will conduct a rehearsal at headquarters from tomorrow until 2 June,&quot; said an information officer who declined to give his name. Separate reports suggested the drill will focus on communications and the public will not participate. The authorities are trying to complete the drainage operation before the barrier collapses. Hundreds of troops have managed to dig a third of the channel. &quot;The work on the blocked lake is going smoothly and, at this pace, it should be completed soon,&quot; Zhou Hua, an official involved in the effort, told Reuters news agency.  &quot;At this stage, the situation is under control, but we&apos;ve set in place this contingency plan to minimise any possible damage.&quot; The death toll from the 7.9 magnitude quake continues to climb. There are 68,858 confirmed deaths and another 18,618 people are missing, many of them presumed buried under the rubble. The emergency services have won public respect for the relief operation, but there is fury at officials and construction firms responsible for building shoddy schools that collapsed in the quake, killing at least 9,000 pupils and teachers. Grieving parents have asked why neighbouring structures remained upright and accused officials of corruption and skimping on materials. The government has promised an investigation and punishment for anyone found to have been negligent. An official investigator told the Guardian that one of the reasons for the collapse of Juyuan middle school was that builders used cheap polyporous slabs. &quot;It would have been better if they used a different material. Of course, it was to do with the price,&quot; said Chen Baosheng, an expert from Tongji University in Shanghai.  &quot;If the Juyuan middle school collapsed, it shouldn&apos;t be to the extent that it kills people. There needs to be a uniform standard. It is not good if there is no uniform standard.&quot; Some of the parents of the dead children have contacted lawyers to press their case in the courts. &quot;They have volunteered to represent us for free,&quot; said Gan Tinfo, whose child died at Juyuan middle school. &quot;I want the responsible officials to be punished by the law and fired from their posts.&quot; Better news is that social workers and volunteers have helped to reunite 7,000 children with their parents. In the chaotic first few days after the quake, 8,000 children were separated. Many of them were presumed orphaned, prompting a surge of adoption offers.  Now only a thousand children are alone and the civil affairs department said it would continue to look for their mothers and fathers before considering fostering. Millions of people are still sleeping in tents and temporary accommodation.  Among the most famous of the damaged structures is the world&apos;s biggest panda reserve at Wolong, where the buildings have been so badly damaged that the institution may have to be moved. &quot;It&apos;s better to move, I think,&quot; said Zhang Hemin, the head of the reserve, told the China Daily.", "tags": ["China earthquake", "China", "World news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Earthquakes"], "publicationDate": "2008-05-30T11:07:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/may/31/foodanddrink.restaurants", "sentences": ["It took me an hour to work out that the thematic styling begins and ends with paper signs reading &quot;Peking&quot;, &quot;Shanghai&quot;, &quot;Szechuan&quot; and &quot;Canton&quot; stuck on various screens."], "title": "Matthew Norman reviews Mr Chu China Palace in Hull", "article": "Mr Chu China Palace, 3/10  Telephone 01482 222288 Address St Andrews Quay, HullOpen All week, noon-midnight. Many &apos;banquets&apos; available; set meals from \u00a36  Before we begin in earnest, may I make a futile attempt to reassure the gentleman who inspired this review that what follows has nothing to do with snobbery? After the Crewe and Nantwich by election, we&apos;ve all had our fill of retrograde class warfare, so let me state for John Prescott&apos;s benefit that I did not arrive at Mr Chu China Palace in a top hat, insouciantly flicking half-crowns towards the malnourished urchins by the front door. Nor is there any link between this public school product&apos;s judgment of what Mr P described, in his memoirs, as &quot;my favourite Chinese restaurant in the world&quot;, and the 11-plus failure that rankles him still, a mere 57 years after the event. No, it is this, and this alone - Mr Chu&apos;s is an absolute shocker. Frankly, I didn&apos;t expect it. When last summer I drove to Kirkcaldy to sample Gordon Brown&apos;s favourite Chinese, it came as no surprise that New Maxin wasn&apos;t great, because you&apos;d no more expect our ascetic PM to take any interest in his food than you would expect him to interrupt John Humphrys with a spirited rendition of Total Eclipse Of The Heart. But John Prescott? How can a man who so adores his grub (&quot;He scoffs it down, he brings it up again/He&apos;s never gonna keep it down,&quot; as his friends from Chumbawamba might have it) think so highly of such a place? Why on earth does Mr Chuck love Mr Chu? The only clue I can find comes from the restaurant&apos;s website. One section is entitled &quot;Promototions&quot;, hinting that Prezza has been bartering his linguistic skills for prawn crackers, and there&apos;s mention elsewhere of &quot;VIP discounts&quot;. Yet you would want more than 25% off a crispy duck or nine to dine willingly at a place whose sole redeeming feature was the funny, mischievous Russian waitress who seated me next to the dancefloor on which John may well have tossed the wondrous Pauline over his shoulder to the sound of Bill Haley. When I asked her which of the website-vaunted &quot;four dining areas&quot; we were in, she looked blank. It took me an hour to work out that the thematic styling begins and ends with paper signs reading &quot;Peking&quot;, &quot;Shanghai&quot;, &quot;Szechuan&quot; and &quot;Canton&quot; stuck on various screens. &quot;Traditional values in a modern setting&quot; sums this one up, the values being those of a fifth-rate Pekingese restaurant circa 1974, with all the dining areas done out in the same ersatz Imperial manner, with lashings of dragons, hanging lanterns and red lacquering hinting at an MFI summer sale. Added to that little lot, the setting is a gleaming retail park on the banks of the Humber, opposite Currys, Land Of Leather and the other usual suspects. It&apos;s a desultory place, then, and especially so when very few of the tables at &quot;Britain&apos;s largest Chinese restaurant&quot; were occupied - for reasons the food wasted little time in explaining to me. Hot and sour soup is always a useful indicator of Peking cuisine, and Mr Chu&apos;s version is a vapid, orangey liquid that&apos;s closer in taste and texture to flavoured water than to anything based on chicken stock, altogether lacking the heat of chilli and the sourness of rice wine, and devoid even of the magic ingredient that is sesame oil. Spare ribs, meanwhile, were drab, grey, bulbous, horribly fatty beasts drowned in an overbearing Peking sauce that may, or may not, have been freshly made in the kitchen. At this stage, and with New Maxin in mind, I was wondering whether their failure to resign over Iraq really constitutes a more compelling reason to hold Messrs Brown and Prescott in contempt than their insane masterplan to make me schlep across the country for awful food. The main courses swiftly settled it. Kung po chicken was merely inoffensive, although the use of jalape\u00f1o rather than Chinese chillies highlighted the lack of culinary pride, while the highest compliment I can pay a collation of bamboo shoots and tree ear mushrooms is that not all the shoots were al dente enough to send a panda scurrying to the emergency dentist. The coup de grace, however, was &quot;Monk&apos;s Delight Vegetable Hot Pot&quot;.

One of the world&apos;s great cultures has finally embarked on a path towards prosperity. China is a much more comfortable and welcoming place than it has ever been. Last year, Tony Blair told us that because of economic changes and rising prosperity, the movement towards democracy in China is &quot;unstoppable.&quot; Everything from economic reforms to rising wealth levels, a growing and modern middle class (currently around 100-200 million people) behaving and acting like we do in Britain, and even granting Beijing the Olympics was meant to hasten the arrival of democracy in China. But since the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, China is seemingly further away (pdf) from democracy. What happened? After all, the circumstances seem ripe for democratisation. There is apparently a strong correlation between free and open markets, and free societies. Prior to reforms in 1978, China&apos;s private sector produced less than 1% of output. Today Shanghai feels like a shining, new, cosmopolitan city. There are now 30 million private businesses in China producing over 70% of its national output. Yet political reform has stalled over the past decade. Importantly, the overwhelming majority of China&apos;s elites - entrepreneurs, professionals, intellectuals, students, journalists, and so on - have lost interest in political reform. When pressed, most express support for the political status quo and are even critical of the 1989 Tiananmen protests. In fact, these elites are the fastest-growing groups wanting to become members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Almost a quarter of the 70 million party members are professionals and skilled workers. One third are college students, and another third are businesspeople. These elites, who were meant to lead the push toward democratisation, have become the party&apos;s newest and strongest supporters. The common mistake made in the west is to assume that while China&apos;s society and economy is rapidly changing, its authoritarian political institutions remain static. Those too quick to proclaim democracy on the horizon in China have underestimated the determination, capacity, and resourcefulness of the regime in its efforts to remain in power. Authoritarian regimes cannot afford to be made irrelevant by other forces. To preserve its economic relevance, the Chinese regime has gone to extensive efforts to maintain control of the major levers of economic power. This control is the heart of an economic structure that entrenches the role and position of party members in Chinese economy and society. Around a dozen key segments of the economy - including banking, construction, infrastructure, media, and telecommunications - are dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The state still owns a majority of the country&apos;s fixed assets and receives over two-thirds of the country&apos;s capital. The CCP has conducted a tireless and largely successful campaign to co-opt, and in many respects create, the rising educated and economic classes. By remaining the key economic player as well as overseeing an extensive system of awards, promotions, and regulation, the government continues to control and dispense a dominant share of the most valued economic, professional, and intellectual opportunities. This means that entrepreneurs are better off doing business as a &quot;partner&quot; of the state. Intellectuals and academics favoured by officials are granted generous research grants, are fast tracked into senior positions, and given personal perks. Journalists have little choice but to work for media outlets that are still subsidiaries of party organs. These are the contented middle classes emerging in China today. Far from being an independent class, why would these middle classes want to change toward a more democratic system when it could lead to their own dispossession? The CCP&apos;s hold on power remains vulnerable to a profound economic shock, such as a significant downturn in economic growth. This would impede the regime&apos;s continued capacity to co-opt and appease. Regardless, a Chinese middle class that looks and acts the same as we do in the west might nevertheless think very differently when it comes to democracy and the future of the country.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-01T15:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/jun/02/oldplaysinnewcostumes", "sentences": ["It&apos;s not the comic-book China of Aladdin - though the play is called a parable - nor the souped-up, super-cool Shanghai of the 20s, nor the Nationalist China of the 40s when the play was composed."], "title": "Old plays in new costumes", "article": "Neon lights ... The Good Soul of Szechuan at the Young Vic. Photograph: Tristram Kenton Richard Jones&apos;s production of The Good Soul of Szechuan has stirred up a fair bit of debate. Most objection has been to the play: a pernicious, commie insult to humanity and a clunky one at that. It&apos;s also been admired - for its insight, its engagement with the real world and, especially, for its ability to provoke.  What&apos;s barely been noticed, oddly, is that the production is set in the present-day. Brecht borrowed an old tale and set it notionally in China - but which China, when? It&apos;s not the comic-book China of Aladdin - though the play is called a parable - nor the souped-up, super-cool Shanghai of the 20s, nor the Nationalist China of the 40s when the play was composed. This production is set in a seedy cement factory and a Day-Glo cornershop in a go-ahead provincial capital in 2008. The whores wear platform shoes and novelty sunglasses. This is, I think, one reason it speaks strongly to its audience - love it or loathe it. Every so often I get an email to let me know that its author won&apos;t come to my theatre unless the productions are presented authentically. This usually means &quot;not in modern dress&quot;, which is shorthand for &quot;not messed about by some too-clever-by-half director&quot;. But what is authenticity in the theatre? Would our Good Soul have been better served by a recreation of the Berliner Ensemble show - with neat half-curtain centre stage and plenty of wrist action with the fan as sweet Shen Te disguises and undisguises herself as nasty Shui Ta? Or should that version stay within back issues of Theater Heute? The author my correspondents are keenest to protect is Shakespeare. Despite the hillocks of volumes on original stagings, we don&apos;t know enough to recreate them. We don&apos;t even know how long it took to play them. The prologue to Romeo and Juliet advertises &quot;the two hours traffic of our stage&quot;. Well, we at the Young Vic sometimes bend the truth a bit about how long a show is if we think its length will put people off - but we&apos;d never tell a whopper like that. You can&apos;t do the full Romeo and Juliet in two hours unless you dash helter-skelter - in which case it will be a) incomprehensible and b) pointless. Ted Hughes insisted that the 17th-century audience could understand every word, including the dozens of neologisms. But, genius though he was, how could he possibly know that Shakespeare&apos;s audience were, at once, unbelievable word boffins and of fashionably diverse education? It won&apos;t wash. And if we don&apos;t know that ... What we do know is that every play, no matter when it was set, was played in modern dress. So people who claim that Shakespeare in contemporary clothing is inauthentic are plain wrong. (Though that&apos;s neither here nor there.) And as to the acting style - we know that Elizabethan actor training required the learning of a range of arcane stage gestures of almost Kabuki complexity. But how were they used, by who? When did this practice die out? Even weirder, it seems that while the same actor played a leading part all the way through, any number of actors could play smaller roles. Someone would come on and Macbeth would say: &quot;Well met, Ross&quot; and though last time you saw Ross he was lanky and blond and now he&apos;s squat and dark, who cares? Apparently. Closer to today: Peter Hall&apos;s Pygmalion now at the Old Vic has been praised for its classic qualities, its authenticity - and jolly wonderful I bet it is. But I wonder in what its authenticity lies? How many people remember the photographs of the original Royal Court productions of Shaw&apos;s plays that used to decorate the walls of the pub on the corner of Sloane Square before it was knocked down to make way for the Oriel. No doubt they were posed for the camera - but why would anyone want their show to be recorded in those wooden, ugly, arch and artificial groupings and postures unless they were proud of them? That must have been how GBS liked it - and we can assume this because he directed many of his first productions himself. Leave it to some director chap - or stage manager as they called them then - who&apos;d dream up idiotic ideas of his own?

I&apos;ve spent the last three nights watching a nine-hour Chinese opera called The Peony Pavilion, and its combination of unearthly beauty, dream-like plot and siren-like singing are making my trip feel ... trippy. I&apos;m on scarcely more solid ground during the day. This newly globalised city, awaiting the start of the Olympics, seems to be almost palpably churning: all around it is being demolished, redesigned and rebuilt. The city seems to be sprinting towards its future. What place can a 400-year-old opera have in that? The Peony Pavilion, which is being staged in London this week, is an opera on an epic scale. Written by the poet Tang Xianzu in 1598, it tells the story of a girl who makes love to a young scholar in a dream, beginning an erotic liaison that sees her die and be brought back to life. The opera is the best-known example of a style called kunqu, which originated in the southern region of Suzhou during the late Ming era (1368-1644). It was highbrow, aristocratic entertainment. Each production, played out over several evenings, was highly codified, with elaborate makeup, fabulously embroidered costumes and music that combined stylised speech-singing with arias that swooped between piercing falsetto and rumbling bass. Over the next three centuries, kunqu opera gave way to the more populist Peking opera, but it remained prized by the Chinese literati for its refined style - until the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, when kunqu was suppressed as a decadent, imperialist tradition. I&apos;ve been watching The Peony Pavilion at Beijing&apos;s National Centre for Performing Arts, a futuristic glass and titanium dome. Later, I meet its producer, Kenneth Pai, there. A dapper, mild-mannered man of 70, he recalls his first encounter with the opera at the age of nine. &quot;I think it was fate,&quot; he says. &quot;The great actor Mei Lan-fang was performing in Shanghai. It was a big sensation and our family were lucky to get tickets. And on the night we went he happened to perform a scene from The Peony Pavilion called The Interrupted Dream.&quot; Pai&apos;s eyes widen until I can almost see the goggle-eyed kid he was then. &quot;I didn&apos;t know what it was. I didn&apos;t understand it. But it haunted me.&quot; Soon after this, China&apos;s history took a fateful turn: Pai went into exile, and kunqu opera went underground. His father was a minister in the nationalist Kuomintang party and settled in Taiwan after their defeat by the communists in 1949. It was there, studying literature at university, that Pai came across the poetry of Tang Xianzu once more. As one of Taiwan&apos;s foremost writers, Pai returned again and again to The Peony Pavilion. One of the stories in his most famous book, Taipei People (1971), was inspired by the opera. He then turned this into a stage play in 1982, and, a year later, co-produced two acts of the original opera in Taipei. The crucial moment came in 1987, when Pai returned to China for the first time in 39 years to see a kunqu opera company perform in Shanghai. &quot;I was overwhelmed,&quot; he remembers, &quot;jumping and clapping even after other people had left.&quot; The actors told Pai how they had kept kunqu alive. &quot;During the Cultural Revolution the performers were sent out all over China for labour reform,&quot; Pai says. &quot;They were not allowed to sing kunqu. It was strictly forbidden. But when they were out working in the fields, they told me they would sing to themselves quietly, just to remember the music, so that they could keep kunqu alive. That is how, after 10 years of this Cultural Revolution - cultural holocaust, I could even say - they could come back and work together again. And I thought, if they could do this, I must help them. If this art form has survived the Cultural Revolution, it must go on.&quot; Pai dreamed of staging his own large-scale kunqu opera production. A three-hour show in Taipei in 1992 served as a practice run, but by the opera&apos;s 400th anniversary in 1998, his project still had not got off the ground. Meanwhile, others had completed theirs. The director Peter Sellars opened the 1998 Vienna festival with a &quot;postmodern&quot; Peony, mixing classical and contemporary music, stage scenery and video screens. Another production, by Chen Shi-Zheng for the Shanghai Kunqu Company, was due to open New York&apos;s Lincoln Centre festival the same year, but was cancelled by the Chinese authorities, who deemed it feudalistic, superstitious and pornographic. The Lincoln Centre mounted Chen&apos;s production the following year, with mostly New York-based artists. It was an 18-hour marathon, complete with a pond and live ducks, including all the opera&apos;s original 55 scenes, and marketed as the revival of a lost Ming tradition. &quot;It was a very exciting production,&quot; says Pai. &quot;But it mixed a whole variety of styles - Peking opera, puppetry, folklore. It wasn&apos;t kunqu.&quot; Meanwhile, the Shanghai Kunqu Company mounted its own lavish version, billed as an &quot;uncut original&quot;, although it included only 35 scenes. &quot;That was kunqu style,&quot; says Pai, &quot;though the set was too much like a theatre stage - with real willow trees, for example - where the real aesthetic of kunqu is more abstract and lyrical.&quot; Other critics were less diplomatic, describing it as gaudy and excessive. Pai remained determined to stage a version that could look to China&apos;s future, while staying true to its past. &quot;But the masters were ageing. And the audience was ageing, too. I had to do something quick.&quot; He began to focus on the new generation, getting two kunqu masters to work with a group of young actors in the Suzhou Opera Company and creating what he calls the &quot;Young Lovers&apos; Edition&quot; of the opera, with the music and staging both lightly modernised. &quot;It was rigorous training,&quot; he says. &quot;I put them through hell!&quot; The production first toured Chinese universities, with tickets either cheap or free. For Pai, these young people were his real audience, rather than the officials with complimentary tickets at the National Centre for Performing Arts, who (and I can vouch for this) nattered on their mobiles throughout the performance. &quot;It was phenomenal,&quot; says Pai. &quot;Thousands of people turned out and sat through nine hours. Why? I have a feeling that this young generation are searching for their cultural identity. They open their eyes and see here a McDonald&apos;s, there a Kentucky Fried Chicken. They are inundated with western influences, but globalisation makes them even more aware of being Chinese. The question is, how to be Chinese? They want to identify with their cultural traditions - but they can&apos;t find them. So this opera is at once familiar and very fresh. They can see it comes from an old Chinese tradition, yet it&apos;s also new for them.&quot;  \u00b7 The Peony Pavilion is at Sadler&apos;s Wells, London EC1 (0844 412 4300) from today until Sunday", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-02T23:08:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/05/frenchopen.tennis", "sentences": ["Gonz\u00e1lez lost his first 10 matches against the Swiss, including the final of the 2007 Australian Open, but he finally struck Federer down in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai last year, albeit in one of the initial round-robin matches, Federer going on to win the title for the fourth time in five years."], "title": "Monfils rides French fervour  to set up clash with Federer", "article": "Gael Monfils, the hugely exciting 21-year-old Frenchman whose father comes from Guadeloupe and mother from Martinique, had the whole of France in a froth and a frenzy yesterday when, unseeded, he reached the semi-finals of his home slam with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 quarter-final victory over Spain&apos;s David Ferrer, the world No5.  Now all that stands in his way tomorrow to becoming the first Frenchman to reach the final at Roland Garros since Henri Leconte in 1988, five years after Yannick Noah had so famously won the title, is Roger Federer, the world No1. &quot;Ga\u00ebl will be difficult to play because he is French, and he&apos;s very fit,&quot; said the Swiss. It promises to be an electrifying occasion. Both players, for quite different reason, make for compulsive watching.  Federer&apos;s pursuit of the one grand slam title he has yet to win reached the semi-final stage for the fourth successive year when he sloughed off a horrid opening set to defeat Chile&apos;s Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4. Pete Sampras, who won 14 majors in total to Federer&apos;s current 12, only ever reached a French Open semi-final once, which underlines the Swiss No1&apos;s total superiority to the American on clay, although any thoughts of him defeating Rafael Nadal, should they meet in the final for a third year on Sunday, appear just as remote, given the Spaniard&apos;s remarkable current form. Federer has had a good draw, having avoided Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals before the possible return against Nadal. Yet the vulnerability that has emerged this year, Federer losing to Djokovic in the Australian Open semi-finals, has continued to surface here from time to time, and in the first set against Gonz\u00e1lez his serve was broken three times. Gonz\u00e1lez lost his first 10 matches against the Swiss, including the final of the 2007 Australian Open, but he finally struck Federer down in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai last year, albeit in one of the initial round-robin matches, Federer going on to win the title for the fourth time in five years. Initially it seemed to give the Chilean a little extra lift of confidence yesterday, though when the world No1 applied the pressure in the second set he folded all too easily, which was disappointing. Monfils will hope to push Federer much harder. At the start of the third set Gonz\u00e1lez, who mixes screeching power with sometimes delicate slice, had three break points on Federer&apos;s serve but could not nail him. He crushed his racket under his foot in anger, but his spirit was crushed too. Federer opened his wings and flew to the finish. For the second match in succession Dinara Safina came back from a set down to reach, like Monfils, her first slam semi-final. In the fourth round she had saved a match point against Maria Sharapova, and she repeated that great escape against Elena Dementieva in a section of the draw that had virtually become the Russian national championship. Dementieva tried to keep smiling, and had every reason to when she was 6-4, 5-2 up, but by the end a great wave of Russian sadness descended upon the 26-year-old Muscovite. She has largely banished the serving yips that cost her the title here in 2006, when she lost an all-Russian final against Anastasia Myskina, but her propensity to self-destruct clearly remains an open sore. Safina&apos;s 4-6, 7-6, 6-0 was greeted with an immense explosion of delight on the main court, the Russian now being every bit as popular as her brother, Marat Safin, and this may be decisive when she meets Svetlana Kuznetsova today for a place in Saturday&apos;s final. They even smiled indulgently when, in annoyance, she decapitated a few potted geraniums surrounding the court. She was not warned for floral abuse; the French historically have a penchant for beheadings. &quot;It&apos;s not easy to come back every time because once it&apos;s going to be too late,&quot; a grinning Safina said. &quot;But impossible is nothing,&quot; The clash of the Ks was not particularly special. Kaia Kanepi, the 22-year-old Estonian, hits the ball reasonably hard, and established a 4-2 first-set lead against a slightly hesitant and nervous Kuznetsova, but ultimately she did not have enough guile to capitalise on this advantage. Kuznetsova will begin today as the favourite against Safina, and holds a 4-3 career advantage, although she will be more than a little wary of her fellow Russian&apos;s reputation as the comeback kid.

That really is the big question facing us as individuals hoping to do something about climate change, and it&apos;s not an easy one to answer. I don&apos;t know about you, but for me the most upsetting moment in An Inconvenient Truth came long after Al Gore scared the hell out of me, constructing an utterly convincing case that the very survival of life on earth as we know it is threatened by climate change. No, the really dark moment came during the closing credits, when we are asked to ... change our lightbulbs. That&apos;s when it got really depressing. The immense disproportion between the magnitude of the problem Gore had described and the puniness of what he was asking us to do about it was enough to sink your heart.  But the drop-in-the-bucket issue is not the only problem lurking behind the &quot;Why bother?&quot; question. Let&apos;s say I do bother, big time. I turn my life upside-down, start biking to work, plant a big garden, turn down the thermostat so low I need the Jimmy Carter signature cardigan, forsake the clothes dryer for a laundry line across the yard, trade in the SUV for a hybrid, get off the beef, go completely local. I could theoretically do all that, but what would be the point when I know full well that halfway around the world there lives my evil twin, some carbon-footprint doppelg\u00e4nger in Shanghai or Chongqing who has just bought his first car (Chinese car ownership is where America&apos;s was back in 1918), is eager to swallow every bite of meat I forswear and who is positively itching to replace every last pound of CO2 I&apos;m struggling no longer to emit. So what exactly would I have to show for all my trouble? A sense of personal virtue, you might suggest, somewhat sheepishly. But what good is that when virtue itself is quickly becoming a term of derision? And not just on the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal or on the lips of the American vice-president, Dick Cheney, who famously dismissed energy conservation as a &quot;sign of personal virtue&quot;. No, it seems the epithet &quot;virtuous&quot;, when applied to an act of personal environmental responsibility, may be used only ironically. Tell me: how did it come to pass that virtue - a quality that for most of history has generally been deemed, well, a virtue - became a mark of liberal softheadedness? How peculiar, that doing the right thing by the environment - buying the hybrid, eating like a locavore - should now set you up for ridicule. And even if in the face of this derision I decide I am going to bother, there arises the whole vexed question of getting it right. Is eating local or walking to work really going to reduce my carbon footprint? According to one analysis, if walking to work increases your appetite and you consume more meat or milk as a result, walking might actually emit more carbon than driving. A handful of studies have recently suggested that in certain cases under certain conditions, produce from places as far away as New Zealand might account for less carbon than comparable domestic products. True, at least one of these studies was co-written by a representative of agribusiness interests in (surprise!) New Zealand, but even so, they make you wonder. If determining the carbon footprint of food is really this complicated, and I&apos;ve got to consider not only &quot;food miles&quot; but also whether the food came by ship or truck and how lushly the grass grows in New Zealand, then maybe on second thoughts I&apos;ll just buy the imported chops, at least until the experts get their footprints sorted out. There are so many stories we can tell ourselves to justify doing nothing, but perhaps the most insidious is that, whatever we do manage to do, it will be too little too late. Climate change is upon us, and it has arrived well ahead of schedule. Scientists&apos; projections that seemed dire a decade ago turn out to have been unduly optimistic: the warming and the melting is occurring much faster than the models predicted. Now truly terrifying feedback loops threaten to boost the rate of change exponentially, as the shift from white ice to blue water in the Arctic absorbs more sunlight and warming soils everywhere become more biologically active, causing them to release their vast stores of carbon into the air. Have you looked into the eyes of a climate scientist recently? They look really scared.  So do you still want to talk about planting gardens? I do. Whatever we can do as individuals to change the way we live at this suddenly very late date does seem utterly inadequate to the challenge. It&apos;s hard to argue with Michael Specter, in a recent New Yorker piece on carbon footprints, when he says: &quot;Personal choices, no matter how virtuous [NB!], cannot do enough. It will also take laws and money.&quot; So it will. Yet it is no less accurate or hardheaded to say that laws and money cannot do enough, either; that it will also take profound changes in the way we live. Why? Because the climate-change crisis is at its very bottom a crisis of lifestyle - of character, even. The Big Problem is nothing more or less than the sum total of countless little everyday choices, most of them made by us (consumer spending represents 70% of our economy), and most of the rest of them made in the name of our needs and desires and preferences.  For us to wait for legislation or technology to solve the problem of how we&apos;re living our lives suggests we&apos;re not really serious about changing - something our politicians cannot fail to notice. They will not move until we do. Indeed, to look to leaders and experts, to laws and money and grand schemes, to save us from our predicament represents precisely the sort of thinking - passive, delegated, dependent for solutions on specialists - that helped get us into this mess in the first place. It&apos;s hard to believe that the same sort of thinking could now get us out of it.  Thirty years ago, Wendell Berry, the farmer and writer, put forward a blunt analysis of precisely this mentality. He argued that the environmental crisis of the 70s - an era innocent of climate change; what we would give to have back that environmental crisis! - was at its heart a crisis of character and would have to be addressed first at that level: at home, as it were. He was impatient with people who wrote cheques to environmental organisations while thoughtlessly squandering fossil fuel in their everyday lives - the 70s equivalent of people buying carbon offsets to atone for their SUVs. Nothing was likely to change until we healed the &quot;split between what we think and what we do&quot;. For Berry, the &quot;Why bother?&quot; question came down to a moral imperative: &quot;Once our personal connection to what is wrong becomes clear, then we have to choose: we can go on as before, recognising our dishonesty and living with it the best we can, or we can begin the effort to change the way we think and live.&quot;  For Berry, the deep problem standing behind all the other problems of industrial civilisation is &quot;specialisation&quot;, which he regards as the &quot;disease of the modern character&quot;. Our society assigns us a tiny number of roles: we&apos;re producers (of one thing) at work, consumers of a great many other things the rest of the time, and then once a year or so we vote as citizens. Virtually all of our needs and desires we delegate to specialists of one kind or another - our meals to agribusiness, health to the doctor, education to the teacher, entertainment to the media, care for the environment to the environmentalist, political action to the politician.  As Adam Smith and many others have pointed out, this division of labour has given us many of the blessings of civilisation. Specialisation is what allows me to sit at a computer thinking about climate change. Yet this same division of labour obscures the lines of connection - and responsibility - linking our everyday acts to their real-world consequences, making it easy for me to overlook the coal-fired power plant that is lighting my screen, or the mountaintop in Kentucky that had to be destroyed to provide the coal to that plant, or the streams running crimson with heavy metals as a result.  Of course, what made this sort of specialisation possible in the first place was cheap energy. Cheap fossil fuel allows us to pay distant others to process our food for us, to entertain us and to (try to) solve our problems, with the result that there is very little we know how to accomplish for ourselves. Think for a moment of all the things you suddenly need to do for yourself when the power goes out - up to and including entertaining yourself. Think, too, about how a power failure causes your neighbours - your community - to suddenly loom so much larger in your life. Cheap energy allowed us to leapfrog community by making it possible to sell our speciality over great distances as well as summon into our lives the specialities of countless distant others.  Here&apos;s the point: cheap energy, which gives us climate change, fosters precisely the mentality that makes dealing with climate change in our own lives seem impossibly difficult. Specialists ourselves, we can no longer imagine anyone but an expert, or anything but a new technology or law, solving our problems. Gore asks us to change the lightbulbs because he probably can&apos;t imagine us doing anything much more challenging, like, say, growing some portion of our own food. We can&apos;t imagine it, either, which is probably why we prefer to cross our fingers and talk about the promise of ethanol and nuclear power - new liquids and electrons to power the same old cars and houses and lives.  The &quot;cheap-energy mind&quot;, as Berry called it, is the mind that asks, &quot;Why bother?&quot; because it is helpless to imagine - much less attempt - a different sort of life, one less divided, less reliant. Since the cheap-energy mind translates everything into money - its proxy - it prefers to put its faith in market-based solutions: carbon taxes and pollution-trading schemes. If we could just get the incentives right, it believes, the economy will properly value everything that matters and nudge our self-interest down the proper channels. The best we can hope for is a greener version of the old invisible hand. Visible hands it has no use for. But while some such grand scheme may well be necessary, it is doubtful that it will be sufficient or that it will be politically sustainable before we have demonstrated to ourselves that change is possible. Merely to give, to spend, even to vote, is not to do, and there is so much that needs to be done - without further delay. In the judgment of James Hansen, the Nasa climate scientist who began sounding the alarm on global warming 20 years ago, we have only 10 years left to start cutting - not just slowing - the amount of carbon we&apos;re emitting or face a &quot;different planet&quot;. Hansen said this more than two years ago, however; two years have gone by, and nothing of consequence has been done. So: eight years left to go - and a great deal left to do. Which brings us back to the &quot;Why bother?&quot; question and how we might better answer it. The reasons not to bother are many and compelling, at least to the cheap-energy mind. But let me offer a few admittedly tentative reasons that we might put on the other side of the scale: If you do bother, you will set an example for other people. If enough other people bother, each one influencing yet another in a chain reaction of behavioural change, markets for all manner of green products and alternative technologies will prosper and expand. (Just look at the market for hybrid cars.) Consciousness will be raised, perhaps even changed: new moral imperatives and new taboos might take root in the culture. Driving an SUV or eating a 24oz steak or illuminating your house like an airport runway at night might come to be regarded as outrages to human conscience. Not having things might become cooler than having them. And those who did change the way they live would acquire the moral standing to demand changes in behaviour from others - from other people, other corporations, even other countries.  All of this could, theoretically, happen. What I&apos;m describing (imagining would probably be more accurate) is a process of viral social change, and change of this kind, which is nonlinear, is never something anyone can plan or predict or count on. Who knows, maybe the virus will reach all the way to Chongqing and infect my Chinese evil twin. Or not. Maybe going green will prove a passing fad and will lose steam after a few years, just as it did in the 80s, when Ronald Reagan took down Jimmy Carter&apos;s solar panels from the roof of the White House.  Going personally green is a bet, nothing more or less, though it&apos;s one we probably all should make, even if the odds of it paying off aren&apos;t great. Sometimes you have to act as if acting will make a difference, even when you can&apos;t prove that it will. That, after all, was precisely what happened in Communist Czechoslovakia and Poland, when a handful of individuals such as V\u00e1clav Havel and Adam Michnik resolved that they would simply conduct their lives &quot;as if&quot; they lived in a free society. That improbable bet created a tiny space of liberty that, in time, expanded to take in, and then help take down, the whole of the eastern bloc.  So what would be a comparable bet that the individual might make in the case of the environmental crisis? Havel himself has suggested that people begin to &quot;conduct themselves as if they were to live on this earth for ever and be answerable for its condition one day&quot;. Fair enough, but let me propose a slightly less abstract and daunting wager. The idea is to find one thing to do in your life that doesn&apos;t involve spending or voting, that may or may not virally rock the world but is real and particular (as well as symbolic) and that, come what may, will offer its own rewards. Maybe you decide to give up meat, an act that would reduce your carbon footprint by as much as a quarter. Or you could try this: determine to observe the Sabbath. For one day a week, abstain completely from economic activity: no shopping, no driving, no electronics.  But the act I want to talk about is growing some - even just a little - of your own food. Rip out your lawn, if you have one, and if you don&apos;t - if you live in a high-rise, or have a garden shrouded in shade - look into getting an allotment. Measured against the Problem We Face, planting a garden sounds pretty benign, I know, but in fact it&apos;s one of the most powerful things an individual can do - to reduce your carbon footprint, sure, but more important, to reduce your sense of dependence and dividedness: to change the cheap-energy mind.  A great many things happen when you plant a vegetable garden, some of them directly related to climate change, others indirect but related nevertheless. Growing food, we forget, comprises the original solar technology: calories produced by means of photosynthesis. Years ago the cheap-energy mind discovered that more food could be produced with less effort by replacing sunlight with fossil-fuel fertilisers and pesticides, with a result that the typical calorie of food energy in your diet now requires about 10 calories of fossil-fuel energy to produce. It&apos;s estimated that the way we feed ourselves (or rather, allow ourselves to be fed) accounts for about a fifth of the greenhouse gas for which each of us is responsible.  Yet the sun still shines down on your garden, and photosynthesis still works so abundantly that in a thoughtfully organised vegetable patch (one planted from seed, nourished by compost from the kitchen and involving not too many drives to the garden centre), you can grow the proverbial free lunch - CO2-free and money-free. This is the most-local food you can possibly eat (not to mention the freshest, tastiest and most nutritious), with a carbon footprint so faint that even the New Zealand lamb council dares not challenge it. And while we&apos;re counting carbon, consider too your compost pile, which shrinks the heap of garbage your household needs trucked away even as it feeds your vegetables and sequesters carbon in your soil. What else? Well, you will probably notice that you&apos;re getting a pretty good workout there in your garden, burning calories without having to get into the car to drive to the gym. (It is one of the absurdities of the modern division of labour that, having replaced physical labour with fossil fuel, we now have to burn even more fossil fuel to keep our unemployed bodies in shape.) Also, by engaging both body and mind, time spent in the garden is time (and energy) subtracted from electronic forms of entertainment. You begin to see that growing even a little of your own food is, as Berry pointed out 30 years ago, one of those solutions that, instead of begetting a new set of problems - the way &quot;solutions&quot; such as ethanol or nuclear power inevitably do - actually beget other solutions, and not only of the kind that save carbon. Still more valuable are the habits of mind that growing a little of your own food can yield. You quickly learn that you need not be dependent on specialists to provide for yourself - that your body is still good for something and may actually be enlisted in its own support. If the experts are right, if both oil and time are running out, these are skills and habits of mind we&apos;re all very soon going to need. We may also need the food. Could gardens provide it? Well, during the second world war victory gardens supplied as much as 40% of the produce Americans ate. But there are sweeter reasons to plant that garden, to bother. At least in this one corner of your yard and life, you will have begun to heal the split between what you think and what you do, to commingle your identities as consumer and producer and citizen. Chances are, your garden will re-engage you with your neighbours, for you will have produce to give away and the need to borrow their tools. You will have reduced the power of the cheap-energy mind by personally overcoming its most debilitating weakness: its helplessness and the fact that it can&apos;t do much of anything that doesn&apos;t involve division or subtraction. The garden&apos;s season-long transit from seed to ripe fruit - will you get a load of those courgettes! - suggests that the operations of addition and multiplication still obtain, that the abundance of nature is not exhausted. The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum, and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world. \u00b7 Michael Pollan is the author of In Defence of Food: An Eater&apos;s Manifesto.", "tags": ["Ethical and green living", "Food", "Environment", "Climate change", "Books", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-05T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/jun/06/isthereanypointingoinggr", "sentences": ["I could theoretically do all that, but what would be the point when I know full well that halfway around the world there lives my evil twin, some carbon-footprint doppelg\u00e4nger in Shanghai or Chongqing who has just bought his first car (Chinese car ownership is where America&apos;s was back in 1918), is eager to swallow every bite of meat I forswear and who is positively itching to replace every last pound of CO2 I&apos;m struggling no longer to emit."], "title": "Is there any point in going green?", "article": "Do you feel it&apos;s a waste of time trying to prevent climate change?

Well don&apos;t, says Michael Pollan, in today&apos;s G2, because even small changes in your lifestyle - and your thinking - can help save the world.  Pollan reckons a lot of people are starting to think &quot;why bother&quot; when it comes to taking action on climate change. Why bother to invest serious money in wind farms, for example, when China and India are continuing to build new coal-powered stations? Why bother to recycle my plastic bottles when my next-door neighbour drives an 4x4?  Let&apos;s say I do bother, big time. I turn my life upside-down, start biking to work, plant a big garden, turn down the thermostat so low I need the Jimmy Carter signature cardigan, forsake the clothes dryer for a laundry line across the yard, trade in the SUV for a hybrid, get off the beef, go completely local. I could theoretically do all that, but what would be the point when I know full well that halfway around the world there lives my evil twin, some carbon-footprint doppelg\u00e4nger in Shanghai or Chongqing who has just bought his first car (Chinese car ownership is where America&apos;s was back in 1918), is eager to swallow every bite of meat I forswear and who is positively itching to replace every last pound of CO2 I&apos;m struggling no longer to emit. So what exactly would I have to show for all my trouble?  And if we do bother, it becomes even trickier to get it right. You only have to look at the story of biofuels to see that we still don&apos;t have any concrete answers on how we can find alternatives to fossil fuel-generated energy. Just a year ago they were being lauded as the answer to all our prayers when it came to finding an alternative energy source to oil for the transport industry, but today, after a number of high-profile reports, they are being blamed for habitat loss and destruction, making CO2 emissions worse, contributing to social and economic problems and causing food shortages in the developing world.  On the other hand, food miles was once an green no-no because of the emissions associated with transporting food long distances. But today those Kenyan green beans aren&apos;t quite as bad when you weigh up the livelihood that growing them provides for farmers in the developing world.  Ethical dilemmas aside, the point is, is any action too little, too late?  Climate change is upon us, and it has arrived well ahead of schedule. Scientists&apos; projections that seemed dire a decade ago turn out to have been unduly optimistic: the warming and the melting is occurring much faster than the models predicted. Now truly terrifying feedback loops threaten to boost the rate of change exponentially, as the shift from white ice to blue water in the Arctic absorbs more sunlight and warming soils everywhere become more biologically active, causing them to release their vast stores of carbon into the air. Have you looked into the eyes of a climate scientist recently? They look really scared.  We&apos;ve seen this debate on this website, on the blogs posts of our Tread lightly initiative, which asks people to pledge to make small changes to their daily lives, that added together will make a big difference.  People have asked whether they should really bother to put out their recycling, or spending thousands of pounds insulating their homes to make them more energy-efficient when our leaders seem to spend most of their time wriggling out of binding targets. Or does our need to wait for legislation or technology to solve the problem of how we&apos;re living our lives suggest we&apos;re not really serious about changing? And is this something our politicians cannot fail to notice?  They will not move until we do. Indeed, to look to leaders and experts, to laws and money and grand schemes, to save us from our predicament represents precisely the sort of thinking - passive, delegated, dependent for solutions on specialists - that helped get us into this mess in the first place. It&apos;s hard to believe that the same sort of thinking could now get us out of it.  So it&apos;s no wonder many people are confused.  But there are many reasons to bother, writes Pollan. You will set an example to other people, and if enough people bother, they can influence behavioural change on a wider scale. Consciousness will be raised and may even change. Markets for consumers with these new values will expand and prosper. New moral imperatives will become established.  And what actions should we bother with?  Growing our own food and becoming more self-sufficient in the face of rising food prices? That&apos;s certainly a good place to start.  Giving up meat? Using the car less?  What do you think?

In spite of which, shiny trousers have always exercised a strange and insidious attraction, from the restoration dandy with his satin-ribboned britches, through the shimmery, graphite-grey, rayon-mix slacks of late-period new romantic pop music - and right up to date with the New Zealand Test team, who have taken the field at Trent Bridge wearing sensational new shiny &quot;supertrousers&quot;. The Black Caps&apos; supertrousers are in keeping with the recent trend for quackish cure-all uber-materials. This time it&apos;s a two-tier process: strides with an integral shammy patch to aid swing-inducing ball-polish; teamed with a thing called &quot;IonX BaseLayer&quot;, said to &quot;improve performance by 2.7%&quot;, which is certainly better than improving it by, say, 2.6%. It is not immediately obvious what a &quot;base layer&quot; is. Having studied the manufacturer&apos;s website, I think it is underpants. And not your standard-issue greying Marks &amp; Spencer boxer but smalls treated with a secret liquid that &quot;delivers ionic energy to the body&quot;. These are bionic underpants, which also &quot;enhance skill and co-ordination&quot;. While performance-enhancing underpants really do sound like a major staging post in the ascent of man (imagine if you put two pairs on, or three, or 10 - that is 27% better already) it is still tempting to wonder whether New Zealand are right to harbour such giddy sartorial expectations. For example, the trousers have had no effect so far on the bowler Chris Martin&apos;s peculiar running style, which looks like someone doing a really energetic impression of a man running, with an unlikely splay-fingered, high-stepping action that, in profile, is an exact facsimile of the flashing green man at a pedestrian crossing. In reality New Zealand&apos;s shiny trousers are no more than a furiously literal-minded response to the ongoing mystery of what it is that makes the cricket ball swing. The engineer who designed them has taken the view that it is all about the nature and quality of polishing, but he might as well have pioneered a special whistle that mimics exactly the sound of a wicketkeeper shouting &quot;aaawwwwbawlin&apos;unlucky!&quot; after every wobbly delivery, or an on-field hologram of a non-striking batsman frowning and doing a &quot;going like a banana&quot; gesture with one finger. The fact is no one really knows the exact formula for hooping it round corners, although having a name like &quot;Ian Botham&quot; or &quot;Wasim Akram&quot; definitely seems to help. And even then, as Waqar Alderman steams in off the angled run in Amazon monsoon conditions, the entire fabric of his gleaming supertrousers stained scarlet, gagging on a family pack of Polos, Troy Cooley murmuring in his ear, Stanley knife embedded in the gleaming, misshapen, horribly gouged new/old cherry held perfectly seam-up in his giant fingers, even then it will still probably not swing. It is all to do with the pollen count, you know, or the particular angle of that new roof at Shanghai central station redirecting certain crucial Pacific breezes. The current trouser-related excitement is sure to change little. The micro-shine patch will pick up lint and fluff. The underpants will lose their unique ionic energy juicing-up qualities in the wash. The only real positive to come out of this is the revelation that cricket remains the kind of game where something important might be decided by what material your trousers are made of. What these trousers really need is to be banned by the authorities. Illicit shiny trousers. Forbidden fruit - with pockets.

The potential challenge posed by the emergence of China as a great power, the rise of India, the hardening of Iranian anti-Westernism and the rise of Islamicist fundamentalism tend to be seen in Britain as discrete and disconnected dramas. How they might relate to the European Union or Latin America, say, is almost never asked. The overriding British default position in foreign policy - that any proposal for co-operation or collaborative action that comes from the EU is necessarily bad and anti-British - only makes discussion even more cramped. Americans think differently. Rather as Britain did when it had an empire, the global scale of American commitments and interests forces American thinking on a grander, more joined-up scale. And Kagan, arch neoconservative, adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain and influence on Barack Obama, certainly thinks grandly. He sees the 21st century as a battleground between liberal democracies and authoritarian states seeking to avenge injustices and reassert their nationalism. The West has no option but to join battle. Thus his call to create a league of democracies that would promote &apos;political liberalisation, support human rights, including the empowerment of women, and use its influence to support a free press and repeated elections that will, if nothing else, continually shift power from the few to the many&apos;. We should never forget that the liberties and international order we enjoy today had to be won by struggle. So it will be again. In a global era, democracy is stronger the more widely it is entrenched and, in any case, our interests, whether combating climate change or fighting Islamicist terror, require more democracy and accountability, not less. Nation states that host terror cells or those that pollute the planet need to know that they risk legitimate intervention from others. It is controversial stuff. The objections are obvious. The United Nations would be devalued and, whatever its weaknesses, it is surely better to have the great powers as members of one global organisation than dividing into two opposing camps. One, centred on the Shanghai Co-operation Council, would be the authoritarian states of China, Russia and others; the second, under US leadership, would be the European and American democracies, Australasia, Japan and India. Instead of struggling for unachievable UN resolutions blocked by the authoritarians, the democracies would be free to go head to head in ideological and political competition. The reaction to Kagan&apos;s book and the championing of its ideas by McCain has been predictable outrage and in many respects I share the concern. Kagan is too airy in his dismissal of the UN. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles of association are among the most inspiring assertions of Enlightenment principles. It may be that Russia and China, or Iran and much of the Muslim world for that matter, do not organise themselves to implement those ideals. But holding them to account for their inadequacies around a globally agreed set of values is vital. The process may be messy, but the alternative - of confrontation, Iraq-type invasions, trade embargoes - is full of risks and self-defeating initiatives, as Iraq has proved. In fairness, Kagan now recognises that Iraq was a disaster, even if he stops short of apologising. But his new proposal is hardly fleshed out. If the aim is to devise yet another way of pursuing his &apos;struggle&apos; by being as confrontational and bellicose as possible to anybody who deviates from aping American democracy then it should be summarily dismissed. But if his league of democracies is to be interpreted as a call for an expanded but loosely organised EU-style association of like-minded states working alongside the UN, then the proposal starts to be more subtle. For Kagan is a great deal kinder to the EU than he has been in the past. The EU&apos;s approach to spreading democracy by setting stringent tests for potential membership has been effective in embedding democracy in the new member states. He no longer condemns Europeans as peace-loving Venusians and leaves the heavy lifting in international affairs to Martian Americans, the heart of his earlier book. Now they are key allies in his global fight. Euroscepticism obstructs a much more important and titanic struggle. If this is his conception, flat opposition makes less sense. The book&apos;s description of the strong nationalist forces emerging in China, Russia and Iran, with their visceral desire to avenge injustices together with their governing classes&apos; stranglehold on power, is sobering. And those who would defend today&apos;s UN at all costs need to be able to show how Japan, Germany, India and Brazil - all great democracies - are ever going to become members of the security council in the face of the implacable opposition of authoritarian China and Russia. There is a battle going on. Authoritarianism is on the rise and it is dangerous. Putting some well-judged edge behind the democracies&apos; defence of their principles and the UN&apos;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not a stupid proposal. Kagan would have made his argument even stronger had he shown how democracy contributes to economic and social strength and thus been more sceptical about the sustainability of Chinese and Russian economic growth without it. But that would have implied that the European approach is more right than American thirst for pitched battles, and there is still something of the neocon night about Kagan&apos;s thinking. But he deserves a hearing and a debate. I have often wondered how Britain&apos;s Eurosceptics would be shown to be out-of-date charlatans, but never thought it would fall to an American neocon to show them up for what they are. \u00b7 To order The Return of History and the End of Dreams for \u00a311.99 with free UK p&amp;p, go to observer.co.uk/bookshop or call 0870 836 0885", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-07T23:06:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/10/china.usa", "sentences": ["On Thursday, 37 years after he was unwittingly deployed in &quot;ping pong diplomacy&quot;, Braithwaite will play a rematch against Liang Geliang, the top ranked Chinese player he faced in 1971 during the tour of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou."], "title": "New round of ping pong diplomacy", "article": "The nine American table tennis players who crossed into China from Hong Kong in April 1971 were, by their own admission, wholly at a loss about what was happening.

Sleepers are in the spotlight because First Great Western has announced that it will no longer put strangers together on the sleeper from London to Cornwall. &quot;It is considered more appropriate in the modern age to allow people their privacy,&quot; says a spokesman. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t expect to share a hotel room with a stranger and nor should you expect to share a sleeper carriage with someone you don&apos;t know.&quot; Sharing on the London-Cornwall service has, in the past, saved you a tenner, which does indeed seem an economy too far, though if you&apos;re doing it every week maybe you&apos;re prepared to put up with close proximity to a stranger to save \u00a3500 a year. A friend who makes the journey regularly says the compartment is too small - and far too intimate - for both occupants to change into their nightclothes at the same time. A diplomatic absence is necessary. He also complains of the drunks who stumble back to the shared compartment in the early hours of the morning and try to get into the wrong bunk. I pray that Mr NRS does not make a late appearance. First also runs the sleeper service to Scotland, and says it is considering whether to end sharing by strangers on this line, too. Ellen Wacher, who I meet in the restaurant car soon after we&apos;ve pulled out of Euston, reckons that&apos;s &quot;ridiculous&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ve travelled widely on sleepers in south-east Asia and I don&apos;t see any problem with sharing,&quot; she says. &quot;Is this aversion to sharing a peculiarly British thing, part of our insular, island mentality?&quot; Her question is rhetorical; she clearly thinks it is. Ellen and husband Tim are going to Fort William for a couple of days for Tim&apos;s birthday. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t consider ourselves train anoraks, but we do enjoy travelling by train,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s the only civilised way to travel,&quot; adds Ellen.  Tim has a question, too - and a theory. &quot;Is stopping sharing being used as an excuse to close the service down?&quot; he wonders. &quot;As I understand it, the Cornish service has been under threat. I used to work for the railways back in the 60s, and the great way to close them was to somehow get the traffic down and then they could turn around and say, &apos;We can&apos;t justify running it&apos;.&quot;  I&apos;ve settled into the restaurant car with Ellen, Tim and half a dozen other passengers to enjoy the poetry of the journey. The poetry is not helped by the fact that the train makes an early stop at Watford Junction and then glides through Hemel Hempstead, but somehow the spirit still soars. Ellen says her dream is to travel on the Trans-Siberian Express, but this is enough to be going on with. I admire her defence of sharing with strangers, but I&apos;m secretly rather glad that Mr NRS hasn&apos;t shown up. That compartment really is too small: what if his feet smelled, or he snored, or he was planning to re-enact the murder on the Orient Express as we passed through Preston? In any case, I&apos;ve decided Mr NRS is a Gogol-esque joke on the part of the rail company. They&apos;ve probably rumbled the fact that I&apos;m a journalist and are anxious for me to avoid the excessive intimacy of the shared experience. I&apos;ve shared sleepers abroad and the experiences have been mixed. Once I hopped on a train in Paris at the last minute and got the last berth on the sleeper to Venice. My three companions in the compartment were all women, and they looked horrified when I sweatily joined them. I had the top bunk, didn&apos;t get a moment&apos;s sleep, and had a smelly pair of shoes that I tried to lock inside a cupboard next to my pillow. It was 14 hours of hell - for all of us. I also took a sleeper once from Delhi to Kolkata and that was fun, sharing with two middle-aged businessmen who regaled me with tales of life in India and insisted on sharing their tiffin, too. Here was an experience that added to one&apos;s pleasure and understanding, but somehow I couldn&apos;t see that being replicated en route to Crewe.  While not exotic - all the meals come out of tins - the restaurant car on the Caledonian Sleeper is pleasant enough. Cheap, too: salmon p\u00e2t\u00e9 is \u00a33, a plate of haggis, neeps and tatties \u00a34, half a litre of Tennent&apos;s lager \u00a31.80. It is said that the service is protected by the phalanx of Scottish MPs who rely on its comforts, and they appear to have preserved their subsidised food and drink as well. The haggis, in redcurrant and whisky sauce, is excellent. The Tennent&apos;s is pretty good, too. &quot;The bar will be closing at 1.30am,&quot; matron tells me. &quot;We want to make sure you get some sleep.&quot; Paul Donaldson, a regular on the Fort William service, is sitting in the restaurant car with his laptop. He says he gets to the Highlands as often as he can to clear his head. &quot;There&apos;s something quite magical about leaving a metropolis at quarter past nine, going to bed and then waking up and finding yourself suddenly transported into the west Scottish mountains,&quot; he says. &quot;Once we get past Glasgow and go up towards Loch Lomond, the scenery will open out. Today is an impulse for me: I wasn&apos;t planning to take the sleeper today - I&apos;ve got something on elsewhere later in the week - but I thought, &apos;Sod it, I&apos;m going to take a couple of days and go up there.&apos;&quot; Donaldson has no problems with sharing. &quot;If I share, I share; if I don&apos;t share, I don&apos;t share,&quot; he says philosophically. &quot;It doesn&apos;t bother me that a complete stranger is in the compartment. In fact, sometimes it makes it a more interesting experience. It&apos;s a very intimate space and trying to jostle each other to use the basin can be a challenge, but it&apos;s part and parcel of the whole thing. To tell you the truth, I think it might lose part of its appeal to people who are trying to find a tiny bit of adventure in a society which is becoming full of bubblegum. We live in a nanny state and, in deciding that they don&apos;t want strangers sharing, First Great Western are probably thinking in terms of liability issues.&quot; He sees the move away from sharing with strangers as part of a societal change. &quot;We have become a more private nation. We&apos;ve started to value our space and privacy more. I think that&apos;s probably a reflection of the intrusion that people feel they are having in their daily lives. They see their home space as theirs, and in an age of more and more intrusion they don&apos;t want their own sleeping habits invaded. You&apos;ve also got sexuality to worry about these days ...&quot; This last phrase is unfortunate, and Ellen is on to it in a flash. &quot;Excuse me, is that something new? Is sexuality something that&apos;s just happened?&quot; she demands. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s new, but there is more awareness of it now,&quot; replies Donaldson. &quot;I think the train company are covering their backs, so to speak, from allegations of improper behaviour.&quot; This is getting out of hand, and it&apos;s definitely time for another Tennent&apos;s. The waitress in the restaurant car is Suzie Kane. She has worked on the sleeper for seven years - one week on, one week off - and loves it. &quot;It&apos;s really interesting; you meet so many different kinds of people: lots of climbers and hill walkers going to Fort William, business travellers, lots of regulars who work in London and go back home for the weekend. We get to know them by name. It&apos;s a real family atmosphere.&quot; Though they do stop serving Tennent&apos;s in the wee small hours, the restaurant car is open all night for tea and coffee, so Suzie never gets to sleep. &quot;Normally after midnight most people are away to their beds,&quot; she says. &quot;I read my book and pass the time. I found it disorientating at first, but you get used to it.&quot; Matron, AKA my &quot;sleeper host&quot;, AKA Kate Parkington, is also taken with the camaraderie of the service. She&apos;s been going back and forth from Euston to Fort William for 16 years, having originally done it on as a summer relief job. &quot;You do get the odd obnoxious person,&quot; she says, &quot;but on the whole everyone is so friendly. There are some real regulars. We&apos;d had a landslip once and the service was cancelled for a couple of weeks. Then when I came back to work, coming out of London one of my regulars said, &apos;Oh Kate, it&apos;s lovely to see you,&apos; and gave me a big hug. That&apos;s nice. You&apos;ll not get that in Tesco&apos;s.&quot; Are people generally happy to share? &quot;On the whole we don&apos;t have any problems,&quot; she says. &quot;People accept the fact that they might be sharing. It&apos;s normally one of the first questions you get: &apos;Will I have somebody with me?&apos;&quot; Kate says she uses her discretion when it comes to allocating berths, and moves people around if she thinks someone will have trouble negotiating an upper bunk, or if two large people are down to share together.  &quot;Take tonight,&quot; she says. &quot;There were two gentlemen travelling separately but booked into the same compartment, and I&apos;ve moved one of them because he had quite a bit of luggage and he&apos;s a really big bloke. I try to be helpful if I can. If I can&apos;t I can&apos;t, and most people are prepared to accept that and will squeeze in together, but I thought this was going to be uncomfortable for them and I had an extra berth.&quot; Does she have problems with drunks? &quot;Stag parties can be interesting. As you can imagine, eight or 10 blokes, all giving it what for. Most of them are fine; they get a bit boozy, but you growl at them and they usually quieten down. If they are totally drunk, you have to say &apos;bed now, or off&apos;. We don&apos;t get too many of those. Male bonding parties are good, too. That&apos;s when you get the real drunks. I had a coach load of them one night and they were loud. They had been doing their bonding in the Highlands, and this was them coming back. You just have to be tough with them. Act tough.&quot; Lucky I didn&apos;t have that fourth can of Tennent&apos;s. By 1am the restaurant car is more or less empty. Suzie has settled into a corner with a thick thriller; Kate is learning Spanish with the help of a pocket dictionary; Ellen and Tim have gone to bed; Paul, though, is accessing Facebook on his computer and evidently has no intention of retiring. But I do and, shortly after a brief stop at Crewe, I head for my small but gloriously unoccupied compartment.  I get changed - it&apos;s a tight squeeze, even for one - and clamber unsteadily on to the top bunk, showing slavish devotion to what it says on my ticket. (Do I think Mr NRS will suddenly materialise in the middle of the night?) Miraculously, unlike continental sleepers, the bed can accommodate my 6ft 4in frame, though I find it more comfortable if I put my feet in the luggage rack. Crewe has been left far behind; Garelochhead, Crianlarich and Upper Tyndrum beckon. Who needs the Trans-Siberian Express? Lights out, I dream of the Scottish Highlands - and haggis in redcurrant and whisky sauce. I&apos;m not sure, however, that &quot;sleeper&quot; is the best term. &quot;Dozer&quot; might be more appropriate, as I don&apos;t think I&apos;m deeply asleep for the entire seven hours I spend in my bunk. The motion of the train takes some getting used to, and you&apos;re aware of every gear change. At 4am the train reaches Edinburgh, where it divides into three parts, with six carriages heading to Inverness, four to Aberdeen, and our intrepid two to Fort William. I&apos;d intended to get up at first light to see the sun rising over the highland peaks. Needless to say, I was still dozing - which was just as well as, according to the fools who did get up, there was no sun and the highland peaks were shrouded in mist. I never do manage to get the blind up, and it&apos;s still dark in my compartment when Kate calls me at 7.30am with a cup of tea and a plasticised croissant. Paul, the technophile, is already in the restaurant car, looking bouncy, carrying a large camera, and talking non-stop. He tells me we are about to pass through the highest station in Britain, which somehow fails to electrify me at 8.30 in the morning. The sheer emptiness of the moors is impressive, though: just heather, streams, lochs, randomly distributed rocks, small groups of deer and the occasional ruined house. Paul also tells me the trains on this line use a unique signalling system, though the precise nature of its uniqueness eludes me. We have now been travelling for 12 hours, but because of the seven-hour doze and my haggis-inflected dreams I have no sense of exhaustion. Nor have I experienced boredom, apart from during Paul&apos;s explanation of the unique signalling system. The seats in the restaurant car are large and well padded - which is handy because Paul and I are large and well padded, too.  This is proper, old-fashioned train travel, not the modern, battery-hen variety. The journey is an escape from life, not the sort of intensification of its worst features that commuting tends to be. No one is using a mobile, or listening to rap music, or even obsessing over sudoku. This is travel that permits self-reflection. &quot;And the end of all our exploring/Will be to arrive where we started/And know the place for the first time,&quot; as T S Eliot had it. Eliot, though, may never have visited Fort William, for here, as the town looms through the mist, reality intrudes. The first thing you see as the train lurches into the station is a branch of Lidl. The dreamy state of sleeperdom is over. But at least the gents in the station has a shower, and I only have 11 hours to kill before I take the sleeper back. I wonder if Lidl sells haggis. Sleeper etiquette Choosing a bunkSome train companies pre-allocate your bunk, but those that don&apos;t present an immediate issue: should you opt for the top or bottom bunk? Top tip: if you want more privacy, but don&apos;t mind hauling yourself up a ladder (carpeted, mind), head for the top bunk. It also means you don&apos;t have to unlock the door in the morning when the guard loudly knocks on the door with his key to herald what must rank - whatever train company you&apos;re travelling with - as the world&apos;s most disappointing breakfast. ConversationBe honest: you both wish the other wasn&apos;t there. So why bother with conversation? Do you really want to hear about how badly their regional sales team is performing this month? Exchange some pleasantries if you wish, but best to get tucked up and off to sleep as soon as possible. The only need-to-know is what time you both have to get up. Getting undressedAlways offer to leave the berth to allow the other passenger to disrobe in privacy. Being in very close proximity to a stranger half stepping into a pair of pyjamas when the train suddenly jerks violently is, as I can testify, an experience that will indelibly stain your brain. Preferably, the passenger using the top bunk gets undressed first so that they can then safely turn their back on the other passenger without fear of catching a Freudian slip in the shaving mirror. The reading lightYou may well have bought along a copy of Murder on the Orient Express to add a frisson of excitement, but staying up until midnight reading is sure to irritate your fellow passenger. Lights out at 11pm, please. Ear plugsYes. Unless you like to be kept awake by the snoring, flatulence and sleeptalking. The barDon&apos;t. Yes, sipping whisky until the wee hours has a James Bond-like appeal, but the reality is that bars on sleeper trains are a magnet for some of life&apos;s less appealing characters. Try to imagine an incoherent barfly from a Tom Waits song shooting the breeze with David Brent. All that&apos;s served up is a cocktail of melancholy, self-doubt and longing for a less transitory life.  The sinkThe squeamish - and women - should look away now. Sinks on sleepers are not just used for brushing teeth. They are there for the lazy and coarse among us -namely men - to relieve themselves. A guard I spoke to once said this is why they get people to share berths: the presence of another passenger helps with &quot;potty training&quot;. Brush your teeth before you set off. Leo Hickman   Great sleeper journeys of the world St Petersburg to Moscow on the Red ArrowThe Krasnaya Streyla (Red Arrow) has been the premier link between Moscow and St Petersburg since communist times, for party officials and well-heeled tourists alike. With lacy curtains at each window and immaculately dressed conductors in charge of each car, it departs at five minutes to midnight every day. It&apos;s no longer the only prestige option between these cities: the Nikolaevsky Express and the luxurious privately run Grand Express now give the Red Arrow a run for its money. Paris to Barcelona by TrainhotelThe Spanish know the value of a good sleeper train, and their unique &quot;trainhotels&quot; link Madrid with Paris and Lisbon, Barcelona with Paris, Zurich, Malaga and Milan, with elegant restaurant cars, a vibrant cafe-bar and cosy sleepers, including some gran clase sleepers with private shower and toilet. There&apos;s nothing better than travelling gran clase to Spain, a three-course meal in the restaurant rounded off with coffee and liqueurs, retiring to bed in a private room, then waking to coffee, croissants and wild Spanish scenery. Central Europe by City Night Line The Germans also know a thing or two about sleeper trains, and have invested in new air-conditioned sleeping-cars for their City Night Line overnight trains, some of them double-deck. If you&apos;re in the money you can book a deluxe compartment with private shower and toilet. The sleepers have made something of a comeback, and since December last year you can once again board an evening sleeper in Amsterdam and end up in Prague, Vienna, Copenhagen or Milan next morning, with breakfast included in the fare. Or how about Zurich to Berlin or Paris to Munich? The softly lit bistro car makes the perfect place for a drink or late dinner before heading off to bed. Paris to the Riviera on the Train BleuOfficially now just another Corail Lun\u00e9a overnight train (how the French Railways love their brand names), the staff at the Gare d&apos;Austerlitz know the true identity of this train full well, and still show it on the departure indicator as the celebrated Train Bleu. Once the only way for civilised travellers to reach the French Riviera, it now lacks proper wagons-lits, but its couchettes and reclining seats still link Paris with Cannes, Nice and Monte Carlo every night. When you awake in your couchette and lift the blind, you&apos;ll find the train running along the fabulous C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur coastline, past millionaires&apos; villas and yacht-filled harbours. Along the Nile from Cairo to LuxorEvery night, two air-conditioned sleeper trains head up the Nile from Cairo to Luxor and Aswan. Well-used by tourists to this day, they offer private one- and two-bed compartments with comfortable upper and lower berths and a washbasin. There&apos;s also a club car for that welcome nightcap. Fall asleep as the train leaves the Cairo metropolis, wake with all the sights of the Nile valley outside your bedroom window, from dhows and cruise boats on the river to fellahin toiling in the fields among the palm trees. Delhi to Kolkata by Rajdhani ExpressThe most prestigious trains in India, the Rajdhani Expresses link Delhi with major cities such as Kolkata or Mumbai, overnight. They&apos;re fully air-conditioned, with a veg or non-veg curry included in the fare and served at your seat. At night, berths fold out and bedding is distributed by the attendant, as the train speeds across the subcontinent at up to 100mph. Today&apos;s Rajdhani may be fast and electric, but you will still wake to the tea vendor&apos;s cry of &quot;Chai, chai, garam chai&quot; as he walks the coaches selling his hot sweet tea. Beijing to Shanghai overnightEvery night, a fleet of modern air-conditioned sleeper trains whisk travellers from the Chinese capital to Shanghai at up to 125mph while they sleep. The four-berth &quot;soft sleeper&quot; compartments come with lace curtains, thickly padded berths and a traditional flask of hot water (for tea) wedged under the table. Your berth may even feature a personal TV screen. Why I hate sleepers I have only done it once, and it was miserable. The compartment was cramped but, I thought, sufficient. That was before I realised I would be sharing it with a student. Forget about personal space. If you are standing in a sleeping compartmentwith someone else you are, by definition, standing too close to them. So, for the nonsleeping portion of the journey, only one of you will be in there. I was happy to award temporary custody to the student, but that was before I saw the bar. Far from being a romantic mode of transport, the Inverness sleeper appeared to be a convenient way for alcoholics to travel in the company of other alcoholics. The bar car was packed and everyone, apart from a pairof bewildered American tourists, was plastered. I drank one beer in the corridor and read standing up for an hour. When I went back for a second, they were out of beer. At ten o&apos;clock I gave up and went to bed. I had the lower bunk. Every time you get out of the lower bunk and stand up, you are nose to nose with the person in the upper bunk, so I decided that once I had settled in for the night I would not move . But whenever the student in the upper bunk had business elsewhere \u2014 which he did, often \u2014 Ibecame convinced that he was going to step on my face. So I couldn&apos;t sleep. I finished my book, and then started it again. Eventually I drifted off , only to be woken at 7am by a purser who handed me a waffle and told me we were in a siding. If we&apos;re standing still, I thought, then this is no longer an unpleasant mode of transport. This is just jail. The train finally arrived seven hours late. On the way back I paid double for the same compartment, but without the student and, to be fair, it was still miserable.Tim Dowling", "tags": ["Rail travel", "Travel", "Transport", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-09T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/jun/10/usinterestrates.equities", "sentences": ["China&apos;s main stock market, the Shanghai composite index, tumbled by almost 8% today, continuing its sharp decline since last November.", "The Shanghai composite index, which closed at 3,073 points, is 50% lower than its peak last October when it reached 6,124.", "Some of the falls were also due to the markets such as Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney \u2013 which were closed on Monday - catching up with earlier losses on Wall Street and London."], "title": "Hard-talking Bernanke spooks the markets", "article": "Stock markets in Europe and Asia fell today after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke appeared to hint that inflationary pressures will prevent another cut in US interest rates.

Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index shed over 4% as some Asian investors took fright, with Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei falling 1.1%. Europe&apos;s markets shared in the negative sentiment, with the FTSE down 1.15% at one stage. It closed down 50 points at 5,827.3.

Bernanke&apos;s vow that the Fed would &quot;strongly resist an erosion of longer- term inflation expectations&quot; was taken as a warning that US interest rates will not be cut again.

Rebecca(Alfred Hitchcock, 1940)2.35pm, BBC2 Hitchcock&apos;s tale about the dangers of marrying on the rebound is a droll gothic exercise. Joan Fontaine goes to live at the vast stately pile owned by new husband Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier), who is haunted by his dead first wife, Rebecca; Judith Anderson is Mrs Danvers, the morbid housekeeper who makes the bride&apos;s life hell. A five-star melodrama. The Adventures Of Huck Finn(Stephen Sommers, 1993)3.50pm, Five Here&apos;s elfin Elijah Wood as a small chap experiencing big adventures in a dangerous world - and it&apos;s not The Lord Of The Rings. Playing the young hero of Mark Twain&apos;s classic novel he is all wide-eyed and wonder-struck - in fact, very much the look he perfected in the Tolkien epic. Meanwhile, director Stephen &quot;The Mummy&quot; Sommers keeps it pacy and entertaining. When Harry Met Sally(Rob Reiner, 1989)5.50pm, Five Despite the screen&apos;s most celebrated orgasm - when Sally (Meg Ryan) demonstrates to Harry (Billy Crystal) in a busy cafe - there&apos;s an old-fashioned feel to Reiner&apos;s romantic comedy. It&apos;s sparky, funny and light of touch; so is the acting. Nice story too: the couple meet intermittently over 12 years - then they shrug their shoulders and jump into bed. Mr And Mrs Smith(Doug Liman, 2005)10pm, C4 Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are the Smiths who, unbelievably, don&apos;t know that their spouse is actually a hitman/woman, and are terribly bored with each other. Still, all is resolved by a little therapy and a lot of superbly choreographed gunplay, when they are contracted to kill each other, in a silly, sexy and stylish comedy. Hannibal(Ridley Scott, 2001)10.15pm, ITV1 This long-awaited sequel to The Silence Of The Lambs suffered a large helping of production troubles, with original director Jonathan Demme and star Jodie Foster both bailing out. But Anthony Hopkins is back, tongue firmly in cheek as the refined old cannibal Hannibal Lecter, now living and dining quietly in Florence. Julianne Moore takes over as FBI agent Clarice Starling. Mystic Pizza(Donald Petrie, 1988)12.10am, C4 Poignant and comic study of three girls learning about life and men in the Connecticut seaside town of Mystic. Julia Roberts, Annabeth Gish and Lili Taylor are waitresses at the local pizza parlour, balancing friendships, romantic dreams and sorry affairs on their plates. Nicely acted. The Joy Luck Club(Wayne Wang, 1993)12.55am, BBC2 The Joy Luck Club is an American mah-jong club where four elderly Chinese women meet. At a party for one of their daughters (Ming-na Wen) who is leaving for China, the women start to recount their life struggles: of war and arranged marriages. Amy Tan wrote this richly moving adaptation of her own bestselling novel, a giant cross-cultural woman&apos;s weepie and unashamed mainstream success for Wang. Sunday June 15 Jeremiah Johnson(Sydney Pollack, 1972)1pm, ITV1 The late Sydney Pollack&apos;s wilderness western stars his longtime collaborator Robert Redford as the legendary JJ, an ex-soldier who tires of civilisation and heads for the snowy wilds of the mountains, where he becomes a feared Indian fighter. A magnificent, meditative portrait of man pitted against nature, it was superbly shot in Utah by Duke Callaghan. Rio Bravo(Howard Hawks, 1958)3pm, ITV1 In Hawks&apos;s riposte to High Noon, sheriff John Wayne doesn&apos;t scurry around town looking for help against the bad guys; he believes in himself and his motley crew - Dean Martin&apos;s town drunk, creaky old Walter Brennan, bar gal Angie Dickinson and young gun Ricky Nelson. It&apos;s a long, easy-going and humorous western with strong thoughts on friendship and pulling together in the face of adversity. Hawks revisited the territory in El Dorado and Rio Lobo, but this is the best. Evelyn(Bruce Beresford, 2002)4.40pm, BBC2 A shamelessly sentimental drama based on the true story of a single father in 1950s Ireland who battles the authorities to hang on to his three children after being abandoned by the woman of the house. Pierce Brosnan takes time out from his 007 shenanigans to play the charismatic hero. The Legend Of Bagger Vance(Robert Redford, 2000)4.45pm, Five The story of how Matt Damon&apos;s Rannulph Junuh gets his swing back. Since his return from the first world war he&apos;s hit the bottle, made his girlfriend - Savannah heiress Adele (Charlize Theron) - miserable and just can&apos;t get it together on her dad&apos;s glorious golf course. Just when you think he can&apos;t possibly win the tournament she&apos;s fixed up, in steps Will Smith&apos;s Bagger Vance, the caddy from heaven, to teach him about life, putting, and everything. Maid In Manhattan(Wayne Wang, 2002)8.30pm, Five Cinderella chambermaid and single mum Jennifer Lopez slips on some designer evening wear and into a romance with Prince Charming, AKA handsome senatorial candidate Ralph Fiennes, who thinks she&apos;s a socialite. Will he stay if she tells him the truth? Moderately funny. Mad Max(George Miller, 1979)10.35pm, Five The Australian cult road movie that introduced Max Rockatansky to the world, and sped Mel Gibson along the road to stardom. Max is a fairly peaceable cop who is transformed into an implacable black-leather knight on wheels when wife and son are killed by a grotesque biker gang; a bleak but sometimes comic vision of a post-apocalyptic world. Kung Fu Hustle(Stephen Chow, 2004)12.10am, C4 Hong Kong superstar Chow is the new Jackie Chan, and this follow-up to the delirious kung-footie film Shaolin Soccer is another delightfully silly martial arts adventure. Chow himself stars as oriental slacker Sing, whose ambition to join the infamous Axe Gang in 1940s Shanghai leads him into trouble with the lawless denizens of Pig Sty Alley. Great, knockabout fun. Middletown(Brian Kirk, 2006)12.45am, BBC2 Matthew Macfadyen stars as Gabriel Hunter, a minister who returns to his native Ulster village to preach hellfire and damnation: where the previous incumbent had let things slide, he starts denouncing the local cockfighters, his sister-in-law, and even his own father. What starts out as a bit of a laugh grows ever more hysterical. Monday June 16 Can-Can(Walter Lang, 1960)12.30pm, C4 Shirley Maclaine is the cafe owner in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris who insists on staging the infamously erotic dance, and is no mean practitioner herself; Frank Sinatra is her lawyer-boyfriend defending her in court before the judges, hedonist Maurice Chevalier and prim Louis Jourdan. Manhunter(Michael Mann, 1986)10.35pm, ITV1 Brett Ratner remade this adaptation of Thomas Harris&apos;s novel, Red Dragon, but it doesn&apos;t match the brilliant original. FBI man Will Graham (William Petersen) is trying to track down a horrific serial killer, and enlists the aid of the imprisoned, super-intelligent people-eater Hannibal Lecktor - the name was spelt differently then, though Brian Cox is as impressive in the role as Anthony Hopkins. Tequila Sunrise(Robert Towne, 1988)11.05pm, Five A rare foray into directing by Towne, who is better known as a scriptwriter (Chinatown is among his credits). He also wrote this Mexico-border drama about narcotics cop Kurt Russell&apos;s crisis of conscience when he confronts lifelong buddy and cocaine dealer Mel Gibson. The pair are also rivals for Michelle Pfeiffer&apos;s tasty restaurateur, and it all comes to a violent conclusion when no-good Raul Julia makes Gibson a criminal offer he finds hard to refuse. Tuesday June 17 I Could Go On Singing(Ronald Neame, 1963)12.35pm, C4 Judy Garland was approaching the end of her tormented career, and much of the melodrama of this tale of the trials and tribulations of a London Palladium star verges on the autobiographical. It&apos;s a patchy business, cobbled together as and when the ailing lady was well enough to perform, but with Dirk Bogarde offering selfless support it rings the emotions mercilessly. About Adam(Gerard Stembridge, 2000)11.35pm, BBC1 Kate Hudson&apos;s Lucy is a thoroughly charming young singing Dubliner who falls for wonderful Adam (Stuart Townsend) when he walks into her restaurant. Passion blossoms, but unfortunately for her, he also bewitches the rest of her family: sisters Frances O&apos;Connor and Charlotte Bradley, Mum Rosaleen Linehan, brother Alan Maher - they all swoon before him. Thursday June 19 The Bold And The Brave(Lewis R Foster, 1956)12.45pm, C4 A routine second world war movie reinforced with some decent characterisation. It&apos;s set on the front line in Italy, with Oscar-nominated Mickey Rooney as a soldier who, in between the fighting, wins $30,000 in a dramatic game of craps (that&apos;s dice): but will he survive to get the dosh home? Friday June 20 Intermission(John Crowley, 2003)11.40pm, BBC1 This punchy, funny, Dublin-set love story follows the fortunes of a dozen or so characters dealing with broken hearts, rubbish jobs, a crashed bus and a bank robbery. At the centre is Cillian Murphy&apos;s John, who is pining for his ex, Deirdre (Kelly Macdonald); but she&apos;s moved in with a bank manager (Michael McElhatton). When robber Colin Farrell&apos;s Lehiff invites him to help rob the bank, he spies payback time. Meanwhile, Colm Meaney&apos;s ludicrous detective Jerry Lynch stalks the streets like a poor man&apos;s Popeye Doyle, documentarist in tow. Honkytonk Man(Clint Eastwood, 1983)1.40am, ITV1 Director Clint also stars as the washed-up, tubercular country and western singer travelling on a picaresque 1930s journey from California to his own personal last chance saloon in Nashville, Tennessee. In tow are grandaddy John McIntire and his teenage nephew (played by Clint&apos;s son Kyle). Melancholic, poignant, and done with a real feel for the time and the music.", "tags": ["Culture", "Television", "Television & radio"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-13T23:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/14/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview10", "sentences": ["The real world, in which he was formed, was Shanghai, where he was born in 1930 and brought up as a typical privileged expatriate boy in the city&apos;s International Settlement, without learning Chinese or tasting a morsel of native cuisine.", "Ballard had held back for 40 years before tackling his own exotic history, and he has told the tale again, in yet plainer fashion, in Miracles of Life, which is subtitled &quot;Shanghai to Shepperton&quot;.", "As a child in Shanghai, he had observed a lot of death and dereliction."], "title": "A life in books: J G Ballard", "article": "Visitors to JG Ballard&apos;s semi-detached domain in Shepperton, beyond the far reaches of suburban west London, experience a sense of stepping through the looking glass. As a writer, Ballard is the ultimate urbanist, the master blender of technology and desire. In his front room, seated at a large oak table that supports a typewriter, he rhapsodises &quot;the motorway, this road with no light that says STOP, the view through the windshield, the cross-patterns of chromium and glass that beckon you towards a better world . . .&quot; As a housekeeper, however, Ballard, who lives alone, resides in the era before the term &quot;mod con&quot; was invented. A 20-year-old Ford Granada of indistinct hue slumps on the narrow driveway, jammed up against the front entrance. Indoors, the curtains, neither open nor closed, are held in limbo by a giant dehydrated plant that has collapsed on to the table, blocking all but the most determined approach. Lost amid the mini-jungle of its dried-up fronds is a dust-covered Collins Dictionary. Ballard&apos;s electrical fixtures would interest the curator of the Design Museum. On a cold day, the rooms are warmed by small heaters positioned in the middle of the floor. The sleek stylist of western consumerism never got round to installing central heating. &quot;I came to live in Shepperton in 1960. I thought: the future isn&apos;t in the metropolitan areas of London. I want to go out to the new suburbs, near the film studios. This was the England I wanted to write about, because this was the new world that was emerging. No one in a novel by Virginia Woolf ever filled up the petrol tank of their car.&quot; The proximity of Shepperton film studios was important. &quot;They were why I picked this place. The entertainment medium of film is particularly tuned to the present imaginations of people at large. A lot of fiction is intensely nostalgic.&quot; Ballard claims that he has &quot;always treated England as a strange fiction&quot;. The real world, in which he was formed, was Shanghai, where he was born in 1930 and brought up as a typical privileged expatriate boy in the city&apos;s International Settlement, without learning Chinese or tasting a morsel of native cuisine. &quot;I didn&apos;t have a Chinese meal until I returned to England.&quot; In 1943, his world flipped upside down when he was incarcerated with his parents in the Lunghua detention camp. In his collection of memoirs, Miracles of Life, published earlier this year, Ballard writes that he was &quot;largely happy&quot; in Lunghua, finding there &quot;a relaxed and easygoing world&quot; that he had not known in everyday life. He claims that he thrived during his two and a half years in detention, &quot;even when food rations fell to near zero, skin infections covered my legs, malnutrition had prolapsed my rectum, and many of the adults had lost heart&quot;. James Graham Ballard is a large man with mischief in his eye and the social manner of a retired civil servant. At 77, he is portly, with grey hair curling on to his shirt collar. He has a full-on way with a good chablis - &quot;More! More!&quot; - but is considerate enough to inquire of his guest: &quot;Do you have a motor car out there? We don&apos;t want you to be killed.&quot; Propped on the mantelpiece is a large, colourful painting by the Belgian surrealist Paul Delvaux. It shows a formally attired woman regarding her naked self in a mirror. In fact, both this picture and its equally striking companion in the adjoining room are specially commissioned copies, painted from black-and-white photographs. The originals were destroyed in the Blitz. &quot;They represent everything I&apos;m about, and I don&apos;t care who knows it.&quot; The discrepancy does nothing to dim his pleasure in the works. &quot;In a sense, fakes are the only authenticity remaining to us.&quot; Until the early 1980s, there were two JG Ballards: one wrote science fiction, including The Drowned World, his first novel, published in 1962, and the short stories contained in The Terminal Beach (1964). The other produced intense, tightly focused narratives of apocalyptic realism, such as High-Rise, which examines &quot;a well-to-do proletariat&quot; jammed into a block of luxury flats in what has since become Canary Wharf. The novel traces the residents&apos; descent into a moral cannibalism reminiscent of Lord of the Flies. His most outrageously imaginative book, Crash, belongs in this group. It positions the bisexual &quot;James Ballard&quot; (a fictional character) in counterpoint with the psychopathic Vaughan, who plans an orgasmic collision with Elizabeth Taylor&apos;s limousine as it emerges from Shepperton film studios, but dies in the attempt. In Concrete Island, another tour de force of the urban highway, the architect Maitland overturns his Jaguar and is stranded for weeks on an embankment beside the Westway in Shepherd&apos;s Bush. These novels, written in quick succession between 1973 and 1975 and considered by many to be Ballard&apos;s best, are all set in present time and are futurological only in prophetic terms. Science fiction was a &quot;chance discovery. It touched a spark, but I never wrote the kind of SF that was typical of the time.&quot; The novelist M John Harrison, who was part of the editorial team of New Worlds, the magazine that published many of Ballard&apos;s most controversial stories in the 60s, points out that he was &quot;never well received by generic SF readers and activists. His work is too clearly poetic, satirical, metaphorical - all of which discourages suspension of disbelief and the immersive experience of the exotic on which SF pivots.&quot; Dinah Birch, professor of English at Liverpool University, who has written widely on science fiction, says that Ballard was nevertheless &quot;one of the most significant figures in the 60s New Wave. His bleak dystopias were very powerful and influenced both readers and writers. It&apos;s true, though, that he did not go in for the clich\u00e9s of the genre at that time - rayguns and tentacled aliens and so on.&quot; To Harrison, he is &quot;a science-fiction novelist in the way that Orwell and Huxley are&quot;. With the publication of Empire of the Sun in 1984, a third literary persona emerged: Jim Ballard, writing in a detailed, naturalistic manner, without recourse to crystallising trees or exhausted water supplies or visions of mutilated genitalia on the Heathrow approach road. In this autobiographical novel, his longest to date, Ballard renounced the urge to fantasise: the story of young Jim having a high old time in the Lunghua camp while death stalked the perimeter was outlandish enough. Ballard had held back for 40 years before tackling his own exotic history, and he has told the tale again, in yet plainer fashion, in Miracles of Life, which is subtitled &quot;Shanghai to Shepperton&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ve often asked myself why I waited so long. People who&apos;ve been involved in war do wait. Robert Graves let 10 years go by before writing Goodbye to All That, which seemed quite a long time. In the course of adjusting to the strangeness of English life, I&apos;d made this vast effort of fatalistically switching off my memories of wartime China. I never spoke about it to anyone, including my wife or children or any of my friends.&quot; He was aware, however, of &quot;an unconscious ferment going on, the knocking on the floorboards, the past under my feet saying: we haven&apos;t gone away&quot;. When he did at last confront the subject - &quot;I thought, I&apos;ve got to get all this down, before I forget&quot; - he realised that the diet of war and detention, the killings he witnessed and the ruthless Japanese guards who excited his adolescent admiration &quot;mapped out the blueprint for most of my fiction&quot;. The writer Iain Sinclair, who &quot;first read Ballard in the New Worlds days&quot;, regards &quot;the Chinese aspect&quot; as the key: &quot;the colonial gentleman more English than the English, growing up in a parodic stockbroker belt, with deep memories of a country he had never known. And then the camp: the ultimate English public school.&quot; Sinclair has no difficulty in linking the style of a novel such as Crash with that of Empire of the Sun. &quot;With Ballard, as with any writer who sustains a long and productive career, there is a single vitalising imagination. The coordinates are fixed. Psychopathology chooses to reveal itself in different ways. There is no &apos;invention&apos; in this trajectory, just recognition, another strategy, another beginning.&quot; As M John Harrison sees it, Empire of the Sun &quot;handles the images of his early life as the elements of autobiographical fiction; books like Crash or a short story such as &apos;You: Coma: Marilyn Monroe&apos; manipulate the same sorts of images and experiences into a personal poetics or mythology&quot;. Empire of the Sun has been Ballard&apos;s only large commercial success, &quot;outselling all my previous books put together&quot;. The novel was turned into a film by Steven Spielberg in 1987, with Christian Bale in the role of Jim. Liberated from the detention camp in 1945, Ballard returned with his parents to England, where he became a boarder at the Leys School, Cambridge. &quot;Out of one institution, into another.&quot; Between 1949 and 1951, he studied medicine at King&apos;s College, Cambridge. Whereas Lunghua inspires happy memories, the recollection of university makes him &quot;shudder&quot;. Cambridge in the early 50s &quot;was so introverted, all the little rules and rituals. All that Gothic architecture - some of it is real, that&apos;s the frightening thing. If it was all fake, one could kind of accept it.&quot; He has never been back. &quot;Things have changed now. But I remember thinking: there must be more to England than this! There&apos;s something wrong. I never met a working-class person unless they were putting a plate in front of me, laden with food.&quot; He regards the time spent dissecting cadavers as &quot;among the most important of my life&quot;. As a child in Shanghai, he had observed a lot of death and dereliction. &quot;Now, only a few years later, I was conducting my own autopsy on all those dead Chinese I had seen lying by the roadside as I set off for school.&quot; In spite of &quot;superb tuition&quot;, he gave up his medical studies. &quot;Once you become a junior doctor, there&apos;s a great pressure of work, and I&apos;d never have found the time to write.&quot; For five years, he worked full time on the scientific journal Chemistry &amp; Industry. When he started writing short stories in the mid-1950s, by which time he had married Mary Matthews, he felt that realism was not capacious enough to contain his &quot;overlit&quot; imagination. &quot;I needed something more charged. I embraced surrealism - like a lover - and psychoanalysis, which closely abutted surrealism. Together, they represented what I wanted to do.&quot; The SF label has stuck to him - &quot;It has some pretty powerful adhesive&quot; - which irritates his subversive side. &quot;Even today I see High-Rise and The Atrocity Exhibition referred to as science fiction. It&apos;s partly shorthand, but it&apos;s also a way of defusing the threat. By calling a novel like Crash science fiction, you isolate the book and you don&apos;t think about what it is. You can forget about it.&quot; His literary lineage runs closer to extreme satirical fabulists such as William Burroughs and Jonathan Swift than to Arthur C Clarke. Ballard encountered Burroughs, whom he greatly admires as a writer, on a number of occasions. &quot;A very strange chap.&quot; Sinclair feels that &quot;the two men, respectful and appreciative, never quite understood each other when they met. Both were set so deep in their visions. Other figures are aliens or rivals.&quot; In Miracles of Life, Ballard describes how he and Mary came to Shepperton via the then bedsit land of Notting Hill. Three children were born in quick succession: James in 1956, Fay the following year, and Beatrice in 1959; both daughters are married with children, while James is, Ballard says, a &quot;confirmed bachelor&quot;. Mary, who came from &quot;a world of prosperous farmers, lavish dances and several very dashing suitors&quot;, encouraged him when he sought to make a career of writing, and his recollections of domestic life suggest an appealing chaos. The family was struck by tragedy during a holiday in Spain in 1964, when Mary developed pneumonia and died suddenly. In the memoirs, Ballard describes his mostly cheerful struggle to raise three young children singlehandedly (he has a longstanding partner, Claire, who lives in west London). &quot;Alcohol was a close friend and confidant in the early days; I usually had a strong Scotch and soda when I had driven the children to school and sat down to write after nine. In those days I finished drinking at about the time today that I start. A friendly microclimate unfurled itself from the bottle of Johnnie Walker and encouraged my imagination to emerge from its burrow.&quot; At the end of the book, Ballard reveals that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006, but even this subject he approaches with resolute good spirits. Iain Sinclair regards Miracles of Life as &quot;warmer, more generous than anything we have seen before. At last, the writer is able to be kind to his wounded former selves.&quot; Ballard&apos;s grief at his wife&apos;s early death appears too deep for elaboration in writing. &quot;I felt that nature had committed a dreadful crime against Mary and her children. Why? There was no answer to the question, which obsessed me for decades.&quot; Their children are the &quot;miracles of life&quot; of the title, and it is hard not to think that the house to which the widower returned after burying Mary in the Protestant cemetery in Alicante in 1964 has been preserved in a state close to that in which she left it. One loyal colleague in those days was Kingsley Amis, whom he liked immensely &quot;before he became a professional curmudgeon&quot;. Martin he met &quot;when he was 14 - like many of us, at heart, unchanged by the decades&quot;. The younger Amis became an admirer early on, saying that Ballard&apos;s novels &quot;could not be written, could not even be guessed at, by anyone else&quot;. He keeps himself remote from the present-day book world; the few enthusiasms mentioned in print - Martin Amis, Will Self, Sinclair - are notably among the nation&apos;s most enthusiastic Ballardians. More than once in conversation he recoils at casual use of the term &quot;literary&quot; - &quot;Oh, oh, oh: I hear a sinister word&quot; - and claims not to have attended a publishing party for more than 40 years. &quot;With all due respect to Kingsley Amis and others, I didn&apos;t feel that the angry young men were responding to what was really important about society. The same goes for John Osborne&apos;s plays. The laying down of the M1 was much more important than anything Jimmy Porter&apos;s father-in-law thought about this or that. The motorway system had a much bigger influence on freedom and possibility.&quot; For Ballard, 1956 is not the year of Look Back in Anger, as for many of his generation, but of &quot;the wonderful exhibition This Is Tomorrow at the Whitechapel Gallery, which marked the birth of pop art&quot;. The show contained Richard Hamilton&apos;s painting Just What Is It That Makes Today&apos;s Homes So Different, So Appealing?, as well as an installation by Peter and Alison Smithson based on what a person would need to survive after a nuclear war. &quot;I thought: here is a fiction for the present day. I wasn&apos;t interested in the far future, spaceships and all that. Forget it. I was interested in the evolving world, the world of hidden persuaders, of the communications landscape developing, of mass tourism, of the vast conformist suburbs dominated by television - that was a form of science fiction, and it was already here.&quot; The Whitechapel exhibition marked the changing of the avant-garde, the moment at which Hamilton and other pop artists overthrew Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Graham Sutherland. Ballard refers to the latter group, a touch severely perhaps, as &quot;artists in favour with the Arts Council and the British Council&quot; - one of several swipes he takes in the direction of subsidising art by &quot;the taxes of people on modest incomes&quot;. Ballard&apos;s conversation, like his writing, is regularly punctuated with inventories of the liberating spirit of technology. But with scarcely a twitch to indicate a change of direction, he explains that his most recent novel, Kingdom Come (2006), &quot;posed the question: could consumerism turn into fascism? The underlying psychologies aren&apos;t all that far removed from one another. If you go into a huge shopping mall and you&apos;re looking down the parade, it&apos;s the same theatrical aspect: these disciplined ranks of merchandise, all glittering like fascist uniforms. When you enter a mall, you are taking part in a ceremony of affirmation, which you endorse just by your presence.&quot; Consumerism &quot;has to a large extent replaced art and culture in this country. The principal entertainment industry nowadays is soccer which, with its marching supporters&apos; groups, is not that far removed from fascism.&quot; These diagnoses of the contemporary condition roll off the tongue with an easy delivery - half schoolmasterly lesson, half the retort of his impish pupil. Ballard surprised some of his counterculture admirers in the 80s by expressing respect for Margaret Thatcher, and supporting her attempts to &quot;Americanise&quot; British life. As long ago as 1965, in his novel The Drought, he was describing a planet choked by chronic water shortages; yet in his more recent annotated updating of The Atrocity Exhibition, he takes a hearty swipe at &quot;eco puritans&quot;, promotes pornography as &quot;a powerful catalyst for social change&quot; and expresses gratitude for the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, to which he attributes his survival. Seated before his reconstituted Delvaux, Ballard is at home with his paradoxes. &quot;Just because you&apos;re right, it doesn&apos;t mean you shouldn&apos;t be viewed with great suspicion.&quot; The gifts of modern life, the &quot;mod cons&quot; that have brought a kind of freedom to the inhabitants of the western world, &quot;are gifts that come in poisonous wrapping paper. One has to handle them very carefully. But that&apos;s true of most of the valuable things in life.&quot; Ballard on Ballard What happens if you regard the whole of reality as a vast video game? I suspect you find yourself in an overheated realm rather close to The Atrocity Exhibition . . . Like its most notorious chapter, &quot;Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan&quot;, it all seemed more than a little far-fetched, but now, in 2008, we call it everyday reality. At the time, 1976, Reagan seemed a vital key to what was going wrong, both with America and the worldwide media landscape. He had become governor of California, but I was convinced he would make it to the presidency. Today only bad actors can lead a nation, as Reagan and Blair showed. Poor Gordon Brown needs six months at Rada and a tryout at the Old Vic. &quot;Reagan&apos;s personality. The profound anality of the presidential contender may be expected to dominate the United States in the coming years. By contrast the late JF Kennedy remained the prototype of the oral object, usually conceived in pre-pubertal terms. In further studies sadistic psychopaths were given the task of devising sex fantasies involving Reagan. Results confirm the probability of presidential figures being perceived primarily in genital terms; the face of LB Johnson is clearly genital in significant appearance - the nasal prepuce, scrotal jaw etc. Faces were seen as either circumcised (JFK, Khrushchev) or uncircumcised (LBJ, Adenauer). In assembly kit tests Reagan&apos;s face was uniformly perceived as a penile erection. Patients were encouraged to devise the optimum sex-death of Ronald Reagan.", "tags": ["Books", "Fiction", "Culture", "JG Ballard"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-13T23:10:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/15/art.fashion", "sentences": ["I said I knew it could be a disaster, but if it made me happy that was all that mattered.&apos; She opened the first Contrasts gallery in Shanghai with an exhibition showing the influence of France on that city, from Shanghai Art Deco to fashion and art.", "Today Pearl has seven galleries based in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong.", "The dining room here seats 12 with ease (her Shanghai residence has a dining table that seats 66) and although Pearl&apos;s address book is bursting with A-list celebrities, many of whom are clients, she is forthright on who she has to dinner: &apos;I don&apos;t like echoes.", "With homes in Hong Kong, London and Shanghai, and a string of international art fairs to attend throughout the year, Pearl has a frenetic schedule."], "title": "A visit to the high-camp home of Pearl Lam, founder of China's Contrasts galleries", "article": "From the moment you step through Pearl Lam&apos;s front door you are a supporting actor in a theatre of her own creation. First you must make your grand entrance down polished wooden stairs - no handrail - on to the main stage: a glittering, mirrored set of glass, rich silks, glamorous daybeds and heart-jolting modern art. Other bit players are already on stage, including Robert, the butler, and Venus, the maid. You are served tea, croissants (&apos;Buttered, almond, chocolate?&apos;) and shown international glossy magazines with &apos;Miss Lam&apos; on the cover. The atmosphere is taut. But where is the leading lady? Taking her time, of course. Eventually all eyes flit towards the silver-and-black op art hall as Pearl&apos;s dazzling five-inch wedges come tip-tapping down the leather stairs. The star has arrived. And she does not disappoint. Pearl Lam, founder of the Contrasts chain of art galleries in China, is a whirlwind of energy - passionate, energetic, generous and uncompromising, but also capable of the most devilish moods if she does not get her own way, and quickly. In the flesh she is tiny - about 5ft tall - with the waistline of a six-year-old and bobbed hair tinted with purple. She must be in her forties but looks 20 years younger, with huge eyes and a face so expressive it has certainly never encountered Botox. But it is her voice that mesmerises - one minute low, sexy, growling, and the next (if something has not happened quickly enough) shrill, fast and domineering. She also seems to engender a healthy blend of fear and respect in those who work for her. As she admits: &apos;Working for me is very difficult because I do not allow people to be creative. Everything is determined by me. It is a case of &quot;Just do it!&quot;&apos; Born into a wealthy Chinese family in Hong Kong which made its fortune through hotels and banking, Pearl was sent away from home at the age of 11 to be educated in the US and then the UK. Not many students own a flat in Cadogan Place, but that is where Pearl lived while taking a postgraduate course in fashion design. &apos;I was too messy to cut patterns accurately. I love fashion, but realised I just liked shopping for myself.&apos; It was such a disaster she only stuck it for three months. At that point she was ordered back to Hong Kong by her family. &apos;I tried to persuade my father to let me do an MA here, but he saw through it. When I was here in London I could be myself. But I knew when I went back everyone&apos;s eyes would be upon me.&apos; In the end, Pearl said she would return only if she were allowed to open an art gallery. Her parents agreed but were quick to renege on the deal. &apos;China does not have a tradition of art galleries, so my mother&apos;s attitude was: &quot;Why come back to be a shopkeeper?&quot; They felt that art should be about culture and self-cultivation, but not about business. In their view the only way to show my intelligence was to use it to make more money for the family&apos;s company.&apos; Not that Pearl was going to go quietly down that road. In fact, she staged her first exhibition in 1993, an idiosyncratic selection of old and new, east and west, fine art, decorative art and design. &apos;I could not conceptualise then what I was doing, but I wanted to show Hong Kong society that just because you have money you didn&apos;t have to live with Louis XV reproduction furniture. I was questioning why in China we always had to adapt and adopt a western lifestyle when our culture is so different. With so much globalisation, the only way to create something really different is to go back to your roots.&apos; After five years she was already making a name for herself, but then the Asian economic crisis hit and she was ordered back into the family firm, this time with no prospect of a way out. Then in 2003, Sars changed the course of Pearl&apos;s life. &apos;I was abroad when it happened, so I could not go back to Hong Kong for four months. I flitted between Paris, London and New York, just loving what I saw. At the end of that time I went back to Hong Kong and told my parents I needed my life back again and I intended to open a gallery. I said I knew it could be a disaster, but if it made me happy that was all that mattered.&apos; She opened the first Contrasts gallery in Shanghai with an exhibition showing the influence of France on that city, from Shanghai Art Deco to fashion and art. Today Pearl has seven galleries based in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. She also has a personal collection of contemporary art and design worth many millions of pounds. Her London apartment is in fact two Bond Street penthouses knocked into one. The lilac living room leads through double-height, deep-mirrored doors into a jewel box of a dining room - a glittering, glamorous fairy tale with walls and ceiling clad in mirror. The centrepiece is a huge feathered Coco Cabana chandelier (by XYZ Design for Contrasts), while black cockerel feathers have been hand-sewn on to the embroidered chair covers and a cloth of woven peacock feathers is laid on the table. &apos;I like feathers because I love frivolous, superficial and camp things,&apos; Pearl says. &apos;I like surprises.&apos; She also loves to entertain. The dining room here seats 12 with ease (her Shanghai residence has a dining table that seats 66) and although Pearl&apos;s address book is bursting with A-list celebrities, many of whom are clients, she is forthright on who she has to dinner: &apos;I don&apos;t like echoes. If you have people all of the same background, they will always agree. I don&apos;t want snobs to dinner - I want people who have something to say.&apos; As the apartment was originally two flats, there are two staircases. The op art one, painted by trompe-l&apos;oeil artist Bruno Romette, leads up to Pearl&apos;s dressing room, bathroom and bedroom - an extraordinary red-and-white space that appeared on the cover of a German architectural magazine, only to be recreated later in the film Factory Girl. At the other end of the apartment is the &apos;Staircase of the 21 Vaginas&apos; - with walls painted and distressed by Romette to give a Pompeii finish, against which the conceptual piece &apos;21 Vaginas&apos; by Cathy de Monchaux is displayed. It certainly makes for a good conversation point during her legendary dinners. With homes in Hong Kong, London and Shanghai, and a string of international art fairs to attend throughout the year, Pearl has a frenetic schedule. With growing international interest in Chinese contemporary art, she is at the top of her game, and she knows it. &apos;At Contrasts we don&apos;t follow the western model of an art gallery,&apos; she says. &apos;We are cross-discipline and cross-cultural, showing work both from Chinese artists and also artists in residence from other countries, who stay for a few months and produce work that speaks of China.

Tang Chao&apos;s paperback, Give Me Back The Dream, a dark tale of unrequited teenage love, conflict with parents and adolescent suicide, reached the top of the bestseller lists last week, a success confirming the coming of age of what has been dubbed the country&apos;s &apos;Generation Z&apos;. &apos;I just tell the story of people I know,&apos; Tang said in a telephone interview from his home in the central Chinese city of Chengdu. &apos;We are the post-Nineties generation and society doesn&apos;t understand us.&apos; Such sentiments might be the staple of sulky adolescents in the West, but they are new in China. If the country&apos;s Generation X grew up in the aftermath of the devastating Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, and Generation Y enjoyed the extraordinary economic growth of the Eighties and Nineties, &apos;Generation Z&apos; has a different teen spirit.  Books such as Give Me Back The Dream and the &apos;adolescent anguish&apos; series of Rao Xuenan sell millions of copies. So do the novels of Guo Jingming, 24 - whose melancholy young heroes seek an answer to their anguish by sitting alone on top of high buildings for hours pondering their plight or by plunging into a vortex of violence, alcohol and karaoke. Alternative music with a darker, more nihilistic style than the saccharine pop that has dominated the Chinese market for a decade is also beginning to make inroads. More than anything, the real novelty is simply the idea that teenagers can be grumpy, hostile and apathetic. &apos;Our parents think we are like them, but we are not,&apos; said Ye Jiadi, 18, smoking a cigarette outside the D-22 club in the university area of Beijing early yesterday. &apos;We just want to hang out. We don&apos;t want to live like our fathers lived. We have our own way.&apos; In a country where hundreds of millions still live below the poverty line, the &apos;Z&apos; phenomenon remains restricted to the comfortable and educated middle class of urban centres, but nevertheless many still see it as significant.  &apos;The writers say what their readers - high-school students for the most part - want to say themselves,&apos; said Zheng Tan, professor of literature at Fudan University, Shanghai. &apos;These are people who have grown up in a China that is becoming steadily wealthier, and as material conditions have improved they have become more concerned with private emotion.&apos; The work of the new writers is also less politically controversial. &apos;Their focus is very personal and they deal less with social, political or economic themes. So the government leaves them alone - and that suits everybody, publishers, authors and consumers alike,&apos; Zheng said. For Deng Jun, a child psychologist in Beijing, books such as Give Me Back the Dream portray the reality for millions of young people. &apos;Official government statistics speak of between 500 and 700 teenagers reported with depression in China, but these figures are very conservative,&apos; she said. &apos;The hotline I run received more than 2,500 calls in the last year from young people showing depressive tendencies.&apos; A further problem is China&apos;s 30-year-old policy limiting parents to one child. &apos;This has created a generation of over-indulged children who have little ability to confront disappointment or hardship,&apos; Deng said. &apos;There is also an enormous pressure on only children to succeed. They feel depressed, anguished and can easily become suicidal. They often have problems making friends.&apos; In Tang&apos;s book, one character kills himself by jumping from the top of his apartment block after a row with his ambitious parents, who have banned him from pursuing a love affair with a schoolmate for fear it could damage his exam results. Young fans of the author said he was describing something many of them felt. &apos;Our generation lack confidence, and as we are often only children we are terrified of being alone or losing friends,&apos; said Wei Peng Fei, 17, a schoolgirl queuing to buy Tang&apos;s book at a central Beijing bookshop. A series of studies in recent years have revealed that Chinese teenagers are smoking and drinking more and having sex at a younger age. Another concern is internet addiction. The government has set up a series of centres which use a mixture of military-style bootcamp discipline and sympathy to treat teenagers who had become dependent on the internet, particularly on video games. Yet Rao Xuenan, 35, whose Young Anguish series has sold millions, says that the &apos;post-1990s generation&apos; also have &apos;a positive side&apos; that is often forgotten. The recent earthquake in which 70,000 died has brought out the best in many teenagers in the wave of solidarity and charity activism that swept China, he said. &apos;I thought they were just anguished and depressed but they are much stronger and less selfish than we imagined.&apos;", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Books", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-14T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/15/popandrock.features16", "sentences": ["Then there&apos;s B6, a brilliant minimal techno artist (he&apos;s on MySpace) I saw at Antidote, a house club in Shanghai.", "Beijing is best for rock and indie, Shanghai for dance music."], "title": "All around this great big world", "article": "Here&apos;s a pub quiz question for you. Name one Chinese pop group. And, no, China Crisis aren&apos;t one... It&apos;s hard for Chinese pop to gain attention in the West. To our ears, Asian music sounds vile: tinny, feminine voices yodelling politely about lost love; the odd clash of cymbals; no beat, no wildness, no oomph. Unlike African or South American sounds, there&apos;s little that shakes yer booty. Chinese music lacks rhythm, the driving power behind most pop. Plus, we haven&apos;t heard that much of it, to be honest. That last is because, lest we forget, Chinese music is closely monitored by China&apos;s Communist government. So closely that it banned Super Girl, the Chinese version of Pop Idol, after three seasons, deeming it low culture and corrupting of its audience. The 2005 final attracted 400 million viewers, who voted in their hundreds of thousands via text message. Li Yuchun, the winner, clocked up more than 3.5 million votes over the series. You could argue that this was the largest ever democratic election in China; and then start pondering why exactly Super Girl was banned. But we&apos;re here to talk music, and, having spent a week in China recently, I can report that the government had a point about Super Girl. The contestants sang C-pop, mainstream Chinese pop that has all the sonic appeal of a kitten trapped in a cutlery drawer. C-pop makes you want to tear your eyeballs out and shove them in your ears to dull the racket. So you turn to China&apos;s indie scene... and have the same reaction. China&apos;s indie bands channel their heroes to an extent that borders on stalking. Watching a video of a mop-haired, parka-clad Chinese lad making monkey faces at the camera is very strange, especially when you&apos;re actually from Manchester yourself. But then, most young British indie bands are pale imitations of what has gone before. Pop has been eating itself for almost 50 years now and, for every innovative genius, there are thousands of plodding karaoke singers. Plus, when you think about it, it&apos;s a peculiarly privileged complaint, that foreign pop sounds too like Western music. Where do we think these Johnny Foreigners live? In the 15th century? The desire for a genuine, hand-tooled, musical product that uses techniques passed down the generations reminds me of the search for authentic peasant cuisine by people who call themselves travellers rather than tourists. It ignores the fact that China&apos;s young people, like those of the rest of the world, listen to Rihanna or Coldplay just as much as they tune into local folk sounds. There are a couple of Chinese acts I&apos;d recommend. New Pants combine New Order riffs with Beastie Boys attitude and fantastically rubbish break dancing. Check out &apos;Everybody&apos; on YouTube (tinyurl.com/3gzkvw): I defy you not to love them. Then there&apos;s B6, a brilliant minimal techno artist (he&apos;s on MySpace) I saw at Antidote, a house club in Shanghai. He&apos;s got a pop persona too: as one half of I-GO (also on MySpace), who sound like a wistful Pet Shop Boys. B6 taught himself English by watching films and first got excited by music when he discovered Throbbing Gristle. Anyone who can extrapolate from Genesis P Orridge to a track called &apos;Synth Love&apos; has to be respected. What else? Beijing is best for rock and indie, Shanghai for dance music. Oh, and no one - not even the most outspoken, well-paid, jet-setting liberal - criticises the government in public.

Boasting a 200-strong entourage, the Chinese Advertising Association is aiming to turn around a traditionally poor performance at the world&apos;s premiere advertising awards event. The CAA took the unprecedented step this year of signing 100 official delegates up for Cannes and organising a gala as a &quot;meet and greet&quot; on the French Riviera. As many as 100 more executives from Chinese agencies have swelled the size of the entourage, although most of these are not officially registered as delegates. The CAA also approached some of the leading players from international ad agencies in China - which in the past have sometimes been left on the outside of the trade body - to enhance its reputation and start to match award-winning neighbours such as Japan. &quot;You can&apos;t ignore China, it is on a high this year and with the Olympics the purpose of the visit is to put China on the map,&quot; said Kitty Lun Chan, the chairman and chief executive of Lowe China, who was invited to represent the country by the CAA.  &quot;You don&apos;t get a gold [Cannes Lion] for turning up here but we are aware we have not won one in over 50 years of the festival and as agencies we always want to do better.&quot; The CAA will be pleased with the fact that TBWA China, based in Shanghai, managed to pick up the nation&apos;s first gold award earlier this week. Even better was the fact that it is a campaign for Adidas for the Beijing Olympics, a milestone given China has never done better than win the occasional silver Cannes Lion award. Lun Chan added that attendance in Cannes will help Chinese ad agency staff network with foreign creatives as well as put the country on the advertising map in the same way that &quot;India, Thailand and Latin America have increased their support&quot;. Japanese agency Dentsu, for example, has done extremely well this year taking the highly coveted Grand Prix award for a radio ad for Canon. According to Group M, WPP&apos;s media buying agency, China will overtake the advertising economies of both the UK and Germany this year, accounting for around 7% of global media spend, leaving it third behind the US and Japan. &quot;It is easy to just focus inside the country, which has a rising national pride, and assume you are good. But it is important for China to always elevate its standard of advertising and win international awards,&quot; said Pully Chau, the chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi China and vice-chairman of the CAA. She added that overall Asian agencies picked up 84 awards at the festival last year and that China needs to up its share. The CAA delegation also included Chinese digital luminaries such as Charles Chao, the president and chief executive of Sina.com, one of China&apos;s most popular online destinations, and senior executives from search engine company Sohu.com. &quot;The CAA believe that China is ready to know more about the world and the world is ready to know more about China, it is like a cultural exchange,&quot; said Chau. &quot;People talk about China but don&apos;t understand the reality.

The bad news came as little surprise: this year, each trip to the retail brokerage has left her feeling queasy. &quot;Everything&apos;s falling, and my shares are falling too. I feel a bit ill because of the money I&apos;ve lost,&quot; she admitted with a wince. The retired supermarket administrator, who did not want to give her real name, is one of millions of Chinese investors to discover that shares can go down, and down, and down, as well as up. Last year, as stocks soared, people stampeded into the market. Customers at her brokerage, a CITIC Securities branch in east Beijing, rose five-fold to 25,000 between the start of 2006 and the end of last year. Its manager, Gu Xiaoyi, estimates that 60 million Chinese people now trade shares. In a little more than six months, the benchmark Shanghai composite index doubled, passing the 6,000 mark in October. Since then it has nosedived to less than half that level - yesterday closing at 2941. Many analysts believe it would have sunk further by now had the government not intervened.  Small shareholders have been badly hit; some have lost their life savings. A few have even killed themselves in despair as their losses mounted. Most seem unable to stay away from the brokerages. On a busy day, 500 cram into the dingy CITIC room. Regulars sit from open to close of each session, bringing cushions to pad the hard red plastic chairs. Keeping half an eye on the screen, they chat, sip tea from flasks and play cards. Other investors crowd around terminals, using swipe cards to check their own stocks or offering advice to friends and strangers alike. Zhou began trading here last year, seduced by glossy brochures on stock issues and the hope of better returns than a savings account - particularly with inflation outstripping interest rates. &quot;I read loads of material and it said the next decade would be the golden years for the Chinese stock market because the economy was developing,&quot; she explained. &quot;We started buying stocks and it was very, very good. When the index reached 5000 I didn&apos;t sell because it was still growing. But then it fell by 10% - then another 10%, then another.  &quot;I tried to break even by buying more, because I thought the cheap stocks would go up again. So when the index hit 4,000 I bought. Then it went down to 3,000.  &quot;Now I just want to sell them off and stop dealing. It&apos;s too much of a risk.&quot; So far Zhou&apos;s investments have lost her 10,000 yuan (\u00a3740), more than two-thirds the average annual income in urban China. Despite her disenchantment, she has yet to bail out; maybe, she said, the index would hit 6,000 again in a year or two.  Gu acknowledged that many customers know little about buying shares or reading the market. &quot;Last year, loads of people just ran in and started buying stocks because someone had told them it was a great time to do it,&quot; he said.  &quot;Ninety-five percent of them didn&apos;t know what they were doing or what they were buying. It was only when it dropped so dramatically that they realised it was actually quite risky.&quot; He argued that the ups and downs were typical growing pains for a new market, suggesting that investors were becoming more sophisticated and regulation improving. &quot;In the west you have hundreds of years of history in the stock market and it wasn&apos;t always stable ... It&apos;s through the highs and lows that you learn,&quot; he added, suggesting that the market was &quot;basically stable&quot; now.  Several analysts suggest that it is settling down now that last year&apos;s bubble has burst. Others believe that assessment is optimistic, and argue the downward trend will continue. &quot;The economy is slowing down ... The stock market will also continue to slide,&quot; said one analyst, who asked to remain anonymous. Certainly, there is widespread anxiety about the economy and in particular inflation. Last week, Stephen Green - the influential head of China research at Standard Chartered - warned: &quot;The golden years are over, at least for the moment.&quot; Yan Yuanrun at West China Securities argued: &quot;Although the market is not very mature, it is still very much connected to the macroscopic economic development.&quot; Others argue that it bears little relation to the overall outlook, or even the performance of individual companies, and has clear links to government policy.  &quot;If you want to invest in the Chinese market, the only thing that matters is what the government will do tomorrow,&quot; said Michael Pettis, a former banker and now professor of finance at Peking University.  &quot;Don&apos;t waste your time trying to figure out who&apos;s profitable and who&apos;s not - it doesn&apos;t matter.&quot; Most of the financial world believes the government is determined to keep the Shanghai index above 3,000 or as near as possible in the run-up to the Olympics, if not beyond.  Analysts point to a range of recent action, from cutting stamp duty and restricting the sale of shares freed from lock-up periods to ordering mutual funds not to issue stock.  &quot;Every time we get close to 3000 there&apos;s a new flurry of announcements aimed at boosting the market,&quot; said Pettis.  &quot;It&apos;s a very dangerous game because every time the government intervenes in a non-fundamental way it loses credibility. It undermines the development of a real and fundamental investor base and strengthens the existing dynamic. &quot;The market shot up 5% before the announcement [on stamp duty] and 10% afterwards - but now it&apos;s retraced all of that.&quot; While experts fret about the future, most small investors are simply hanging on in there. Some seem paralysed by their losses; others, curiously sanguine, comparing investment with the fun of placing a bet. Taxi driver Peng Desheng did not even know what stocks his family owned - he had simply told his wife to &quot;go and spend some thousands of yuan&quot; last year, but was unperturbed by the decline.  He said: &quot;It&apos;s like gambling: you need the courage to lose a bit of money or what&apos;s the point? You might as well spend all your money on steamed buns and sit at home eating them.&quot;", "tags": ["Investing", "Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-18T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/19/olympicgames2012.olympics2012", "sentences": ["A fifth sponsor for the event, won last year by Roger Federer, left, at its current venue in Shanghai, will be signed once Mercedes ends its association with the tournament for the top eight players later this year."], "title": "Olympics could give Mugabe a UK stage", "article": "The UK government faces the nightmare scenario of watching Robert Mugabe take the seat he is entitled to in the London 2012 main stadium under its own Olympic hosting agreements. If the Zimbabwean despot wins what is expected to be a rigged election on June 27 he will be entitled to apply for accreditation for the London Games as a head of state. In the hosting agreement for the 2012 Olympics provision is made for anybody holding official International Olympic Committee accreditation to enter the country as if it were a valid UK visa. The admission of Mugabe, who considers London his favourite capital city, would come as a huge embarrassment to the government. The Mugabe question is causing difficulties for sport in the UK as the England and Wales Cricket Board is being squeezed between pressure from the International Cricket Council and the government over Zimbabwe&apos;s scheduled tour next summer. Talks between the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, and the foreign secretary, David Miliband, have sought to find a workable way to block Zimbabwe&apos;s entry for the two-Test, three-ODI tour. The ECB is understood to have alternative opponents capable of fulfilling the fixtures, given that Zimbabwe is not even a Test-status nation. But Zimbabwean participation in next year&apos;s World Twenty20 appears less likely to be prevented.  A spokeswoman for the IOC could not be reached for comment last night.  Kolpak conundrum Leicestershire&apos;s chief executive, David Smith, has employed five Kolpak players this season as &quot;senior role-model cricketers&quot; to counter the influence of the central contracts that have led to what he terms a &quot;brain drain&quot; of talent from the counties. Yet the England and Wales Cricket Board is expected from next year to clamp down on the influx of overseas players once the European Commission has officially clarified its restrictions on the Cotonou Agreement that opened access to the UK for South African and Caribbean cricketers.  Smith is far from impressed with the ECB&apos;s stance, stating that Somerset gained promotion from the Second  Division last year by using more non-English qualified players than any of their rivals. Somerset had been the employer of the ECB&apos;s chairman, Giles Clarke, before his election to the Lord&apos;s position last September. A spokesman said that he had not been in charge of the county&apos;s recruitment, having withdrawn from day-to-day responsibilities to concentrate on his election campaign. Cummins and goings Simon Cummins, head of the sports practice at the head-hunters Odgers Ray &amp; Berndtson, will meet Football Association officials in the second week of July to finalise the talent profile for the new chief executive of the World Cup 2018 bid company. Although he stated in a radio interview on Tuesday that the successful candidate would &quot;almost certainly&quot; be an established chief executive with an international track record, Cummins drew back yesterday from implying that internal candidates had been overruled.  That will be a relief to Simon Johnson, who has ambitions of stepping in to the role since his position as director of corporate affairs appears increasingly redundant after Alex Horne became chief operating officer. It is musical chairs at Soho Square: Horne&apos;s replacement as Wembley&apos;s chief executive is being sought while today is the closing date for applications for the post of director of football services. Banking on London The Association of Tennis Professionals is poised to extend its agreements with South African Airways and Ricoh after Barclays yesterday signed a \u00a33.5m-a-year, five-year deal as headline sponsor of its Masters Cup which moves to London&apos;s O2 Arena from November 2009.  A fifth sponsor for the event, won last year by Roger Federer, left, at its current venue in Shanghai, will be signed once Mercedes ends its association with the tournament for the top eight players later this year. It is expected that once all partners are on board the men&apos;s game will overhaul the \u00a350m, six-year deal the women&apos;s tour struck with Sony Ericsson in 2005. matt.scott@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Zimbabwe", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-18T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/21/hollandrussia.minutebyminute", "sentences": ["Here&apos;s Niall Lambert: &quot;I&apos;m watching this on an internet stream from Shanghai, and I&apos;m sure the Chinese commentators are obsessing about how the Dutch are the tallest people in the world.", "Things like, &apos;I&apos;d never have gone for a ball like that, but then again, being from Shanghai I am short, whereas the Dutch are the tallest people in the world&apos;.&quot; Woah, they commentating in English too?"], "title": "Euro 2008: Holland v Russia - as it happened", "article": " The teams: Netherlands: 1-Edwin van der Sar; 21-Khalid Boulahrouz, 2-Andre Ooijer, 4-Joris Mathijsen, 5-Giovanni van Bronckhorst; 17-Nigel de Jong, 8-Orlando Engelaar; 18-Dirk Kuyt, 23-Rafael van der Vaart, 10-Wesley Sneijder; 9-Ruud van Nistelrooy.

In the white (with a bit of red and blue) corner we have Russia, kind of OK until they blew the Swedes away with more breathtaking teamwork than an asthmatics&apos; orgy. The Dutch are favourites, but I think they&apos;re due a bad game and the Russians are very good value indeed at 4-1.  Oh, and Robben picked up a knock in training, so he won&apos;t even be on the bench. Well he might be on the bench, but he won&apos;t be coming off it.  Now both these sides like a bit of a counter attack so there could be a huge amount of you-go-first, no-you-go-first flirting going on. Or they could just stand in their own penalty areas, while the ball sits on its own in the centre circle.  Some info on the Dutch from a genuine Dutch person: (Arjen van Doorn)&quot;You might find the following bemusing - the Dutch anthem is actually quite odd for a national anthem- it starts off with &apos;Wilhelmus van Nassouwe, am I of German blood&apos; - only to end with &apos;The king I always have honoured&apos;.&quot; Consider me bemused.  1 min: A fact. Robin van Persie is the second-fastest player at Euro 2008, reaching a top speed of 31.53km/h in the group stages. Unfortunately, he&apos;s on the bench, so we&apos;ll just have to imagine how fast he is.  3 min:  The stadium looks beautiful as stadia will in big nights in major tournaments. Vast swathes of orange in the crowd with a few pockets of white. Kuyt has the first chance with a header that he does well to win but sends high and wide.  5 min: Pavlyuchenko intercepts a loose ball and races away but his cross is cut out by De Jong. &quot;Actually, the Dutch sing that they&apos;ve always honored the king of Spain,&quot; says Adriaan Tijsseling. &quot;Should be interesting if Spain and Holland meet...&quot; Well, maybe they honour the Germans and the Spanish, just to be friendly, like.  7 min: Free-kick to Russia and Zhirkov whips a free-kick in that Van Der Sar does well to palm away. Kolodin than has an excellent chance but doesn&apos;t capitalise.  9 min: Russia are doing a lot of attacking, but Holland aren&apos;t doing much about the counter. Pavlyucenko has an excellent chance, unmarked about nine-yards out, but his header is over.  13 min: Pavlyuchenko sends in a deep cross after breaking away, but it&apos;s a bit too deep for everyone&apos;s liking. &quot;The grass they&apos;re playing on was imported from Holland,&quot; says Alan Polonsky. &quot; Doesn&apos;t that give the Dutch home advantage?&quot; I salute you for not making the obvious Dutch grass joke, sir. Which I kind of did, to my immense discredit.   15 min:  And then Zhirkov makes him a feel a bit better with an even worse cross. Great camaraderie.  18 min: Ooijer sends a huge boot up the pitch, but it&apos;s offside and just like a Brett Easton Ellis novel it comes to less than zero.  20 min: Best chance for the Dutch so far. Sneijder breaks into the box, but his shot is blocked as he moves in on the keeper.  23 min: Still a bit cagey, the Dutch are content to soak up the Russians but aren&apos;t stretching themselves to hit back. &quot;I think your High-Tech Department&apos;s graphic could be more accurately said to depict the Dutch shrinkage, rather than implosion,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;But it still works, especially if it&apos;s a cold night.&quot; Yeah, I wasn&apos;t quite sure how to represent implosion using only the red and orange crayon in Photoshop, but I think it gets the idea across semi-nicely.  26 min: The ball comes to Engelar on the edge of the area, but he sends it wide. A few people have been asking me why the Dutch are wearing black armbands. A horrible story, I&apos;m afraid. Boulahrouz&apos;s baby died in the week, so it&apos;s a mark of respect for that.  30 min:  Kolodin nails Van Nistelrooy and Holland have a dangerous free-kick. Van der Vaart&apos;s cross ambles across the box and Van Nistelrooy and De Jong \u2013 both unmarked \u2013 should have put it away.  32 min: Arshavin comes in to the game for the first time and curls a low shot to Van Der Sar&apos;s far post which he stretches to save. Then Kolodin leathers the ball back in and again Van Der Sar is forced into a good save.  33 min: Gah! Who does Kolodin think he is? He shoots from about half-a-mile out that nearly dips below the Dutch crossbar.  35 min:  G Naylor: &quot;Ruud didn&apos;t score that chance because his shirt was being pulled. Can&apos;t the officials see that?&quot; Arshavin&apos;s cross is lumped away by Engelar, the ball is involved in a long-term relationship with the Dutch area at the moment.  37 min : Sneijder&apos;s main job at the moment is helping out his defence, sneaking back there to intercept a Russian through ball. Then Van Nistelrooy twists in the box to deliver a shot that Akinfeyev does well to save.  40 min: Sneijder sends a free-kick over. Gregory Feit comes up with a worrying point: &quot;Just how annoying the White Stripes anthem become?&quot; I know it&apos;s terrible to see one of the most perfect songs of the 21st century reduced to a Uefa plaything.  44 min: The Dutch aren&apos;t getting much joy, but they have kept Arshavin quiet and, just like Delbert Wilkins, that could be crucial. Van De Vaart shoots straight at the keeper after Kolodin stuffs up. &quot;Do you think Jim Beglin on ITV has even seen a foul in his life,&quot; demands Dathan Tedesco. &quot;When has a player gone down where he doesn&apos;t call it a dive? When commenting on a tackle, when in his view was the defender not going for the ball? When a player is grimacing when has he not commented &apos;that doesn&apos;t hurt&apos;?&quot; It&apos;s actually been proven that Beglin is so manly that just showing pictures of him to female lab rats can induce a sex change.  45 min: A bit of time wasting as we approach half-time. In fact, as we reach half-time.  Half-times emails: &quot;Can only Russians born in the European part of Russia take part in the European Championship,&quot; asks Mirko Kamann. No, it&apos;s a party and every Russian is invited.  &quot;Are the Dutch intentionally putting every shot into a Russian player?,&quot; asks Graeme Pena. &quot;It seems the strategy is to pummel the Russian into submission.&quot; Although, to be fair the Russians are doing a fair job of pummeling Van der Sar&apos;s palms into a pulpy mess.  &quot;Actually, the line in our national anthem is &apos;I am from Dietsen origin&apos;. Meaning not German but, well, Dutch,&quot; says Rick van der Laar. So, it&apos;s taken three Dutchmen to settle the meaning of one word? Disgraceful.  46 min:  Van Persie is on for Kuyt, which is about as attacking a substitution as you can get. &quot;Arshavin&apos;s haircut isn&apos;t very good is it,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;A mid-80s Phillippe Sella won&apos;t go down well at a Champions League club, although it might pass muster at Aston Villa.&quot; Pavlyuchenko&apos;s Father Dougal ain&apos;t much better.  47 min: Good old, Marco. Van Persie makes an immediate impact slicing a volley wide after a clever flick-on by Van Nistelrooy. &quot;Given his repeated success with unfancied national teams, do you think it safe to call Hiddink the Guus that lays the golden eggs,&quot; giggles Jacob Doherty, with his daring Judaic-Celtic moniker.  49 min:  Dutch free-kick that floats to De Jong who is unmarked on the far post, he can&apos;t quite make it though. &quot;Jim Beglin has just called a shocking piece of defending a &apos;Titus Bramble Moment,&apos;&quot; begins Niall Harden, who knows a riff when he sees one. &quot;Can anyone suggest similar moments for, say, brutal but actually just clumsy tackles (Scholesian?), profligacy in front of goal, or goalkeeping howlers?&quot; Um, a Shearer Moment for a dazzling display of tactical insight?  52 min: Arshavin and his 99 tricks sneak into the box, but Mathijsen and his covert letter J nip in to make an excellent tackle.  54 min: The Dutch national anthem debate rumbles on at 5 emails a minute, so let&apos;s just say there&apos;s definitely a bit about a king from somewhere in it. It&apos;s got to be better than God Save The Queen, whatever the truth. Heitinga is on for Boulahrouz, who might well be emotionally, if not physically, exhausted.  GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holland 0\u20131 Russia (Pavlyuchenko 55min)Semak crosses and Pavlyuchenko who, just like a reclusive farmer, has been ploughing a lone furrow, slides in front of Heitinga to volley home.  58 min: Saenko nearly makes it two with a shot that flies just wide of the right-hand post.  60 min:  I wish I&apos;d put a tenner on Russia now. They fully deserved that goal, and have been far the more dangerous team. For the first time in a game that matters (Romania didn&apos;t) this tournament, Holland have been favourites and they don&apos;t like it.  64 min:  Pavlyuchenko volleys wide, but he was parallel with the near post, so it&apos;s no biggie. Van Persie nods tamely at a ball that he really should have directed across goal.  67 min: Heitinger has a wee cut on his chin. And a big stain on his reputation after letting Pavlyuchenko score. &quot;Didn&apos;t &apos;John&apos; Heitinga, as he&apos;s named according to the caption, used to be &apos;Johnny&apos;,&quot; says David &apos;D-Man&apos; Wall. &quot;Is he initiating the kind of unsuccessful late-career bid to be taken seriously made by the likes of Andrew Cole, G8, P Diddy, and Sasso (who used to be Ron)?&quot;  69 min: Semshov is off for (oh, Jesus) B-I-L-Y-A-L-E-T-D-I-N-O-V.   71 min: Pavlyuchenko plays a brilliant ball to Anyukov, who tears up the right-hand side. He brings it down, but by the time he controls it the angle is too acute to cause Van der Sar any real trouble. Holland aren&apos;t rustling up too much of an answer to Russia. Kolodin booked.  72 min: That booking also came with a complimentary free-kick for Holland, but Van Persie sends it over.  76 min:  Arshavin, who has more up his sleeve than Mr Tickle&apos;s cardigan, plays a glorious ball to Pavlyuchenko. OK, maybe it was a bit too long, but that brings me on to Ed Campion&apos;s email. &quot;Note to Man United: sell Portuguese winger and buy Arshavin.&quot;  78 min: This is terrible from the Dutch, they look like Sven (or McClaren) era England, unable to evolve when they go a goal down. There doesn&apos;t appear to be a plan B. Pavlyuchenko nearly gets his second, but Van Der Sar saves.  81 min: Sneijder has his best moment of the match as he smacks a shot in from 30 yards that goes just over.  83 min:  Russia play a series of passes that, just like a gaggle of foot fetishists, are straight to feet. It nearly culminates in a glorious goal but they get too over-elaborate and Holland clear.  GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holland 1\u20131 Russia (Van Nistelrooy 86min)Holland&apos;s Plan B involves them getting a corner and doing nowt wit\u2026 Oh. Van Nistelrooy latches on to a wickedly curling free-kick and nods home. They don&apos;t deserve that, but if you won&apos;t defend free-kicks properly then you make like Portugal. Here&apos;s Niall Lambert: &quot;I&apos;m watching this on an internet stream from Shanghai, and I&apos;m sure the Chinese commentators are obsessing about how the Dutch are the tallest people in the world. Things like, &apos;I&apos;d never have gone for a ball like that, but then again, being from Shanghai I am short, whereas the Dutch are the tallest people in the world&apos;.&quot; Woah, they commentating in English too?  89 min: The Dutch, you may remember, are almost as bad at penalties as England, so they&apos;ll want to tidy this one off.   90 min +1:  Kolodon is off \u2026 No he&apos;s not. The ref gives a second booking, but the linesman calls him over and says (correctly) that there was no foul on Sneijder. Excellent linesmanshipping/assistanting refereeingmanship. Oh, and PEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPP This one&apos;s going to extra time.   ET 1min: Will Russia live to regret not putting the Dutch away when they really should have? Barring them all dying in the next 30 minutes, I suspect the answer may be yes.   ET 3 min: Russia nearly steal in, but Van der Sar, who has been excellent tonight, snuffs out the danger. In Dutch news, Van Nistelrooy shoots over.  ET 5 min: Zhirkov tackles himself as he works his way into the area. Well played, sir!   ET 7min:  Arhsavin staggers around looking a bit drunk, although we all know it&apos;s a genius-like trick to fool the Dutch into complacency and shoots over. Then Pavlyuchenko crashes a shot against the bar.  ET 10 min: Some of the players are practically walking around now, fatigue is setting in. Arshavin dances into the box and lays the ball off to Torbinsky, who is unmarked but the shot is tamer than a lapdog and doesn&apos;t trouble Van Der Sar.  ET 12 min: Kolodin, who has a monster of a shot, slams a free-kick just wide. &quot;This isn&apos;t football from the very top drawer, but it&apos;s another magnificent match,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;This is the best tournament since Italia 90.&quot; Better in my opinion.   ET 15 min: Russia have wasted some excellent opportunities this half. The Dutch haven&apos;t really had any to waste. &quot;Do you think it would be better for world peace, the political development of Russia, hastening the post-Putin era, were the Dutch to triumph tonight,&quot; asks Steve Byrom. &quot;Just wondering.&quot; Dunno, John Pilger&apos;s doing tomorrow&apos;s MBM, ask him.  ET 17min: Russia scream for a foul in the area as Zhirkov goes down in the area. No penalty.  ET 19 min: Russia continue to dominate, they should have won this game about five times. Replays suggest the ref was right to wave away the penalty. And Jim Beglin agrees with me, so there.   ET 20 min: Another chance for Russia! The ball&apos;s pulled across goal, but no one&apos;s there to put it away. Pavlyuchenko puts his shot over moments later.  ET 21 min: If this goes to penalties, the Russians will be know they should have won this game a long time ago and \u2013 like Croatia last night \u2013 that could have ugly results.  GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holland 1\u20132 Russia (Torbinsky ET 22 min)Arshavin \u2013 who else \u2013 loops a cross over Van Der Sar and Torbinsky rushes past Van Der Vaart to prod home on the line.   ET 25min: Yipes, Arshavin is a brilliant player. His cross confused the life out of Van Der Sar, arguably the most experienced keeper in the world. Pavlyuchenko is subbed for Sychev to waste a few seconds.  GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holland 1\u20133 Russia (Arshavin ET 26 min)How much is Arshavin worth now? Criminally, no one is close in on him as he races on to a through ball, and he puts the ball between Van Der Sar&apos;s legs.   ET 28 min: All this is thoroughly deserved for Russia. Holland have done nothing of note tonight and have threatened seriously once: through the set-piece - a set-piece, what are they, England? - that led to the goal.  -  PEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!:  That&apos;s it! Van Nistelrooy collapses to the floor with cramp his team-mates look stunned.  Gary Naylor, a riposte: &quot;Best tournament since Italia 90? What is Naylor going on about?&quot; says Jason Richards. &quot;For a start Italia 90 wasn&apos;t a great tournament (Argentina and Brazil were poor, there were few really good games, and it was only England getting to the semi-finals that puts an nostalgic glow on it for most Englishman) and second has he forgotten Euro 2000? Seven great games at least and the greatest international tournament bar none, surely?&quot;  As good as Arshavin, Pavlyuchenko et al were, Guus Hiddink has now gone from gone from Alan Turing to Albert Einstein on the genius-o-meter.

For years international brand hotels have dominated, wooing guests with dizzying skyscraper views and hundreds of bedrooms. Crowds loved to mingle in their lavish lobbies, busy bars and numerous restaurants. Big has been beautiful. But the city is now discovering the small and stylish. Mixing historic buildings with personal service, a clutch of new boutique hotels are making their mark.  Design-driven boutique hotels are a long-established feature of most major cities. So why have they taken so long to reach Shanghai? At URBN, one of the hottest new hotels, owner Scott Barrack says it&apos;s all about timing. &apos;Shanghai has matured in sophistication. It&apos;s no longer just a business hub; it&apos;s a vibrant, hip city. As the lifestyle has improved so has the demand for hotels and services.&apos; In other words the newly fashionable and fabulous want more than a marble could-be-anywhere lobby and a bland bedroom. And while the new boutiques have elements in common (such as shunning the waterfront Bund for quirky locations like the French Concession, and using period buildings) they are also all different. For example, Mansion oozes old-fashioned gangster glamour while JIA prefers a fashionable hotel-as-your-home feel. For URBN it&apos;s all about the environment: it boldly claims to be the first carbon-neutral hotel in China.  The recent opening of Pudi, a boutique offshoot of the worldwide Accor chain, is a sign that the big brands recognise the potential of this market. For now, boutiques are far outnumbered by the big brands. But with Shanghai&apos;s cool quota rising and a burgeoning Chinese middle class, it&apos;s little wonder there are bold expansion plans. In the coming year expect more Art Deco decadence and a boutique eco-retreat. Until then here are five of Shanghai&apos;s best.  Jia Shanghai Jia means &apos;home&apos; in Mandarin, a concept Singaporean owner Yenn Wong has applied to her playful designer boutique. Entry to the 1920s building is by room key or doorbell only, creating an exclusive and peaceful city retreat. While it is clearly in love with design (the theatrical lobby features cascading birdcages and giant bears as art), it&apos;s not at the expense of kick-your-shoes-off comfort. Each of the 55 large bedrooms feels more elegant apartment than city hotel. White walls and large mirrors act as a backdrop to eye-catching bespoke furniture. Subtle flashes of Chinese design include wardrobes lined with traditional wallpaper, and old fashioned local sweets are artfully piled next to gleaming fruit. The room rate includes not only breakfast, but help-yourself afternoon tea and evening drinks.  \u00b7 931 West Nanjing Road; jiashanghai.com. Doubles from \u00a3135 Urbn Hotel Think China and concern for the environment doesn&apos;t naturally spring to mind. But URBN puts the issue front and centre with its claim to be carbon-neutral by offsetting its carbon footprint. Guests don&apos;t suffer for their principles; here you protect the planet through lavish luxuries and stylish design. The entrance is so discreet it would be easy to miss: from the busy street you walk into an oasis of towering trees and gravel. Inside the converted warehouse, recycled materials are everywhere: the lobby mixes reused slate with warm wood and there&apos;s a quirky feature wall of rescued brown leather suitcases. The 26 rooms are sleek and uncluttered, with large beds raised above a sunken seating area. Concierge services range from walking tours and cooking classes to language lessons and tai chi.  \u00b7 207 JiaoZhou Road; urbnhotels.com. Doubles from \u00a3103 Mansion Hotel Most businesses are keen to hide their shady past; at Mansion they revel in it. Once the party villa of infamous syndicate boss Du Yue-Sheng, the beautiful 1930s building is now a luxurious 30-room boutique. The large lobby is a carefully cluttered &apos;old Shanghai&apos; creation: antiques from opium pipes to photos of gangster gatherings are scattered between chintzy sofas and green palms. Guests enjoy high tea surrounded by polished gramophones and muskets. On the roof an open restaurant and bar offer views of the low-rise neighbourhood and skyscrapers beyond. The bedrooms continue the winning mixture of old-fashioned glamour and modern comforts. Perfectly placed for the bustling French Concession, guests are just a hop from antiques markets and lively local restaurants. \u00b7 82 Xin Le Road; chinamansionhotel.com.

Enter the Art Deco building through a small side street and a butler guides you through lobby and corridors discreetly decorated with sculptures and tanks of tropical fish. The 52 rooms are ready for business but leisure guests will feel at home too. The design is certainly decadent: piles of cushions, colourful art and copper-accented bathrooms with deep tubs and separate rainforest showers. After an early breakfast in the guests-only eighth-floor lounge (champagne scrambled eggs are highly recommended), it&apos;s two minutes&apos; walk to Fuxing Park, where locals practise tai chi and take dance classes.  \u00b7 99 Yandang Road; boutiquehotel.cc.

It may lack the bells and whistles of some boutiques, but it delivers the essentials with simplicity and style. The design has a Mediterranean feel, with heavy wooden doors, whitewashed walls and monastic arches. Narrow corridors are brightened by mirrors, light floods through stained glass windows, and scented candles burn in the stairwells. Bedrooms are decorated with simple white linens and dark antique furniture. If guests are inspired by the interior, they have the chance to recreate it - all the hotel furniture is available for sale.

Born in Berlin, the daughter of a military family, she broke on to the international scene with the coming of sound as the nightclub performer Lola Lola, humiliating and destroying schoolteacher Emil Jannings in The Blue Angel (1930), a role on which she was to play variations for the rest of her life. The film was directed in Berlin by Joseph von Sternberg, the Hollywood aristocrat born into a working-class Jewish family in Vienna. Both self-creations, their conspiratorial Svengali-Trilby relationship continued back in the US with six exotic, erotic melodramas at Paramount, in which exquisite decor accompanied the subversion of social decorum. Most of the films were produced before the Hollywood code was strictly enforced. Blonde Venus (1932), for instance, begins with Marlene and five other fr\u00e4uleins bathing in the nude observed by six American hikers. Her first line in that picture, first in German then in English, was: &apos;Won&apos;t you go away?&apos; She subsequently delivered a succession of unforgettable lines both on stage and off, including: &apos;It took more than one man to make me Shanghai Lily&apos; (Shanghai Express) and &apos;He was a great detective, but a lousy cop&apos; (Orson Welles&apos;s Touch of Evil). Over 40 years she launched a succession of songs that were to become her cabaret repertoire when public performance took over from the movies: &apos;Falling in Love Again&apos; (The Blue Angel), &apos;The Boys in the Backroom&apos; (Destry Rides Again), &apos;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&apos; (the big post-war hit that brought her back home after having renounced her German citizenship in 1939 to become a major figure in the anti-Nazi crusade). She was a complicated, contradictory person. She was feminine and androgynous, spontaneous and calculating, heavily made-up yet natural, at ease in period costume but most relaxed off-screen in flared trousers. Her best work was done with fellow European \u00e9migr\u00e9s - Sternberg, then Lubitsch (Desire, Angel), who brought out her flair for comedy, Mamoulian, (Garden of Allah), Wilder (who exploited her corrupt innocence in A Foreign Affair and Witness for the Prosecution) and Fritz Lang, briefly her lover, who eventually directed her in the cult western Rancho Notorious, a definitive role in a picture she loathed. Hemingway said &apos;If she had nothing more than her voice she could break your heart with it. But she has that beautiful body and the timeless loveliness of her face. It makes no difference how she breaks your heart if she is there to mend it.&apos; Kenneth Tynan said &apos;She has the bearing of a man: the characters she plays love power and wear trousers.

It does not matter greatly what has happened at the Australian, French or US Opens during the previous year. If Andy Murray, who has yet to get beyond the last 16 of any of the four majors, says he can win Wimbledon, as he did after the French Open this year, then he can win Wimbledon. So let&apos;s forget about Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.  For the next two weeks Tim Henman, who never said anything of much significance during his playing career, other than that it was his &quot;destiny to win Wimbledon&quot;, will be joining the BBC television cheerleaders, presided over by Sue Barker, for what amounts to an annual ritual of trying to big-up any Briton playing at the tournament into something he or she patently is not. Mind you, even this task is wearing thin, with Murray the only domestic singles player of genuine international quality in either the men&apos;s or women&apos;s draw.  At least Henman had Greg Rusedski by his side during a decade when phrases like &quot;Henmania&quot; - a vaguely ridiculous concept - &quot;Henman Hill&quot; and &quot;Timbledon&quot; were coined. Rusedski, who unlike Henman actually reached a grand slam final, at the US Open in 1997, almost always wilted at Wimbledon. Henman played in four semi-finals and, when he reached his first quarter-final, in 1996, he was 21 years old, the same age as Murray.  So, if it was Henman&apos;s &quot;destiny&quot; and he could never make it, what hope is there for Murray? It would be easy to say &quot;none&quot;. The United States has not produced a men&apos;s champion at Flushing Meadows for five years; Yannick Noah was the last Frenchman to win at Roland Garros, in 1983; Australia&apos;s Mark Edmondson was their last men&apos;s champion at home, in 1976. And Wimbledon? Well, we all know that one. Fred J Perry, 1936. British men&apos;s tennis, RIP.  Yet here we have an often-truculent Scot from Dunblane, with a reputation for being injured every other week, attempting to prove that where Perry left off he can take over. Or will this be, as with Henman, just another figment of Auntie&apos;s fevered Wimbledon imagination during these credit-crunch days of falling revenue and dwindling interest in the sport. Even John McEnroe, the winner of three Wimbledon singles titles and generally a voice of sanity among the obsequious rah-rah Britons, is having his Murray doubts, after praising him to the hilt a couple of years ago.  But then this is Wimbledon, a time when everybody goes a little mad. Amid it all the talented Mr Murray is trying to steer a path between what is possible and what is probable. He is No11 in the world and has won five tournaments. He was the US Open junior champion in 2004. Had it not been for a serious wrist injury last year which caused him to miss both Wimbledon and the US Open, there seemed every chance that he might have entered the top five and he would almost certainly have qualified for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, which is restricted to the world&apos;s top eight players.  That injury, together with a parting of the ways with his garrulous American coach, Brad Gilbert, confused everything.  &quot;It looked that the trajectory of his career was going up and up before that,&quot; said Tracy Austin, an astute judge of both the men&apos;s and women&apos;s games and another welcome voice of sanity during Wimbledon fortnight. &quot;So much about tennis is about confidence and maybe that injury has rattled Andy a bit. I can see that his fitness has improved but he still needs to get stronger if he is to challenge for the majors. Just look at Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.&quot;  It is a perception echoed by McEnroe; it would be crazy to talk in terms of Murray winning the title this year.  In terms of direct comparison Murray, who is now coached by Miles Maclagan, has been a little unfortunate that Djokovic, with whom he was neck and neck 15 months ago, has rushed ahead. The Serb reached the French Open and Wimbledon semi-finals last year and lost to Federer in the US Open final before, this January, winning his first grand slam title in Australia. They are a week apart in age, a world apart now in experience.  Not that Murray is without his admirers. Take Croatia&apos;s Goran Ivanisevic, the Wimbledon champion in 2001, when he beat Henman in the semi-final. &quot;Andy&apos;s got all the tools and all the shots but of course there is still a long way to go and there is so much to learn in pro tennis,&quot; said the Croat. &quot;He&apos;s got something inside him that I really like, an attitude on court that not many players have. He&apos;s an emotional guy and I really like guys like that.&quot;  Yet it is this emotional side that worries others, who see in it a propensity for Murray to get down on himself.  &quot;I guess the difference between somebody like me and Andy is that nothing ever got me down,&quot; said Mats Wilander, the Swedish winner of seven majors. &quot;I never shook my head, or at least never showed the other guy that I was feeling shit. And I think that&apos;s something he&apos;s got to learn. You can clearly tell when he&apos;s upset. You can get upset but you can&apos;t let your head down and I think that&apos;s what he&apos;s doing a little bit.&quot;  Arguably, everybody has become too obsessed with Murray&apos;s on-court demeanour, and the continual references to the sort of minor aches and pains that all players carry throughout the season. Australia&apos;s Rod Laver, the greatest of them all, has been impressed with Murray&apos;s progress. &quot;I like the way he is able to change his game up from player to player,&quot; he said. &quot;He looks very casual in the way he plays, but he&apos;s getting to a lot of shots and he has great accuracy. His court coverage is good and I think that is something that he is going to continually learn. If you can accomplish, knowing what you&apos;re doing and why you&apos;re doing it, then that&apos;s going to breed a champion.&quot;  The one constant in Murray&apos;s short career has been his unswerving self-belief. As a youngster he sauntered alongside his mum, Judy, through the Wimbledon walkways and, as they passed the Centre Court, remarked casually: &quot;I&apos;m going to play there.&quot; Such self-confidence alone will not make him a grand slam champion and he has always insisted that he does not expect to be playing his best tennis for another year or two. But he has always had a clear idea of his own ability and where it can take him.  Wimbledon is not a domestic tournament, no more so than Flushing Meadows, Roland Garros or Melbourne. Each of the four majors brings together the best tennis players in the world every year in a series of four world championships. This is where every player aims to be at his best. This is where the intensity of the individual competition, both physical and mental, is unparalleled in the tennis world.  And it is within this international context, where being the British No1 means absolutely nothing, that Murray, like Henman before him, is attempting to make a mark.", "tags": ["Wimbledon", "Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport", "Wimbledon 2008"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-22T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/24/siemens.bribery", "sentences": ["The group develops highly innovative technologies such as COREX for Baosteel&apos;s new furnace in Shanghai which cuts noxious emissions by up to 95%."], "title": "Scandal-hit Siemens now 'squeaky clean'", "article": "&quot;We are now the most squeaky clean company,&quot; a raft of senior Siemens executives said behind closed doors at a global media summit held this week in London. It&apos;s a huge claim but they&apos;ve all been through intensive compliance training and exhaustive interviews to ensure that Europe&apos;s leading technology group is no longer a byword for bribery and corruption. Ever since the scandal broke in late 2006 the company has been confronted with mounting evidence that officials, perhaps under the blind eye or with the covert connivance of senior managers, used bribes across the globe to win lucrative contracts. It has identified so far \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a31bn) in slush funds and put the cost of cleaning out its Augean stables at \u20ac1.8bn. It is not out of the woods yet. There are ongoing investigations in several countries and current and pending court cases in its home country, Germany. The board is still considering suing former colleagues for compensation. More worryingly, talks with the powerful US financial regulator, the SEC, are still going on with the threat of a fine of more than $1bn (\u00a3500m) and/or the loss of potential contracts still hanging over the group. Peter L\u00f6scher, the Austrian chief executive brought in exactly a year ago to reshape the group and restore its reputation, can only say: &quot;We are making good progress, working intensively with the authorities.&quot; But he can&apos;t give any date for concluding the SEC discussions or indicate the size of the fine being talked about in plea bargaining. An update, he adds, will be given when Siemens publishes its third-quarter results on July 30. But L\u00f6scher, the first non-German to run the company in its 161-year history, is adamant about one thing. Questioned whether Siemens is still being asked to pay bribes, he asserts: &quot;We say no, irrespective of who asks ... We are a clean business here and everywhere.&quot; But I&apos;m told by at least one executive that the company has lost contracts because it refused to pay up. The CEO has already visited Russia, itself a haven of official corruption, three times this year and reports no problems, praising Putin for knowing that Siemens has been active in Russia since 1853. He is a regular visitor to China and is now on the verge of taking his executive team on a long trip to the Middle East. All vital areas for future growth as the western economies skirt stagflation but scarcely bribe-free? L\u00f6scher, very tall and sternly serious, admits the group has another credibility problem. In April he was forced to issue a profits warning after an internal review uncovered problems with key contracts, mainly in power generation and transport, that would cause extraordinary charges of \u20ac860m in the current quarter. And, while seeking to downplay the prospect of further charges, he can&apos;t rule them out. The group&apos;s shares continue to struggle as a result and shareholders, promised higher margin targets earlier this year, are waiting for the good times to roll. They may finally rally early next month when he at last gives details of the \u20ac1.2bn cost-savings plan that, unions say, could mean 10,000 job-losses. In his year in office, L\u00f6scher has reshaped the group, stripping out several layers of management in favour of three core divisions - industry, energy and healthcare - headed by their own CEOs. Around 70 regional companies have been cut to 20 &quot;clusters&quot;. The group has spent \u20ac20bn on acquisitions and raised \u20ac12bn in disposals as it seeks to reposition itself - much like the &quot;competitor&quot; unnamed at the summit (GE where L\u00f6scher worked for four years) - in the face of &quot;mega-trends&quot; such as climate change, urbanisation and demographic upheaval. He has now set his sights on getting all of Siemens&apos;s businesses into the No 1 or 2 position globally compared with the current two-thirds. This week the emphasis has been on &quot;green&quot; technology, with the group claiming environment-friendly products make up a bigger proportion (23% or \u20ac17bn) of its annual revenues than GE&apos;s and aiming for \u20ac25bn by 2011 - but refusing point blank to give any earnings targets, even grosso modo. Certainly, growth in &quot;sustainable&quot; markets such as wind energy has been respectable, at 17% a year, making Siemens the market leader. The group develops highly innovative technologies such as COREX for Baosteel&apos;s new furnace in Shanghai which cuts noxious emissions by up to 95%. But credibility problems continue to dog it. L\u00f6scher insists that, in the &quot;second world economy&quot; in the making, &quot;curbing growth and lowering living standards is not an option&quot; when the global downturn is already achieving that. There is plenty of evidence that, while oil at prices close to $140 a barrel should propel the long-term drive towards alternative fuels, voters are pressing policy-makers for short-term remedies. Siemens this week seemed simply to wish the slowdown away. It also needs to take note of the evidence presented in its own executive slides: in the past five years both China and India have moved faster than anticipated into the hi-tech, low-cost products that directly compete with the likes of Siemens in its home western markets. They are not waiting for Siemens to sort out its internal problems. Even so, L\u00f6scher simply has to sort them out and complete the deep-seated cultural change he is trying to achieve in quick time. This week he said Siemens was one of the few institutions in the world to have a truly global reach - comparing it to the Catholic church and Coke. It is indeed active in 190 countries, with 70% of its staff and 80% of its revenues outside Germany. But, like Michael Ballack, it remains profoundly, old fashionedly German.", "tags": ["Business", "Technology sector", "Telecommunications industry", "Telecoms", "Media", "Technology", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-24T16:22:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jun/25/chinassuperpoweredpoetry", "sentences": ["In every garden we visited from the Yu Gardens in Shanghai to the Master of the Nets Garden in Suzhou, we found tablets, paintings, sculptures inscribed with poetry."], "title": "China's superpowered poetry", "article": "An explosion of poetry ... Lighting fireworks to celebrate the newly-recognised Dragon Boat festival in memory of Qu Yuan. Photograph: China Photos/Getty I wasn&apos;t expecting many poetic encounters travelling through China on a tour bus of 40-odd. An assumption about as wrong as you can get. Poetry is so historically important in China that a brush with verse is inevitable. In every garden we visited from the Yu Gardens in Shanghai to the Master of the Nets Garden in Suzhou, we found tablets, paintings, sculptures inscribed with poetry. As my boy pointed out with his nose stuck in Julia Lovell&apos;s The Great Wall, poetry had such status in ancient China that it became a crucial part of the civil service entrance exams: a skit written by a poet-bureaucrat in Chang&apos;an on the rebel-bandit administration led to the execution of &quot;everyone in the capital - for centuries, the centre to which the elite of China&apos;s poet civil servants had been drawn - who could write poetry&quot;.  Well, so much for the Tang dynasty, but what about poetry in China in 2008? What political significance does poetry in China have today - from interpretation of the classic poets to contemporary poetry? To bang a drum that has been well-thumped by myself, I think we are gravely mistaken when we confuse writing poetry with acting politically. But great poetry undoubtedly pricks and probes political consciousness, in its own time and in ours. This is no straightforward or uncomplicated matter in China - even setting aside questions of censorship - as the example of Qu Yuan in Beijing&apos;s Olympic year illustrates. As we were driving back from visiting the Three Gorges Dam our guide quoted from Qu Yuan, in his words &quot;the Chinese Shakespeare&quot;. As I learnt, we were in China during the first officially recognised Dragon Boat holiday, or Duanwu, on the mainland. The Dragon Boat festival commemorates Qu Yuan&apos;s suicide by drowning and the attempts by the villagers who loved him to stop his body being eaten by fish, banging boats and throwing rice dumplings or zongzhi into the river to distract the fishy fiends. Qu Yuan is officially recognised as a &quot;patriotic poet&quot;. The lines our guide quoted from Ode to an Orange Tree are also quoted on the official Three Gorges Dam website, the poem indicative of Qu Yuan&apos;s &quot;loyalty and integrity&quot; as well as illustrating the poet&apos;s ideal of the state as &quot;independent, unselfish and unyielding&quot;. When our guide quoted Qu Yuan&apos;s poetry I never felt for an instant that we were being fed poetic propaganda. I believe our guide was sincerely engaged with a poet he loved. What became apparent, however, is that contemporary appreciation of classic Chinese poetry is not just a matter of aesthetics. A group of Chinese scholars took the opportunity of the revived Duanwu festival to write an open letter that suggests replacing the omnipresent image of Chairman Mao on one of the yuan bills with that of Qu Yuan. The presence of Qu Yuan on a 20 yuan note has as much to do with a nation&apos;s appreciation of literature as the presence of Dickens or Shakespeare on Bank of England notes. But that&apos;s not the point. The scholars&apos; argument is not really about &quot;reviving culture through the pocketbook&quot; as one website dubbed the campaign. Their complaint is that the official &quot;patriotic&quot; valorisation of Qu Yuan and his poetry has devalued and dimmed this poet&apos;s dissenting voice: &quot;his desire for freedom and his refusal to submit to tyranny, has been obscured and diluted&quot;. What is being contested here is the cultural legacy of Qu Yuan: what does this 2,000-year-old poet mean to Chinese society right here and now? Culture and heritage are big in China at the moment: from the launch of the Cultural Heritage website in the last few weeks to the explosion of interest in western classical music. Literature, too, is being reclaimed and reworked - but how many Chinese poets today are taking up Liu Hongbin&apos;s challenge &quot;to build a historical bridge between the glory of Chinese classical poetry and the ruins of modern Chinese language&quot;? If I had a better grasp (or let&apos;s face it any grasp at all) of Chinese calligraphy I might find the answer on one of the many contemporary poetry sites very much alive and kicking in China. This is an interesting and complicated time for poetry - contemporary and classical - in China. There are no easy answers. Yet wouldn&apos;t it be something if down the line we weren&apos;t just sitting up and taking notice of China&apos;s economic dynamism but of its poetic and political vibrancy as well?", "tags": ["Poetry", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-25T15:00:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/26/art.creditcrunch", "sentences": ["Another example: in my post yesterday came an invitation to an art fair in Shanghai from a Madrid-based gallery that I first encountered at Frieze in London \u2013 further evidence that this it is a completely international scene."], "title": "Charlotte Higgins: In the face of the credit crunch, the art market remains strong", "article": "On the one hand, everyone is obsessed by the credit crunch. On the other, a Monet waterlily painting\u2013 Le Bassin aux Nymph\u00e9as \u2013 has just cracked through the world record auction price for the artist. What&apos;s going on? While money markets totter, how come the art market seems to be staying so strong? And who has the dosh to spend a cool \u00a340.1m on a painting right now? Part of the answer lies in what happens at the top ends of markets \u2013 not just the art market but, say, the housing market. There was an interesting pair of pieces in the London Evening Standard earlier this week, for instance. One article talked about the handful of sought-after London streets in which houses are having no trouble holding their value. Another spoke of a property that has had 40% knocked off its asking price in the past four months. The point both about the houses that are holding their value and, to a much more extreme degree, the Monet, is twofold: rarity and universal appeal.  Monet waterlily paintings are extraordinarily scarce. Nearly every single one of them is in a public collection, and will never come up for sale. On the very rare occasion when such a picture emerges from a private collection and comes on to the market, there are, failing apocalypse and plague, going to be enough super-wealthy individuals who have been waiting half a lifetime to buy it. It&apos;s a question of supply and demand. Equally, Monet waterlilies have an appeal that cuts across cultures and borders. At a basic level, they are completely unobjectionable: there&apos;s nothing controversial, nothing outrageous to offend particular cultural or religious sensibilities. Anyone can appreciate their fragile, limpid gorgeousness; and at the same time they are universally recognised to be vitally important to the trajectory of the history of art. It is extremely unlikely that works like these are going to lose their value, or go out of fashion.  But perhaps the most important reason for the art market&apos;s continued top-end strength is its globalisation, as Jussi Pylkk\u00e4nen, president of Christie&apos;s Europe points out. When the art market crashed in 1990-92, the world was a very different place. Now Russians have fortunes to spend, and China is opening up. The internet means that auction houses are accessible from anywhere. No longer are they the exclusive province of a small club of people. Pylkk\u00e4nen says that top-end buyers have increased threefold over the past five years; this is largely due to the increased geographical reach of his auctions.  Combined with this, there has been a fundamental cultural shift. Interest in contemporary art was largely regarded as a laughable pursuit 30 years ago; now Tate Modern is the most popular tourist destination in London. The super-rich are not immune from this deep social trend. And unlike the rest of us, they can go out and buy art, in quantity. The growth of art fairs is both symptom and cause of this: we have Frieze in London, for example; but they are also multiplying globally. There are now high quality art fairs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, for instance. Pylkk\u00e4nen says that in a recent sale of Victorian paintings at Christie&apos;s, three important Pre-Raphaelite works were bought by Asian collectors. Another example: in my post yesterday came an invitation to an art fair in Shanghai from a Madrid-based gallery that I first encountered at Frieze in London \u2013 further evidence that this it is a completely international scene. Of course, someone like Pylkk\u00e4nen, whose business is market confidence, would never suggest that what is euphemistically termed a &quot;market correction&quot; could be in the offing. Common sense, however, may suggest otherwise. Even if it hasn&apos;t obviously bubbled through the system yet, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if certain parts of the market slow down. There has been talk of the Leipzig school, for instance, and Chinese contemporary art, having recently grown rather overheated in the past couple of years (and for that read overpriced).

Private conversations between lovers revealing details of illicit dealings and exposing high-level fraud are being retold by women to the anti-corruption bureau in Dongguan, a major industrial city in the south. &quot;At least 80% of corrupt officials exposed in Dongguan had mistresses who gave us important information that we did not possess,&quot; the bureau&apos;s deputy director, Zhou Yuefeng, told the China Daily newspaper. Beijing has repeatedly pledged to fight corruption, one of the major causes of public resentment and potential unrest. Earlier this week, it said the situation was &quot;grim&quot; and the task &quot;arduous&quot; as it announced a five-year plan to tackle the problem. Proposals include more public hearings and professional consultation to improve transparency, as well as stricter internal investigation by the Communist party. &quot;Resolutely punishing and effectively preventing corruption relates to whether the people support you or not and to the party&apos;s life-and-death survival,&quot; said the document. &quot;The central government leaders of course put a lot of emphasis on this... They have anti-corruption as a high priority,&quot; said Ren Jiaming, the professor of public policy at Tsinghua University and a specialist on corruption issues. &quot;From our research we can see some anti-corruption as being effective - the tax problem has much been reduced, and also corruption at the customs, which is very serious but is being dealt with.&quot; He said wider changes, such as political reform, were needed to tackle the underlying causes. Others argue punishing bribe-givers as well as bribe-takers was necessary to curb the practice. China&apos;s public servants regulation, which took effect a year ago, says officials must be dismissed if they are found to have mistresses. Zhou said receiving bribes in the form of share dividends was also common among corrupt officials in Dongguan. He cited the case of the former head of a fire brigade who was jailed for five years after receiving a &quot;share dividend&quot; of 1.61m yuan (\u00a3120,000) from a fire prevention equipment company despite not being a shareholder. The fire chief had been rewarded for promoting the company&apos;s business. In another case, 48 customs officers received monthly &quot;salaries&quot; from a local smuggling gang. Zhou said: &quot;A growing number of corrupt officials are trying to circumvent the law. We welcome tip-offs and we will protect and reward informers.&quot; By its very nature, corruption is hard to measure, but it is believed to cost China billions of yuan per year.

Analysts said that the markets are in nervous mood, following fresh indications that the long-running turbulence in the financial sector may still not be over.

In recent years, travel companies have begun offering tour packages to gay visitors to the Middle Kingdom, which is slowly - if awkwardly - coming to terms with homosexuality.

Accompanied by gay, English-speaking guides, Go Pink offers its primarily western clients city tours of Beijing, Shanghai and Xi&apos;an and custom adventure trips to the Silk Road, Yunnan, Sichuan and elsewhere. Sightseeing is enlivened with &quot;insider stories about gay empires, gay affairs in the Forbidden City and the gay history of China.&quot; Go Pink also introduces visitors to local nightlife, and fosters connections with the gay community. In Beijing, clients can network with Promen, and join volunteer programmes.  In 2006, Go Pink had 100 clients. Last year it had about 300. Purple Dragon (00662 238 3227, purpledrag.com), Asia&apos;s oldest and largest gay travel company, based in Bangkok, now sends some 600 clients a year to China, and Tongzhi Holidays (00852 29828281, tongzhiholidays.com) offers gay packages to Hong Kong and Macao.  Western travel companies also offer gay-friendly China packages. Man Trav (0845 0266 906, mantrav.co.uk) has three packages to China, including a 13-day Yangtze Passage cruise, \u20ac2,295 for two.

Murray meets the eighth seed on Centre Court tomorrow. Despite the fact that Gasquet reached the semi-finals here last year, and has a 2-0 record in head-to-heads, the Scot will fancy his chances. Gasquet was not impressive in defeating his countryman Gilles Simon - who had never been beyond the third round - 6-3 6-3 6-7 6-3 on No1 Court and continues to show signs of flakiness. Gasquet, from Serignan, in southern France, is only 22 but seems to have been around a long time. He featured on the front of the French Tennis magazine when he was nine years old, having had a racket put in his hand as soon as he could walk by his tennis-coach parents. He has promised much throughout his career but has too often faltered. Yesterday he gave a typically inventive but patchy display. Against Simon, he dropped the third set, when it appeared easier to be back in the locker room, then suffered a break in the opening game of the fourth, having taken the opening two sets in 66 minutes. Gasquet failed to close out the match in straightforward fashion against an opponent who had not taken a set from him in their previous two meetings. His main failing was dodgy shot selection. On too many occasions Gasquet opted to serve and volley, which is not his natural game, and this is a weakness Murray, an astute tactician, will seek to exploit. What the British No1 will also hope to diffuse is the threat from Gasquet&apos;s range of shot. His array of winners against Simon included sliced drop-shots, a fierce serve at nearly 135mph and a formidable backhand that is his box-office shot. Gasquet takes this stroke high and single-handed, allowing him to unleash a singular power on clean connection that leaves little chance of a response. But the backhand was not on show as much as Gasquet would have liked, and he will be disappointed that he allowed his concentration to wander. This was perhaps not a surprise as Gasquet is reckoned to have a brittle temperament.  He has found the expectations placed on him difficult to cope with. Not only was he a cover boy at the age of nine, he was the second youngest male to appear in the French Open, just short of his 16th birthday.  Last year at this tournament, Gasquet came from two sets down against Andy Roddick to reach the semi-finals. There was no shame in being defeated by Roger Federer who took his fifth title. That win against Roddick is considered Gasquet&apos;s finest performance of a career which has so far yielded more than \u00a31.5m in prize money. Yet there remain nagging doubts about his mental strength. In France&apos;s Davis Cup tie against the United States in April, he refused to play Roddick ostensibly because of a blistered hand. But Gasquet also admitted he was not confident enough to beat the American, then subsequently played in a dead rubber later the same day. In 2007 he considered missing the Paris Masters because of a knee injury. But, again, there was a telling admission when Gasquet said he was fearful of the reaction from French fans &apos;if things go wrong&apos;. Confidence seems to be a problem. After victory against Simon, who is ranked 28th in the world, he said, &apos;It was really difficult. I lost a lot of confidence at the beginning of the fourth.&apos; Gasquet, who was ranked as high as seven in August of last year, has won as many titles as Murray, five, but has also managed to reach two Masters finals, in Toronto and Hamburg, both of which he lost to Federer. He also had two more titles on grass than Murray, having won Nottingham in 2006 and 2007. Murray has so far come off second best in two previous meetings with Gasquet. Last November the Frenchman denied him the final place in the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai by defeating him 6-3 0-6 6-4 in the quarter-final of the Paris Masters. The Scot, though, will take heart from the whitewash he gave Gasquet in the second set - a result of him applying soft hands when returning serve that puzzled his opponent.  Of tomorrow&apos;s meeting, Gasquet said, &apos;I love to play this match and he is great player.&apos; If he is to progress, though, Gasquet will have to be far more ruthless.", "tags": ["Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport", "Wimbledon 2008"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-28T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/29/olympicgames2008.china", "sentences": ["The bar&apos;s owner, Yu Huai Ying, is a fan of United and of English football since the Seventies, owner of restaurants in Shanghai and Beijing, and poised to cash in on massive interest in European football in China and for the Olympics.", "In 1993, when his father fell ill, he returned to China, establishing a studio called East Village, then his current studio, called Fake - a thinly veiled play on the name of an exhibition he staged in Shanghai called &apos;Fuck Off&apos; - and staging such installations as painting a Coca-Cola label on to an ancient Han vase and then smashing it."], "title": "Special report: the nest generation", "article": "As the crowds converge through the heat of a sickly dusk, their expectation turns into a collective gasp - a moment of awe - as a red glow appears from within the stadium known universally as the &apos;Bird&apos;s Nest&apos;.  The incandescence seems to throb like the building&apos;s heartbeat, such is the effect of this central showpiece of Beijing&apos;s Olympics - and thereby of modern China. Entwining momentum with sturdiness, chaos with order, its vortex of steel latticework is a marvel of imagination and engineering, and scene of tonight&apos;s inaugural athletics event, the Chinese Athletics Open, which is itself a rehearsal for the real thing.  We are now 76 days from the opening ceremony, but China has been preparing a decade for this, and building frantically ever since Beijing won the Games in 2001. August&apos;s showpiece will be as controversial as it is momentous. The concern about human rights in China has sharpened as abuses have increased in the run-up; the journey of the Olympic torch (a ritual introduced by Josef Goebbels in 1936, without precedent) through London, Paris and San Francisco was disrupted by protests against China&apos;s occupation of Tibet. And by way of a tragic overture to China&apos;s supposed opening to the world in August, a terrible earthquake struck Sichuan province. It will unavoidably remain a macabre backdrop to the Games.  I have come to see the city&apos;s final preparations for myself and to find out how the Games are viewed outside the Olympic village. The wondrous Bird&apos;s Nest is ready, and inside, on this Friday night, the Athletics Open - a &apos;test event&apos; to make sure things are running seamlessly - proceeds, bathed in white light. Among the most important rehearsals are the medal presentations and, with the majority awarded to Chinese competitors, the hoisting of three red flags gets plenty of practice.  Four decades ago, a Chinese athlete who was overly successful could be accused of jinbiao zhuyi, or &apos;trophy mania&apos;, which meant pitching their individual achievement above the state&apos;s goal of mass athleticism. But since China came second to the United States in the medal tally at the Athens Olympics, the old Cold War jostle between America and the Soviet Union has become one between the US and this year&apos;s hosts. And while the Chinese team are favourites to top the table this time, their track-and-field athletes - America&apos;s strongest suit - are largely untried. So the outcome of China&apos;s great Olympic experiment will be decided here in the Bird&apos;s Nest, where the speaker system is belting out not only the Chinese national anthem but also Celine Dion&apos;s &apos;The Power of Love&apos; and some sort of sub-Chariots of Fire tune.  Wandering beneath the 42,000 tonnes of steel latticework, I ascertain that a 355ml can of official Olympic Yanjing beer costs five yueng (40p), and that the lavatories are done very smartly: black walls, which then become deep socialist red inside the private cubicles. I also glimpse the VIP seating area, where the world&apos;s leaders will place their backsides alongside those of the communist elite on some 1,200 red velvetine seats, which lean forward rather uncomfortably. If Germany&apos;s Chancellor Angela Merkel does boycott the opening ceremony in protest at China&apos;s human-rights record, she will miss out on the textured &apos;embroidery&apos; effect of the red faux-velvet walls of the VIP lounge, as well as lavatories of a much higher standard than those for the masses. The basins are cut in black marble, shallow and square like a pond in a formal Chinese garden, and the black walls are flecked with gold.  Back out on the track, only about a tenth of the tens of thousands of lights are being used to floodlight this event. The other banks of bulbs are blackened out until the opening ceremony, which, according to tradition, has to try to outstrip all before it for spectacular trickery. And which China will succeed in doing, if these light fittings are anything to go by.  The evening in the Bird&apos;s Nest reaches its climax with the appearance of the first Chinese man to win an Olympic track gold. Hurdler Liu Xiang is the poster boy of China; he is what David Beckham was to England half a decade ago, only in a country of 1.3 billion people. Winner of the 110metres event in Athens four years ago, he is expected to repeat that feat this summer, and his presence in the Bird&apos;s Nest tonight is the reason why 60,000 of the 81,000 seats are occupied. As the event nears, his name is chanted in high-pitched female voices. The music makes way for an electronic heartbeat and a slow-motion film of Liu&apos;s imposing, compact frame fills the screen. And there he is on the track, folding his red shirt over his eight-pack as a forest of cameras flash. After one false start, and 13.47 seconds of breathtaking acceleration, Liu leaves the field behind him and breaks the tape for gold. Before he has even received his medal, at least half the crowd make to leave - this is what they came for.  Beijing&apos;s population of 15 million has for some years now been added to by incalculable millions come from the provinces to build the Olympic village (never mind the extra construction in the city itself). The Games themselves will, of course, attract further hordes, and no test event can predict whether the city can cope with the logistics of 400,000 people moving in and out of it at any given moment, not to mention the 11,000 VIPs at the opening ceremony, who need a full security despatch.  The building work has been relentless, and at express speed: one skyscraper in the village, a hotel complex with what looks like a chef&apos;s hat on top, was only three storeys high last October. Every now and then, you get a glimpse of how this part of the city must have looked only recently - little streets with pagoda-style architecture, and still a few bicycles - before it was razed to the ground and recreated as a metropolis of concrete, unapologetic ugliness, punctuated by the odd monument to modernity, usually designed by a famous foreign architect. Chairman Mao Zedong still looks down over Tiananmen Square, but all around is a more fervent reverence for icons such as Valentino and Nike, and it is easier to find a Versace suit than a toothbrush in the shops.  The immediate surroundings of the Olympic village are a visual cacophony of concrete skyscrapers, through which crawls a spaghetti-bowl of roads heaving with traffic. And you wonder: what happened to all the people who lived here? How many were moved and where are they? China&apos;s foreign ministry says 6,037 families have been displaced by preparations for the Olympics, but the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions calculates that up to 1.5 million people may be moved, including by related urban development projects, by this August.  To find where they have been moved to, you have to journey into an altogether different city: past the office blocks, to where the steel and glass give way to older, residential blocks with iron grilles over the windows and balconies; past forests of electric pylons, branches of B&amp;Q and Carrefour, into the Chang Ping suburb, where low-rise housing is fronted by welding shops, auto-part shops and bamboo stalls. Where people are out of sight and out of mind.  One of the most famous political prisoners in China (and an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience) is Ye Guozhu, sentenced to four years&apos; imprisonment for leading the first demonstration against forced evictions related to the Olympics. Out here in Chang Ping, Sun Yongliang, who led his local campaign against the mass demolitions before he was forced to move and still tries to co-ordinate compensation suits, remains at liberty.  He himself has settled his case with the government but, despite a gagging order, is happy to talk - if we meet on a lonely street, a very long way from the community of Yung Shen where he used to live, opposite the Olympic Village. His was the very last shack to defy the bulldozers. But now he, too, has gone, having struck a compensation deal which he says he is &apos;very unhappy with&apos;.  Sun&apos;s community had numbered 550 homes, most of whose families - including that of his wife, Chen Zongxia - had lived there for at least four generations. Most villagers had been peasants, tending small plots of land, but had, like Sun, adapted their family economies by renting rooms to migrant construction workers. First, bulldozers removed most homes, then the water was cut off. Finally, Sun and his family were alone.  &apos;My family forced me to [settle],&apos; he says. &apos;My mother-in-law suffered from diabetes and wanted to give up. I was ready to burn myself and the house rather than be moved. They lied to the old people, they kept pretending that the demolitions were nothing to do with the Olympics, and only in the end admitted that they were. Many people have not been compensated at all, and when the authorities did the deal with me, they told me to shut up. How can anyone win a battle against the government? There are just so many people in Beijing whose houses have been demolished. There have been cases in the Chao Yang district when they&apos;ve just come in the night, covered the people in sheets, dragged them out and demolished the houses.&apos; Sun has previously been calm, but he becomes suddenly angry. &apos;You wouldn&apos;t see anything about demolitions for the Olympics in the Chinese media. It spoils the Olympics for me, certainly.&apos;  For many people, this summer&apos;s Beijing Games will stand for the entwinement of globalised trade with communist authoritarianism to create the world&apos;s fastest-growing economy, and a treaty between both creeds that there is no problem between them, so long as the money is right.  It was China itself which linked the procurement of the Olympics to the country&apos;s record on human rights. Wang Wei, secretary general of the bid committee, said he was &apos;confident the Games coming to China not only promotes our economy but also enhances all social conditions, including... human rights&apos;. The International Olympic Committee have said repeatedly that they expect human rights in China to improve as a result of the Games. But Amnesty International could not be more articulate about the impact of the Olympics on human rights. In a report issued in April, Amnesty collated a wave of recent imprisonments and abuses: &apos;It is increasingly clear that much of the current wave of repression is occurring not in spite of the Olympics, but actually because of the Olympics. Peaceful human-rights activists, and others who have publicly criticised official government policy, have been targeted in the official pre-Olympics &quot;clean-up&quot;, in an apparent attempt to portray a &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;harmonious&quot; image to the world by August 2008.&apos;  In March, the leading human-rights activist Hu Jia became the latest in a long line of those convicted and imprisoned for &apos;inciting subversion&apos;. One of Hu&apos;s causes was that of up to 800,000 workers, sacked by two Chinese petroleum giants, whose demands for compensation are led by activist Xiao Yishan. Xiao is a haunted, frightened woman of middle age, who makes a long journey from her suburb to meet on a street in the locality of foreign embassies, because she says it is safer that way. She is smartly dressed in a silk trouser suit, but clearly exhausted by fear and a recent operation for cancer. She talks about her own cause, about how its local leaders in the provinces have been &apos;harassed and imprisoned&apos;, and are unable to hold any kind of demonstration in Beijing because of the Olympics.  &apos;That is the last thing the government wants people to see,&apos; she says. &apos;This country is very patriotic and we are all proud Chinese. Our cause is not that of Tibet, but they are using Tibet and the Olympics to make things harder. I am in touch with Hu Jia through his wife, and the one thing he wants to make clear is that he is not an enemy of China, he is simply a friend of democracy.&apos;  On my first evening in Beijing, needing to get away from the cults of Mao and consumerism that dominate the city centre, I head for the student quarter of Chao Wang. A group of young students and workers are gathered on the edge of a lake, where candle flames burn in the shape of a heart, to mourn the dead of the Sichuan earthquake, to pray and hear speeches. The earthquake is an unavoidable backdrop to the stadium&apos;s inauguration: the pity of the tens of thousands of lives it claimed, the heroic rescue work, and the anger of the bereaved - especially the families of dead children - at the corruption that caused shoddy building and high casualties. In one way, the horror opened China to examination it has never faced from outside; in another, it gave the Olympic host nation a human face. This event at Chao Wang adds something else: the degree to which the earthquake and the Olympics are related in the minds of the young. I see here that the Games consolidate a third force, other than loyalty to Chinese communism or the march of Nike and Microsoft. That they are the focus for a fiercely reinvigorated Chinese nationalism.  The crowd mourning the dead chants the Mandarin equivalent of &apos; Forza !&apos; or &apos;Here we go!&apos; - it is &apos; Jaio !&apos;, literally &apos;Add oil!&apos;, as per &apos;pour on petrol&apos;. &apos;The Chinese people have never been so united,&apos; the speaker says. &apos;Unity is power!&apos;  One construction worker from the provinces tells me: &apos;We are sad because we are mourning the people, but we are happy because we are so united as a nation. With the Olympic Games, we will show the world how united we are, and that we are the greatest people in the world.&apos; &apos;Out of our suffering and unity over the earthquake will come victory at the Olympics,&apos; says his friend.  The same night, the Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea is taking place. Kick-off is at an unfriendly 2.45am Beijing time, but at Yu Huai Ying&apos;s bar in town, which hosts the Beijing branch of the Manchester United Supporters Club, all three storeys are full of young Chinese, girls and boys, pouring back beer, eating chips with ketchup and wearing United shirts. There is a signed photograph of the young David Beckham on the wall, and some others of golden oldies such as Ray Wilkins.  The bar&apos;s owner, Yu Huai Ying, is a fan of United and of English football since the Seventies, owner of restaurants in Shanghai and Beijing, and poised to cash in on massive interest in European football in China and for the Olympics. &apos;The Olympics will be very big in here,&apos; he says. &apos;The same crowd will come, it&apos;ll be packed in here. But only because it is happening in China, and because there is the chance that China can win.&apos;  Wu, an engineering student drinking in the bar, says he will be watching the Games here. &apos;We certainly can&apos;t afford tickets for the stadium,&apos; he says, &apos;but I&apos;m curious and want to see Liu Xiang win again for our country.&apos;  On my final day in Beijing, I go in search of the Bird&apos;s Nest&apos;s creative origins, which entails a journey beyond the depressing Lego-brick city to a very intriguing quarter. &apos;Arts Zone 798&apos; and the series of studios beyond it constitute a rather lovely corner of Beijing, where old streets and buildings have been spared the bulldozer and turned into a kind of trendy theme park in which the authorities seem not only to permit but encourage cultural activity.  This is where the male ponytails and John Lennon glasses are, the sidewalk cafes with smoked-salmon salads, art galleries and boutiques that sell Mao-chic clothing - wonderful silk dressing gowns printed with pictures of the Red Guard. And a little way beyond here is the studio of the most remarkable artist in China, Ai Weiwei. On the wall looking on to the street are neon letters reading simply &apos;FUCK&apos;.  The Bird&apos;s Nest was designed by the Swiss company Herzog &amp; de Meuron; but the ideas were Ai&apos;s. He is a gentle, thoughtful but bear-like man, wearing a T-shirt and beard. The architects called him the project&apos;s &apos;creative consultant&apos;, but Ai says characteristically of his role: &apos;I don&apos;t need a title - I would prefer &quot;The Untitled&quot;.&apos;  Ai grew up in the Xinjiang hard-labour camp, his father Ai Qing having been imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution as China&apos;s leading poet and a foremost dissident. &apos;I know what I know,&apos; Ai says, &apos;because, as a child, I have seen the opposite of freedom. I have seen many people killed, the results of stupidity and cruelty and the results of courage. I have learned that to turn humankind into a creative force is a terrible problem.&apos;  Ai studied at Beijing Film Academy, before founding an avant-garde circle called the Stars and emigrating to New York, where he lived for 12 years. In 1993, when his father fell ill, he returned to China, establishing a studio called East Village, then his current studio, called Fake - a thinly veiled play on the name of an exhibition he staged in Shanghai called &apos;Fuck Off&apos; - and staging such installations as painting a Coca-Cola label on to an ancient Han vase and then smashing it.  It was a fine stroke by Herzog &amp; de Meuron to turn the rascal of the Chinese alternative into the muse for China&apos;s second most recognisable monument after the Great Wall. It means he can do what most Chinese cannot: speak his mind about the regime.  Ai worked on what he calls the &apos;aesthetic and philosophical aspects&apos; of the stadium&apos;s design: &apos;on the shape, and how the shape would relate to the city and to the present situation in China&apos;. We talk about the impression of swirling sturdiness upon seeing the stadium the first time: &apos;control, and losing control and the same time&apos;, as Ai puts it. &apos;The shape of the stadium is intended to reflect yearning for the rule of reason, but not without passion and dynamism - wanting to show that the head and the heart can coexist.&apos;  One of the most striking things about the Bird&apos;s Nest is the way the latticework makes the arena open to the exterior. Many have observed that this is a way of keeping the smog from settling, by admitting a breeze. But there is another reason too, Ai says. &apos;It is intended to be a statement about the need for a more open society, open discussion, greater transparency. I wanted it to have that kind of image, that kind of energy. I don&apos;t believe you can relate architecture to political statements, but architecture will always relate to ideology. And I do not see ideology as a matter of left and right, or East and West, any more. I see the tension in ideology as being between a more interesting state of mind, and a more dreadful state of mind; these are the things that divide mankind. The artist should be for the interesting against the dreadful.&apos;  Surprisingly, however, Ai has not yet visited the iconic building he inspired. &apos;I have never been in a stadium in my life,&apos; Ai says, &apos;and I never will. I doubt I will ever go into the Bird&apos;s Nest, because I am leaving the city for the Olympics, and not as a boycott - as some have said. Yes, I feel outraged at the Chinese government, and I am disgusted by the way power is abused in this country. But I have been misunderstood - I think the Olympics is a good opportunity for greater transparency in China.  &apos;I am leaving town simply because I don&apos;t want to have to talk about it all the time, and I don&apos;t want to offend people by saying so,&apos; he continues. &apos;I am much more interested in what is going to happen to it after the Games. I would like it to become a place where people like to go, bring their children or can come for mass weddings, or maybe mass divorces - or, best of all, to have big barbecues together.&apos;  And what will be Ai&apos;s next project? &apos;I&apos;m not sure. I&apos;m very busy these days. Maybe to have some lunch, then a nap, or maybe to stroke my cats. I haven&apos;t made up my mind.&apos;  China&apos;s olympic hopes There are an awful lot of hearts to break in the world&apos;s most populous nation, so you have to feel for 110m hurdling superstar Liu Xiang, who carries the hopes and expectations of 1.3 billion compatriots and a government that initially set its team a target of 119 medals. Liu will not be alone in the Beijing pressure cooker.  It is hoped that Cheng Fei, China&apos;s most successful female gymnast, will win gold on the floor, but nothing less than gold will do in her specialist discipline, the vault. The men&apos;s table tennis team, who dominate their sport, are expected to win a complete medal sweep: number three\u2011ranked Wang Liqin is seen as a potential weak link, though - he is nicknamed &apos;chicken heart&apos; for his tendency to lose big matches.  Although the defending Olympic champion and the favourite in the air rifle competition, Du Li faces the unique pressure of trying to win the first medal on offer.  A poll by Xinhua News Agency revealed women&apos;s volleyball as the gold medal &apos;most wanted by the Chinese&apos; after the 110m hurdles, so captain Feng Kun and her team will need to perform. In contrast, there is very little pressure on the man with the broadest shoulders: basketball player Yao Ming, a giant in stature, even in the NBA, and homeland popularity, is not expected to win anything with an under-par Chinese team.", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Sport", "China", "Olympics 2008: Athletics", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-28T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/30/wimbledon.tennis1", "sentences": ["In 2005 Gasquet made the world top 20; last year he reached the top 10, winning a place at the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, which is reserved for the world&apos;s eight leading players."], "title": "Gasquet has the skill to upset Murray but is he a soft touch?", "article": "Richard Gasquet, who stands between Andy Murray and his first Wimbledon quarter-final this afternoon, sauntered slowly through the All England club towards the practice courts yesterday lunchtime, accompanied by his mother, Maryse. It would not have been surprising had baguettes been tucked under their arms, for herein lies a family relationship that many in France believe has led to so many of Gasquet&apos;s troubles - namely that his family have stifled him emotionally and never really allowed him to grow up. He was singled out early as a future champion, appearing on the front of a French tennis magazine when he was nine. The expectations have always been immense (Wimbledon-esque, you might say), so much so that Gasquet has frequently wilted under the all-pervading pressure. This has, notably, been the case at the French Open where he has won only four matches in six attempts and this year pulled out just before the start with an injury that some believed was psychosomatic. &quot;Blockage of the knee&quot; was the medical translation. Blockage in his head was the inference. Such a poor record at Roland Garros is a paltry return for a player of immense talent, the possessor of one of the most sublime one-handed backhands in the world. Not that anyone in Britain or, more particularly, Wimbledon should spend today imagining him to be a malfunctioning head case. While the 22-year-old&apos;s progress has not been as spectacular as that of Rafael Nadal, the world No2 whom either he or Murray may meet in Wednesday&apos;s quarter-finals, it has been impressive enough. In 2005 Gasquet made the world top 20; last year he reached the top 10, winning a place at the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, which is reserved for the world&apos;s eight leading players. He clinched that place by defeating Murray at the Paris Indoor Open, when the home pressure was obviously intense. Indeed, all appeared to be well as the year began but then came a fourth-round defeat in the Australian Open by a fellow Frenchman, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who famously went on to reach the final. Suddenly, or so it seemed, all the expectations about Gasquet becoming a grand slam winner piled on to his shoulders once again. Suggestions were made that he should break free of his parents&apos; emotional influence, that they were killing him softly with kindness. Where was the fight? Where was the steel? When would he grow up? His withdrawal from the Beijing Olympics further fuelled the debate - an extremely civilised one, being French - although Gasquet has partly answered his critics here over the last week. He entered Wimbledon knowing that an early defeat would drop him out of the world top 20 but also remembering his feat in reaching a first major semi-final here last year, when he lost 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 to the eventual champion, Roger Federer.  Before this year&apos;s French Open such was his frame of mind that few expected him to survive even the first round. However, Gasquet has gradually rediscovered the form on grass that saw him win a thrilling five-set quarter-final from two-sets down against Andy Roddick last year.  &quot;It&apos;s going to be a tough match,&quot; said Murray, who last night went out for an Italian meal with his gran, grandad, mother and brother, Jamie, before watching the final of Euro 2008. &quot;He can hit most shots, serves and volleys a little bit and he moves particularly well on grass which not too many of the guys do.&quot; Gasquet has won both their previous meetings, though this is a very different Murray from the one that lost to Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus at the same stage two years ago. &quot;It was the first time I had made the fourth round of a slam and I was not used to playing tournaments lasting more than a week,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I know that, if you want to go deep into a slam, you need a bit of time away from the court as well.&quot; In other words Murray is growing up and leading a more rounded life.  &quot;In previous years I went on court a little bit stressed so I became a bit tired after a few matches. This year it&apos;s been different; I&apos;ve dealt with everything much better and feel more relaxed on the court. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll perform much better against Gasquet than I did a couple of years ago. Now I feel I&apos;m well prepared physically and mentally and much stronger. So everything else takes care of itself. It&apos;s just up to me to play tennis well and that&apos;s what I do. It&apos;s what I&apos;ve done my whole life.&quot;", "tags": ["Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport", "Wimbledon 2008"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-29T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/jul/01/michaelwhitespoliticalblog195", "sentences": ["That title will surely go to Shanghai, Mumbai or even Dubai, an FT colleague had told him."], "title": "London - capital of the 21st century?", "article": "&quot;The strength of this town is the foreigners.&quot; Which town? London. Who says? Marco Niada, an Italian correspondent long resident here. He has just written a book to coincide with his return home and delivered a promotion speech which I listened to at the ambassador&apos;s residence the other evening. Outsiders&apos; perspectives are usually worth hearing, so I started taking notes. Niada&apos;s assertion was that London has always been &quot;a big head on a small body&quot;, disproportionately larger than the country in which it sits in a way that is not true of France or Italy - the &quot;country of 100 cities&quot;. Italians feel slightly proprietorial about London because they can claim to have founded it on marshy gravel islands at the lowest crossing point of the Thames after the conquest in AD43.  From zero population to 60,000, it was sacked by Boudicca (AD60-61), restored, but later reduced to barely 3,000 after Rome&apos;s regions withdrew in 415, leaving the Brits to fend (badly) for themselves.  &quot;London was created by Romans, destroyed by the locals,&quot; the author explained. It took until the 1300s to get the population back to 60,000 locals, by which time they were under Norman management. If that sounds unflattering, it isn&apos;t. Niada&apos;s book is called The New London, Capital of the 21st Century (it&apos;s all in Italian, by the way, including the title) and his argument is that the city&apos;s fortunes have waxed and waned over 2,000 years, but that it always works best when it is outward-looking, connected to the wider world.  It makes better sense of its disproportionate domestic size: &quot;It needed the outer world to sustain its size,&quot; as our visiting foreigner put it. All this is probably familiar to geographers, but not to me. I vaguely knew that London was the largest city north of the Alps in the age of Imperial Rome, substantial in a way that Lutetia - Paris - was not; also that the Roman road network was the best we had until the late 18th century (there is always an upside to empires) when improvements resumed. Plumbing? Let&apos;s not even think about comparisons, at least not before those Poles arrived. Anyway Marco&apos;s thesis (I&apos;ve known him for years. He is very kind, and with his wife raised funds to build a school in Afghanistan) is that London started opening up to become a big city again under Elizabeth I, took off in the 17th century, became a world-trading hub in the 18th century and industrially dominant in the 19th century - until the Germans and Americans got cracking.  It reached 1 million inhabitants by 1800, 7 million by 1900 and then declined to the point where a quarter of its inhabitants were telling pollsters they wanted to leave by 1990, the same year Mrs Thatcher did.  Since when globalisation - and the luck of language and time zones which allow traders to deal with both New York and Asian markets every day - have again restored its fortunes: &quot;flooded by foreigners again because it was again able to put itself at the centre of world transactions.&quot; Niada seems to believe that what he calls &quot;London&apos;s ruling class&quot; opened itself up to competition - so that entrepreneurs, bankers, executive types poured it. I&apos;m not sure if they see it that way.  But poor and middling people have come too, including Italians. In 1800 they were political refugees, later craftsmen, then poor people - until Italy got rich in the 1970s. In the latest surge entrepreneurs as well as Venetian waiters (coincidentally I was served by one in a London pub the other night) have returned. There are 300 languages spoken here now, 100,000 Italians and 300,000 French - &quot;one of France&apos;s great cities&quot; as Sarko put it when he came looking for votes.  Marco says Italian influence is felt in the language - zucchini instead of courgette? - and via the better coffee. They have also helped make us more relaxed. Hmm. Not sure about that either. There is a downside to huge numbers of incomers, especially among poorer locals who compete for jobs and resources, those who do compete.  I also am aware that London talk annoys many non-Londoners. &quot;Can we hear more about this fascinating and under-reported part of the country?&quot; a Guardian letter-writer once sarcastically demanded. In any case Niada&apos;s flattering account was promptly deflated by a local, James Blitz, a former Rome correspondent of the FT.  Capital of the 21st century? You must be joking. That title will surely go to Shanghai, Mumbai or even Dubai, an FT colleague had told him. London, said Blitz, is the Wimbledon of finance - better at organising the event than actually doing it.  But he also revealed that Niada, who works for the financial daily 24 Ore, commutes to his office on a smart Italian Vespa 250cc. On his journey he likes to count the other Vespas and to analyse the stylish clothes which their riders are wearing.  &quot;Only an Italian would do that.&quot;", "tags": ["Local politics", "London", "UK news", "Politics", "Dubai", "World news", "United Arab Emirates"], "publicationDate": "2008-06-30T23:23:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/02/2", "sentences": ["Associated Press in Mexico City Man kills five in knife attack on police station A man armed with a knife stormed a police station in Shanghai yesterday, attacking officers and killing at least five.", "The 28-year-old man started a fire outside a gate of the building, then rushed inside and began stabbing officers, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau said.", "The man, who was from Beijing and unemployed, said he was seeking revenge after officers at the station in Shanghai&apos;s Zhabei district investigated him last year for allegedly stealing bicycles, police said."], "title": "World news in brief'", "article": "Police videos of torture training shock TV viewers Videos showing police practicing torture techniques on a fellow officer, dragging another through vomit and jumping on a suspect have sparked outrage after they were broadcast on Mexican television and newspaper websites yesterday.

The remarkable Jie Zheng was watched by an estimated television audience of over 100 million in China yesterday as she became the first woman from that vast country to reach the last four at Wimbledon. The audience in Shanghai alone was 14 million. Zheng, ranked 133 in the world having been No786 at the turn of the century, also became the first wild-card entry to reach the semi-finals here as she beat Nicole Vaidisova, the 18th seed, 6-2, 5-7, 6-1. The most heart-warming piece in this story is that Zheng, who turns 25 on Saturday, will not pocket one penny of the \u00a3187,500 in prize money she is guaranteed so far. She will donate her winnings to the fund set up following the earthquake in the Sichuan Province in south-west China in May which killed 60,000 people and left five million homeless.  &quot;I would like to give all the money,&quot; she said, &quot;but some will go to the tennis association. Apart from this I will do some charity work when I get back after Wimbledon.&quot;  She had already knocked out the 30th seed, Dominika Cibulkova, in the first round and Britain&apos;s Elena Baltacha in the second. Then she beat the No 1 seed, Ana Ivanovic, followed by Agnes Szavay, the 15th, in the fourth round. Yesterday she lost a set for the first time. Next up is Serena Williams.  Granted, that 133rd ranking might be a little misleading. Zheng was actually as high as No27 in August last year, but she slipped back following surgery on her left ankle. Furthermore, she is already a Wimbledon champion, having won the doubles title here two years ago. But the 5ft 4in girl was still very much second favourite to beat Vaidisova, who is 8in taller and hits the ball a lot harder. However, Zheng used her height, or lack of it, to get right down to the low balls - she also hit some astonishing 80mph aces which skidded through at about knee height to the Czech. &quot;Serena is two-times winner of Wimbledon and a very prominent player on the grass court,&quot; Zheng said. &quot;For me, I&apos;m only a first-timer to enter the semi-final. And in 2004, in the first round, I lost to Serena when she was defending champion.&quot; Zheng almost gave the impression that she is doing little more here than passing the time until the Olympics in Beijing in August. &quot;Maybe this is my last tournament before the Olympics,&quot; she said. &quot;We want to try our best in the Olympics. Tennis in China is very important because we won Olympic gold in the doubles [ courtesy of Li Ting and Sun Tiantian in Athens in 2004].  &quot;The Olympics in China is very important. Everyone wants to win a gold medal. I think maybe the doubles is more a chance for me to win the gold medal. But also it is tough. Many good players come to play the Olympics this year. I will play both singles and doubles. I now feel I have more belief to play in the Olympics.&quot; Zheng&apos;s main weapon in these Championships has been her rasping, double-handed backhand. &quot;I started to learn tennis by playing with both hands  because I was not strong enough,&quot; she said. &quot;In that time one coach will have more than 10 to 20 kids. None of my family is a tennis player. When I was a child I was very lively and sporty. To play tennis was an accident choice. The boys play more table tennis. Chinese men need more fitness, more power.&quot; According to Tennis Magazine China there are an estimated 10 million people now playing the game in the country, with more than 1,000 over the age of 10 playing full time. Hongbo Chen, a journalist, said: &quot;We are building so many courts it is impossible to count. Every block of flats being constructed has a swimming pool and tennis courts.&quot; Before Zheng, Li Na was the most successful woman from China at Wimbledon, reaching the quarter-finals two years ago.

In the financial year 2007-08, a record 6 million people came through the doors, including 35,000 who visited on a single day to celebrate the Chinese new year. The museum&apos;s director, Neil MacGregor, said: &quot;We had to shut the main gates on Great Russell Street to prevent more people from coming in. It was the first time we did that since the Chartist riots of 1848 - although on that occasion the staff were actually on the roof, armed with stones.&quot; The 6.049 million total number of visitors - up by more than a million on the previous year - means that the museum beat Tate Modern to become the most visited cultural attraction in the UK. It is a measure of this success that MacGregor was headhunted to become director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, following the announcement of the retirement of Philippe de Montebello, in January. However, MacGregor, 62, announced yesterday that he had signed a contract to run the British Museum for a further five years. This will take his tenure up to the Olympic year of 2012 - and means he should see through the redevelopment of the north-west corner of the museum into new galleries for large temporary exhibitions. &quot;I had conversations with the Met,&quot; he said, &quot;but on the basis that I was going to stay here. I had conversations with them about what their future plans might be - but not as a candidate. I made that clear from the start.&quot; MacGregor said his desire to stay at the helm of the museum came from the idea that &quot;the opportunities and challenges for a world collection in London are limitless - greater than anywhere else in the world. There are very few other places, if anywhere, that you can look at 20th century American prints, and ancient Chinese art, and statues of Hadrian, in one building. And the Met is not a public museum - whereas the British Museum is a public institution and the public museums of London have always been free to everyone.&quot; Other successes have included the touring of exhibitions to Dubai and, currently, a show about the ancient Olympic games in Shanghai, which is attracting up to 5,000 visitors a day. That exhibition will also tour to Hong Kong, where it will be seen during the Beijing games. But the biggest single success was the First Emperor exhibition, with its sculptures from the terracotta army, which brought 850,000 people to Bloomsbury, the most for an exhibition there since Tutankhamun attracted 1.7 million in 1972. MacGregor announced the final instalments of a group of exhibitions designed to examine the nature of empire and power. The first was the terracotta army exhibition; the second is the forthcoming Hadrian show, which opens this month. The quartet is to be completed, announced MacGregor, by an exhibition about Shah Abbas, the great 16th- to 17th-century ruler of Persia who combined personal brutality (killing and blinding his sons) with an unparalleled religious tolerance. The final of the four, for autumn 2009, will look at Moctezuma, and the collision of his successful and expanding Aztec empire with Europeans in the early 16th century. Excitement is already building around Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, which opens on July 24, and has sold 10,000 advance tickets. The exhibition will include some sensational new finds, such as a monumental stone head of the emperor excavated in Sagalassos, Turkey, last year. The head has never before been seen in public, even in Turkey, and is being exhibited in London only after what the curator, Thorsten Opper, described as &quot;complex negotiations. &quot;You can probably still smell the soil on it,&quot; he said. The exhibition will also aim to debunk various received ideas about the Spaniard, who ruled the Roman empire when it stretched from the Scottish lowlands to the Persian Gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. Hadrian&apos;s Wall, it will be suggested, was probably far from a tool of peace and stability, as has often been assumed. Instead, Opper likened it to Israel&apos;s &quot;security barrier&quot; on the West Bank. &quot;There is no real evidence that it was to keep the Scots out; more likely an active tool of suppression, dividing the tribes. We have been brought up to imagine it was the bad guys north of the wall and the good guys south - but it was the same people on either side,&quot; he said. Opper said Hadrian&apos;s reign was suffused with parallels to our own times. &quot;He left an immense legacy for us all, even if we are not aware of it. His first act was to withdraw his overstretched army from Iraq - which goes to show Roman history isn&apos;t remote, and isn&apos;t done and dusted.&quot; Hadrian&apos;s immediate predecessor, Trajan, had conquered the Parthian empire, which included modern Iraq. According to Opper: &quot;When Trajan reached Basra, he made speeches about how it was a shame he couldn&apos;t carry on into India like Alexander the Great. But while he was making these statements, there was already an insurgency.&quot;", "tags": ["Design", "Heritage", "Art and design", "Museums", "Museums", "London", "Culture", "UK news", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-02T09:09:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/04/golf", "sentences": ["The 27-year-old from Surrey, whose biggest impact previously this season was to blow a chance to beat Phil Mickelson with a closing double-bogey seven in Shanghai last November, broke the course record at the Kent club with a nine-under-par 63."], "title": "Fisher recharges his batteries and smashes course record", "article": "Ross Fisher, two days after wondering if he was too tired to compete in the European Open, produced the lowest round of his Tour career. The 27-year-old from Surrey, whose biggest impact previously this season was to blow a chance to beat Phil Mickelson with a closing double-bogey seven in Shanghai last November, broke the course record at the Kent club with a nine-under-par 63. &quot;It&apos;s a little bit surreal,&quot; said Fisher, who despite the windy conditions finished with six successive birdies to leave some of the biggest names on the circuit trailing in his wake. He leads by two shots from Graeme McDowell. &quot;It&apos;s probably the best, most solid round of golf I&apos;ve played and on the front nine [he began on the 10th] the hole was as big as a bucket,&quot; he added. Winner of his first Tour title in Holland last August, Fisher came through the 36-hole Open qualifier at Sunningdale on Monday and discussed with his manager how much he had left in the tank for this week. Asked if he considered pulling out, he replied: &quot;I sort of had a thought about it. I was feeling pretty tired but how do you pull out of an event when you live only 40 minutes away? &quot;It&apos;s pretty difficult to sit at home and watch it on TV, knowing that you are playing well. So I thought, &apos;Let&apos;s see how we go.&apos; Have a few days off and, if I feel fine, I&apos;ll play.&quot; He took his wife, Joanne, to Wimbledon for her birthday on Tuesday, left his caddie to walk the Kent course and then attacked it &quot;blind&quot; first thing yesterday morning. While six players were chosen at random for testing on the first day of golf&apos;s new anti-doping era, Fisher kicked off with two birdies, did not have to wait long for two more and, after bogeying the short 17th, covered his inward half in 30. That included sinking a bunker shot on the 187-yard 7th and hitting a massive drive on the dog-leg 448-yard 9th that, to his disbelief, came up a mere 20 yards short of the green. The defending champion, Colin Montgomerie, finished with a 70. Montgomerie was disappointed he could not build on being three under after eight holes - two shots into bunkers cost him bogeys after that - but he still had a better day than the Open champion, Padraig Harrington.

For a start, it has the changes of elevation that often characterise a great track and which its Northamptonshire rival, based on the perimeter road of an old airfield, inevitably lacks. As the fast right-hander at the end of the pits straight leads into a sequence of sweeping downhill bends called the Craner Curves, the spectators are already getting their money&apos;s worth. True, Senna had traction control to help him cope with the grim conditions 15 years ago. But so did all the other drivers, who could only watch in astonished admiration as he blazed through the murk from fifth to first in the course of a single devastating lap while setting off to win the first, and so far the only, grand prix held at the circuit since before the Second World War. According to yesterday&apos;s announcement by Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone, formula one cars will race again at Donington Park when the British grand prix returns there in two years&apos; time. They held races there under that title in 1937 and 1938, won by Bernd Rosemeyer and Tazio Nuvolari, both in Auto-Union cars. Rosemeyer, Nuvolari, Senna: the winner of the 2010 British grand prix would find his name engraved beside those of a trio of all-time greats. If it happens, that is. The volley of announcements yesterday from Mosley&apos;s FIA, Ecclestone&apos;s FOM and from the Donington leaseholders bubbled with optimistic descriptions of how the circuit would be brought up to the required standards. &quot;Finally British formula one fans will get the grand prix venue they deserve,&quot; Mosley proclaimed. &quot;We wanted a world-class centre for formula one in Britain,&quot; Ecclestone said. &quot;The major development plans for Donington will give us exactly that.&quot; &quot;Donington Ventures Leisure Limited has worked closely with the local and national authorities in consideration of the planning requirements,&quot; the leaseholders said. &quot;The details of this and the Donington Park master plan that outlines a five-year investment programme of some \u00a3100m will be provided at a future date. The investment will be led by a private investor who is also a large shareholder.&quot; Ecclestone also showed a design, by his circuit architect Herman Tilke, for the adaptation of Donington Park, involving the addition of a loop section before the pits straight. Tilke, who drew up the new circuits in Shanghai, Sepang, Istanbul and Abu Dhabi, would also be expected to increase the size of the run-off areas. Such work would take time to complete, but not nearly as long as the improvements to the infrastructure which have proved such a bone of contention between Ecclestone and the British Racing Drivers&apos; Club, Silverstone&apos;s owners, over the past 10 years. Having succeeded in persuading the Blair government to speed up work on improvements to the A43, Ecclestone seems to have satisfied himself that something can be done to improve entry to Donington Park, which is close to the M1 but is serviced by the narrow A453, which is also the access road for the East Midlands airport. After the hugely popular MotoGP race held there last month irate spectators found themselves forced to wait for up to three hours in the car parks before making their exit. The thought of thousands of holidaymakers, on their way to catch flights to Ibiza or Majorca, getting caught up in the grand prix traffic suggests the possibility of a new dimension in the phenomenon of road rage. Although Donington may boast perhaps the best museum of old formula one cars in the world, at present its pits are rudimentary and its grandstands and other spectator facilities virtually non-existent. These are precisely the defects for which Ecclestone criticised Silverstone so relentlessly. As Damon Hill, the president of the BRDC, said yesterday: &quot;It seems odd to give the race to a circuit where there&apos;s more work to do than there is here.&quot; Donington&apos;s estimate of \u00a3100m to make the circuit meet the standards of the circuits recently funded elsewhere by national governments appears modest, and the statement&apos;s mention of a &quot;private investor who is also a large shareholder&quot; seems unduly coy. Who can this person be? Perhaps Tom Wheatcroft, the builder who rescued the derelict circuit, which had been used as a military vehicle depot, and successfully reopened it in 1977 before selling the lease to Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd? Or is it a disguise behind which lurks the figure of Ecclestone himself, who would then become the promoter of the British grand prix? A darker possibility is that, 12 months after Silverstone hosts its farewell grand prix next year, the Donington development will not have reached the stage at which a race can be held there. At that point a default clause might allow Ecclestone to pull the plug, giving him the opportunity to remove the British grand prix from an already overcrowded calendar and replace it with a government-subsidised race in one of his new territories, such as Russia or India. Or he could go back to Silverstone and make the BRDC an offer to buy the circuit that it might find difficult to refuse - at a price more advantageous to Ecclestone than the one he would have had to pay if the circuit still had a contract to stage the grand prix. Ecclestone thinks fast in these circumstances but - contrary to his frequent protestations - he and Mosley also think long, as Mosley&apos;s gift to Ecclestone of a 100-year contract for formula one&apos;s commercial rights should demonstrate. Those who doubted the reality of their apparent falling-out over the News of the World headlines had their scepticism rewarded yesterday when one or both of them leaked news of their rapprochement to a newspaper known to be willing to provide support for whatever fa\u00e7ade they care to erect in pursuit of their joint ambitions. The truth is that behind the smoke and mirrors there was never a sliver of daylight dividing them. Now, in addition to humiliating the old guard of the BRDC membership - men such as Sir Jackie Stewart, whom both men have long viewed as an implacable enemy - they have emerged with a scheme that, whichever way it turns out, perfectly suits their purposes. The truth in formula one is about as reliable as the weather on this Northamptonshire plateau. Yesterday the sun shone all day; tomorrow a deluge could sweep the whole thing away, and there are those who think it might be good riddance to a sport that was once a matter of courage and honour but now stands revealed as a playground for men who, fuelled by greed and deceit, take the rest of us for fools as they make themselves rich beyond dreams.", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Bernie Ecclestone"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-04T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/05/china.photography", "sentences": ["Then there are the new rich at play: Xiu Yang, the developer and entrepreneur who is trying to resurrect polo in China; Ying Mingshan, the Chongqing industrialist who is building one of the country&apos;s biggest car companies; and Jason Fong, the director of the wealth management department at UBS Securities in Shanghai."], "title": "China picture special: Faces in a billion", "article": "     Even on an ordinary day, Luo Jinquan is an unlikely poster boy for China&apos;s spectacular economic development. A peasant from Yunnan, one of the country&apos;s poorest provinces, he is a down-to-earth man of the soil, the opposite of the entrepreneurial urbanites often presented as the country&apos;s new model workers. Today Luo is fertilising his fields - a sweaty, smelly job that necessitates him slinging a 20kg basket of sheep manure on his back and wading back and forth across the fast-running river between a dung pile and his plot of land. For Swiss photographers Mathias Braschler and Monika Fischer, it is his earthiness and industry that make the farmer&apos;s story worth recording. By the time they find Luo, he has already ferried across 20 basketloads. He is tired, but patiently poses for a portrait, standing in the middle of Weishan river for nearly 30 minutes with a heavy, malodorous load strapped across his forehead. It proves a striking image, a powerful example of how economic development is touching the lives of poor villagers in even the most remote regions of China. While the photographers set up their lights in the middle of the river, Luo, 27, says that his income has increased tenfold compared with five years ago. It is the same across his village, Douyijin, where families now earn between 3,000 and 6,000 yuan (\u00a3200 and \u00a3400) a year. &quot;Life has changed so much. Things are much better than before,&quot; he says. &quot;We grow different crops, like sweet potatoes, and we can do migrant work in the cities. Incomes are better. Many people are building new homes.&quot; Later in the year, the local government will build a bridge across the river - one of the smallest of tens of thousands of infrastructure projects reshaping China. For Luo, the completion of the bridge will be a historic moment: today&apos;s basketfuls of manure may be the last he has to carry through the river. Braschler and Fischer were commissioned by the Guardian to make an epic journey across China, capturing moments just like this: shots of ordinary life that together illustrate a nation on the move. Over six months, they drove 20,000 miles through all but three of the country&apos;s 34 provinces, making portraits of people from a broad range of Chinese society. They include the super-rich of the eastern megacities, a poor nomad from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, a Long March veteran in Shaanxi, a nuclear guard in Gansu, a prostitute in Shenzhen, and factory workers and peasants everywhere. Along the way they had frequent run-ins with the authorities. Their last project (which featured in Weekend just before the 2006 World Cup) was a set of 30 portraits of the world&apos;s leading footballers, including Beckham, Zidane and Ronaldinho, taken seconds after the final whistle of a match. &quot;This time, we are doing almost the complete opposite of the footballers project. We are taking pictures of people almost nobody knows,&quot; Braschler says. I joined them for five days in Yunnan, China&apos;s southernmost province, famed for its ethnic diversity, rich biology and spectacular mountain scenery. The couple were aiming to take a portrait a day. Luo was the first they photographed on this leg of the trip. Braschler spotted him in the valley as we drove through the rain on a winding mountain road. Where to go next was the subject of a long discussion - should they try to photograph the builders working on Xiaowan dam, a few hours&apos; drive to the south? This is exactly the kind of project Fischer and Braschler want to record, but in the end they decide against it. It would mean a detour of almost a day, and there&apos;s a chance the police might detain them for photographing a sensitive project. This has already happened twice. In Xinmin, Liaoning province, the authorities held them for several hours after they took a portrait of a 16-year-old mechanic - whether because the boy was covered in oil or because he was under age, the police felt the town&apos;s image was threatened. On the second occasion, the two photographers were caught as they took pictures of a railway security guard in Xinjiang province, which is the second most restive area of China after Tibet. We stop for the night instead. Before turning in, Braschler and Fischer show me Polaroids of some of the people they have already shot. In Dalian, two oil terminal workers - Yang Jianguo and Sun Yongyi - could be model workers in a socialist realist painting. Other images are timeless: children training at the acrobat school in Shandong province; infant members of the travelling circus near Hukou falls; the cotton pickers of Hami in Xinjiang; and several farmers and coal miners whose tools and clothes could easily have come from the 19th century. Some remote areas are still untouched by development. In Inner Mongolia, one young nomad woman, Wuluchua, did not know what the Olympics were, nor could she name the president of her country. Most striking are the images of sudden, dramatic change: Wang Wei, the Communist party secretary, stands among the rubble and desolation of the porcelain factory in BoShan that once employed him. The company went bankrupt, like many other state-owned enterprises, during the economic reforms of the past 20 years. Then there are the new rich at play: Xiu Yang, the developer and entrepreneur who is trying to resurrect polo in China; Ying Mingshan, the Chongqing industrialist who is building one of the country&apos;s biggest car companies; and Jason Fong, the director of the wealth management department at UBS Securities in Shanghai. After decades of Maoism, China has wholeheartedly embraced the principle &quot;to be rich is glorious&quot;, laid down by the late Communist party leader Deng Xiaoping. Making money is the national goal, and now that fortunes have been made, there is increasing interest in how to manage them, hence Fong&apos;s success. We are far from such riches in Yunnan. As we drive deeper into the terraced mountains the following day, it is easy to identify the region&apos;s main social problems. They are literally written on the walls. &quot;Preventing drugs is everyone&apos;s responsibility&quot; reads a propaganda slogan, hinting at the influx of cheap narcotics from nearby Burma. &quot;Serious Punishment for Land Seizures&quot; says another that addresses the main cause of social unrest in rural areas (Braschler and Fischer are later to be detained a third time for looking into a property dispute in Anhui). &quot;Aids is not frightening. There are ways to prevent it&quot; reads another - Yunnan has one of the highest HIV rates in China because of drugs and prostitution. The last slogan we spot emphasises family planning: &quot;If you follow the one-child policy, you will be rewarded when you are old&quot;, it promises. We reach Wuliang, a small rural community, on market day. Our driver is nervous when we ask him to stop. &quot;Be extra polite,&quot; he says. &quot;These people are rough. They drink blood and eat raw meat.&quot; The live animals, open-air hairdressers and general hustle and bustle of the mountain market make it a compelling subject, but the crowds drawn by the oddity of foreigners will make it hard to take pictures. &quot;It&apos;s gonna be chaos,&quot; our driver predicts. A pork seller agrees to a portrait. He is a good subject: strong features, colourful stall and friendly manner. All he wants in return for the shoot is for somebody to buy a pig&apos;s head for 50 yuan (\u00a33.60). But setting up a large format camera and lights takes time. As the minutes pass, the crowd grows bigger. Soon the throng is blocking the thoroughfare and a neighbouring stallholder is demanding compensation for lost business. Fifty yuan, he says, is not enough. There are shouts and jostling. The manager of the market is called. Braschler is forced to abandon the shoot. He is bitterly disappointed. But the driver, at least, is pleased to be leaving what he considers a wild community. A couple of hours farther along the road, at Anding district hospital, we meet Dr Zhong Rufang, who has dedicated herself to providing for the medical needs of women in this poor, remote community. Radiating dignity and intelligence, she comes across as an angel of mercy, but she is also a firm believer in government-controlled family planning and conducts two or three forced abortions every year, some as late as seven months. &quot;The one-child policy has made our lives better,&quot; she insists. &quot;In the past, we didn&apos;t even have enough food to go around.&quot; The trend, she says, is towards persuasion rather than coercion. &quot;In the past, some women who refused abortions were brought here in handcuffs,&quot; says Zhong, who has been a doctor for 17 years, &quot;but now it is not like that. These days, some so-called forced abortions are actually women who want abortions but can&apos;t afford it, so they wait until the government compels them.&quot; And contraception methods have improved greatly. I ask if some villagers are able to evade the family planning policy and secretly give birth to second or third children. No, she says: &quot;The government knows every woman&apos;s situation. There is a propaganda official in every village keeping tabs on this.&quot; And if they did flout the rules, they would be fined. She is encouraged that far more women are giving birth in her hospital rather than at home, thanks to the government&apos;s new health insurance scheme and a World Bank programme. It means infant and mother mortality rates are lower - and there is less call for her to walk hours into the mountains to care for mothers suffering complications. Even here in central Yunnan, there are some people who are getting rich. The keys to wealth are proximity to power and good connections. We stop for the night at Jingdong, the administrative centre of the county. It turns out that our hotel doubles as a karaoke nightclub. The car park is packed with Mercedes sedans, Toyota Land Cruisers and other cars that scream money. Inside, we meet a party of Jingdong&apos;s powerbrokers - the judge, the chief prosecutor, the head of the tax bureau, a factory boss and the manager of the local trust bank. We shake hands, smile, drink a toast to each other and take it in turn to sing and dance. By the end of the evening, we are all flushed and crooning Auld Lang Syne. The next day we meet again, and there&apos;s an opportunity for some more sober conversation and a little patriotic boasting. &quot;We&apos;re behind Europe at the moment, but we&apos;ll catch up in 20 years,&quot; the chief prosecutor says. &quot;Our big municipalities are already almost at the same level as yours in the west.&quot; The portly bank manager, Su Dapeng, offers to take us hunting for wildfowl and to pose for a portrait. His parents and grandparents taught him how to catch the birds, but there&apos;s a difference now. &quot;For them, it was an important way to get food, but for me it is just a hobby. It doesn&apos;t really matter if I don&apos;t catch anything.&quot; We head into the mountains in Su&apos;s new Land Cruiser, stop for lunch at a scenic restaurant and then hang around drinking beer and eating fruit as two of his employees attempt to lure the birds with a tape recording of the fowl&apos;s mating call. They return after a couple of hours with the prey in a bag, which the bank manager then holds as a trophy while he poses for a portrait. None of us has moved a muscle or set foot in the forest. We return to the restaurant for another banquet, this time including the bony wildfowl. It turns out that the restaurant is an extra source of income for one of the officials. &quot;I opened it under my sister&apos;s name. I had to do that because I am a government official. We are not supposed to have our own private businesses on the side,&quot; he explains. The restaurant is aimed at senior officials and wealthy locals - you wouldn&apos;t call it outright corruption but, as everywhere in China, people have their fingers in as many pies as possible. The growing gap between rich and poor comes across very strongly in the portraits from Braschler and Fischer&apos;s journey. At one extreme, they have people like Ma Jing - the daughter of a general, who is now building a hotel complex in Penglai, Shandong with her husband, Li Haifeng. At the other, there are illiterate subsistence farmers such as Sun Xuejiang, beggars such as Bao Keshun, who plies his trade with a one-legged monkey, and 81-year-old Huang Sufen, who earns less than 20 pence a day collecting plastic bottles from the side of a motorway. Fischer says the woman cried with gratitude when they gave her a Polaroid, some money and a Swiss bell as a token of thanks. &quot;Sometimes it is hard to believe how brutal this country can be,&quot; Fischer says. &quot;It is one of the last communist countries, but there is probably no other place in the world where people are more capitalistic than in China.&quot; The previous week, they passed close to the rocket base in Sichuan province where China had launched its first lunar probe - part of the country&apos;s ambitious space programme. Less than half an hour&apos;s drive away, they photographed Zhang Weng Xiang, who makes 5,000 yuan (\u00a3350) a year from two water buffalo and a tiny field. Amid such inequality and rapid change, it is not easy for the authorities to maintain stability. The officials in Jingdong told us about protests and petitions in their province sparked by forced relocation programmes for dams and other infrastructure projects. In such cases, the responsibility for restoring order lies with the People&apos;s Armed Police, a million-strong paramilitary unit. Our karaoke friends put us in touch with one of the officers, Zhang Xiqing. He enlisted in the army in his home province of Henan when he was 16, transferred to the police academy and now, with nine years&apos; experience in the riot police, he dreams of one day becoming a general. &quot;We got a new uniform and a salary increase this year,&quot; he says. &quot;Our income has gone up a lot in the past five years. We also have more entertainment. Before, we used to just sit around and watch TV, but now we have table tennis, pool, computer games - and the food has improved a lot, too. Life is getting better for soldiers.&quot; Zhang is reluctant to go into details of the operations he has been involved with, speaking only of the humanitarian work his unit has undertaken, putting up tents for the homeless following a recent earthquake. But a few months after the shoot, the People&apos;s Armed Police gained worldwide notoriety for their handling of the riots in Lhasa and their protection of the Olympic flame during the protests in London and Paris. During their six-month journey, Braschler, Fischer and their Chinese assistant rarely got lost, which is remarkable considering they travelled largely on small roads off the highways, but they encountered plenty of other problems, including three cases of food poisoning, a gastrointestinal infection, a respiratory infection, and a running battle with diarrhoea. They got one speeding penalty (the amount of which was open to negotiation like, it seems, everything in China), bumped the car once and almost got stuck on a ferry on the Yangtze. They crossed a military zone near a nuclear test site in the Taklimakan desert, where they had to bed down secretly in a hotel that was forbidden to foreigners. They drove up to an altitude of 4,500m, where the conditions played havoc with the Polaroids. They crisscrossed the Yellow river 10 times, and suffered from the 38C Beijing summer heat and the early onset of winter on the Qinghai plateau, where the mercury dropped to -6C. Few people get to view such a breadth of China. In Gansu province, they became the guests of honour at a huge wedding after the six months&apos; pregnant bride, Bin Bin, decided that the foreigners would bring luck to the nuptials. Among the most spectacular - and piquant - shots is the portrait of window cleaner Zhou Huajing perched hundreds of metres above the cityscape of Chongqing on land that he used to farm before it was planted with skyscrapers. The opposite perspective is offered by the picture of a coal factory worker enveloped in a cloud of black dust. The contrast between the glory of China&apos;s natural scenery and the damage caused by factory pollution and emissions from the world&apos;s biggest coal industry is very evident in their pictures. &quot;It is a place of absolute extremes,&quot; Fischer says. &quot;The beauty of many parts of the country is breathtaking, while the environmental destruction in other parts is beyond imagination.&quot; On my last day on the road with them, we visit Dianchi lake, which once supplied the drinking water for Kunming city. Not any more. This vast waterway is now one of the three most polluted lakes in China. Effluent, fish farms, river traffic and factory waste have created the perfect breeding ground for bright green toxic algae, which slurps around the refuse dumped into the lake. As central and local government pass the buck and haggle over what should be done, the lake gets filthier. Meanwhile, one man, Zhang Zhengxiang, a former farmer, has dedicated his life to protecting the lake. His love of the waterway and anger at the despoilers is obvious. &quot;I got into this because I am an orphan and I have always seen Dianchi as my mother. I want to give something back to her,&quot; he says. He points to a sign written in large, red characters in the middle of the lake. It reads: &quot;Cleaning up Dianchi is a success of this generation that will be felt by future generations.&quot; He is outraged. &quot;That&apos;s nonsense. This is the most polluted place and still they dare to write such slogans here.&quot; Zhang has taken great risks to collect information on polluters, has sued powerful officials, and has blocked the roads used by illegal loggers. His enemies include factory bosses, quarry owners, fish farmers and timber thieves, and Zhang says he has been slashed with a knife, had his teeth knocked out, his hand broken and his camera and mobile phone stolen. He has been dubbed a troublemaker, his wife has divorced him and he has gone bankrupt filing lawsuits against polluters. But he vows to struggle on until the lake is restored to its former glory. He is another face of changing China. Thirty years ago, Zhang would probably have been thrown in prison or a re-education-through-labour camp. Today, he is a highly regarded nuisance among residents of Kunming. Everyone is moving on. The Olympics this summer will show not just how far the country has come, but how much further it still needs to go. \u00b7 Xiu Yang, entrepreneur Polo with a Chinese flavour is the goal of Xiu Yang, an entrepreneur born in 1966 - the year of the horse in the Chinese zodiac - who has spent more than 20m yuan (\u00a31.5m) of his personal fortune building an elite equestrian club in the hills outside Beijing. Xiu hopes to use the sport to promote a gentleman&apos;s culture and to build business contacts among the well-to-do.  It is four years since he started the club, recruiting Mongolian riders, building a stable and inviting several dozen foreign coaches to advise him; he is now planning to launch a national tournament. &apos;I want to localise the game,&apos; Xiu says, &apos;to get more Chinese people to know about and play it.&apos; Despite polo&apos;s reputation as &apos;the sport of kings&apos;, he believes anyone can play - as long as they have money, determination and a good character. So far he has had mixed success - his club has only 30 members - but he says it has helped him to build up contacts with players overseas and to show the outside world how much China has changed. Two years ago, he invited a team from Australia to his manor house for an exhibition game. It was a bridge for communication, he says. &apos;It was their first trip to China. They were so thrilled by the economic boom that they described it as like flying on a helicopter.&apos; Xiu is reluctant to go into details about his wealth, which comes from an architecture business, property investments and construction site management. But as a child, he says, even though he grew up in an intellectual family of chemical engineers, he could never have imagined he would not only realise a dream of riding horses, but be able to build a manor with an en-suite, walk-in stable. &apos;This polo club of mine is only a small part of my business,&apos; he says, &apos;but it is a very big part of my life. I designed my bedroom and the stable to be under the same roof, so I am actually sleeping with the horses.&apos;  This year, he plans to tour America and Europe with his team. &apos;The secret of my success is learned from horses,&apos; he says. &apos;I have a galloping heart and a strong will. Dreaming is not enough. You have to make the effort to chase your dream.&apos; Wang Wei, Communist party secretary It is with some nostalgia that Wang Wei returns to the ruined kilns of the BoShan porcelain factory, in Shandong province, where he once encouraged his fellow workers to put their trust in the Communist party. It&apos;s six years since the state abandoned the firm, pushing Wang, the deputy party secretary, out of a job. Wang, 59, still curses those leaders who, he believes, betrayed the party&apos;s principles when millions of workers, like him, were laid off. &apos;We were drowning and needed someone to throw us a life-saver. But those who claimed to be helping only tossed us a stick, which was no use at all.&apos;  When Wang joined the company in 1994, the golden era of the state-owned factory was already drawing to a close. The government was no longer willing to subsidise loss-makers in non-strategic industries. Deprived of financial support and political protection, public companies were falling like dominoes. Wang thought the company could turn itself around with reforms and investment. Instead, he quickly found that he had been hired as a scapegoat. His appeals for change fell on deaf ears. &apos;The harsh reality was that government policy was at odds with the factory&apos;s needs. We were lost, with no way out. When the factory hit real difficulties, the higher authorities came to us and organised the workers to sing the Internationale, telling us we must help ourselves. It was pointless.&apos; At first, workers were sent home and told they were merely &apos;off duty&apos;. Salaries were cut again and again. Production fell lower and lower until one day it stopped completely. No one bothered to tell the workers the plant was closing. &apos;It was like a car without a brake; the crash came quickly.&apos; Wang now survives on a pension of 1,000 yuan (\u00a373) a month. It is just enough, he says, if he lives frugally and his family stays healthy. He is resentful of the former government officials who get four times as much, even though they are the same age and, he feels, have not worked as hard. &apos;It is unacceptable. The only reason is that they had a job with the government. Who are the civil servants and who the masters of society? It seems now in China the relationship is reversed.&apos; Ma Jing, leisure industry tycoon The daughter of a People&apos;s Liberation Army general, Ma Jing is now a multimillionaire, running a resort complex she describes as China&apos;s answer to Versailles.  Life was dull when she was growing up, she says, and she did not have high expectations. &apos;The most I hoped for was to join the army and become a doctor.&apos; But in 1983 she fell in love with Li Haifeng, a poor, unemployed man from a rural family, and married him despite fierce opposition from her family. &apos;I was born into privilege,&apos; she says, &apos;and married into poverty. It was unthinkable that a general&apos;s daughter would marry a boy from the country. My friends and relatives thought I must be insane; they said our relationship was immoral.&apos;  Ma resigned from her job as a doctor in a state-owned hospital - again defying her father - and she and her husband went into business. &apos;We borrowed 5,000 yuan (\u00a3366) from friends. First we started a small restaurant. That turned into a mid-sized one, then a big one, then a guest house, then a hotel, and finally a tourist complex.&apos; In the past five years, Ma says her income has risen from 30m to 200m yuan (\u00a32.2m to \u00a314.7m) - easily enough to send her daughter to study in the UK. And her father has at last come round to her way of thinking. &apos;Now he realises private-owned business can also serve the people. It is a win-win situation when you can do that and make money for yourself. He truly feels proud of me.&apos; \u00b7 Additional interviews and research by Chen Shi and Lou Li.", "tags": ["China", "Photography", "World news", "Culture", "Art and design", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-05T12:36:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/06/equities.stockmarkets", "sentences": ["With markets losing nearly 20 per cent of their value from the peak last autumn (emerging markets have done even worse; Shanghai is down 50 per cent), investors might wonder where they can turn for relief."], "title": "Decline and fall of the cult of shares", "article": "In 1981, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, shocked Wall Street when he declared a zero-tolerance policy towards the rampant inflation that had hit 14 per cent, devastated the US economy and led to the dollar plunging on foreign exchanges. The tools Volcker employed became trademarks of the governments of Ronald Reagan and, to a lesser extent, Margaret Thatcher: limiting the growth of money supply and ratcheting up interest rates. Two years later, Volcker could boast that the medicine was working as inflation was cut to little more than 3 per cent, while similar, if more tardy progress, was being made in Britain. But the side effects were severe. American unemployment soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression and social unrest increased, with indebted farmers rioting in Washington. Likewise in Britain, joblessness rose sharply and inner-city discontent culminated in race riots in London, Liverpool and Bristol. Financial markets reacted differently, crashing initially, then climbing as confidence grew that the stagflation of the 1970s was at an end and that companies would be able to leverage their balance sheets, paving the way for the biggest mergers and acquisitions boom since the end of the Second World War. As share prices took off, the cult of the equity was born. A folklore grew up that stock prices would keep rising and that as long as investors kept their nerve through the occasional rout - the crash of 1987 or the recession of 1991 - share investment was a one-way bet. Taking 1980 as the starting line, the next 20 years would show stock prices easily outperforming government bonds, or cash, and inflation-busting returns were the norm: between 7 and 10 per cent a year. It would take the technology crash of 2000-01 and the credit crunch for regulators and financial players to ask whether the cult of the equity had gone too far. In 2003, the answer seemed obvious with UK listed companies reporting pensions deficits that totalled \u00a355bn, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Many of the same pension funds are today nursing a deficit of \u00a312bn. Stock-market historian David Schwartz says : &apos;It is one of the biggest myths that shares offer generous returns provided your time horizon is a long one.If you look at average annual returns from 1900, stocks come in at about 1 per cent; it is only if you re-invest dividend income that the figure rises to 4 or 5 per cent.&apos; Schwartz says 1980-2000 was the exception to the rule and that during the first half of the 20th century, US equities adjusted for inflation showed almost no growth. According to Samuel Brittan, chief economist of the Financial Times, the inflation-adjusted value of the FT Index in 1970 was no higher than in 1936. By the time Thatcher came to power in 1979, it was below the level of the worst Depression years of the 1930s. Wall Street did not reach its 1928 peak until 26 years later. Mark Harris, of New Star Asset Management, says: &apos;Statistics are easily manipulated; the key is when to buy and sell. If you liquidated shares that you held for five years at the end of 1999, you would have done very well. Timing, as always, is everything.&apos; Which brings us to the performance of equity markets in the past decade, but here the picture is bleak. The US Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s index is more or less where it was in 1998, and if inflation is factored in the loss is around 30 per cent. The numbers are even worse in Britain: the FTSE 100 is below where it was a decade ago, while in real terms, the hit is 40 per cent. For those coming up to retirement age, the past 10 years look like the lost decade. You might as well have put your money in a building society account, such is the damage inflicted by the dotcom bust and the credit crisis. Retail investors have voted with their feet. According to the Investment Management Association, more people have cashed in their Isa equities savings plans than taken out new ones in each year since 2004, despite tax breaks. Similarly, IMA data shows that retail investors accounted for \u00a39.5bn in 2007, only marginally ahead of 2001, illustrating that the wider share ownership aspirations of Conservative politicians in the 1980s are a long way from being met. With markets losing nearly 20 per cent of their value from the peak last autumn (emerging markets have done even worse; Shanghai is down 50 per cent), investors might wonder where they can turn for relief.  There are no easy answers, says Harris. Higher inflation, soaring energy costs, troubled credit markets and worries about an inflationary psychology don&apos;t look like going away any time soon. Central bankers, meanwhile, must try to contain inflation without risking even slower growth - unless, of course, they plump for the medicine prescribed by Volcker 27 years ago. Reckless lending by banks, stockmarket volatility and the crisis of confidence engulfing Western capitalism are serious enough, but do not on their own explain the flight from British equities since 2000. The UK pensions industry has undergone a seismic shift as regulators insist that assets more closely match liabilities as the working population gets older and life expectancy longer. That has seen funds invest more heavily in &apos;safer&apos; government and corporate bonds and shun conventional equities.  At the same time, it has spawned an interest in alternative investments such as hedge funds, private equity, commodities, emerging markets and currencies as fund managers seek higher returns from elsewhere, in part to mitigate the more pedestrian upside from a predominantly conservative gilts-orientated portfolio.  At industrial company Invensys, the final salary scheme is closed to new members and its investments, which were predominantly in equities 10 years ago, are now 80 per cent in &apos;fixed government bonds of various durations&apos;, says spokesman Stephen Devany. &apos;It is about more closely aligning our assets with our liabilities.&apos; But what has happened at Invensys mirrors a trend across Britain: the country has seen a diminution of the number of young, working people employed in the industrial heartland. Invensys was once a huge company with more than half its pension scheme members working at factories selling goods at home and abroad. Today, its scheme members number 100,000, but only 1,000 are in work; the rest have retired and are drawing their pensions. The fund must invest conservatively to avoid actuarial censure. There isn&apos;t time for market swings to smooth out in the years before younger members retire. Fifteen years ago, the big occupational pension schemes were the bulwark of the London market, but recently they have become big seller of equities, depressing prices. The trend has been reinforced by insurance companies, which have been forced into maintaining tighter solvency ratios by the Financial Services Authority, making them more risk-averse.  David McCourt, an adviser to the National Association of Pension Funds, says: &apos;What we have been seeing is a broad programme of diversification away from equities and into bonds and alternative investments.&apos; The latest NAPF survey shows 55 per cent of defined benefit scheme assets in equities, against about 85 per cent in 1993. A Bank of New York Mellon report says that in 2007 British equities accounted for only 28.7 per cent of UK pension fund portfolios, &apos;the lowest ever&apos; allocation of this asset class. Alternative assets, such as hedge funds, rose from 0.8 to 1.6 per cent; relatively low, but rising. The decline in importance of shares&apos; investment in relative terms should not obscure the fact that, over long periods, equity returns are superior to those produced by gilts and short-term government bonds (about 4 per cent to the good), as the Barclays Capital graph shows. Neither should we ignore the superior returns on offer from fund managers with a gift for stock picking or strategies.  But the cult of the equity, developed in Britain by George Ross-Goobey when he was employed by the Imperial Tobacco pension fund in 1947, looks to have had its heyday - at least, for now.", "tags": ["Inflation", "US economy", "Investment funds", "Business", "Shares", "Money", "Funabashi", "Investments"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-05T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/06/china.automotive", "sentences": ["When MG Rover went bust three years ago, a Chinese company, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, had already bought the intellectual property rights to the Rover 75, 25 and all the engines, and Nanjing Automobile Corporation bought the MG name, IPR and the factories.", "Handel came here in 1991 for a couple of years and ended up staying, opening the country&apos;s first contemporary art gallery, becoming the chairman of China&apos;s largest law firms and opening Shanghai&apos;s first truly Western emporium, Three on the Bund, an art-restaurant-retail palace."], "title": "Top gear, please, and step on it", "article": "What becomes immediately apparent on entering the 10th annual Beijing car show is the emotional intensity with which China has thrown itself into its greatest consumerist passion to date: the first throes of an almost Jeremy Clarksonesque affair with the car. The entire nation, it turns out, is in love with them, is in thrall to them, is possibly thinking about buying one. Or so it seems, as I attempt to make my way to the Ferrari stand, where I&apos;ve been promised a delivery ceremony is about to be performed, my nose squashed into some man&apos;s armpit, my ribs flattened by the weight of what feels like a billion people pressing in on every side. I&apos;d always known that there were a lot of people in China - I just wasn&apos;t expecting to meet them all on my first day.  Not quite everybody, I discover afterwards, merely 600,000 of them, or the population of Glasgow. All of them looking at cars, being photographed next to cars, picking up brochures of cars, getting into the driving seats of cars and shifting the gears and stroking the upholstery and opening and closing the boot.  I miss the delivery ceremony on account of the armpits, but I discover it&apos;s standard procedure in China, and the next day at Beijing&apos;s Mini dealership they perform one especially for me. It feels a bit like I&apos;m getting married. There&apos;s a whole lot of people wishing me good luck and shaking my hand, a bag full of Mini-related gifts, flowers and, finally, a photograph of me and my loved one - my hand resting on the shapely bonnet of a Mini Cooper - which is later mounted in a Perspex frame and presented with a flourish. You don&apos;t just buy a car in China, it seems. You are emotionally wedded to it. There are 890 different cars on display at the show, made by more than 225 different manufacturers, some of which I&apos;ve heard of - Ford, Mercedes Benz, Toyota - and some of which I haven&apos;t (Great Wall, anyone? Build Your Dreams? Brilliance?) or, allow me to correct myself, hadn&apos;t heard of until then. But there&apos;s also something in the air, the sort of excitement that car manufacturers spend millions of pounds attempting to recreate in order to titillate our jaded Western souls, and that exists here for real. Fifteen years ago, you couldn&apos;t even own a car. The country is now the second biggest car market in the world, and for millions of Chinese window-shopping for their family&apos;s first set of wheels, this is their consumer revolution.  Martin Parr, the photographer, looks like a child in a sweetshop. His latest big project is documenting luxury, and specifically the developing world&apos;s response to it, and the spectacle of the crowds and the cars and the models draped over them in the vast halls of the New China International Exhibition Centre has sent him into overdrive. &apos;Isn&apos;t it fantastic?&apos; he says. It is. It&apos;s just so big. There are hundreds of stands, thousands of people. At the Chery stand, I stop and catch my breath and talk to a rare breed, an English-speaking salesman called Andy Wang. Chery, it turns out, is one of the biggest and most successful car manufacturers in China and its aim now, according to Andy (most English-speaking Chinese take an English name; I&apos;m thrilled, later, to meet a Trevor), is to &apos;push it out all over the world. We must make our guests to believe in our make.&apos; Andy is so enthusiastic that he gives me a full tour in which he points out all the special features and then shows me on a map all the places Chery exports to. It reads like a CIA hitlist: Libya, Belarus, Algeria, Uzbekistan and lots of other places that aren&apos;t the US or Western Europe, with their tediously difficult crash tests and emissions standards. He&apos;s just detailing the benefits of the anti-locking brakes when I ask him if he has a car.  &apos;Yes, of course, I can drive a car! After graduation, I drove in my company. We learn in one week. I find it very easy for me to drive a car.&apos; But do you own a car?  &apos;Ah. I wish! But it&apos;s a lot of money, but one day, yes!&apos;  Andy, it turns out, is the sort of average Chinese consumer who makes Western CEOs drool. His parents worked in a factory until they set up their own business. Nobody in his family has ever owned a car, but it&apos;s what he aspires to and one day soon may be able to afford. According to the chief executive of GM, a salary of \u00a31,500, or the average annual income of households in China&apos;s mid-level cities, is the threshold at which people start to think about buying a car. Estimates vary, but it is believed that around 30 in every 1,000 people in China own a vehicle, which, as the New Yorker has pointed out, is roughly what it was in the US in 1915. The potential for growth is the stuff of an automobile executive&apos;s dreams. And an environmentalist&apos;s worst nightmare. North-east China already has the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution anywhere in the world. Chery, it turns out, is China&apos;s Ford; the Chery QQ, its Model T. It&apos;s a tiny slip of a car, a &apos;micro sub-compact&apos; in the jargon, which was launched in 2003 and costs just \u00a32,000: officially China&apos;s cheapest car. More than that, it was the car that China had been waiting for. The newly burgeoning middle classes embraced it and Chery&apos;s sales leapt by 80 per cent.  Looks-wise, you might just recognise it, as it&apos;s a pretty much identical copy of a Daewoo Matiz as owned by a very unhappy General Motors. The company was furious, having bought the Korean company with the intention of relaunching the Matiz as the Chrysler Spark, but were beaten to the punch by the QQ, and although they filed legal papers they didn&apos;t get very far on account of the fact that Chery is owned by the government. It also seems to have set something of a precedent. I&apos;m not much of a car expert, but even I can spot a Mini, although it turns out to be not a Mini at all but a Lifan 320; a Smart Car which isn&apos;t, it&apos;s a Shuanghuan Noble; and a rather fantastic copy of a Hummer made by the Dongfeng Corporation which looks the part but I&apos;m not sure you&apos;d necessarily want to test it under enemy fire in the Iraqi desert.  And there, in the luxury hall, is a familiar-looking badge belonging to a company called Roewe. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d have recognised it but Martin Parr comes bounding up to find me. &apos;Look! It&apos;s a Rover!&apos;  It is, or at least it&apos;s the bastard Chinese son of Rover risen from the ashes of the Longbridge plant. When MG Rover went bust three years ago, a Chinese company, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, had already bought the intellectual property rights to the Rover 75, 25 and all the engines, and Nanjing Automobile Corporation bought the MG name, IPR and the factories.  On a huge TV screen, I watch a film exemplifying Roewe&apos;s brand values. A Chinese version of Hugh Grant is shown in a number of typical English scenes: smoking a cigar while playing chess, fencing, dancing with a pretty lady in a tiara, and lounging around in cricket whites. And then Liu Tao, Roewe&apos;s brand director, leads me to the back of the stand, where there is a &apos;Roewe Taste Tea House&apos; and young men dressed like James Bond serve English tea in bone china teacups, just like they do in England. Roewe is how the Chinese pronounce Rover, Tao says (the company wanted the Rover name, someone else tells me, but ballsed up at the last minute), and the Roewe 750 is essentially the Rover 75. &apos;Only we make some changes; China&apos;s roads and habits are different. And from a styling point of view... we&apos;ve changed the rear end, because people here like a bigger boot. And we have more modern interior trends. The Rover 75 was a bit...&apos; &apos;Old-fashioned?&apos; &apos;We call it classic.&apos;  So there you have it. A Roewe 750 costs \u00a312,000, has a very smart suede interior and at some point in the near future will probably be available once again in Britain. A woeful Telegraph editorial on the subject is probably already written, but as luck would have it, I ended up riding in a chauffeur-driven Roewe 750, owned by Handel Lee, an American-born-and-educated Chinese lawyer and one of the most dynamic cultural entrepreneurs in the country, and what can I say? It seemed pretty nice. Lee tells me he bought it &apos;for fun... I couldn&apos;t resist it. A Chinese-made Rover. It&apos;s so sad in Britain - it was such a great brand. And we rescued it.&apos;  A few stands down, I chat to Graham Biggs of Rolls-Royce UK, who tells me how he&apos;s been coming to the show for the past five years, in which time it&apos;s changed beyond all recognition.  &apos;The show stands, the money being spent... before it was only low-priced budget cars whereas now there are all these people carriers and sports cars. They&apos;re so ambitious and so good. Make no mistake, the Chinese are coming and they are very, very smart. The motor world as we know it is changing.&apos;  Although, equally, he could have left &apos;motor&apos; out of the sentence. Because cars - and the Chinese appetite both for buying them and for making them - is simply a metaphor for the new power relations between East and West. Our environmental concerns - read rank hypocrisy - at the idea of the Chinese owning as many cars as we do, and our dismay that they can produce them better than we ever could - read consumerist glee at how cheap they&apos;ll be - is part of a global shift we&apos;re powerless to resist. China makes nearly everything else that we buy and consume; of course they can make a Rover better than we can. And of course we are all going to be driving Chinese cars in about five minutes&apos; time. Who are we kidding? In the far, far south of the city, on a piece of ground the size of several football pitches, I find 500 white Volkswagen Santanas belonging to the Beijing Oriental Fashion Automobile Drive School. It&apos;s a truly bizarre sight as every single one of them appears to be either turning into a parking space or reversing out of a parking space. Over and over again. In each car are four students and watching are the instructors, one of whom, Zhang Jin, explains the score. First up is two whole weeks of driving theory. (Sample question: &apos;Drivers should a) deliberately underestimate each other, b) compete for road supremacy or c) learn and help each other, adopt one&apos;s strong point while overcoming one&apos;s weak point and keep safely driving.&apos; I&apos;m assuming the answer is c) but, on the other hand, how would this even work?) Then comes basic driving which involves 26 hours of sitting in a classroom. And then they move to the parking lot for six hours a day for five days to learn manoeuvres. And then, finally, they go out on a road, for a grand total of six hours.  Which possibly goes some way toward explaining the statistics. China has just 2 per cent of the world&apos;s cars, yet 21 per cent of its fatal traffic accidents. Every single day, 1,200 new cars take to the streets of Beijing, the vast majority of them driven by complete novices. In Britain, the equivalent would involve our entire motorway system being used only by 17-year-old boys. Three of the people in Zhang Jin&apos;s group are in their twenties, but one, Lin Zengyi, is 51. &apos;Did you ever imagine when you were a child that you could one day own a car?&apos; I ask him and the class practically falls over laughing. &apos;When I was young, I couldn&apos;t afford a bicycle! I couldn&apos;t even afford to buy enough to eat. I earned 16 RMB [\u00a31] a month. A car? What? Are you mad?&apos;  It is nothing short of amazing to witness the journey that China has made in less than half a lifetime. And it&apos;s even more amazing when you come across it in a single person. There&apos;s an ad in one of Beijing&apos;s English-language magazines placed by a Chinese lady driver who offers trips around town and I arrange to go for a spin in her car, although it&apos;s not so much a spin, more a saunter. Her name is Cathy and we tour the hutongs, or alleys, of Beijing&apos;s Sanlitun bar district and the speedometer barely troubles the 20kmh mark. When we meet an obstruction and have to reverse down a narrow road, it takes so very, very long that it feels like time itself has actually stopped.  Handel Lee, he of the chauffeur-driven Roewe, had told me about such driverly habits. &apos;Have you noticed?&apos; he says. &apos;People drive very slowly. They have a better sense of things around them. They&apos;re surrounded by 1.4 billion people so they&apos;re used to being cramped, they are always smack up against each other. You don&apos;t get this aggression you get in the West. Coming from the States, I can just zip my way through.&apos; And as in driving, as in life. Handel came here in 1991 for a couple of years and ended up staying, opening the country&apos;s first contemporary art gallery, becoming the chairman of China&apos;s largest law firms and opening Shanghai&apos;s first truly Western emporium, Three on the Bund, an art-restaurant-retail palace. All by just zipping his way through. But back to Cathy. We&apos;re in her brother&apos;s Nissan and she tells me her story. How she grew up in Shandong province where her parents were farmers, and moved to Beijing after her brother did. I don&apos;t really get to the bottom of how her parents managed to have two children, but more than that, I find it hard to believe that Cathy, the model of urban sophistication, her hair fashionably cut, driving herself - slowly - around the streets of Beijing was, until recently, one of the great forgotten rural masses. She lists for me everything she didn&apos;t have growing up. &apos;No TV, no radio, no washing machine, no fridge, no water from the tap. There wasn&apos;t even a road, just a dirt track. If you wanted to go shopping, you cycled 18km to the shop and 18km back.&apos; Her mother, who moved with her, can&apos;t read. And until they both arrived in Beijing eight years previously, &apos;I&apos;d never had ice cream or been in a elevator. Never eaten Western food.&apos; She is the new Chinese revolution personified. From rural to urban, from the peasantry to the middle class, from a bicycle to a car. She&apos;s amazing, really, but then everything in China is at least mildly amazing, if not totally amazing. From the new Norman Foster airport to the 40,000km of expressways built in the past decade - as smooth as silk and trimmed with privet hedges and begonias - to the exhibition centre in which the car show is being held, which, apparently, was built in roughly two-and-a-half seconds. &apos;I was there two weeks ago,&apos; Julian Hardy, the MD of Aston Martin China, tells me, &apos;and it was total chaos. It still looked half-built. They were out there tarmacing the last bit of the car park the night before the show opened.&apos;  That&apos;s the way it works in China. Until the 1990s, you couldn&apos;t book a train ticket or a hotel without special dispensation. The myth of the open road isn&apos;t a myth here; owning a car is a direct expression of the new freedoms that the country enjoys. Those ads showing a man in charge of his destiny swooping along an empty mountain road? He&apos;s the Republic of China. Or he would be if anybody went any further than the supermarket in their new runarounds. Which they don&apos;t. Or at least not yet. Kenneth Zhao, a sales executive for Great Wall Motors, shows me a rather fantastic-looking camper van but admits: &apos;Frankly speaking, we don&apos;t have much of a market for it. This is an overseas idea. The percentage of people who enjoy the life is much less.&apos; The road tolls are too high (they&apos;re roughly the same as Germany&apos;s), the infrastructure too poor. If people drive long distances, it tends to be en masse with their car club. There are hundreds of these in Beijing, and on a rainy Sunday I join Zhao Xiangjie, president of the Target Auto Club, on a jaunt out of town to see how this works. Basically, we form a convoy of SUVs, decorated with flags, tailgating each other down the middle lane of the highway and communicating via a combination of CB radio and mobile phone or, as in Zhao&apos;s case, both simultaneously.  We head a few miles out of town to a hot spring resort, and what with the incessant crackle of the CB radio and the people overtaking on both sides, the bicycles that appear in your path out of nowhere, the way that cars will brake suddenly, on a whim, with no seeming idea of the concept of being rear-ended, and the terrifying appearance of a worker in an orange jacket stepping into the fast lane to sweep the carriageway by hand, it&apos;s probably enough for me. Zhao, though, regularly organises trips to places like Lhasa (he&apos;s been 15 times and it takes 18 days), Stockholm (35 days) and Cairo (50 days).  Doesn&apos;t anybody have a job? I ask. &apos;Most people own their own companies so they manage their time. They are middle-class or upper-class and they enjoy driving. It&apos;s also a social circle. On the package tours, there are different classes; they find they don&apos;t like the fact that it&apos;s so mixed. Here, they are with other people who are the same.&apos; And that is the crux of it. At the second-hand car market in Beijing, I meet Nin Yujun, 32, out car shopping with his wife Zhang Zhimin, 33, and their child Nin Kun. They need a car for their business, he says. Because it&apos;s convenient. And because all their neighbours have one. And? He hesitates. &apos;There is psychological pressure to own a car,&apos; he admits.  To own a car in China is already to be rich beyond the dream of most people. But as any good Western consumer knows, this is not enough. What kind of car you own speaks volumes in any country, let alone in one whose business dealings revolve around the concept of &apos;face&apos; - keeping it, losing it.  And it&apos;s here that the likes of General Motors and Porsche hope to make a killing. In 2006, GM had its worst ever year in the US; in China, on the other hand, sales were up 80 per cent. China is the largest market for BMW in the world, even though the cars are nearly twice as expensive as in Europe thanks to 83.2 per cent tax. Bill Cheng, the managing director of Bentley China, tells me that growth last year was 94 per cent and almost looks disappointed. &apos;The year before it was 100 per cent,&apos; he says.  Growth is phenomenal, but it may become more phenomenal still. A million more cars are likely to be added to the roads this year, but to catch up with ownership levels in the US would involve the addition of 750 million cars. Environmental Armageddon, although maybe it&apos;s here that the cleaner, greener car will finally be cracked. Already, though, the car is changing everything else - from the supermarkets where people now shop to the dormitory towns where they now live.  When Cathy returned to her village in Shandong province last year, it was the first time that the villagers had ever seen a woman drive a car. &apos;Nothing has changed there, nothing. Me? I am totally different. I was so fat when I came to the city! And dark from working in the fields.&apos; She&apos;s remarkable in so many ways, Cathy. The future of China made flesh. And lovely and friendly and hospitable with it. The next time I come to Beijing, she says, we should take a road trip back to her village. At the end of the evening I watch her gingerly manoeuvre her way out into the stream of Beijing traffic. And she&apos;s doing c) I think: learning to help each other and adopt one&apos;s strong points while overcoming one&apos;s weak points and keep safely driving. Four wheels good: the rise of the car Eight million vehicles, including light trucks and minivans, were bought in China last year.  This represented a 25 per cent rise on the previous year and saw the country overtake Japan to become the second largest car market in the world. Four-fifths of all new cars sold in China are bought by people who have never had a car before. China has just 3 per cent of the world&apos;s cars, yet 21 per cent of its fatal traffic accidents.  More people aspire to own a car but do not currently own one in China than in any other country. 1,200 new cars take to the streets of Beijing every day.  According to a BBC report, only six in every 100 Chinese people own cars, compared with 80 per cent in the UK. Authorities say they have invested \u00a38.6bn to tackle Beijing&apos;s smog, which largely results from traffic congestion. In 2005 China had a total road network of more than 3.3m kilometres, although approximately 1.47m km of this network were classified as &apos;village roads&apos; and did not have proper surfaces.  Major cities are expected to be linked by a 55,000km interprovince expressway system by 2020.

The stiff moral codes devised by Confucius, adapted by the communists and imposed by parents nationwide seem to be disappearing fast. Until the early 1980s, most Chinese were still squeezed into sexless Mao jackets and a good night out meant a revolutionary sing-song at a mass meeting. But China&apos;s newly opened doors have let in new role models and tempted its youth into drinking, smoking and pre-marital sex. &apos;People often describe us post-Eighties generation as selfish. Maybe &quot;self-centred&quot; is a better word. We are certainly more self-aware, which isn&apos;t a bad thing,&apos; Chun says, flicking a long cigarette. Her generation, almost all only-children, have been spared the material hardship and political perils of their parents&apos;, but other growing pains have taken their place. Chun grew up in Beijing in her father&apos;s military compound, dropped out of school at 17, developed a passion for rock&apos;n&apos;roll and had a string of boyfriends, a journey she chronicles in her coming-of-age novel, Beijing Doll Beijing Doll is one of a wave of autobiographical novels by the so-called &apos;beauty writers&apos; - young women who describe in detail their sex-drenched, drug-laced private lives. Notable rivals include Wei Hui, author of Shanghai Baby, and Mian Mian, who wrote Candy. Though it was quickly banned by the government, Beijing Doll struck a chord with Chinee teenage girls and has sold an estimated 1 million copies on the black market. It has now been published in English in the States. When asked if she feels lucky, Chun replies: &apos;Not particularly. I think Beijing Doll is an excellent book that deserves the success.&apos; Although insisting that she is different, she admits the book reflects many characteristics of the &apos;me-generation&apos; youth: their materialism, their lack of ideology and their shameless pursuit of love and pleasure. When &apos;bourgeois liberalism&apos; encouraged students to demand democracy, the government cracked down. But private lives have since become private for the first time under communist rule. Young people enjoy ever-more daring choices of clothing and lifestyle, from skimpy tops to punk. &apos;Some accuse us of not caring enough about politics,&apos; says Chun. &apos;Why should we care? In my view, our lack of interest in politics makes us more humane, don&apos;t you think?&apos;Lijia Zhang Qin Liwen, Head of Sohu News, 32 Internet use is growing faster in China than anywhere else inthe world. Qin Liwen heads China&apos;s trendsetting news website, Sohu. Qin discovered how powerful and rich the virtual world was when she attended a conference on internet media in Germany two years ago. On her return, she created an English-language website for the weekly newspaper the Economic Observer, Beijing&apos;s answer to the Financial Times, and received comments and proposals for co-operation from around the world. She was trying to finish a novel when she was offered the job as head of Sohu News. &apos;I snatched it up as I felt it was a position where I could make an impact.&apos; One year on, she has not regretted it for a moment although she suffers severe sleep deprivation, she says. In China, internet media can only republish articles that have already appeared in traditional media. &apos;But there&apos;s plenty of space for creativity,&apos; she says. &apos;My job is to select interesting news items and then repackage them - the way people read online is different from reading a newspaper; I make sure to give the top headlines to news items that concern people, like pricing and social welfare, and never allow tabloid news to dominate.&apos; The biggest frustration in her job is strict state censorship, of course, but Qin is often able to find ways around it. When the Olympics torch relay in San Francisco was disturbed by Tibetan protesters, the traditional media seemed at a loss as to how to cover it. Despite being an Olympics media partner, Sohu correspondents reported the fracas by focusing on the positive story of overseas Chinese protecting the event. Now Sohu.com is catching up with Sina, China&apos;s first news portal. &apos;I find it immensely satisfying to communicate every day with tens of millions of users,&apos; she says. (The precise figure is a state secret.) Qin has lived abroad but she finds life most fascinating in China. &apos;China lacks freedom, democracy and a regulated market - things are changing and evolving all the time and there&apos;s plenty of chaos. Somehow within that chaos, there&apos;s vitality, and that&apos;s exciting for me.&apos; Lijia Zhang Ning Ying, Film director, 48 Ning Ying, Beijing born and bred, is one of a large number of Chinese who have travelled to the West to learn their trade and then returned to apply their skills to documenting China&apos;s chaotic society. &apos;In the Eighties I went to Italy to study film-making. I learnt a lot, met my husband and greatly enjoyed the experience.&apos; But when she returned, six years later - to work as assistant director on Bernardo Bertolucci&apos;s The Last Emperor - Ning fell in love with the city all over again. &apos;On my way home from the airport, I felt such a strong connection to the city. I settled back the following year. If I have to compare Beijing with one city in the world, then it has to be New York: both places burst with energy and creativity. As an artist, it is very exciting to be in China right now as the country is going through drastic transformations.&apos; Ning has directed three films in a Beijing Trilogy about these transformations. For Fun is a comedy about an old man forced to retire who organises an amateur Beijing Opera troupe in his neighbourhood. &apos;Beijing Opera records the sound of old Beijing and the traditional way of life, which is fast disappearing.&apos; In On the Beat and I Love Beijing, Ying explores the impact of the speedy changes on the local people and their difficulties in dealing with the changes. &apos;Like any fast-changing society, there&apos;s inevitable tension and dramas here,&apos; she says. &apos;People&apos;s memories are associated with concrete objects, with bricks, for instance. When a wall in your street disappears, you&apos;ll naturally feel anxious and confused. I remember a few years ago when I arrived back at Beijing airport, I realised that the old airport had vanished, taking away the smell of garlic, which I always associated with old Beijing. I felt slightly lost. In Italy when I missed home, I could always smell garlic.&apos; Lijia Zhang Jian Jun Xi, performance artist, 46 In November 1999, Two Naked Artists Jump Into Tracey&apos;s Bed made the two Chinese artists - who, in fact, kept their trousers on when they foiled security guards and invaded Tracey Emin&apos;s work in Tate Britain - famous and led many to associate the Chinese with performance art for the first time. &apos;I actually established a performing art group called Concept 21 back in 1986,&apos; says one of the pair, Jian Jun Xi, at his studio in Beijing, which he now calls home. &apos;Performance art, until recently an alien concept here, is a good medium to provoke, a good way to express our desire for freedom.&apos; Concept 21&apos;s first show saw four art students, bandaged in white gauze, pour ink over each other at Beijing University. It was so provocative that it led other students to protest against corruption later that day. It was a time when China was gingerly unbuttoning Mao&apos;s straitjacket and an avant-garde scene had yet to emerge. Before long, Jian Jun migrated to the UK where he met his artistic partner, Chai Yuan. Together they staged some memorable performances such as Running Naked Across Westminster Bridge with Tony Bear (starkers this time); Two Artists Swim Across the Thames, a reinterpretation of Mao&apos;s swimming in the Yangtze; and Soya Source and Tomato Catch-up Fight, commenting on the conflicts between Eastern and Western cultures. Penis Spirit was perhaps their most shocking work. They pickled a human penis in spirit then drank it with friends in Beijing. &apos;It&apos;s not everyone&apos;s cup of tea. But what we&apos;d like to do is to push the boundaries,&apos; Jian Jun explains in fluent English. Lured by a burgeoning and innovative cultural scene and a more mature and accepting audience, the duo - who although heterosexual are now often referred to as &apos;China&apos;s Gilbert and George&apos; - decided to settle back in China. &apos;We feel that we&apos;ve learnt a great deal from the West. It is time to return and continue our journey.&apos; Lijia Zhang Carmen Zou, fashion designer, 42 Mao&apos;s wife, Jiang Qing, famously said that the pleasure of sex was short-lived while the pleasure of power lasted a lot longer. Top Beijing designer - fans include China&apos;s first rock&apos;n&apos;roll star, Cui Jan, and film star Huang Shengyi - Carmen Zou chose sex and power as her twin themes in her ground-breaking collection. &apos;I always find there&apos;s something sexy about a woman in military uniform,&apos; she says. Nixon would have agreed. During his historic visit to China in 1972, he found the uniformed dancers performing in the ballet The Red Detachment of Women very sexy. Zou explains that, unlike in the West where being sexy means a dress that shows your cleavage, the Chinese way is to reveal a little to inspire your imagination. &apos;Like this one,&apos; says Carmen Zou, pointing to a high-collared silk cheongsam with daring splits from ankle to thigh. The dress is printed with images of those girls from the red ballet. The ballerinas in the 1970s could not wear a cheongsam because they were banned as a symbol of capitalism. Now, with capitalism and the fashion world blossoming, artists are busy reinterpreting Mao and the communist past. Zou is reforming the Mao suit, a buttoned-up tunic with four pockets, which for many years served as China&apos;s national uniform. On one sleek dress, Mao&apos;s famous words &apos;We daughters of China prefer military uniform to fancy dress&apos; crawl across the semi-transparent fabric. &apos;It is fun to borrow from our rich history to make the design more interesting,&apos; says Zou. Her keynote colours are China red, army green and worker-ant blue. Her bespoke outfits are expensive: up to \u00a31,000 for a stylish velvet coat: &apos;As China becomes richer and more individualistic, I am sure my business will prosper.&apos; Lijia Zhang Miao Wong, queen of nightlife, 24 Miao Wong is queen of the underground techno scene in the capital city. She manages Acupuncture Records, a crew of eight local DJs - &apos;not resident DJs but party DJs,&apos; she says - and organises funky parties. &apos;They are all outstanding DJs. They don&apos;t just do shitty remixes,&apos; she says, swigging from a bottle of beer at a bar, &apos;they make their own music.&apos; Miao started as a DJ-groupie after going to Beijing to study but soon fell into the dark corner of underground parties. &apos;Something in the electronic music just knocked me off my feet. My idea of having a good time is dancing my ass off all night, to a good beat.&apos; It took her a long time to get a decent range of techno DJs together. Music, especially her techno-head type, is not central to Beijing&apos;s nightlife as people tend to go to discos more to see and be seen than to dance, often sitting in private rooms with their friends or preferring to karaoke with sing-song girls. However, Miao has enjoyed a lot of success, winning over growing numbers of electro-hippies, since the establishment of Acupuncture Records a year ago. There are plenty of upwardly mobile youngsters willing to share her vision. &apos;The key is to come up with original venues and groovy themes.&apos; Her finest - perhaps wildest is a better word - was last year&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve party, Spooked, in a 4,000 sq m warehouse with 2,000 people, a mixture of Chinese and expats, dancing the night away in sweat, sound and strong rhythm. &apos;What I want to do is to promote local DJs, to educate the community and establish a local techno culture that is here to stay,&apos; she says. &apos;But first of all, we want to have fun.&apos; Lijia Zhang  Sa Dingding, singer, 25 It&apos;s not every day that you hear the Chemical Brothers, Nine Inch Nails and Mongolian folk music referenced in the same sentence, but it comes naturally to singer/musician Sa Dingding. Sa released her first album in 1998 at the age of 18 and was subsequently voted the Best Dance Music Singer in China. She has sold 2 million albums in south-east Asia alone. While the younger generation love her electronica and dance material, older people respond to her indigenous traditional music, played on the zheng (the 25-stringed Chinese zither) and the morin khuur (the Mongolian horsehead or horsehair fiddle). Her musical nourishment began when as a toddler she travelled the Mongolian steppes with her grandmother. &apos;I was in the grasslands from the ages of three to six where they have all kinds of music from throat-singing to horsehair fiddle.&apos; As a teenager she attended Bejing University and studied music where she found that traditional teaching sometimes clashed with her own musical direction. &apos;Everyone in music school has to learn classical music techniques and philosophy but I have a free spirit and a great imagination so there was some collision between traditional teaching and my own thinking. The greatest thing is that I have not lost my imagination.&apos; Neil Norman", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "China arts 2008", "Olympics 2008", "Fashion", "Music", "Film", "China", "Art and design", "World news", "Media", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-05T23:10:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/06/architecture.china1", "sentences": ["Shanghai&apos;s World Financial Centre is half as high again and the Burj al Arab tower in Dubai, now reaching completion, will be more than 2,000ft, but Beijing knows how to impress with more than sheer size."], "title": "Director of the Design Museum, Deyan Sudjic, judges the buildings of the new Beijing", "article": "Very few architects say in public that they will not build in Beijing. The only notable dissident is Daniel Libeskind of Ground Zero fame, who has questioned the seemliness of building for an authoritarian and undemocratic regime, under which construction workers endure the most primitive of conditions, with minimal safety provisions and poor wages. A few more, having experienced the minimal fees offered by most Chinese developers, have quietly refused to work there. But that has not stopped an unprecedented architectural stampede, led by Rem Koolhaas, Norman Foster, and Jacques Herzog. Despite everything, there is a sense that building here is one of those rare chances architects get to make history, so how can they say no? This is a capital that has rebuilt itself faster than any other in the history of the world. In two decades it has moved from the middle ages, with an overlay of bicycles and Stalinism, to a shimmering surreal vision, two parts Las Vegas, two parts Dubai, and five parts the most brutally unequal capitalist society on earth. Everybody with any pretensions to an architectural profile has looked at working there, from David Adjaye and Will Alsop at the more radical end of the spectrum, to the large scale plan factories exporting off-the-shelf designs for ready-made cities. Whether they wanted to or not, they have created exactly what their Chinese clients were looking for: a new city that looks like the capital of an emergent superpower, in which the factories of the communist era have been swept aside, making way for showy vulgarity, the bizarre, the wilful, the inept, and the occasional masterpiece. Despite the promises to shut every construction site and dismantle every crane in time to let the dust settle for the Olympics, Beijing still looks like a vast building site. Looming over the Olympic stadium is a highrise tower that more or less behaves itself for its first 20 floors and then suddenly erupts into a gigantic Elvis quiff, rearing up another 15 floors and taking a terrifying cantilevered leap into space. Not far from Tiananmen Square, still presided over by Mao&apos;s effigy, you can find an army of labourers putting the finishing touches to what taxi drivers proudly declare is the city&apos;s first six-star hotel. It&apos;s designed in a florid late 19th-century Belle Epoque style, rising like a huge meringue over the surviving fragments of the hutongs, the traditional courtyard houses that once characterised the entire city which have been demolished to make way for the next highrise. The first piece of genuinely western grade modern architecture in Beijing, Denton Corker Marshall&apos;s Australian embassy, was built remarkably slowly by a construction brigade of the People&apos;s Liberation Army. It was finished in 1992. Since then, an entire new city has been built around it. Context is not something Beijing has done well since the days when the north-south axis that runs through the city was violated by Mao&apos;s creation of Tiananmen Square. This was adorned by the erection of a monument to the heroes of the People&apos;s War, an act that was followed by the still more damaging placing in the exact centre of the square, blocking the axis, of Mao&apos;s mausoleum in what, were it not for the revolutionary statuary, would look like the library for a moderately ambitious Midwestern campus. While the Olympic venues are already complete, the city centre is not. The museum on the west side of Tiananmen, facing the Great Hall of the People, is still a shell. Behind the walls of the old legation district, a huge new shopping district is under construction. Its mainly elderly, or migrant, inhabitants have been cleared out to make way for what is aimed at becoming the city&apos;s answer to Covent Garden in London. All that is finished in this part of the city is the Grand National Theatre, designed by Paul Andreu, the architect responsible for Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. It is a monstrous gesture, a metal egg with the tedious inevitability of symmetry. To make matters worse, it is sunk into the middle of a circular lake - not so much a boiled, as a fried, egg. It&apos;s a moat that does nothing to relieve the barren monotony of Tiananmen Square. Equally troubling is American architect Steve Holl&apos;s project by the second ring road. Holl has designed an apartment complex: a cluster of a dozen towers, linked by two-storey walkways 20 storeys up. Beijing&apos;s architectural evolution has gone from Stalin, who summoned Chinese architects to Moscow for fraternal lessons in authoritarian Art Deco classicism, to post-modernism, by way of a brief episode in revivalism that saw offices blocks topped by giant tiled roofs and lacquered dragons. Now it is a place where anything can happen. \u00b7  Deyan Sudjic is director of the Design Museum in London The Olympic Stadium  Herzog &amp; de Meuron&apos;s awe inspiring 91,000-seat stadium, known, because of its latticed surface, as the Bird&apos;s Nest, is the defining landmark, not just of the Olympics, but of the new China, the emergent superpower that is using the games to mark its breakneck transformation from Marxist-Leninist backwater to glittering metropolis. Its steel structure is of a complexity that tested Chinese technology and manufacturing to its limits. As a monument it has a richness and depth that take it far beyond the simplistic cult of the icon. Herzog &amp; de Meuron have done nothing less than reinvent the athletic stadium. Instead of an isolated object, cut off from the city around it, the bird&apos;s nest is designed to create public spaces that come to life even when the stadium is not in use. As the most conspicuous of Beijing&apos;s new landmarks, it has also been sharply criticised by Chinese architects who have been angered by their exclusion from the most high-profile projects. Aquatic Centre The Olympic pool is sheathed in a huge plastic skin, patterned on the structure like a soap bubble. Designed by the Australian architects PTW, it looks best at night, glowing translucent blue, a quieter counterpart to the structural flamboyance of the stadium on the other side of the Olympic green. It&apos;s designed as a deliberately understated counterpoint to the stadium that adjoins it and which is given pride of place in the crush of much less interesting buildings that press in from all around. The Grand National Theatre  Within sight of the courtyards of the Forbidden City, and on the edge of Tiananmen Square, the Grand National Theatre is impossible to ignore and perhaps the most questionable of the city&apos;s new structures. Designed by Paul Andreu, the architect for Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris, it has a ruthless symmetry. Its titanium and glass shell is sunk into the middle of a circular lake that acts a moat, the most anti-urban gesture imaginable. Its three halls are reached by tunnel, ducking under the water, to take visitors into the most lavishly finished interiors in Beijing. China Central Television/ Mandarin Hotel The CCTV towers will not be ready for the Olympics. Nor, despite earlier claims to the contrary, will the Mandarin hotel adjoining it. Yet the complex is already one of the city&apos;s most conspicuous new structures. Both are designed by the same team, Rem Koolhaas&apos;s Office for Metropolitan Architecture. They have produced the most aggressive, and determinedly transgressive, landmark for Beijing. The earthquake-defying form - and huge structural overhangs which leave tens of thousands of square feet of office space supported, apparently, by nothing - look bizarre even in a city in which anything is possible. The hotel and offices can be read as a single, extraordinarily violent architectural composition, a wildly thrashing monster, its tail flapping up and down, trailing behind two giant elephant&apos;s legs. It has taken architects in China 20 years to get the hang of building sophisticated polished skins. With the CCTV headquarters, Koolhaas has decided that the mark of true sophistication for China is to look rough. To deal with all those extreme cantilevers in an earthquake zone takes a great deal of structural skill, here provided by Arup engineers. It also needs a fair bit of steel, which is applied, apparently at random in strange clusters, some stopping mid-flight, others going off at odd angles, creating the impression of a darned sock, or structural Band-Aid, applied retrospectively to patch up the cracks. China World Trade Center 3 Beijing&apos;s tallest tower, the China World Trade Center 3, is the third instalment in a development that has become the heart of the city&apos;s business district, a thicket of towers that sprouted almost by accident between the first crop of international hotels and the diplomatic enclave. As contemporary high-rises go, at only 1,083ft , it is relatively modest. Shanghai&apos;s World Financial Centre is half as high again and the Burj al Arab tower in Dubai, now reaching completion, will be more than 2,000ft, but Beijing knows how to impress with more than sheer size. Designed by the American firm, Skidmore Owings and Merrill, it&apos;s a skyscraper that stands out for its quiet reticence. The tower, with its gently tapered form and carefully pleated metal and glass skin, is an elegantly cut Brooks Brothers suit, with curious echoes in its gothic base of Minoru Yamasaki&apos;s Twin Towers destroyed in the 11 September attacks in New York. When it&apos;s finally completed next year, the first 50 floors will be earmarked for office use, with 22 hotel floors on top. Jianwai Soho When I first saw this project in 2003, you could still find slogans from the Red Guard days on the walls of the few remaining factory compounds that were once China&apos;s pride and joy, in the process of being flattened to make way for a new capitalist city. Working for Soho China, run by Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin, the most innovative developers in Beijing, the Japanese architect Riken Yamamoto has created a huge complex of flats, shops and cafes. There are 20 towers, containing 7 million sq ft of space, ranged in a careful grid. Bejing Airport Bejing&apos;s new terminal is essentially a new airport. Cross the threshold and you are dazzled by what feels like a landscape rather than an interior. A sparse collection of giant columns, white inside the glass walls, red outside, hold up its delicate, refined roof. Norman Foster has more experience than most of designing airports. Stansted, Hong Kong&apos;s Chek Lap Kok and now Beijing have each moved a step further in perfecting lightweight structures. Beijing&apos;s sweeping roof, elegant as a sand dune, has been peeled open here and there to allow in flashes of daylight while the glass walls show the ranks of jumbos outside.", "tags": ["Architecture", "China", "Art and design", "Culture", "Asia Pacific", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-05T23:10:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/06/healthandwellbeing.relaxation15", "sentences": ["I remember watching an elderly couple at it from my hotel window in Shanghai - the man caught in the attitude of dancing with an invisible bear, the woman leaning forward with a hand outstretched as though attempting to halt a runaway train the hard way."], "title": "Phil Hogan: 'Why, it's meditation for the body!'", "article": "For many of us, relaxing has moved on in recent years from the traditional Roman model (lying around on chaise longues all afternoon, being fed larks&apos; tongues on toast by slaves), more towards the mind-body-spirit aesthetic of the ancient east. Take tai chi, for example. Are you not quite as chilled a person as you&apos;d like to be? Would you like to be more tolerant of people that you currently tear your own head off to avoid speaking to? Do you have bad dreams? Tai chi is good for all these things, and very popular. Just look at China, with entire communities up at dawn and flocking to city parks and squares for an hour or so of slow movement in the early smog. I remember watching an elderly couple at it from my hotel window in Shanghai - the man caught in the attitude of dancing with an invisible bear, the woman leaning forward with a hand outstretched as though attempting to halt a runaway train the hard way. In tai chi, there&apos;s an unnatural-looking position for every occasion, each devoted to the cultivation of internal energy or chi (sometimes spelt qi for the benefit of Scrabble enthusiasts). I attended a tai chi class in the Caribbean once, attracted by its promise as a curative for bad posture, gastric disorders, muscular toning and road rage - plus, of course, there&apos;s no heavy lifting. I wasn&apos;t quite a natural. I began to wonder if it helped if you were a relaxed sort of person to start with. And it wasn&apos;t as easy as it looked. There was one bit where I had to stand, unaided, on one leg, while the rest of the class watched pityingly; perhaps rightly suspecting that I was only there because my kayaking had been cancelled because of high winds. I quite liked the look of chi kung, though, which has less movement - quite often none. If you see someone in your local park pretending to be holding a bow and arrow, this could be what they&apos;re up to. All the action happens on your insides, stimulated by idiosyncratic breathing techniques geared to providing benefits for lungs and colon. The Germans&apos; idea of relaxation, meanwhile, is a bracing country stroll without shoes and socks on. &quot;Barfuss walking&quot;, as they call it, was apparently invented by a 19th-century Bavarian priest, though presumably cavemen had the idea first. Anyway, now it&apos;s a branch of reflexology and if you can&apos;t be bothered to visit the Black Forest, it is available in Stoke. I myself tried a particularly austere urban version of it in Macau. Barfuss might not sound very relaxing (what if you stand on a hedgehog?) but don&apos;t worry - the Germans set up trails that take you through only the best water, gravel, mud, tree bark, pebbles, grass and whatnot. By all accounts it&apos;s good for your blood pressure and at the end of it all, your feet have never felt so tinglingly alive; a feeling that communicates itself to your entire being (just be sure to maintain those low stress levels when you get back home by not walking mud across someone&apos;s clean floor). For those still hankering for the classical virtues, what better than a touch of basic hydrotherapy in the form of a nice soothing bath? But forget the Radox; it&apos;s time you sorted out those jangling nerves with a few hours in a floatation tank! You can buy your own if you have money to burn and a large sitting room; otherwise just pop down to your local float centre, get your kit off, immerse yourself in the drown proof 25cms of warm water (it&apos;s kept at body temperature) and let your senses go. The super-saturation of Epsom salts keeps you gravity free, and once you&apos;ve killed the lights and got your earplugs in, why it&apos;s ... it&apos;s meditation for the body! Remember Altered States, the &apos;80s film in which the boffin played by William Hurt loses his mind from being suspended in that tank for days on end? Well, it&apos;s not like that, though floatation tanks do boast a proud history in the service of experimental psychology. But here it&apos;s just the ultimate in relaxation. Your brain, having nothing better to do, releases a tonne of endorphins and ticks down to a state of simultaneous alertness and dreaminess in which the left side discovers its right. It is said (by floatation tank sales professionals) that it takes Buddhist monks years to get this in touch with themselves. &quot;Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream,&quot; as John Lennon sang - though of course he may have been talking about heroin.

Preamble: It&apos;s British grand prix time again, which means rain, wind and an uphill challenge for anyone who happened to be born on these shores. In case you missed yesterday&apos;s qualifying session, this is what the front end of the grid looks like:1 Heikki Kovalainen, McLaren2 Mark Webber, Red Bull3 Kimi Raikkonen, Ferrari4 Lewis Hamilton, McLaren5 Nick Heidfeld, BMW 6 Fernando Alonso, Renault7 Nelson Piquet, Renault8 Sebastian Vettel, Toro Rosso9 Felipe Massa, Ferrari10 Robert Kubica, BMWHhmm, the line-up for today&apos;s race looks likes someone - a blazer-clad BRDC member after a few G&amp;Ts? \u2013 threw the names of this season&apos;s top 10 points scorers into a helmet and extracted the starting grid at random. Championship leader Massa in ninth, second-placed Kubica in tenth, Hamilton in fourth and Raikkonen in third. But let&apos;s give a cheer to Kovalainen for his first-ever pole and \u2013 strewth! \u2013 raise a can to Webber for inexplicably putting his Red Bull into second. This is going to be an electric start \u2013 I won&apos;t know where to look first.  Gary Naylor has emailed to say he misses Murray Walker. We all do, Gary. Would you rather hear him interviewed than a celebrity chef? Oh yes.  Predictions: Can we make any about today&apos;s race, given the weather and the mixed-up grid? It&apos;s difficult, but Kovalainen will be desperate to prove his worth and follow his first pole with a debut win. Webber got second on merit, but will be hoping bad luck doesn&apos;t strike. The Ferraris don&apos;t seem to be as hooked-up as the McLarens, so Hamilton might get the march on Raikkonen. It would be great to see a wild-card complete the podium \u2013 Piquet or Vettel would do nicely after their strong qualifying performances. Then again, with this weather, it&apos;s probably best not to try and guess what&apos;s going to happen. Who will have been cautious and opted for full-wets and who&apos;s gambling on intermediates?  Some mechanics are, very kindly, holding umbrellas over the drivers. Despite the fact they&apos;re sitting in their cars. With helmets on. I&apos;ve got goosebumps because I&apos;m excited, but I bet everyone in the crowd has them because it&apos;s freezing.  Parade lap: Looks like most drivers are starting on intermediate tyres. There&apos;s quite a bit of spray and some standing water at parts of the track. No-one has run off the track before the race has even started - unlike in the GP2 support race this morning.  Start: Go-oooooo! Hamilton shoots down the outside of Webber and almost gets Kovalainen heading into Copse, but not quite. Webber spins and throws away all his hard work in qualifying.  Lap 1: Uh-oh. Massa has spun as well, but managed not to get hit and carries on. David Coulthard finishes his last-ever British grand prix in the gravel, after colliding with Sebastian Vettel. It&apos;s Kovalainen ahead of Hamilton and Raikkonen. Hamilton is very close and almost gets Kovalainen coming down the pit straight.  Lap 3: Alonso has now taken fourth from Heidfeld while Trulli has shot up to seventh, while Sutil and Barrichello have both made stunning progress in the opening few laps. Hamilton is really hustling Kovalainen.  Lap 4: Hamilton gets past Kovalainen on the inside at Stowe to take the lead. Was Kovalainen told to let him through? It seemed like an easy move.  Lap 9:  There&apos;s no rain but the track is still damp. Hamilton is gaining a cushion over Kovalainen and Raikkonen in the lead - how might lighter on fuel was he in qualifying? Webber is starting to make his way back up the field after his disappointing start. Can Alonso, in fourth, close the gap to Raikkonen? He&apos;s only 3.5 seconds adrift.  Lap 10: Blimey, Webber has now taken Nakajima, Bourdais and Sutil and is 12th. Insert your own &apos;Red Bull gives you wings&apos; joke.  Lap 11: Kovalainen spins under braking into Abbey, letting Raikkonen through into second. At least he manages to stay ahead of Alonso. But a McLaren one-two is now less likely. Piquet&apos;s engineer says over the radio that more rain is expected in five mins. Sutil goes through the gravel and out of the race.  Lap 13: Webber watch - he&apos;s now passed Barrichello for 11th and is hunting down Button.  Lap 15: Hamilton&apos;s lead is 3.8 seconds but Raikkonen is closing the gap. The teams should be getting ready to pit drivers within the next five laps or so. Could we see some rash gambles?  Lap 17: No-one has spun for a while. Massa has passed Rosberg for 15th. I wonder if Coulthard is having a nice cup of tea and piece of shortbread in the Red Bull hospitality?  Gary Naylor (him again) asks: &apos;Why is a Grand Prix like a T-shirt? Both are much better to watch when wet.&apos; He must be a Bon Jovi fan. No-one else has emailed me. Sob.  Lap 19: Kovalainen pits - but what tyres are they going to put on? They&apos;re fitting new intermediates, so they must be predicting rain. Webber has also pitted. Maybe he needed a break from overtaking everyone.  Lap 21: Raikkonen has really caught Hamilton now - his lead is less than a second. But both must be pitting soon. Let&apos;s hope they don&apos;t clash in the pitlane again...  Lap 22: Hamilton made it out of the pits just ahead of Raikkonen and the crowd lifted up their soggy sleeves and cheered. And now they&apos;re putting on their macs again... must be more rain.  Lap 25: Hamilton is over 12 seconds ahead of Raikkonen, and the Ferrari driver looks like he is going to have to pit and change tyres. What has Ferrari done? Hamilton might walk this unless the rain delivers us a safety car.  Lap 28: Piquet has now passed his team-mate Alonso! It&apos;s all down to the tyres. Like Raikkonen, Alonso didn&apos;t have fresh intermediates fitted in the first round of pit stops. They may as well be driving Morris Minors for all their performance. Hamilton has now lapped world championship leader Massa. Meanwhile, Heidfeld mugs Kovalainen while the Finn is passing Raikkonen. Heifeld now in second. Fisichella goes to play in the gravel.  James Kinsella emails in. He&apos;s unsure why Hamilton is so quicker and asks if he&apos;s taking shortcuts. It&apos;s the tyres. Note to self: suggest that when a driver takes on new tyres, the old ones are placed around the neck of the team manager, giving us all a fail-safe way of knowing which drivers have them on. Maybe.  Lap 32: Both Ferrari&apos;s have now pitted again, the teams being forced to change their earlier strategies after failing to fit fresh tyres in the first stops. Raikkonen and Alonso (who also pitted) are now expected to run until the end of the race without stopping.  Chris Dalby has emailed from China where he says the race isn&apos;t being broadcast. He thinks that this might be the last chance for a British win at Silverstone, with the news this weekend that the race will move to Donington from 2010. With Hamilton&apos;s lead now 25 seconds over Heidfeld, it sounds like Chris is a wise man.  Lap 35: After Kubica took third from Kovalainen, the McLaren car is brought into the pits and new intermediates are fitted. What a shame the Finn is struggling so much after his superb qualifying performance.  Wow... Matthew Tyler-Jones has emailed from the cinema, where he&apos;s watching Kung Fu Panda with his three year-old. Not only is that great fatherhood - to sacrifice watching a grand prix for the happiness of your child - but extreme dedication to the sport to still keep an eye on what&apos;s going on in the race. Matthew, I salute you.  Lap 37: It&apos;s all gone mental. The rain is hammering down, Piquet is out, Hamilton has a brief off and everyone needs to pit for full wets. Massa is everywhere. A hare legs it across the track. Brilliant. Why aren&apos;t all grands prix like this?  Lap 38: Hamilton pits... but they&apos;re putting intermediates on! This seems like an incredible gamble, despite his 26 second lead. The weather must be clearing up and the track not as wet as it seems.  Lap 39: Raikkonen has another spin, coming out of Woodcote backwards, while Webber has also been off. Apparently there are blue skies.  Lap 42: Barrichello, on full wets, steams past Alonso. Kubica flies at speed into the gravel \u2013 he won&apos;t be second in the drivers&apos; championship anymore. Hamilton is still our leader, with Heidfeld over 40 seconds adrift. Trulli has only made one stop and is third - if he doesn&apos;t have to stop again, could we see him on the podium for the second time this season? Or will Barrichello deliver a shock result?  Lap 43: Barrichello has Trulli but there are reports he&apos;ll have to pit again after the fuel rig failed during his last stop and he didn&apos;t take any on. Doh!  Gary Naylor asks whether the hares risking their lives to run across the track are heading to Donington. Personally, I think they are religious fanatics making a protest for peace. They just forgot to bring their banners.  Lap 45: It&apos;s true - the skies are blue and the sun is shining. Hamilton is one of the only drivers who hasn&apos;t put a Bridgestone wrong, and he&apos;s several seconds faster than rivals on the same intermediate tyres.  David Akast has asked me to tell Chris Dalby that in Shanghai the grand prix is being shown on two channels - including CCTV5, the national sports channel. See how the humble live formula one blog can reach out to people around the world? What a lovely moment, thanks guys.  On the ITV commentary, James Allen has suggested that Hamilton has enough time in hand to stop for a cup of tea and still win the race. Perhaps he could join Coulthard? I&apos;d bet he&apos;d prefer a nice slice of battenburg to a shortbread finger, however.  Lap 49: Hamilton&apos;s lead is, indeed, over a minute now. Heidfeld is second and Barrichello - brilliantly - looks set to complete the podium. What a thrilling race.  Lap 52: Ouch! Kovalainen has spun - letting Alonso and Raikkonen through - and team-mate Hamilton has lapped him. Massa has also spun. Again. He&apos;s in the pits, and perhaps considering giving it up altogether and going for a nice warm cup of soup.  Erwan Shahfizad reports that only those Malaysians with satellite TV can watch the grand prix. What a shame. He also says something about a hare&apos;s leg which I don&apos;t quite understand. Aplogies Erwan. Ooooh, Raikkonen has just passed Alonso for fourth.  David Akast, I have an email to pass on to you from Michael Garvey who is also in China and says he knows you. He would love to get in touch again. Amazing... an incredible grand prix and friends reunited all rolled into one. What a day.  Lap 56: Alonso, Kovalainen and Nakajima are having a fab battle and Trulli is angling for a look-in too as we approach the end of the race. The battle for fifth is going to be tight.  Lap 58: Kovalainen takes fifth from Alonso. Bet he doesn&apos;t like being passed by a silver car.  Last lap: What a race from Hamilton. The crowd deserved to see it, the circuit (in its 60th anniversary) deserved to host it... and the man himself deserved to take the flag. Well done Lewis, a truly memorable drive.  &quot;Tremendous discipline... but look after the car&quot; says Ron Dennis over the radio as Hamilton finishes his victory lap. He is now tied with Raikkonen and Massa on 48 points at the top of the table. A superb podium for Barrichello, too. Here&apos;s the finishers:1 Hamilton2 Heidfeld3 Barrichello4 Raikkonen5 Kovalainen6 Alonso7 Trulli8 Nakajima9 Rosberg10 Webber11 Bourdais12 Glock13 Massa  What it means: Hamilton was, potentially, at a cross-roads in his second difficult season. He&apos;s now proved that he&apos;s capable of keeping his head and delivering stunning drives when the pressure is on. He&apos;s put himself level on points with Massa and Raikkonen and he&apos;s given himself a psychological advantage heading into the next race. Massa, in particular, will be feeling the strain after an appalling weekend, while Ferrari will be looking at its ability to make the right decisions about tyres in the heat of the moment.

The 27-year-old Englishman, who began the tournament with a course-record 63 playing the Kent layout &quot;blind&quot;, completed a seven-stroke win by holing a bunker shot on the last. Fisher began the week by qualifying for The Open but contemplated pulling out of the European Tour event because of tiredness. He will be glad he did not. Before the final round Spain&apos;s Sergio Garc\u00eda thought a score of 68 might give him a chance of victory, given the wet and windy conditions, and then produced a 66 that he called one of the top five rounds of his career and &quot;definitely the best putting round I&apos;ve ever had&quot;. Yet, given Fisher&apos;s scoring, he would have had to shoot a 59 just to make a play-off. Fisher, who was three ahead of Graeme McDowell and nine clear of Garc\u00eda overnight, finished with a 68 for a 20-under-par total. With it he took a second Tour victory and moved from 21st in the Ryder Cup standings to 11th. &quot;Just a great week,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt really calm all day, very composed, comfy with my game. I got my fair share of luck as well - at the last I was just thinking, &apos;Try and put it on the green&apos;. I&apos;m delighted.&quot; In November Fisher led the Champions event in Shanghai by one shot with one hole to play and, with his closest challenger, Phil Mickelson, in the water on the par-five, he was favoured to win. But he chipped over the green into the lake for a double-bogey seven and lost the play-off. Earlier in 2007 he was joint leader with a round to play in the PGA Championship at Wentworth, his home club, but collapsed to a last-round 84. Fisher, a former England amateur international said: &quot;They say the second win is harder. I might have made it look easy but it certainly wasn&apos;t.&quot; As for the possibility of a Ryder Cup debut, he added: &quot;I&apos;d love it but it&apos;s still a long way off.&quot; The Northern Irishman McDowell&apos;s third place, which he managed despite a final round of 73, put him in the 10th and last automatic qualifying spot in the Ryder Cup standings. South Africa&apos;s David Frost, at 48 trying to become the oldest winner in Tour history, finished fourth, which gave him one of the places into The Open that were up for grabs at the event. Fisher&apos;s 50-foot putt for eagle on the 5th put him in a commanding position early in his round and he then played the remaining holes in three under, with birdies on the 12th, 15th and 471-yard 18th - on which Fisher produced three of only 25 birdies all week. The Open champion Padraig Harrington, who was 18 shots back in 17th place after a 75, said: &quot;I don&apos;t think any player out here would be surprised at Ross&apos;s performance. He is well capable of doing this and more regularly.&quot; Garc\u00eda had only 21 putts in his final round and, given that this is the part of his game holding him back for so long, he could deserve to go into The Open as favourite. He is up from fifth to second in the Ryder Cup standings and said: &quot;Obviously I came here trying to win but my second goal was to get as many cup points [as possible] and that&apos;s helped a lot. &quot;I would expect to putt like that every single round. I&apos;d love to, it would be an easy game. Now I feel what Tiger feels 90% of the time on the greens - it&apos;s a great feeling.&quot; The defending champion, Colin Montgomerie, paired with Harrington, finished 24th after a final round of 77 and remains 14th in the Ryder Cup points race.", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-06T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/07/premierleague.europeanfootball", "sentences": ["&quot;Asia holds huge potential for clubs hoping to expand their brand and business.&quot; Games in Seoul, Hong Kong and Shanghai didn&apos;t sell out but did enable the club to recoup some of David Beckham&apos;s salary.", "Maybe it is no different to when Beyonc\u00e9 played Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta to promote her second album."], "title": "Is a new colonialism taking place as football's big fish look east?", "article": "At the end of last season, Bayern Munich defeated Indian club Mohun Bagan 3-0 in Kolkata, watched by 125,000 locals. Double that figure and you are not far short of the entire population of the Maldives, a nation that defeated India 1-0 in the South Asian Cup final a week later. It&apos;s hard not to think that the \u00a31.5m or so that Bayern received for the game from a private Indian company, which would barely cover Luca Toni&apos;s summer salary, may have been better invested elsewhere. Bob Houghton, India&apos;s manager, was scathing. &quot;Do you think Bayern Munich played against Mohun Bagan because they love India or Indian football?&quot; asked the former Fulham midfielder. &quot;They played in India because they were paid an obscene sum of money. If they had spent that amount on developing the youth teams, Indian football would have been better off.&quot; Such visits are fairly new to India but are a familiar feature of summers further east. Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s Manchester City made a 10-day post-season tour of Thailand and Hong Kong, donating the proceeds from the Hong Kong leg to the China earthquake fund. On the pitch, the tour was less of a success as the Blues lost both games. &quot;You can&apos;t be in business and ignore the Asia markets,&quot; the LA Galaxy owner Alexi Lalas told me on the eve of the club&apos;s Asian tour in March. &quot;Asia holds huge potential for clubs hoping to expand their brand and business.&quot; Games in Seoul, Hong Kong and Shanghai didn&apos;t sell out but did enable the club to recoup some of David Beckham&apos;s salary. It is hard to say what LA Galaxy did to help football in east Asia - perhaps it was no more than a chance for fans to see Beckham in the flesh. The former England skipper was part of a Real Madrid team that visited the region in 2005, which symbolised all that was bad about these tours when disinterested players came, saw nothing and conquered little more than the remote control in their hotel rooms. Real pocketed $25m but it came at a price as the vice-president of the Chinese FA, Yang Yiming, told theguardian.com: &quot;At the beginning, the tours really warmed the Chinese football market. In the 1990s, everyone in Beijing was talking excitedly about how Beiing Guoan defeated AC Milan and Arsenal. And then we realised it&apos;s only a show and a joke, just a commercial game, no more than that.&quot; Maybe Yang is right. Maybe it is no different to when Beyonc\u00e9 played Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta to promote her second album. Nobody moaned that she wasn&apos;t doing enough to help the local music scene. When Christina Aguilera visited Seoul and Tokyo, she wasn&apos;t expected to do her bit for K-pop or J-pop - she appeared on stage so late that fans were grateful she appeared at all, so why should football teams be expected to help the K or J-leagues? But that is precisely what Asian Football Confederation (AFC) boss Mohammed bin Hamman wants. With half the planet&apos;s population in Asia, it is accepted that clubs will always go east in search of new fans, markets and money, but it is the manner of the visits that the confederation hopes to change. &quot;Don&apos;t come as businessmen,&quot; Bin Hamman said when deciding that the Premier League&apos;s 39th game was not such a bad idea after all. &quot;You have to leave a legacy \u2026 that is going to benefit the youth of the country, the club, the national association. Don&apos;t come as bloodsuckers.&quot; Perhaps he had Manchester United in mind. Last year, Bin Hamman flew into a rage over the club&apos;s plans to play in Kuala Lumpur two days after the city hosted an Asian Cup semi-final. &quot;It is a way of colonialism. It is not fair play at all \u2026 It&apos;s immoral, unethical, and disrespectful,&quot; he said. United&apos;s rivals snickered at the scolding. &quot;It doesn&apos;t show respect to Asia,&apos;&apos; Martin Haegele, Bayern&apos;s head of international affairs, said with a straight face. &quot;We want to be different from clubs that just come to milk the cow.&apos;&apos; Chelsea agreed. &quot;We&apos;re not going to take our club to Asia when the Asian Cup is taking place,&apos;&apos; chairman Bruce Buck said smugly. &quot;That&apos;s lesson No1.&apos;&apos; Chelsea are first on the AFC&apos;s list. The Londoners are building a long-term relationship with Asia as they aim to become the world&apos;s biggest brand by 2014. In 2006, Chelsea became the first European club to sign an agreement with the AFC, pledging to promote and advance Asian football. Until now, the players haven&apos;t been too active on Asian soil but Peter Kenyon is a frequent visitor to India and China where the club has been involved in setting up local leagues. And this month they will play pre-season friendlies in China and Kuala Lumpur, as well as a game against Chengdu Blades in Macau to raise funds for earthquake victims - not bad for a club that once considered installing electric fences at Stamford Bridge. The club&apos;s south-west London neighbours Fulham are also eyeing the Asian market, with the Cottagers scheduled to play two pre-season friendlies in Korea this month, against Busan L&apos;Park and Hyundai Ulsan. India is seen as the new China, with - at the moment at least - less cynical fans, and European clubs are eager to have a presence on the subcontinent. Arsenal recently signed a deal with a Mumbai club, Manchester United have opened soccer schools and Everton have held training camps and coached local coaches. Houghton is still not convinced. &quot;Do you really believe these clubs are hunting for talent in India?&quot; he asked. &quot;They&apos;re a menace for Indian football. They are doing nothing for the sport. All this is a money-making racket, nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Do you seriously think that Chelsea and Manchester United consider India a great place for talent?&quot; Not all agree with Houghton. While fans in China, Japan and Korea have perhaps wearied a little of European visits, counterparts in India and Indonesia are still enthusiastic. The official Indian line is that Bayern&apos;s visit was what the game needed in a cricket-mad nation. &quot;It was definitely a success,&quot; said Subrata Dutta, the vice-president of the All Indian Football Federation. &quot;As a team, they helped enhance the popularity of the sport especially after the Indian Premier League.&quot; For Mohun Bagan, it didn&apos;t quite hit the heights of a friendly with Pele and New York Cosmos in the 1970s but &quot;from a marketing perspective, it was a success&quot;, said club spokesman Sohini Mitra Chaubey. &quot;In India, not many companies are willing to invest in football. But by watching teams like Bayern, they can see that investing in football isn&apos;t a bad idea. The brand visibility is massive when you have 125,000 people watching your team.&quot; Around 60,000 fans in Jakarta also saw the Germans. &quot;It was a huge benefit for our national team. Our players can learn from some of the best in Europe,&quot; said the head of the Indonesia FA, Nurdin Halid, by telephone from his prison cell - he was jailed in November for corruption but kept his job as head of the FA. &quot;Our national team never had more than 60,000 fans in the stadium for a friendly.&quot; That is the sad part - 125,000 to watch a European team shorn of its Euro 2008 stars while few in India noticed the Maldives loss?

At Sunday&apos;s British grand prix at Silverstone Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one commercial rights holder, threatened to remove the UK race from the calendar altogether if the Donington Park promoters, Simon Gillett and Lee Gill, fail to deliver on their contract to stage the race on what will be a heavily redeveloped circuit designed by Hermann Tilke, the architect who designed the tracks in Malaysia, Bahrain and Shanghai. &quot;We have not yet actually received the planning application although we have been talking through the project with the race promoters during the phase prior to last week&apos;s official announcement,&quot; said a council spokesman, Ian Hill, yesterday. &quot;Obviously we have little experience of a project on this scale and once we become involved we will be looking at it from an overall viewpoint, talking to the owners on an ongoing basis. &quot;Our approach will be dictated by the need to get things right for such a major global sporting event, while at the same time addressing whatever needs and concerns arise among the local residents. &quot;Of course the sheer scale of this project is such that we will be working closely with the highways agency and the police authorities from the very start.&quot;  Much as some members of the British Racing Drivers&apos; Club, the owners of Silverstone, may like to hope, it is unlikely that the Donington Park promoters will run into the same intractable problems which confronted the owners of Brands Hatch during their ill-starred efforts to revive the famous Kent circuit for formula one action in 1999. On that occasion several issues conspired to scotch plans to refurbish the track. The complaints of residents who lived close to the circuit and the issue of conserving a unique tract of historic woodland were problems enough without the headache of insufficient room to build state-of-the-art pits, paddock and grandstands. As a result the British grand prix contract reverted to Silverstone and there are those at the BRDC who will be hoping that, in the end, Silverstone will be the beneficiary of somebody else&apos;s failure to get the job done for the second time in little more than a decade.  Although the planning applications have still to be submitted, the Donington Park promoters seem to have a clear idea of what is expected of them and Tilke&apos;s preliminary sketches for the track layout certainly have the ring of practicality. The only formula one race staged at Donington was the 1993 European grand prix, won in spectacular fashion in the rain by the late Ayrton Senna, who stormed from fifth to first place on the opening lap.

And what greater form of flashback could there be than an entire festival devoted to reviving old movies - the restored, the rediscovered, or simply the seen anew? Bologna&apos;s Il Cinema Ritrovato (Cinema Rediscovered), which just wrapped its 22nd edition, offers a window on the past, turning the most fantastic fiction films into documents of their time; but it also reflects back on us now, holding a yardstick to our presumptions of progress. Like any good (and well-funded) festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato offers an impossible choice of cinematic pathways. This year&apos;s festival squeezed into eight days retrospectives of the great Hollywood expressionist Josef von Sternberg, including but extending beyond his Marlene Dietrich iconographies (Morocco, Dishonoured, Shanghai Express, Blonde Venus, The Scarlet Empress and The Devil is a Woman); Lev Kuleshov, the Soviet theoretician and pioneer; the Italian silent serials star Emilio Ghione; sundry Chaplin-related programmes, part of the festival&apos;s ongoing Chaplin project; the Depression-era talkies of the Warner Bros studio; and an international selection of movies about the atomic bomb. But the greatest discoveries were the compilations of short films from the cinema&apos;s early years. Each edition of the festival exhumes films that have reached their centenary - this year celebrated the class of 1908, the year DW Griffith joined the Biograph company, and American cinema began to vie with the recession-hit French and Italians - in what programmer Mariann Lewinsky calls &quot;a long-term research project in real time&quot;, or cinema chronicled as an annual serial. 1908 was also the year the vehemently anti-feminist Lord Asquith became British prime minister, and helped radicalise the Suffragette movement. Dovetailing with the 1908 anthology was an excellent survey, Irresistible Forces: Comic Actresses and Suffragettes, which showed the struggle for women&apos;s emancipation playing out in street protests and screen farces. Here were suffragettes on the streets of Newcastle, and the charred husk of Yarmouth Pavillion; here the spectre of uppity, mannish maidservants on the rampage, and a henpecked husband&apos;s fantasy of laying down the law to modern-day witches such as his wife. Most shocking was the footage of Emily Davison&apos;s death underfoot at the 1913 Derby - or perhaps the newsreel&apos;s briefest pause for acknowledgement before moving on to report the end of the race. Most delightful, not least to those of us reared on a British cinema of restraint (not to mention the passivity of modern female film roles), were such anarchic comedies as Did&apos;ums Diddles the P&apos;liceman - clearly an incitement to all hyperactive moppets to batter their local bobby - or the series of Tilly the Tomboy shorts, in which the fair-faced teenager and her sister Sally upend their parents&apos; party, joyride a stolen truck, and trampoline on their bedridden elders with gleeful impunity. Such movies need the conditions for which they were intended - celluloid projection, the big screen, darkness, the company of other movies - if they are truly to talk to us across time. The festival helps us regain that context: where else would you find crowds squatting in the aisles for a screening of the rickety 1927 idle-rich melodrama Children of Divorce, starring Clara Bow and a young Gary Cooper? (A Paramount rarity partly re-shot by Von Sternberg, the film impressed me as a powerful argument for redistributive taxation.) The festival&apos;s widescreen presentations stretch out down the road at the city&apos;s half-century-old Cinema Arlecchino, with its original curved screen and hopefully less original aroma of stale popcorn. I caught Metin Erksan&apos;s Dry Season (Susuz Yaz), a prescient parable about water privatisation which played something like a James M Cain retelling of the Cain and Abel story. It was the first Turkish winner of Berlin&apos;s Golden Bear in 1964, to the embarrassment of the Turkish authorities; decades of studious neglect ensued, until a recent restoration under the auspices of Martin Scorsese&apos;s new World Cinema Foundation. Movies need viewers, and Bologna&apos;s biggest events were saved for the open air of the Piazza Maggiore, where at 10pm every festival night 5,000 seats beckoned delegates and Bolognese alike. Tuesday night was a particular thrill: the silent version of Hitchcock&apos;s Blackmail, accompanied by the premiere of Neil Brand&apos;s especially commissioned new score, arranged for full orchestra by Timothy Brock. As night set in, and the piazza gazed up at Anny Ondra&apos;s unravelling date in 1929 London, Brand&apos;s echt-Hitchcockian motifs and harmonies folded us right back into the drama, with all those commingling Bernard Hermannn and Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3sza references in tow. The festival ends, the archivists retreat to their darkroom forensics, and we return to our DVDs. Il Cinema Ritrovato also hands out awards for the best of the year&apos;s global DVD crop, though it&apos;s not very good at publicising them. The BFI&apos;s Land of Promise: The British Documentary Project 1930-1950 was one of the releases given a special mention, though the French publisher Carlotta Films came out best with three awards - best bonus materials for their Douglas Sirk box set, best box set for sound movies for their collection of Brazil&apos;s Cinema Novo director Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, and Best Silent DVD with Marcel L&apos;Herbier&apos;s L&apos;Argent.

EMI starting building factories here in 1906, when it was still called The Gramophone and Typewriter Company. In the 60s, its factories covered 150 acres and it employed 14,000 people. Today, however, the factories and recording studios are gone or in the process of being demolished. EMI&apos;s Hayes workforce is in single figures, all of them employed in the company&apos;s last remaining building, a vast archive. From the outside, the archive looks as melancholy as the rest of Hayes. Inside, it&apos;s just bizarre, an apparently endless steel vault containing not just records and master tapes, but aged recording equipment, gramophones, memorabilia and files of press clippings. &quot;They&apos;ve kept everything,&quot; notes Mark Ainley, co-founder of Honest Jon&apos;s, the acclaimed record label born out of the legendary Notting Hill record shop. Ainley estimates he has spent around 20 months working in the archive&apos;s temperature-controlled environs, sorting through shelf after shelf of forgotten 78s, recorded across the world in the early years of the 20th century: he was alerted to their existence by former EMI CEO Tony Wadsworth. Honest Jon&apos;s has become famous in recent years not just for the involvement of Damon Albarn - who credits Ainley and business partner Alan Scholefield with exposing him to Malian music - but for digging up and releasing impossibly recherch\u00e9 music. However, even Ainley seems slightly overwhelmed by what was lurking on the Hayes archive shelves. He has found recordings of Tamils impersonating motorised transport in 1906, Bengali beggars singing and utterly chilling records from the first world war, intended to inform the British public of the different bells that would be rung in the event of a poison gas attack. &quot;It&apos;s basically a load of records on a shelf without very much other information. They&apos;ve never been inventoried, they&apos;re not even stored by artist or country, but catalogue prefix, so there&apos;s nothing for it but to just go through all of them, just listen to everything.&quot; He sighs. &quot;It&apos;s daft.&quot; The intention, he says, was to release a series of albums themed around different countries - as well as the newly released Give Me Love: The Brokenhearted of Baghdad 1925-1929, projected volumes include albums devoted to Turkey, Caucasia, Lebanon, Greece, Iran, Egypt and the Belgian Congo - but the situation has got so out of hand that in addition to the albums, he&apos;s thinking of starting a website to try to marshal the archive&apos;s apparently bottomless supply of aged world music: &quot;I was staggered by what we found, in terms of the raw quality of it, the diversity of it, the condition of it and the volume of it. When the recording engineers went abroad, they recorded huge quantities. In just a couple of Iraq sessions, they recorded about 1,000 sides.&quot; Yes, he concedes, it is a funny thing to be working on at the moment. The Hayes series is the last project Honest Jon&apos;s will undertake under the auspices of EMI: its six-year contract with the major ran out in May: &quot;And now we&apos;re going to find out if we can subsist.&quot; Honest Jon&apos;s archaeology has thrown up a fascinating, forgotten history of world music, packed with extraordinary figures, not least Fred Gaisberg, an American who worked with the inventor of the gramophone, Emil Berliner, before emigrating to England to work as a recording engineer for the Gramophone Company in 1898. Gaisberg is best remembered as a classical music talent-spotter - he was the first person to record Enrico Caruso - but in the early years of the 20th century, he embarked on a series of adventurous field trips abroad to record indigenous music: Russia in 1901, India in 1902, China and Japan the following year. Gaisberg, it&apos;s worth noting, was not always hugely impressed by what he found. In Calcutta, he was horrified by English colonials, who &quot;might as well be living on another planet for all the interest they took in Indian music&quot;, as he complained to his diary, and more horrified still by one female singer&apos;s habit of chewing betel nuts while performing: &quot;It necessitated the presence of bearer following her about with a silver cuspidor into which she would empty her mouthful,&quot; he shuddered, &quot;much to the distraction of her charms.&quot; Things got even worse in Shanghai. &quot;The Chinaman&apos;s idea of music is a tremendous clash and bang ... the din so paralysed my wits I could not think,&quot; protested Gaisberg, who was clearly no Edwardian Andy Kershaw, adding that he&apos;d thus far made 325 records there, but couldn&apos;t tell the difference between any of them. Nevertheless, it&apos;s hard not to be slightly awestruck by the conditions under which he and his fellow engineers worked. Gaisberg&apos;s trip to the far east was considered so perilous that he made out his will before leaving England. &quot;Sometimes they would travel hundreds of miles on horseback, carrying boxes and boxes of elaborate and delicate equipment, in order to make these quite tentative rendezvous with musicians,&quot; says Ainley, who found letters and notes from Gaisberg among the 78s. Indeed, Ainley thinks the engineers&apos; lack of local knowledge may have been to their advantage: &quot;When they went to Iraq in the 1920s, they recorded Kuwaitis, Kurds, women, Jewish hymns, city music country music. It&apos;s a snapshot of the city, it&apos;s more diverse because they hadn&apos;t decided in advance what they wanted.&quot; It&apos;s all grand, swashbuckling stuff, bolstered by photographs of the extravagantly moustachioed Gaisberg recruiting potential artists while sporting a pith helmet, or looking slightly perturbed in a kimono. But Ainley cautions against taking too romantic a view of the pioneering sound engineers: for one thing, the records they were making were never heard in England, but exported back out to the places where they were recorded: &quot;I don&apos;t think they were trying to memorialise this music, I think they were trying to make money.&quot; By the time EMI&apos;s engineers went to Baghdad, they found themselves engaged in that most 21st-century of record company practices: a bidding war for the most popular singers with a rival German company. &quot;It&apos;s good, innit?&quot; chuckles Ainley. &quot;Brings a bit of honesty into it. And it worked, they sold tons of records. The session they did in 1925 in Baghdad, they sold 11,000 records just from that one.&quot; Nonetheless, he says, &quot;when you read what Gaisberg saying the colonials were on a different planet to the people whose music he actually wanted to hear, I don&apos;t think it would be right to say they were only interested in the money. There is something really optimistic and kind of ... something that&apos;s gone. There&apos;s just a gentle idea of how you can make a change, how you can affect ideas about the world.&quot;  \u00b7  Give Me Love: The Brokenhearted Of Baghdad 1925-1929 is out now", "tags": ["World music", "Culture", "Music", "Vinyl"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-10T23:18:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/11/news.culture1", "sentences": ["Violinists from the Shanghai Conservatory will brush shoulders with flautists from Finland&apos;s Sibelius Academy.", "The Sydney Conservatorium will present works by contemporary Australian composers, Finnish musicians will play folk-infused jazz, and Shanghai and Beijing delegates will include traditional Chinese pipa and zheng music in their programmes."], "title": "On your marks.

When China first sought the games, it was still reeling from Tiananmen Square and the way it was covered around the world. The country lost its first bid, but in its second Liu Qi, the mayor of Beijing, made &quot;the further development of our human rights cause&quot; an explicit part of his presentation. Whether it was a pledge, or a promise, or in the text of the bid itself, is open to debate. The bid has never been published. With Tibet simmering uneasily in the background, up to 30,000 journalists are about to descend on the country to test the mayor&apos;s words. The manicured monumentalism of the opening ceremony will be the crowning symbol of the country&apos;s emergence on the world stage. It will be less of a coming-out parade for Chinese leaders than a coronation. For the very same reasons, western leaders rightly remain uneasy about giving their imprimatur to a regime which jails dissidents, persecutes religious groups, backs Burma and bankrolls Darfur. The comparison with Hitler&apos;s games in 1936 is hysterical, but the games in Moscow in 1980 or in Seoul in 1988 both come to mind. Nicolas Sarkozy told Hu Jintao at the G8 summit that he would be attending the opening ceremony as president of the EU as well as his own country, but the merest hint of trouble could have him scurrying for his jet. In fact his pilot may be advised to keep the engines running. Nor is Gordon Brown made any less vulnerable by turning up only at the end. If a major incident happens before then he will have to climb out of a hole of his own making. Have these leaders squandered their leverage by turning up, or will they use their attendance to pull those levers? George Bush has undoubtedly wasted his political capital, by saying he would be attending as a sports fan. Just before he did so, a court in Shanghai granted parole to a Chinese-born US citizen, Jude Shao, who had served half of a 16-year sentence on tax evasion and fraud charges. His supporters said he had refused to pay a bribe sought by tax officials. If Washington&apos;s pressure can effect the release of a US citizen, what is its responsibility to Chinese human rights activists like Hu Jia, who got three and a half years in prison in April for publishing an open letter, &quot;The Real China and the Olympics&quot;?  Far from advancing the cause of human rights, China has used the run-up to the games as an excuse to clamp down on them, as a book from Human Rights Watch shows. The relative freedoms enjoyed a year ago by an emerging group of commercial lawyers, journalists and petitioners have disappeared. In the past decade these activists have pushed the envelope by using email and the internet to make their voices heard. Today the government is using the same tools to clamp down on their activities. The envelope is pushing back. But this is not just a game of cat and mouse between small groups of activists and a much larger army of state apparatchiks. There are strong currents of nationalism swirling in the Chinese blogosphere, resentful of how events in Tibet were depicted outside the country. They carry an implied threat to the western media: muck up our games with your coverage and you may find that, after they are over, there will be a backlash. China promised western journalists that they could travel and operate freely around the country (except Tibet), but that freedom is due to expire in October. It should instead be extended to all journalists in China. The course of the games will be determined by how the Chinese government tackles the inevitable displays of protest.

The carpet still has to be laid on the university&apos;s volleyball courts, the spotlights connected, the music chosen. Only then can scores of his finest pupils show Yan&apos;an, a small town in central China, &apos;what ballroom dancing is all about&apos;. &apos;This is the moment I have been working towards all my life,&apos; said Ren, 48, as he watched 100 contestants, all from Yan&apos;an University, putting the finishing touches to their make-up and costumes. &apos;This is my dream.&apos; The couples adjusting pink nylon gowns and sequinned electric blue trousers do not know it but they - and Ren - are the face of modern China. Far from Beijing, from Shanghai or from the bustling economic powerhouse of Guangdong province, they have grown up in a poor, rural, northern-central province and are often the first in the family to receive more than a rudimentary education - and in some cases the first not to worry about basics like food and a roof.  Shi Tao Jao, in a yellow dress, hopes for a career in &apos;international tourist management&apos;. Dancing allows her &apos;to meet boys&apos;. These young people have watched their country evolving at an astonishing pace. In the last competition, Shi came second. Now she wants to be first. Ren himself knows about change. He set up the club, from which he now earns a good living, with the 60,000 yuan (\u00a34,400) redundancy payment he received when the state-owned factory where he had worked for 26 years shut 18 months ago - bankrupted by the government&apos;s free market reforms. &apos;Once it was just two of us. Now we have 400 dancers,&apos; Ren, a former truck driver, said. And with three weeks to go until the Olympics, Ren&apos;s ambitions of teaching all Yan&apos;an the cha-cha-cha have met with official approval.  The Communist party of China is nothing if not flexible. What some might once have considered a bourgeois Western import has been cleverly co-opted. &apos;We are using ballroom dancing to mobilise young people for the Olympics,&apos; says Shen Chang Liang, in Yan&apos;an&apos;s public sports office. As elsewhere in China, local authorities are planning a series of sporting competitions, parades and open days to crank up the popular fervour for the Olympics.  Sports authorities may insist that the games themselves are non-political, but few in China are blind to their internal significance. Bringing the Olympics to the country is widely seen as a vindication of the government&apos;s diplomatic skill - and therefore that of the party - as well as its economic competence. It is also seen as a key assertion of a new national identity and confidence. &apos;Sport is a key part of the project of the party for the nation,&apos; said Liu Haijun, director of the Yan&apos;an Sports Institute. So Yan&apos;an, population 340,000, now has a new 20,000-seat sports stadium, one of hundreds of such projects across the country. Every afternoon, after lessons in the morning, scores of teenage students train on the stadium&apos;s Astroturf. Mainly from poor rural families, they are all students of Yan&apos;an&apos;s subsidised Sports Institute. This, they hope, is their way out of poverty.  But equality, sporting or otherwise, is relative. The director&apos;s large, new black car is parked outside the students&apos; squalid, rudimentary accommodation and the windows to his air-conditioned office keep the stench from the student&apos;s communal latrines at bay. For the government, sport not only projects national pride and prowess, but is a way of cushioning the pain of immense social and economic changes.  The parents of Lu Fan, 17, an aspiring young sprinter at the academy, live 30 miles north of Yan&apos;an in a flat provided by the factory where they have worked for 20 years. If the state-owned enterprise closes they will lose income, healthcare and their home. Then the \u00a3400-a-year fees for the sports institute would be very difficult to find. &apos;I am always anxious,&apos; said Lu&apos;s mother, Li Chunmei. &apos;But my son has talent, so I am hopeful too.&apos;  Lu says he is &apos;realistic&apos;. &apos;I don&apos;t dream of the Olympics. But maybe I&apos;ll make it on the national stage one day. And I&apos;ll make a good living too,&apos; he says. But sport will only go so far in uniting the nation behind a repressive one-party state ... and the government has other cards to play.  Yan&apos;an is the city where Mao Zedong ended the Long March and built up his forces before finally launching the campaign that brought him and the resurgent Communist party of China to power in 1949. Scattered among the towering new apartment blocks are the simple - but perfectly maintained - huts and halls used by Mao and his comrades more than 60 years ago.  Since 2005, the government has poured huge resources into &apos;red tourism&apos; here. A vast station is under construction in Yan&apos;an to welcome special trains ferrying visitors from the sprawling coastal cities. The prettiest and brightest local girls are recruited to guide half a million visitors each year. &apos;The important thing is to transfer the spirit, diligence and patriotism of the old generation,&apos; says Yuan Xin, 23, a guide and local student. The visitors are mainly on coach trips from factories and schools but increasingly there are individual visitors, too. In the courtyard of Chairman Mao&apos;s former home, one woman said she had brought her nine-year-old daughter to learn of &apos;the sacrifices made by our leaders&apos;. In another, two young boys dressed up as 1930s soldiers and took pictures of each other. &apos;The hardship the old leaders suffered is really impressive,&apos; one said.  For their guide, there was no doubt. &apos;The Communist party and the Chinese nation are inseparable. Without the Communist party, there is no new China,&apos; she said. The success of &apos;red tourism&apos; reveals one reason for the party&apos;s continued hold on China: the legitimacy the party has as a liberator of the country from invaders, colonial proxies and powers in the mid-20th century.  Equally important is a reputation for efficient management, which explains in part why such extraordinary precautions are being taken to ensure a trouble-free Olympics - despite the bad press they provoke overseas. For months, visas have been restricted, dissidents harassed, activists gagged, normally tolerated critics warned to stay silent and even the most innocent tourists vetted. &apos;If imposing the control of the party on the games means less visitors, so be it,&apos; said one Western diplomat. &apos;As long as the games are without incident, anything is acceptable.&apos; Few in Yan&apos;an, or elsewhere in China, mention democracy or human rights. Some are too frightened. For others, perhaps conditioned by 60 years of tightly controlled media, such ideas seem alien. &apos;China? Democratic? What a funny idea!&apos; one Yan&apos;an housewife exclaimed. Others repeat the government&apos;s argument that China is too big and unstable for Western-style democracy to work.  Among the scores of people interviewed by The Observer in Yan&apos;an only one, a Christian woman student from the Mongolian minority, expressed a desire for greater democracy because &apos;people would then be more free to practise their religion&apos;. She was quick to add that President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao were the best leaders for 40 years. The party is far from a tiny elite, as some commentators claim. Its official membership is 73 million and growing. Its members range from the powerful technocrats in the upper reaches of government to village chairmen. They include committed socialists, bureaucrats of every variety, quality, honesty and competence and, increasingly, ambitious young networkers.  Yet &apos;socialism&apos; appears as something of a relic in the new China and &apos;communism&apos; an inherited but empty title. Few states have embraced neo-liberal capitalism so quickly, so enthusiastically and so thoroughly. Decades of economic growth appear to vindicate the choices made by party leaders in the early 1980s and during a second wave of economic restructuring a decade later. Alongside the legitimacy conferred by their forebears (the famines and brutality of the Mao era are carefully obscured) and the loyalty resulting from decades of social engineering, is the party&apos;s trump card: economic development. And in Yan&apos;an, though perhaps less spectacularly than in Shanghai, the new wealth is very evident. Outside a small rustic restaurant a new Jaguar belonging to businessman Wang Cheng, 45, is parked. &apos;It cost me 1.5m yuan (\u00a3120,000),&apos; he said, tucking into a meal of pork intestines and chilli. &apos;I have one philosophy in life: a man&apos;s worth is his wealth, his value is his riches.&apos; Wang, a property developer, hotelier and son of a government clerk and a farmer, is not a party member. &apos;That does not mean I am not a patriot,&apos; he insists. At the university, staff are proud that the car park is full. &apos;Now we have more than 80 cars for 270 staff. Ten years ago there were none,&apos; said one lecturer. Even menial labourers living 18 to a filthy &apos;cave&apos; house on the slopes around Yan&apos;an insisted that life was &apos;much better&apos; - though they complained about rising prices, the cost of healthcare and school fees. And a 61-year-old woman who earns \u00a31 each evening from collecting plastic bottles for recycling said that life was easier, at least compared to the grim days of famine and political brutality of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976.  Drive off the new motorway running down the fertile valley and on to the rutted road that leads east from Yan&apos;an into the hills and, for 120 miles, the landscape does not vary: wooded hills fissured by erosion; small ponds staked with fish nets; terraced fields sparsely planted with wheat; and villages, a hundred identical dusty clusters of brick, concrete, peeling paint, fading slogans and chickens. On the final ridge before the Yellow river gorge, Wang Zhi Hong, 44, is tending his apple trees. Wang&apos;s village, Zaho, is a long way from the sparkling image of the new China that the government hopes to showcase during the Olympics. Wang admits that, like most of his neighbours, he eats meat only about a dozen times a year. Jars beside his earth-and-brick house collect rain from the roof for drinking and washing. Though some villages have mains water, Zaho&apos;s 280 inhabitants cannot find the 300 yuan (\u00a324) for each connection. Most young people have gone to work in the cities. The daughters of Wang Cui, 51, are in Beijing. &apos;What do you expect?&apos; she asks. &apos;This place has not changed for 30 years.&apos; Even the new house she has built with cash sent by her children brings worries. &apos;Now all our poor relatives want to borrow money,&apos; she says.  But however much Zaho&apos;s villagers complain - about poor healthcare, the distant school, corruption and partisan local officials - they remain loyal &apos;to the great project of building a new China&apos;, as described in the slogans painted on their walls a year or so ago. They are grateful for recent tax cuts for farmers and proud that their country is hosting the Olympics. There is only a trace of nostalgia. &apos;In the old days, 30 years ago,&apos; says Wang. &apos;Everyone was poor and life was tough ... but at least we were all equal.&apos;  Down in the gorge that funnels the Yellow river through the mountains on its way to the plains and the sea, a crowd of tourists - all Chinese - take photographs. The games, the Chinese authoritarian model, the Western statements on Tibet, their country&apos;s economic success, all combine in an outpouring of identity and emotion, of pride in their nation, &apos;their&apos; Olympics and their government.  There are, of course, threats to the party&apos;s dominant position that could become serious in the decades to come: the global economic factors and local environmental problems could derail the economic growth that so many believe will bring them or their children wealth. It is clear that the &apos;rush for growth&apos; is leading to such profound inequality that stability could be threatened. In one shop in Yan&apos;an, where five pairs of Italian-made shoes, each costing what the staff earn in a month, are sold each day, there were rumblings of discontent. &apos;It does make me angry,&apos; whispered one shop assistant. &apos;The gap between the rich and the poor is getting too big.&apos;  The real trouble for the ruling party may come not from this generation but the one that follows. But that is some time away yet. For now, in Yan&apos;an and the rest of China, the dance into a capitalist future goes on and the Communist party continues to call the tune.

Her image was inscribed on the first post-war atom bomb, tested in 1946 on the atoll that gave its name to the bikini. A poster for her most celebrated movie, the noir classic Gilda, was being put up on a wall in Rome by the hero of the Italian neo-realist film, Bicycle Thieves (1948), when his bike was stolen. In 1994, seven years after her death, Frank Darabont filmed Stephen King&apos;s novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, in which another Hayworth poster is used to cover the entrance to a prison escape; the convicts watch Gilda and cheer when, to her ageing husband&apos;s question, &apos;Gilda, are you decent?&apos;, Hayworth replies: &apos;Me? Decent?&apos; Yet while playing femme fatale roles, Carmen and Salome among them, she was always pure, kind, vulnerable and misunderstood. In the 1947 fantasy she played the goddess Terpsichore in the emblematically named film fantasy Down to Earth - emblematically, because she was constantly brought down and exploited by every man she met. Her first husband, Edward Judson, transformed her from the dark-haired Margarita Cansino (daughter of a celebrated Spanish-born dancer and his American stage partner) into the ravishing red-blond Rita Hayworth. The brutal, manipulative Harry Cohn made her the top star of his Columbia studio. Orson Welles, her second husband, sought to restore his fortunes by directing her in the misogynistic The Lady from Shanghai (1947). Millionaire playboy Aly Khan made her his trophy wife, took her away from the cinema for four years and left her penniless. The singer Dick Haymes, her fourth husband, thought she&apos;d revive his career and protect him from deportation to Argentina. After 30 movies, mostly B-pictures, she became a minor star in Howard Hawks&apos;s classic Only Angels Have Wings (1940), then a major star a year later in Mamoulian&apos;s Blood and Sand, where she proved a gift to Technicolor as the Spanish socialite who leads matador Tyrone Power astray. She gained a reputation in Hollywood for her hard work, dedication and lack of false pride while working in two musicals with Fred Astaire (who thought her a better dancing partner than her cousin, Ginger Rogers) and Gene Kelly, who appeared with her in the seminal Cover Girl (1944). Gilda (1946) was the high point of her career and she attempted to reprise it with the merely passable Affair in Trinidad, which reunited her with Glenn Ford, when she returned to Hollywood after her divorce from Khan. She appeared in a couple of decent pictures thereafter - as Burt Lancaster&apos;s ex-wife in Separate Tables, and as another innocent temptress, playing opposite an ailing Gary Cooper in Robert Rossen&apos;s underrated They Came to Cordura (1959). But her career tragically petered out with poor movies and finally Alzheimer&apos;s, initially and tragically misdiagnosed as alcoholism.

Hospitality industry insiders report that several large hotels are running at anything from 50-70% occupancy while some smaller places are struggling to book more than 50% of their rooms. Even the state newspaper Shanghai Daily reported that the appetite for Olympic trips was considerably lower than expected. Zhang Lei, a spokesman with the Shanghai-based Spring International Travel Service, told the paper that its special packages had met &quot;a slack response&quot;, with only 1,000 customers taking up the offers - around half the number expected. Yin Jun, manager of the Jiangsu provincial branch of China Travel Service, blamed the prices of accommodation and tourist buses, saying the cost of packages had tripled to above 6,000 yuan (\u00a3440). Officials have forecast that about half a million foreign visitors, and an even greater number of domestic travellers, will come to the city for the games. But asked if tourist numbers were lower than expected, an official at the Beijing Tourism Bureau declined to comment yesterday. &quot;The government will not talk about anything negative,&quot; said the man, who gave his name only as Mr Song. &quot;If the matter was something positive, then maybe we could talk about it more.&quot; At the higher end, many four- and five-star hotels are booked out for the games.

On one side of the village, the slope slips away to a wooded valley. On the other, the haphazard apple orchards stretch down to a river, swollen after recent sharp and heavy rains. In either direction the horizon is a mass of similar hills, valleys and apple trees. But this is no rural idyll. The river leads to an oil refinery and a vast new chemical factory. It is the latter that has brought the road - and its trucks coughing exhaust fumes into the heavy, humid air 24 hours a day. They pass a few metres from the doors of the house of Dong Pang&apos;s parents-in-law. Dong Pang, in his neat trousers and clean shirt, stands out among the farmers of the village. He is visiting his wife&apos;s former home and is quick to point out that he now lives in the city of Xi&apos;an in an apartment and works as a paediatrician. He sits gingerly on the edge of the single bed in the one-roomed home, a vaulted single chamber with patchy electricity and sanitation which, built half into the hillside, is known as a &quot;cavehouse&quot;.  &quot;I like to come back and visit the simple people of the countryside,&quot; he says. His wife sits quietly on a thin plastic mat stretched over the surface of the brick and plaster platform that serves as a bed. An iron stove is built into it, a traditional way of combining cooking and heating. There is little else in the house \u2013 an old television, two carved wooden chairs and two large and garish posters. One is of a large and very chubby baby, the other of an array of plastic fruit and bottles of European brandy. Dong Pang&apos;s wife turns away and holds a small child to her breast. A small cat crosses the vegetable garden outside the house and stretches in the evening sun.  The villagers of Xin Cun are very happy with their new road, Dong Pang&apos;s in-laws say when they come back from the fields. Now they can take their apples to local markets rather than wait for the buyers to come to them. As a result they get three times as much for their produce \u2013 60,000 yuan (\u00a34,500) annually - and this year their entire crop is being bought up by the government. &quot;Something to do with the Olympics,&quot; they add.  A hundred miles north and east of Xin Cun is another village, Zaho. Here, too, ranks of ridged hills stretch away to the horizon and the slopes of sandy soil are terraced into thin orchards curling along the contour lines. And here, too, a road is coming. The village lies at the end of a 100 mile stretch of bitumen currently being rammed through the gorges and the hills. With its dozens of bridges, its cuttings, its scores of bulldozers and hundreds of workers, the road would be a major national engineering feet almost anywhere in the world \u2013 except in China where it is the equivalent of a bypass extension in rural Wales. Zaho used to be a tobacco village. &quot;Conditions were very tough,&quot; says Wang Zhi Hong, the 44-year-old local village head. &quot;We used donkey carts to bring the water up for irrigation.&quot; But tobacco earned just 500 yuan a month - \u00a337 - so they also turned to apples. Zaho is still dirt poor \u2013 most villagers eat meat merely on festivals a dozen times a year - but much more money is coming in.  New water mains run to the village fields and, though Zaho&apos;s 280 inhabitants are too poor to pay the fee to have their homes connected, pipes now irrigate the fields. Those fields are an increasingly rare commodity. Desertification, reforestation schemes, urbanisation, road-building and a host of other factors has resulted in a shortage of farmland in China. From the 120m hectares that remain \u2013 seen as a crucial national security asset - somewhere between 500,000 and 1m hectares are lost each year. As China gets richer food demands are changing. Many outside the country fear that the new appetites and the new wealth of 1.3 billion people, whether in Zaho or in Shanghai, will drive up global food prices. In fact, some economists argue, the situation is more complicated and the impact of emerging economies on the world&apos;s food prices is exaggerated. Firstly, they say, studies have shown that it is not the amount of food that is changing but the type. The Chinese now want more higher-quality products, more processed food, more meat and more dairy products - but not simply more food. The country remains more or less, self-sufficient and is likely to be so for the next decade. So the apples produced in Zaho and Xin Cun go some way to off-setting a big deficit in oil seeds, for example. Even the new appetite for dairy products may well be satisfied by increased internal production.  Yet, for anyone used to travelling in India or Indonesia, it is not the absence of land but the absence of the crowds, of people or of livestock, in China that is striking. Wang Zhi Hong himself has had four children \u2013 a flagrant breach of the country&apos;s one-child policy that has resulted in a series of onerous fines \u2013 who have all left the village to work in local towns or faraway cities. What is needed, the economists say, is to increase the productivity of the 320 million people, 43% of the active population, who work the land. But no one is sure if the Chinese government want to sacrifice their self-sufficiency in low-yield grain to risk higher-value crops whose price is heavily determined by international commodity markets.  Behind the doors of their mud-and-brick homes, the people of Zaho refer obliquely to the problems so common in the countryside everywhere in the emerging world: corrupt or self-seeking officials, brutal police, avaricious relatives, poor schools and worse medical care. &quot;I&apos;m a member of the Communist party but that doesn&apos;t help much round here,&quot; said Wang ruefully. Some talk about the famines and random violence of the years of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution or even the widespread starvation of the earlier Great Leap Forward. Those days were safer, surer, more equal, even if people were poorer, they say. Then they pause, reflect, and return to praising the new road and the price of apples. As elsewhere in China, slogans are painted on walls. &quot;Rule of law keeps the village well-run,&quot; the side of one Zaho farm reads. The road back to the nearest city is lined with more injunctions. &quot;Oil and coal strengthens the country&quot;, &quot;Openness is the driving force&quot; and &quot;Fruit and vegetables make us rich&quot;.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-17T23:08:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/jul/18/tenthingsivelearntaboutch", "sentences": ["Yes, the Shanghai skyline is impressive but it obscures not just fairly well-reported deep poverty - there are still millions of people who do not eat meat regularly - but a broader level of development that is still very rough round the edges."], "title": "Ten things I've learnt about China", "article": "My previous experience of China was an unrepresentative month in the mountains along its border with Pakistan 10 years ago. I returned recently for another month, criss-crossing the country, and carrying out scores of interviews with all kinds of people. The combination of the Olympics and the aftermath of the earthquake may have meant that I was there at an unrepresentative time, and such a short visit to such a vast country - the language of which you cannot even read - is only enough to teach you what you have yet to learn. That said, here are some initial thoughts. 1. China is not half way to being a developed economy and country, but it is a few decades away from being a poor one. This is not just a semantic difference. Yes, the Shanghai skyline is impressive but it obscures not just fairly well-reported deep poverty - there are still millions of people who do not eat meat regularly - but a broader level of development that is still very rough round the edges. A small but telling detail: urban cartography is still in its infancy.  2. China is not communist - except for the political system. This may seem a bizarre statement but the apparatus of a one-party repressive state sits uneasily on a mass of go-getting, neo-liberal materialist individualism. &quot;My philosophy is that a man&apos;s worth is his wealth,&quot; one hotelier in the Shaanxi town of Yan&apos;an told me. Such values appear far from rare. And in terms of social security, subsidies and collective efforts, many western European countries seem positively socialist in comparison. 3. In China there is a general confidence in the future that does not exist in Europe or the USA. Hundreds of millions of people are convinced that life is better for them than for their parents and will be better still for their children. This confidence underpins their very lucid view of the Chinese position in the world - as one of the globe&apos;s paramount nations/civilisations that has lost ground over a couple of centuries for a variety of internal and external factors and is now back on the road to regaining its rightful place as a superpower. 4. Democracy is unlikely to break out soon. The focus of western media on political dissidents disguises their minority status within China. &quot;Democracy&quot; is often seen as &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;un-Chinese&quot;. The bottom line, as one Beijing intellectual said ruefully is &quot;why change a winning team&quot;. Frustration and anger is directed at low-level officials - particularly those who are corrupt or incompetent - but not the system as a whole. &quot;If there was an election tomorrow, the party would probably win,&quot; the intellectual commented. 5. This could change if economic growth is derailed by economic disaster, a lack of resources (including water) and/or some kind of radical external shock. However, in the next couple of decades, it would seem hard to foresee any major threat to the hegemony of the Communist party of China. 6. That said, the extraordinary disparity in incomes may become a serious threat to stability. When you have shop assistants who sell fairly banal shoes that cost their entire month&apos;s salary to local white-collar workers - to say nothing of the expensive sports cars parked in front of the vegetable sellers stores or the migrant labourers working on the new luxury brand shops - a massive forward economic momentum is necessary to keep the social balance. If growth slows, then - as with one of the bicycles overloaded with produce that one sees in provincial towns - a spill could become inevitable. 7. Despite the confidence and the nationalist rhetoric, there is also profound uncertainty. The shrill reaction to any external criticism, and the tendency to sulk or to bully seem evidence of some significant self-doubt. In social terms, many people have grown up in a society that has changed so radically that the example and the values of their parents are simply no longer relevant. The best-selling authors for China&apos;s &quot;Generation Z&quot; are often very young and their subject matter very dark. This lack of norms makes for enormous openness and vigour and energy but also a tendency to the extremes: of hedonism, of materialism, of nationalism. 8. You are free to say more or less what you want in a private individual capacity - though few would risk going too far - but to communicate your views in any way or seek out others who share them is extremely dangerous. The monopoly that ensures the continued power of the Communist party is not merely that of coercive violence or of the dissemination of information but on the ability to organise. Any physical or virtual attempt to join people up, to build links risks draconian punishment. The Communist party is the nation&apos;s &quot;network of networks&quot;. Any potential threats to its dominant position are thus brutally cut down. 9. The massive economic expansion of the last 30 years has been based largely on the building of the hardware of a developed modern nation. But when all the roads, the railways, the airports and the bridges have been built, the programme of national construction will have to make something else: creative, intellectually agile, freethinking individuals able to cope with a chaotic, plural 21st century world. China&apos;s pragmatic, open-minded ability to take ideas from anywhere, study them, learn from them and apply them is impressive. But, though the Chinese one-party model may be supremely effective at getting railways built it, is less certain that rule by a middle-aged male engineers can provide the mental equipment that will be needed to continue to grow once the hardware has been built.  10. China is big. This is a very obvious statement. But it is only when you drive along a 200 mile road across hills and deep gorges that is being widened and straightened along its entire length and is not even the most important infrastructure project of the far-flung province where it is found, or when you arrive in what you expected to be a small rural town and find its population is in fact five million, that it sinks home. That the nation&apos;s collective ambitions rival their new railways stations or ports in scale, should surprise nobody.", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-18T10:45:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/18/news.seanmichaels2", "sentences": ["Tibet!&quot; at a concert in Shanghai earlier this year, she might as well have been shouting &quot;O Chinese government - crack down on foreign artists!&quot; Though the state&apos;s initial response was just to rebuke the Icelandic singer, they have now implemented new policies to guard against musicians who &quot;threaten natural unity&quot;."], "title": "China to screen setlists for anti-government songs", "article": "When Bj\u00f6rk yelled &quot;Tibet!

Miners, however, missed out as metal prices dropped due to rising stock and fears of slowing demand in China, where official figures this week showed a decline in GDP growth from 10.6% in the first half of 2007 to 10.4% this year.

Delong retains a substantial holding in Cape Lambert with rights to 40m shares (8% on a fully diluted basis). The holdings give Evraz significant influence over the company with the potential to disrupt the current MCC transaction, which is scheduled for shareholder approval on July 28. &quot;We view the share as a speculative buy pending further information on the intentions of Evraz, as the shares could go to 45p and beyond if a counter bidding scenario unfolds.&quot; Still on the speculative tack, Coffeeheaven, which operates coffee bars in central Europe, added 2.5p to 41.25p on talk that a long-awaited bid could emerge next week. Meanwhile security technology group Detica jumped 22p to 303p after revealing a bid approach. Traders talked of a possible offer of around 380p a share. Hiring as well as firing Supplying graduate trainees to investment banks would seem a thankless task in a credit crunch. And, indeed, shares in the Aim-listed education group ILX slumped last month when it warned of challenging times ahead, despite maintaining that it was well placed to cope. Yesterday, at its annual meeting, ILX revealed that first-quarter revenues had risen 22%, and bookings for graduates were in line with last year, suggesting that its clients have not cut back dramatically on graduate recruitment after all.

To the surprise of pundits, the O2, sponsored by the mobile phone company of the same name at an annual cost of \u00a36m, has become the most popular venue in the world for live music. In the first six months of this year, ticket sales were at 853,000, 30 per cent better than runner-up, the Manchester Evening News Arena (576,171), and well ahead of Wembley (247,159) in London and Madison Square Garden (312,896) in New York. &apos;I often work an eight-day week, or so it feels,&apos; says Campbell. &apos;A lot of the music is at weekends, so there isn&apos;t much time to flop around at home.&apos;  Still, his four children, twins aged four, a nine-year-old and a 12-year-old, have variously come to the O2 to see Led Zeppelin, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Prince, the Rolling Stones and the Eagles. Perks to die for, but perhaps more for a middle-aged man than pre-teens? Campbell smiles and takes another gulp of his cafe latte at Starbucks, where we meet, near the entrance of the 20,000-seater arena. Starbucks is one of several dozen shops, cafes and restaurants that make the O2 appear like a mini-version of nearby Canary Wharf. &apos;This a world-class city, so you have got to have world-class acts,&apos; he says.  Suddenly, he is on his feet and beckoning me to a map on a pillar, where he points to an area pencilled in for the next phase of the \u00a3700m development that has been bankrolled by Philip Anschutz, the mogul behind AEG, the US sports and entertainment group that has owned the centre since 2005. Nothing is finalised, but Campbell envisages a new hotel complex, possibly involving Marriott, a theatre that could feature the world-famous circus troupe Cirque du Soleil, and more bars and restaurants. In September, the O2 will launch a new nightclub, build on several attractions, including the Tutankhamun exhibition, and open a Vue cinema with 11 screens. But there will be no super-casino, as originally envisaged, after the government ditched its plans. Campbell fumbles in his pocket for a print-out of upcoming live music: Kylie Minogue, Stevie Wonder, Lee Evans, Coldplay and James Blunt. Impressive, or what? But does the O2 make money? &apos;AEG is a private company and we don&apos;t break out the figures. We cover our operating expenses, including interest payments. The debt is a different matter.&apos; To be fair, the O2 is a work in progress. The initial investment was \u00a3350m in 2005/7, &apos;when we gutted the place. Apart from the tent, everything else is new.&apos; The same sum will be spent again by the time the next phase is completed, theoretically in time for the Olympic Games in 2012, when the arena will host basketball and gymnastics. Campbell, 49, keeps an eye on negotiations with world-class promoters such as Harvey Goldsmith. These days people tend to come to him, but the centre has been helped in attracting heavyweight artists by AEG, one of the biggest event-promotion companies in the world. The O2&apos;s income is generated via a rental charge - which varies, depending on the artist - and from taking a proportion of ticket sales, which also varies with each performer.  Ticket prices are a delicate issue: &apos;We don&apos;t want &quot;price&quot; to be the selling point, but nor do we want to be elitist. The key is to offer value for money. People should go home feeling that they have had a good night out, without feeling ripped off.&apos; Campbell has come a long way from his roots in Kelvinside, Glasgow where he was born in 1959 to middle-class parents: his father worked as a purchasing manager for an engineering business, his mother was a social worker. In his teens, he got the American bug and took an MBA at Washington University, specialising in marketing. From there, he joined General Mills and then Pepsi. In Britain, he worked for Richard Branson&apos;s Virgin group and played a key role in setting up Ginger Media Group with Chris Evans in 1997. He later moved to the Ministry of Sound, the global dance music brand, a job that was to stand him in good stead when he was appointed chief executive of the O2 in 2005.  He caught the attention of AEG after a four-year stint working for former London mayor Ken Livingstone, helping to set up the Visit London initiative, where he delivered the first boost to tourism in the capital for 10 years. &apos;AEG spotted a gap in the market,&apos; he says. &apos;London was crying out for a new state-of-the-art, large music venue and AEG had the balls and foresight to see the opportunities that the Dome offered. Don&apos;t forget that at the time, it was lying empty and it was viewed, rightly or wrongly, as a white elephant, a disaster.&apos; Sound at the O2 is key, with lambs&apos; wool stuffed into the complex&apos;s walls to help the acoustics. Even the seats have sound-proofing built into the upholstery. He says the same is true of the smaller and increasingly popular IndigO2 theatre, which can seat 2,000. But some complain that the sound isn&apos;t good enough.  What&apos;s next? &apos;Diversity: upcoming events include a Bollywood extravaganza and a new classical series. We are also becoming a major sporting venue - ATP Masters tennis is coming in 2009, when it moves from Shanghai.&apos; Of course, everything has to be signed off by AEG, which has an empire including David Beckham&apos;s LA Galaxy Football team and the LA Kings ice-hockey franchise. &apos;AEG does a lot of homework before investing, but you wouldn&apos;t expect anything less, would you?&apos; says Campbell.

She was born in Beijing in 1923 on the 12th day of the sixth month according to the lunar calendar. However, to make her seem younger, 1924 was put down on her registration papers at Beijing Theatre school, and she retained this as her birth year in all her official papers. Her family, descended from Manchu nobility, had fallen into poverty. She was 10 when her mother sent her to the school. It was lonely, but she would be fed while she learned a profession. She changed her surname from Jiao to Li, her mother&apos;s maiden name, in order not to affect her family&apos;s reputation. In the past, all female roles had been played by men, and Beijing Theatre school was the first co-educational training institution. Her tutors for the dan (young female) roles she studied were male performers. She worked hard, learning plays by heart in the traditional way, and doing the arduous physical exercises that were part of the training. After six months, she was given a small role, but was booed by the audience when she failed to reach the high notes. For some years, she was given only walk-on parts. Then before a scheduled performance, both the leading student-actresses lost their voices. Still only 14, Li took the major role and received rapturous applause. From that moment on her success was assured. When she graduated, Li organised her own troupe with some classmates and they enjoyed a successful run in Shanghai. However, the 17-year-old soon found the pressure unbearable and disbanded her troupe. She worked under the protection of various male stars and was a private disciple of Mei Lanfang and other male masters of the dan role who had responded positively to the arrival of women performers. She became a great star, particularly known for her roles in The Dragon and the Phoenix, The Courtyard of the Black Dragon, Two Phoenixes Flying Together, and Three Pretty Women. She gave birth to two daughters, Li Li in 1944 and Li Ruru in 1952. When the People&apos;s Republic was founded in 1949, Beijing Opera was seen as a popular art form but in need of reform. Plays were banned for reasons such as &quot;too much violence&quot;, &quot;sexual suggestiveness&quot;, &quot;reactionary politics&quot; and even &quot;no ideological significance&quot;. With a relatively &quot;clean&quot; personal history, Li was considered suitable material for a &quot;people&apos;s artist&quot;. She herself was hopeful about the new regime that had brought peace and stability and, like other actors, she was delighted that they would now be respected as equal citizens. In the course of &quot;re-education&quot;, she made self-criticisms of her &quot;crimes&quot; - the bourgeois thought and individualism demonstrated in striving for fame; the make-up and fashionable clothes reflecting her bourgeois life style; and the counter-revolutionary romances and ghost plays she had performed. Although much of the repertoire disappeared, she performed plays such as The Drunken Imperial Concubine, The Xin&apos;an Inn, The Pavilion of Red Plum Blossom, and Imperial Concubine Mei. She toured the Soviet Union and Europe several times, and gave Beijing Opera performances in Britain in 1958 and 1979. All this came to an end with the cultural revolution in 1966. Li was incarcerated in an &quot;oxpen&quot; (a room used as an ad hoc prison) and separated from her daughters who were sent to work in the countryside. When she was released in the early 1970s the theatre had become a duller place; only the model works produced under the supervision of Mao&apos;s wife Jiang Qing could be staged. Curiously however, as these were all mutations of Beijing Opera, Li and her colleagues were now needed again. Mao&apos;s death in 1976 brought transformations. Li could once more perform the roles she had made famous. Her favourite play was The Drunken Imperial Concubine, which she first appeared in aged 11. She performed it for the last time when she was 70. She regarded passing on her art as important and was generous in her help to younger performers. She taught many students, offering master classes and giving seminars in various theatre institutions. Her marriage, in December 1979, to Cao Yu, one of China&apos;s greatest dramatists, led her to take up writing. She published a play in 1984, while a novel that appeared in 1993 was made into a 25-episode television serial and reprinted in 2008. Her research on the performing art of Beijing Opera has recently been published in Shanghai in a collection edited by her daughter. Beijing Opera was a living tradition. Not only the arias, but the techniques, movements, symbolism and make-up were all passed down from one player to another. Looking back on her life, Li lamented that so many plays with their specific acting skills had been lost in the hands of her generation. What, she asked, would she say to her predecessors when she saw them in the other world? The answer should surely be that through her teaching she was also able to pass on to future generations much that would otherwise have been lost.

St George Wharf, London Something magical happens when dictators and architects fall in love. The offspring, these days, is usually triangular. Dictators understand the power of architecture. Saddam Hussein was an enthusiastic patron, and particular fan of marble. Hitler&apos;s favourite was the architect Albert Speer. Norman Foster recently built the Orwellian-sounding (and very triangular) Palace of Peace and Reconciliation for the dodgy regime in Kazakhstan. Take a look. Remind you of the all-seeing eye much? Architects, left to themselves, mostly produce wonderful buildings with one eye on the sensibilities of the man on the street. Give them a tyrannical patron, and all sense of proportion - the human scale - vanishes. Just look what the North Koreans built: the Ryugyong Hotel. &quot;The more centralized the power, the less compromises need to be made in architecture,&quot; said Peter Eisenman when asked why architects like working for dictators. Let&apos;s hear it for compromise and decentralisation, then. The main aesthetic crime committed by the Ryugyong Hotel - as by most dictators&apos; commissions - is its sheer monumentality: it&apos;s just so unnecessarily huge. Such colossal buildings seem to crush the human spirit, and do so knowingly. Then again, only an oversized ego builds oversized buildings - as if trying to reduce everything else to the significance of an ant farm. In architecture, ugliness and contempt are synonyms. This is a building that clearly hates people. Is it the world&apos;s ugliest building? It&apos;ll make most lists - but there&apos;s a lot of competition. For my money, the world&apos;s five worst have got to be: 1. House of the Republic (now Palace of the Parliament), Bucharest Nicolae Ceaucescu&apos;s monumental folly still holds world records for the largest civilian administrative building, most expensive administrative building, and heaviest building in the world. Constructing it required demolishing much of Bucharest&apos;s historic district, including 19 Orthodox Christian churches, six Jewish synagogues, three Protestant churches, and 30,000 residences. It&apos;s still unfinished. 2. Buckingham Palace, London Home to the second-longest lasting unelected head of state in the world, let&apos;s face it, it&apos;s monolithic and could have been built by Stalin. Nash no doubt did his best to beautify a pig, but a pig it remains. 3. Ryerson University Library, Toronto Proving that democracy can also be brutal (just ask the Iraqis), this 11-storey tower looks more like a second world war fortification than a temple of learning. The sort of place you wouldn&apos;t want to be late returning books to. 4. Any McDonald&apos;s drive-thru, anywhere They are to architecture what the Happy Meal is to nutrition. And they&apos;re always the same. Everywhere. Around the world. No matter where they&apos;ve plonked them. Vernacular? What&apos;s that? 5.

By 1902 he was earning enough money as a freelance journalist and short story writer to leave. His first novel, The Pothunters, was published in the same year. Did you know? &apos;PG&apos; stood for Pelham Grenville. Wodehouse called it a &quot;frightful label&quot;, and his garbled childhood pronunciation, &apos;Plum&apos;, became his affectionate nickname for the rest of his life. Critical verdict By the 1930s Wodehouse had gone from being a prolific contributor to newspapers and magazines to the foremost comic novelist writing in English. His creations, in particular the quixotic aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his sober valet, Jeeves, and the dreamy, pig-obsessed Earl of Emsworth, rapidly gained a place in the popular consciousness, and the books of their adventures sold by the millions worldwide. Wodehouse also wrote countless song lyrics, and is credited with being one of the fathers of the American musical. His fortunes were to change in 1940, however, when he was captured by German forces in occupied France and agreed to broadcast a series of talks on German radio. Wodehouse was in fact being manipulated by the Nazi propaganda machine, and these light-hearted broadcasts provoked a vicious reaction from politicians and journalists in Britain. Confused and embarrassed by accusations of treason, Wodehouse went back to America and continued to write, but his reputation took a long time to recover and he never returned to his native country. A knighthood just before his death in 1975 went some way towards an official apology, however, and the popularity of the work itself never really went into eclipse. Today Wodehouse is as loved as ever, and his vivid prose style and unique comic invention are recognised as major contributions to English fiction. Recommended works Wodehouse published over a hundred books, most of which are still in print. Among the best Jeeves and Wooster novels and collections are The Code of the Woosters and Joy in the Morning, while the finest Emsworth books include Summer Lightning and Heavy Weather. Two early novels worth exploring are Mike and Psmith in the City, while Ukridge and Uncle Fred in the Springtime features another of Wodehouse&apos;s best-loved characters, Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge (pronounced Fanshawe Ewkridge). For an airbrushed but nonetheless fascinating glimpse of the man himself see the autobiographical Performing Flea and Over Seventy. Influences Wodehouse liked to sprinkle references to classic authors throughout his work, and particularly enjoyed deploying his own uniquely garbled quotations from Shakespeare. Dickens, Kipling and Jerome K Jerome also appear to have shaped his writing, as did the operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan. Now read on George Orwell&apos;s essay, &apos;In Defence of PG Wodehouse&apos;, is one of the earliest accounts of the novels, and also offers a level-headed assessment of the war broadcasts. Broadway, Jeeves? follows the ill-fated New York production of Alan Ayckbourn and Andrew Lloyd-Webber&apos;s musical By Jeeves! in 2001, as told by the actor Martin Jarvis. Adaptations The Jeeves and Wooster stories were adapted by the BBC in the 1960s, with Ian Carmichael as Bertie and Dennis Price as Jeeves, and by Granada in the 1990s, with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. Plum&apos;s War, a play by Michael Butt transmitted by Radio 4 in 1999, dramatised the recording of the Berlin broadcasts, and starred Benjamin Whitrow as Wodehouse. Recommended biography Wodehouse: A Life by Robert McCrum (2004) is a masterly study of Wodehouse&apos;s achievement, and includes a scrupulous and clear-eyed examination of the wartime scandal which dispenses with much of the accumulated hyperbole. Wodehouse emerges as political innocent who was guilty only of errors of judgement, and whose determination to write on in the face of adversity provided his final vindication.

Recommended works Empire of the Sun is a fascinating child&apos;s-eye war novel; his short stories combine existentialism and science fiction. 2000&apos;s Super-Cannes saw Ballard at the peak of his powers: a mature detective story and techno-dystopia in a workaholic business park where residents let off steam with a little light psychopathy. Influences Science fiction and William Burroughs&apos; probing into the mechanical possibilities of the human body are obvious influences (Naked Lunch was &quot;a grenade tossed into the sherry party of English fiction&quot;); his interest in temporal dislocation also echoes JB Priestley&apos;s time-slides.

The myth of Kafka&apos;s life so overshadows what he wrote that millions who have never read a word of his know, or think they know, something about the middle-European Nostradamus, almost unknown in his own lifetime, trapped in a dead-end job, whose mysterious, endlessly interpretable works somehow foresaw the Holocaust (and so on). In 1982 I was allowed, as a mere undergraduate, to touch the original manuscript of The Castle. Throughout the 10 years I spent doing a PhD on Kafka, I was haunted by the memory of that simple historical artefact and by the vague but growing conviction that there is something rotten in the state of the Kafka industry.  While writing my book Excavating Kafka I came across unpublished material so striking as to suggest that the myth needs completely demolishing. If the mere prospect of a few new letters throwing light on his relationship with Max Brod is enough to send scholars all over the world into raptures, why has no one has ever thought fit to show Kafka&apos;s readers and students the pornography he owned?  There is a footnote in Brod&apos;s first biography of Kafka, which would have enabled anyone to find this material 85 years ago. His letters to Brod reveal, to those with eyes to see, exactly where he kept the porn - in a locked bookcase in his parents&apos; house (an image that sets off echoes throughout his work). The mystery is why it has remained such a secret. The underlying reason is, I suspect, that admitting to Kafka&apos;s porn also unlocks the truth about his whole literary life.  The man who delivered porn to Kafka in 1906-07 turns out to be the same man who first published him in 1908 - and who, as judge of Berlin&apos;s major literary prize, fixed things so that Kafka would get the glory. It seems the Kafka industry doesn&apos;t want to know such things about its idol - which means, academics being the gatekeepers of the artefacts, that they don&apos;t want you, the reader, to know.  Once we realise this, the light of historical reality floods in through the holes in the hagiographic myth. We find a millionaire&apos;s son addicted to whores all his adult life; a writer backed by an influential clique who was admired (and knew it) by almost every major German-language fellow-author of his day; a loyal Habsburg citizen with a senior state-sector job who expected (and wanted) the German and Austrian empires to win the first world war, right to the end; a man who had no more inkling of the Holocaust than anyone else.  With the rubble cleared away, perhaps we&apos;ll at last see Kafka&apos;s work for what it really is - not the gloomy stuff we Anglo-Saxons received via post-Auschwitz French existentialists, but wonderful black comedies written by a man soaked in the writings of his predecessors and of his own day.James Hawes \u00b7 Last week&apos;s Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing festival at Harrogate is not only the biggest festival of its kind in Europe, it is also the most convivial of all literary festivals - with authors and readers mixing happily, especially in the bar. Hotly debated topics, both on and off stage, included why women get so much flak for writing violent books (answer: prejudice), why people are sniffy about &quot;cosy crime&quot; (same reason - as Catriona McPherson, author of gentle 1920s mysteries put it: &quot;All that these hard men are doing is sitting in a chair typing, just like me, you know&quot;), and whether Andy McNab would be interviewed wearing a balaclava (he didn&apos;t, although, for security reasons, he cannot allow himself to be photographed). Stef Penney (right), the only woman on the shortlist for the prize for best crime novel, proved a worthy and popular winner for her first novel, The Tenderness of Wolves Quercus). She won \u00a33,000 and a hand-made beer cask.Laura Wilson \u00b7 Which author has, over a 50-year career, been described as &quot;beyond psychiatric help&quot;, seen his work banned, refused a CBE, spawned his own adjective and been immortalised on a stamp? If you guessed right, you&apos;ll be able to say with the aficionados gathered in Barcelona this week: &quot;Soy ballardiano.&quot; &quot;Autopsy of the New Millennium&quot; is a four-month exhibition dedicated to the work of JG Ballard, conducted in Spanish, Catalan and English at the Centre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de Barcelona (see www.cccb.org). That it should appear in a city better known for Gaud\u00ed and scooters than sliproads and suburbia is a sign of Ballard&apos;s growing international stature. As well as long-lost films and interviews, the curators have assembled an exhaustive array of Ballardiana, from his cut-up texts and provocative fake adverts to the short story &quot;Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan&quot; in the shape of a political pamphlet distributed at the Republican convention, and a damning review of Ballard&apos;s 1970 art installation of crashed cars by the woman hired to provide scantily clad decoration at its launch. Other perspectives are provided by an internee&apos;s incongruously gentle watercolours of the Shanghai camp, and video and photos by artists who identify themselves as Ballardian. The exhibition was launched to the strains of Ballardian music - Klaxons, Robert Foxx - and there was much talk of the Ballardian gaze, described as a set of reading glasses which can throw the inner workings of reality into focus or merely show a blur. &quot;It&apos;s like Christian grace,&quot; says Josep Ramoneda, the CCCB director. &quot;You either have it or you don&apos;t.&quot; Justine Jordan \u00b7 Second-guessing the Man Booker judges&apos; longlist choices ahead of Tuesday&apos;s announcement has taken off this year, on both the prize&apos;s own site and Picador&apos;s blog - where \u00a350-worth of Picador books are on offer to the person with &quot;most correct guesses&quot;.

Chinese officials dismissed video statements by spokesmen claiming to represent the little-known Turkestan Islamic Party, who warned that they would attack next month&apos;s Games and said they were to blame for the previous blasts. A US terrorism-monitoring firm published a transcript of their video.  The Chinese authorities have repeatedly alleged that extremists from the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang - known as East Turkestan by separatists among the Uighur Muslim population - were targeting the Olympics. Officials have blamed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and, more recently, Hizb ut-Tahrir for plots. The AFP news agency quoted intelligence analysts Stratfor as saying the Turkestan Islamic Party was another name for ETIM.  During the last fortnight alone, Chinese officials claimed they had cracked a plot to attack a football venue in Shanghai and had broken up 12 terrorist cells in Xinjiang. In addition to stationing a 100,000-strong anti-terrorist force in Beijing, a security drive has been launched in Xinjiang.  Last week explosives detectors were said to have been installed at airports in Xinjiang, and there were reports that two Muslims convicted of terrorism had been executed in Kashgar, while 15 others were jailed.  But the state news agency Xinhua yesterday dismissed the video claims, saying the details of one incident were wrong, that there was no record of a factory explosion in Guangzhou on 17 July, and that two bus explosions were not linked to terrorism. The group claimed to have used a tractor laden with explosives to target police in the city of Wenzhou on 17 July, killing 17 people. But officials claimed the attack took place two months earlier, no police were involved, and that a disgruntled gambler was to blame. Revenge attacks are relatively common in China.  &apos;Nonsense! The explosion totally had nothing to do with terrorist groups,&apos; said Chen Shichun, head of the Wenzhou municipal public security bureau. Shanghai officials said the bus blast which killed three people in May was unrelated to terrorism. In the Yunnan province, the public security bureau said there was no evidence of a terrorist link to two bus explosions which killed two people on Monday. The monitoring firm IntelCenter has published a transcript of the video and a still showing three masked men, but has not released the video itself. The company could not be contacted yesterday. It quoted the group&apos;s leader, Commander Seyfullah, as saying: &apos;Despite the Turkestan Islamic Party&apos;s repeated warnings to China and international community about stopping the 29th Olympics in Beijing, the Chinese have haughtily ignored our warnings. The Turkestan Islamic Party volunteers who had gone through special preparations have started urgent actions. Our aim is to target the most critical points related to the Olympics. We will try to attack Chinese central cities severely, using the tactics that have never been employed.&apos; He urged spectators and athletes - &apos;particularly the Muslims&apos; - not to attend the Games, adding: &apos;Please do not stand together with the faithless people.&apos;  Earlier this year the Ministry of Public Security said it had disrupted two plots to attack the Olympics. It claimed one group had been planning to kidnap athletes, foreign journalists and other visitors, while a second had been manufacturing explosives and was plotting to attack hotels, government offices and military targets in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities, on the orders of ETIM. In a separate incident, the authorities blamed Uighur separatists for an alleged hijack attempt on a passenger flight.", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-07-26T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/27/olympicgames20083", "sentences": ["When Australia and Serbia start the men&apos;s football tournament of the Beijing Olympics in Shanghai on August 7, Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, and Javier Mascherano will be just some of the global game&apos;s superstars forgetting the World Cup, Champions League and \u00a3150,000-a-week salaries for dreams of gold-medal glory."], "title": "Beijing 2008: Brazil lead the big names vying for Olympic football glory", "article": "When Australia and Serbia start the men&apos;s football tournament of the Beijing Olympics in Shanghai on August 7, Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, and Javier Mascherano will be just some of the global game&apos;s superstars forgetting the World Cup, Champions League and \u00a3150,000-a-week salaries for dreams of gold-medal glory. &apos;It&apos;s a difficult situation,&apos; Mascherano says of players&apos; willingness to upset their clubs, which has moved Werder Bremen to seek a ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport following the decision of their Brazil forward, Diego, to walk out on the Bundesliga club so he can play in Beijing. &apos;But it&apos;s very important for any footballer to win the Olympics.&apos;  The Argentine should know, having helped his country to gold in Athens four years ago. His attitude reflects the growing glamour, prestige and quality of the competition since it became a de facto under-23 World Cup at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics: it draws the greatest spectator numbers of all 28 sports at the Games. While British involvement is usually an impossibility because there is no team - the Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish fear it would threaten the separate status of the four home nations - Britain will compete at the 2012 Olympics. This was inevitable from the moment London won the Games three years ago, although some newspapers claimed last week that this has only just been decided.  Unless the current climate changes, this team will field only English players and, despite Lord Coe, head of the London Games organising committee, recently saying Sir Alex Ferguson was a possible contender to take charge, this is unlikely, not least because the Manchester United manager is a Scot. The team is likely to be led by an English coach who &apos;can get valuable practice at a major tournament with a view to possibly taking over the top job with England&apos; at some point after the Games, says a senior source at the Football Association, who are likely to be the key decision-makers. Brazil, winners of five World Cups, are so desperate for victory in the one major competition they have never claimed that the coach of their senior team is already in place for the Olympics. Dunga, who captained Brazil to the 1994 World Cup, has selected the strongest possible squad, led by Ronaldinho - one of the three permitted overage players. Midfielders Anderson and Lucas Leiva, of Manchester United and Liverpool respectively, will travel, as will Manchester City&apos;s record signing J\u00f4, Milan wunderkind Alexandre Pato and, unless Werder win their appeal, Diego. Real Madrid&apos;s Robinho would have played, too, but for suffering a groin strain.  &apos;We&apos;ll respect the agreement that was made before Ronaldinho&apos;s transfer to Milan,&apos; said club vice president Adriano Galliani when the double World Player of the Year completed his move 11 days ago. Galliani, though, added that the 28-year-old would not have been allowed to play if it had been Milan&apos;s decision.  This is the recurring sentiment from club bosses who are conscious that more and more of their stars want the chance to win a gold medal. Some are hoping that, because the competition is not part of the official international football calendar, players can be withheld. Barcelona are still questioning the inclusion of 21-year-old Messi despite Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, issuing a letter to all competing nations which reiterated that &apos;the release of players below the age of 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs.&apos; Filippo Inzaghi, who no longer gets a game for Italy, has been denied a placed in Pierluigi Casiraghi&apos;s Beijing squad by Milan. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, meanwhile, is furious he can do nothing to prevent 21-year-old Ryan Babel - injured in training with Holland before Euro 2008 - putting himself at further risk, and has reluctantly agreed to Mascherano&apos;s involvement as an overage player. They and Lucas will miss the opening of the Premier League season and the Champions League qualifiers. While Ronaldinho, Babel and company are in China despite the grumbles, football politics exempts British stars. So the team with the most Olympic titles (level with Hungary) - three golds between 1900 and 1912 - will have to wait until London for a possible fourth.  Since the 1980s, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have feared any combined side would allow Fifa to remove their separate status, leading to a British team competing in the World Cup. But with London hosting the Olympics, the British Olympic Association want to enter a team and &apos;hope that a way can be found to allow the four Home Country FAs to agree to let their players put themselves forward for selection&apos;. There seems little chance of this. Only England are interested. &apos;We are absolutely opposed,&apos; says the Scottish FA&apos;s Rob Shorthouse. &apos;We have to do what is right for Scotland.&apos; The English FA&apos;s view, meanwhile, is, &apos;Sepp Blatter has made it clear there would be no detrimental effect on the home nations.&apos; From its introduction in 1900 until 1972, Olympic football was amateur, like the rest of the Games. At Los Angeles in 1984, won by France, the rules were tweaked so that European and South American nations could select any players who had not featured in the World Cup - there were no restrictions on other countries - before the present format was introduced, which has allowed the Games to become a showcase for future and current stars.  In 1992, Australia, with a young Mark Bosnich in goal, finished fourth. &apos;That was a very significant moment for football in Australia,&apos; Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer says. &apos;I watched it avidly as young kid of 18. I haven&apos;t been selected for Beijing but I&apos;d love to play for Australia at the Olympics.&apos;  At the 1996 Atlanta Games, 86,117 watched a Nigeria team featuring Nwankwo Kanu win gold by defeating an Argentina side that included Hern\u00e1n Crespo. Four years later Yakubu played for Nigeria, while Cameroon won the final 5-3 on penalties against Spain, after Samuel Eto&apos;o had scored in a 2-2 draw.  &apos;You watch the Olympics on television and really want to play. It&apos;s a great time meeting athletes from other sport,&apos; Yakubu says. &apos;We got to the quarter-finals before Chile beat us. How was the standard? Very high.&apos; In Athens, Carlos Tevez scored the goal against Paraguay that gave Argentina - whose team also featured Gabriel Heinze - a first Olympic football gold. It was his eighth goal of the tournament, the highest individual tally for 32 years.  Last Wednesday was the deadline for the 16 teams to name their 18-man squads. Chelsea will lose Salomon Kalou to Ivory Coast, Blackburn&apos;s Ryan Nelsen is playing for New Zealand, Australia have called up Fulham&apos;s Adrian Leijer and four Football League players, while Gianni Zuiverloon, West Brom&apos;s new 22-year-old Dutch forward, will have a delayed introduction to the Premier League. They will be keen to perform for the fans back home, but when play begins, some of Europe&apos;s top clubs will be watching anxiously for injury to multi-million-pound assets on which their seasons depend.  This year&apos;s hosts will not be expecting to win gold. &apos;I remember watching the China team in the 1988 Seoul Olympics as an eight-year- old,&apos; says China captain Zheng Zhi of their only previous appearance at the Games, which ended goalless for them in three matches. Zheng, 27, who has played for Charlton since 2007 and enjoys a fanatical following in a country of 1.2 billion, is keen to claim the nation&apos;s first goal at a major tournament: China also failed to score at the 2002 World Cup finals. &apos;I can&apos;t remember any players from 1988, but yes I hope to be the first Chinese player to score. It is a dream and I&apos;m very proud to be captain of my country.&apos;  If that strike came against Brazil, who with New Zealand and Belgium form China&apos;s group, that would only increase Zheng&apos;s popularity.

Some production appears to have shifted from the Pearl river delta to cheaper areas inland and foreign companies are already mooting the possibility of moving manufacturing to countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia.  The textile industry is particularly badly hit because it is highly dependent on overseas sales, making up almost 13% of the country&apos;s total exports and employing almost 20 million people. Paul French, chief China analyst at the research firm Access Asia, said: &quot;With a lot of big international brands you have to do independent, external factory inspections for quality assurance and ethical issues because there&apos;s been too much trouble over issues like corruption. But at the moment factory inspectors can&apos;t get in to check orders. &quot;The government is saying in September everything will be back to normal, but that&apos;s too late for Christmas because everything has to be out by mid-October at the latest and for America even earlier, otherwise there&apos;ll be no glad rags on the high street.

I was eight years old and it was the first act of conscious larceny that I can remember. BOAC - British Overseas Airways Corporation - that dates me; and the &quot;Speedbird&quot; logo is now long gone, also. I can see the small badge in my mind&apos;s eye: a 10-pence piece would cover it - navy blue, edged with silver, a cross between a notional bird-shape and an arrowhead - modern, thrusting, stylish, everything that the 1960s, BOAC and its fleet of mighty, navy blue and white, four-engined, turboprop planes were meant to embody...  Mark Pertwee&apos;s mother was a travel agent and she was a source of all manner of travel agent freebies: timetables, small desktop models of planes (KLM, Pan Am, Air France), little plastic pennants of national flags and their carriers, and she generously shared this bounty with me as well as her son (I was his best friend), but she pointedly did not give me a Speedbird lapel badge. Perhaps she was only provided with one, herself, perhaps it was valuable - silver plate and enamel - it now strikes me. And perhaps this was why I coveted it so.  I planned my theft well. First of all, I hid it in the Pertwee house, in the cupboard under the sink in the guest toilet. I waited a fortnight (Mark seemed oblivious to its disappearance) before I pocketed it one day and took it home. I never showed it to my parents or my three older sisters - indeed I never wore the Speedbird lapel badge in my lapel. It was, in a way, a pointless theft - Mark Pertwee never knew he had lost it and I was never able to sport it. Was it, even, a bona fide theft, worthy of the name, given it had never been registered as stolen in the theft-victim&apos;s mind? I think I lost it in one of my parents&apos; many house moves. I wonder why I stole it at all.  I stole cigarettes from my mother - never money, I want to make that absolutely clear. She smoked heavily, two packs a day, and favoured a brand called Peter Stuyvesant, a cigarette with a somewhat astringent, throat-warming taste, as I recall (and much enjoyed by raffish, square-jawed, Caucasian airline pilots, if the advertisements were to be believed). I would steal four or five cigarettes a week, and she never spotted they had gone.  I ask myself again: is this an example of another non-theft? What category of genuine theft have we here? In my teens, I must have stolen hundreds, possibly thousands, of cigarettes from her. She would buy cigarettes in cartons and, as I grew more bold, I would steal entire packs from the drawer in her bedroom where she kept her stash. My father was a pipe-smoker, with a penchant for fragrant, aromatic tobaccos (until he died in his 50s from lung cancer). Our house reeked of smoke, like a pub. I smoked in my bedroom and no one noticed; my three sisters smoked. It was like that in those days.  I smoked regularly through my teens, even after my father died, and only gave up when I married my first wife, Encarnacion. She detested smoke and smokers to a neurotic degree - I would not have managed a kiss had I not forsworn cigarettes. I think back to all that subterfuge - opening my mother&apos;s handbag, rifling through its contents looking for the Peter Stuyvesant soft-pack, checking to see how many were left - always risky to steal if there were under 10. Then a few heart-thumping seconds watching her fish in her bag to light up herself, and, later, the furtive, head-reeling inhalation with my friends down the lane, under the railway bridge; the subsequent needless deodorising of the mouth - chewing gum, Listerine - and clothes and body (Brut aftershave was particularly masking). For years I must have walked through my house leaving in my wake a pungent, invisible contrail of chemical perfume. Nobody noticed, ever.  I stole food at my boarding school. We were allowed a modest food parcel once a week (like POWs) from a local grocer: a few bananas, a box of dates, mini-packs of cornflakes - no buns or cakes, no chocolates, nothing that could be purchased from the school tuck shop where fizzy drinks, colas, biscuits and every tooth-rotting sweet the confectionery industry could serve up were on offer.  In my house there was a very rich Greek boy whose food parcel might have come from Fortnum &amp; Mason, such was its size and magnificence. I and my coevals pillaged this boy&apos;s food with no compunction (he was plump and cried easily). It was thanks to Stavros&apos;s food parcel that I developed my enduring taste for Patum Peperium, Gentleman&apos;s Relish, a dark, pesto-like spread made from anchovies. It is my Proustian madeleine - it summons up all my early pilfering. I can taste its earthy, farinaceous salinity now.  I stole other things, as well - everyone stole at my school - it was tacitly understood that we all stole from each other, all the time. We stole food, drink, deodorant, shampoo, clothes, pornography, pens, stationery, books... We also shoplifted shamelessly and efficiently in the local town and villages. Only stealing money from your schoolmates was the ultimate sin, which brought permanent pariah-status on the perpetrator and earned him, for the duration of his school career, the nickname of &quot;Fingers&quot; - his personal badge of iniquity, his mark of Cain.  I stole a pair of Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses from a department store in Bath where I was at university doing a degree in architecture. I tried them on, then tried on a dozen others, replacing some back on their little racks, taking them off again and, halfway through this elaborate process, putting on my own spectacles and slipping the Ray-Bans into my spectacle case. I wore them all summer to much acclaim. I was probably wearing them when I met Encarnacion (my future wife, the one who hated smoking) who was an au pair for a solicitor&apos;s family in Bristol.  I look back on my university years as my thieving pomp. I stole at will, whenever I felt like it. Nothing grand, nothing exceptional, just things I wanted and didn&apos;t feel like paying for. I stole newspapers and magazines (the New Statesman, Mayfair, Men Only, Flight, Gramophone); I stole hardback books (I still remember some titles: The History Man, Keats And Embarrassment, The Metropolitan Critic); I stole food - Mars bars, sandwiches, fruit. I once stole a haunch of venison from a delicatessen. One day I stole a tin of cherry pie-filling - I&apos;ve no idea why: I don&apos;t particularly like cherries and had no intention of making a pie. The man who ran the corner shop, where I casually lifted the tin from a shelf on my way out, saw me and gave chase. I lost him after a couple of streets - I ran fast - but I have never since experienced such a pure rush of emotion: an atavistic fear followed by an adrenaline-fuelled exhilaration that made me sway as I stood there catching my breath.  I stole nothing for several years - I simply stopped stealing for a while. Perhaps it was marriage to Encarnacion, the swift arrival of the twins (Lolita and Bonita) and the responsibilities that went with my job. I was an architect in a large and prestigious firm - the Freedlander, Cobb Partnership - I was a married man and a father of two lovely little girls. Stealing in these circumstances would seem demeaning, despoiling, almost filthy. All right, like everyone else I fiddled my expenses, but no one in their right mind would call that theft. However, it was over a fractious and unpleasant formal query about my expenses that I met the managing partner of Freedlander, Cobb - Margaret Warburton, FCA, and my life changed.  I stole my daughters&apos; happiness. Perhaps that&apos;s too strong: I stole Lolita and Bonita&apos;s right to a stable family life with two parents, a father and a mother. To this day I don&apos;t know how Encarnacion discovered my affair with Margaret Warburton, but when she presented the evidence of our liaison (her father, Jose, and her brother, Severiano, also sternly present, their dark eyes shining with implacable loathing), it was compendious and irrefutable. We separated, she took the girls back to Valladolid, we divorced and I moved in with Margaret.  I missed the girls but I did not miss Encarnacion much, I have to confess. There is a problem marrying someone who speaks your own language imperfectly - all nuance is lost: and with nuance goes humour, irony, sarcasm, subtext, secrets. All these were present with Margaret - a clever, sly and salacious mind operated beneath that perfect accountant&apos;s exterior: the lean, pale, expressionless face, the deliberately too-tight, well-cut suits, the coiffed, dark helmet of hair, the black-framed officious spectacles - swiftly removed and swiftly replaced to make forensic points in meetings. Indeed, it was exactly this juxtaposition that made my adulterous sex life with her so energetic and alluring. I didn&apos;t take enough care - I didn&apos;t take any care, I now realise; all I wanted and waited for was the covert rendezvous, the snatched weekend, the airport hotel, the meeting of two cars, nose to nose, in some rural layby.  I stole pounds 985,622 from Freedlander, Cobb over a period of seven years. Margaret Warburton, the managing partner, supervising the burgeoning accounts of the firm, saw the opportunity, especially as more and more of our projects were abroad - the desalination plant in Saudi Arabia, the new terminal at Kolkata airport, three office blocks in Shanghai, and so on. She needed a senior partner to collude - and why wouldn&apos;t I collude with my clever wife? (We married shortly after the divorce, but told no one, not even my mother and sisters - Margaret&apos;s idea.) I signed wherever she told me - overruns, unforeseen expenses, delays, extra hours worked because of global time differences - the opportunities were manifold. In a $100m contract, do you notice an extra $80,000? No, not if it&apos;s all properly accounted. We were careful, we took our time, we weren&apos;t greedy. Small amounts on almost every job were hived off and banked in the Cayman Islands. Sometimes we deliberately admitted to our mistakes, apologised and reimbursed the client. Everything appeared above board. We lived well, holidayed discreetly but at considerable expense (Margaret bought us a permanent suite on one of those floating cruise-ship hotels) and we maintained separate houses for form&apos;s sake. When we were arrested together, in Margaret&apos;s office in the new Freedlander, Cobb HQ in Southwark - the one that looks like a hand grenade - it came as a massive shock. I felt like an innocent man, wrongly arraigned on a trumped-up charge.  I stole tobacco from my fellow prisoners in the austere but not intolerable open prison where I was sent to pay my debt to society for my shameful white-collar crime. For some reason, I received a sentence of six years and Margaret three. Tobacco, cigarettes - is this the thieving leitmotif in my life? I stole tobacco - I&apos;d given up smoking years before, remember - to buy alcohol. Prisoners who worked in the allotments made a virulently potent hooch from potatoes and other tubers. I would pinch fingerfuls of roll-up tobacco from casually set-down plastic envelopes of the stuff, and when I had enough accumulated (a fistful, say) would exchange it for half a pint of moonshine and a few hours of oblivion. It was like drinking some sort of burning, ruthless, liquid toxin; you sensed small ulcers forming in your stomach almost immediately. You felt it could have de-iced aeroplanes in the Arctic, stripped paint from antique cars. It was marvellously strong. My drink problem became more acute after Margaret left prison and divorced me. She moved abroad, to Latin America, and I never heard from her again, of course. How much had we really stolen? I had no idea. The prosecuting council came up with the pounds 985,622 figure, but for all I know it could have been double. It was entirely Margaret&apos;s plan, the whole operation - she was the thief, the real thief, not me. Old Julius Freedlander himself took the stand to destroy my character, claiming only to be &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; with Margaret&apos;s betrayal. She was demure, only rarely weepy - I think I seemed some brutal mastermind who had dumped his nice Spanish wife to manipulate this blameless accountant. Both Margaret and I were advised by our briefs to plead guilty, advice we took - it seemed to work for her.  I stole three and a half pints of bitter, a near-full gin and tonic and a Bacardi Breezer in the Richard The Lionheart in Cromer, Norfolk, last night. It&apos;s laughably easy - a legacy of my prison-induced alcoholism. I steal drinks in crowded pubs at weekends or, better still, pubs with beer gardens in the summer. I sit nursing my bitter lemon or Diet Coke waiting for the bar staff to emerge and start clearing up empty glasses. I just follow them around, and in the bustle that their progress creates more often than not can help myself to an unguarded drink, take it as far away as possible and consume it quickly. Crowds of young men and women, always leaving their drinks to go out and smoke, are very fair game. You&apos;ll see five or six glasses on a ledge or table - nobody knows whose drink it is, nobody pays attention. Solitary drinkers who leave their drink to go to the lavatory are also useful prey. It&apos;s amazing how many people buy a pint or a glass of wine, and leave without finishing them. I discreetly help myself to these unwanted drinks - but then again that&apos;s not stealing. If you read a discarded newspaper on the train, have you stolen it? Of course not.  To go into prison a successful, highly-trained, middle-class professional and emerge a semi-functioning alcoholic was hardly what I planned and naturally, after the disgrace, the profession no longer allowed me to call myself &quot;Architect&quot;. I managed to buy a small cottage in South Runton, near Cromer, and set myself up as a &quot;Designer&quot;. In the first years I was commissioned to do a few jobs - a cricket pavilion, a conservatory in a nursery, a wing of a doctors&apos; clinic in King&apos;s Lynn, and managed to live quietly, respectably. But the jobs seemed slowly but steadily to diminish - I wonder if word had leaked out somehow about the Freedlander, Cobb scandal. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if Julius Freedlander himself wasn&apos;t quietly blackening my name around East Anglia... In any event I haven&apos;t worked in 18 months and I&apos;m seriously behind on my mortgage repayments. I recently sold my car and bought a bicycle.  My great pleasure, apart from drinking, are my daughters, Lolita and Bonita - rather, I should say &quot;Lola y Bona&quot;. They are a pop sensation in Spain and other Mediterranean countries - Greece, Croatia, Cyprus. They have a website: lolaybona.es - check it out, their fame is local but huge. I cycle into Cromer once a week and buy all the foreign celebrity magazines, you know the ones - Calor!, Proximite, Peep&apos;L. I cut out the pictures of Lola y Bona and stick them on a huge pinboard that covers one wall in my kitchen. My wall of celebration, I call it, at least something turned out well.  Last week I took my pile of magazines into the Lionheart and flicked through them looking for pictures of my babies. I found a couple of them at a film festival in Dubrovnik. Tanned, lithe, sexy girls with black, black hair, like their mother. Identical twins, that&apos;s the catch, you see - the songs they sing seem entirely ordinary, bouncy, rhythmic, heavy on percussion, thumping drums - but those girls, 18 years old, impossible to tell them apart.  A man I vaguely know wondered if I&apos;d like a drink, so I asked for a large vodka and tonic. I think he&apos;s a novelist, very curious about my stint in the open prison. I tell him colourful anecdotes about &quot;doing time&quot; - I suspect it&apos;s all going into a book. After he&apos;d gone I procured a couple of half pints and most of a large glass of red wine. I wandered out on to the front. I like Cromer, perched on the edge of England, on the edge of England&apos;s plump, round bum. I think of continental Europe out there, across the North Sea, and wonder where Lola y Bona might be: Majorca, Zagreb, Larnaca, Tel Aviv? It makes me feel I&apos;m not that far away from them - not close, but not far away.  There&apos;s a large bric-a-brac antique shop in a side street by the pier and I wandered in to kill some time. I was stunned to see, in a small display of badges and brooches pinned on a velvet cushion, a BOAC Speedbird lapel badge. I asked to have a look at it and inquired about the price. The owner - he has mutton-chop whiskers and wears loud checked suits and coloured waistcoats - told me it was pounds 150. There was no price ticket, of course - what kind of fool did he take me for? &quot;Very rare,&quot; he added, &quot;extremely.&quot; I asked him his best price and he said he couldn&apos;t go lower than 130. I laughed, I scoffed - I told him I&apos;d had one of those BOAC Speedbird lapel badges when I was a boy. Should have hung on to it, mate, he said, smugly: very rare, much sought after by collectors of airline memorabilia. I said I&apos;d think about it and then stuck the badge back on the cushion but was careful not to fully close the securing pin. I&apos;ll come back next weekend - it&apos;s a bank holiday - wander around the shop when he&apos;s distracted by the crowd - and steal it.", "tags": ["William Boyd", "Original writing", "Books"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-01T22:59:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/02/olympics.quiz", "sentences": ["2 Officially recognised Shanghai &quot;troublemakers&quot; have been provided with a set of protocols.", "4 Shanghai&apos;s vice-mayor has unveiled plans to distribute sweets and comics to crying children at football matches."], "title": "All you need to know about China - true or false?", "article": "In the run-up to the Games the news wires have been buzzing with wacky obiter dicta from the host cities.

It was initially thought that only the Olympic media centre and hotels used by journalists would have access to such sites, but they are currently visible to internet users far outside those locations.  However, sites with information on the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong, Chinese dissidents, the Tibetan government in exile and the 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests are still inaccessible.

Barring injury, disqualification or a sudden collapse of form, this is when the nation&apos;s biggest sporting hero Liu Xiang will defend a title that it was once thought Asia could never win: the 110m hurdles. As the events in Tibet and elsewhere this year have shown, uniting a country as vast as China is not easy but Liu&apos;s bid for a second Olympic win looks set to be one of those moments in the history of televised sport, when almost an entire nation is joined together by airwaves, pixels and emotion. From 9pm local time the better half of a population of 1.3billion people will start tuning in to CCTV5, the state broadcaster&apos;s sports channel. By the time the starting gun fires, Shanghai socialites, Sichuanese farmers, Guangdong factory workers and perhaps even some Tibetan monks and Mongolian nomads will be huddled around television sets to see if Liu can repeat a feat that - more than any other - announced China&apos;s arrival on the world sporting stage. The 110m hurdles gold was once the preserve of black Americans and Europeans, who were thought to have more power and technique than Asians. But at Athens in 2004 Liu changed all that. In a transcendental performance he achieved what no Chinese man had previously managed - a gold on the track, matching Colin Jackson&apos;s 11-year-old world record and, for good measure, beating an American, Terrence Trammell, into second place. At the time Liu said his performance was a stereotype buster. &quot;I want to prove to all the world that Asians can run very fast,&quot; he said. &quot;I am a Chinese and considering the physiology of the Chinese people, it is something unbelievable.&quot; There was no complaint from Jackson, who praised Liu&apos;s hurdling style as &quot;silky&quot;. Since then Liu has entered the celebrity stratosphere. He is the country&apos;s greatest sporting hero, so much so that he is often described as China&apos;s David Beckham. But this is an understatement: Liu&apos;s fame is not cosmetic, he has actually won something for his country. According to Wang Xiaoshan, of Sports Illustrated, Liu is on the frontline of a 30-year campaign to rebuild national confidence. &quot;Until 1978 China was a closed country that thought it was doing well. Then we opened the door and suddenly realised we were poor and backward. It was a huge blow to national pride. To rebuild confidence, the government focused on sport. In the early Eighties the victory of the women&apos;s volleyball team in the world championship was a huge lift. Then we saw Chinese victories in many other events. But there was one area where it seemed we would never break through - men&apos;s athletics. Here we failed again and again until Liu came through and changed everything.&quot; Sohu.com sports journalist Ye Tao agrees: &quot;Liu Xiang is extremely popular because he proved that the yellow race is not inferior to any other.&quot; To whet the appetite further, the 110m hurdles in Beijing has the potential to be one of the great showdowns of sporting history. Barring a calamity, Liu will go head to head in the final with his biggest rival, Dayron Robles of Cuba. Liu will have the advantage of home territory and the support of a crowd of 81,000 adoring fans. But on this year&apos;s form, Robles is the favourite. In June Robles poured over the hurdles in Ostrava, Czech Republic, to set a world record of 12.87 seconds, trimming a hundredth of a second off Liu&apos;s two-year-old mark. To show it was no fluke, he ran 12.88 a month later in France. Robles set the stage for an epic Olympic encounter. &quot;It&apos;s such a good time; I wasn&apos;t expecting that,&quot; he said. &quot;Wow! I do not know if I can beat Liu Xiang in Beijing now. But we will see.&quot; Liu meanwhile has been struggling with a sore hamstring, which is becoming almost as talked about in China as Beckham&apos;s metatarsal once was in England. At a warm-up event on the Bird&apos;s Nest track in May he appeared to be over the worst. Against a weak field Liu was imperious. After one false start he burst free of the competition within three hurdles and then cruised fluidly to victory amid a burst of camera flashes from around the track. Afterwards he gave the thumbs up to the new track and told the Guardian he was not weighed down by the weight of expectations. &quot;I do not feel any pressure. The best way to relieve pressure is to rest well and eat well.&quot; But at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, in June, he was disqualified for false starting. His coach, Sun Haiping, said Liu was simply too eager to return to top form but there was inevitable speculation that the burden of the hopes of 1.3bn people was taking a psychological toll. Whatever the reason, Liu will go into the Olympics without one top-level race this year. Can he still win? Wang says maybe. &quot;I would give him a 50 per cent chance. He is in good condition but Robles is in even better shape. Liu has the advantage of competing on home territory. For some this might be too much pressure but Liu is mentally strong. He is healthy and outgoing. The pressure won&apos;t be a problem.&quot; Liu, of course, is not the only athlete under pressure. Since returning to the Olympics in 1984, China has steadily climbed up the medal table. In Los Angeles the world&apos;s most populous nation - then still impoverished and still recovering from the Cultural Revolution - managed 15 gold medals in a competition weakened by the boycott of the Soviet Union. Building first on traditional strengths in table tennis and badminton, the All China Sports Federation focused effectively on technical events, such as diving and shooting, to push up the medal count. With the help of a network of specialised sports schools, some of which train children from as young as six, their programme has been hugely successful. In terms of golds China was fourth in Atlanta, third in Sydney, second in Athens and now on home territory, few doubt they will complete the sequence. That the Chinese team will top the gold medal table for the first time in history is now taken for granted, the only debate is the degree of dominance. Websites devoted to the topic suggest 40 is considered the minimum acceptable number of golds, while 50 would take China into dreamland. But Liu&apos;s case is special. There are more certain golds, such as Zhang Yining in table tennis, Zhang Guozheng in the men&apos;s weightlifting or Guo Jingjing in the women&apos;s diving. There is also a taller, richer sports star in the 7ft 6in Yao Ming, the NBA basketball hero. But the former are not in events with the same cachet while the latter is very unlikely to win an Olympic medal. Liu, by contrast, has it all. He is a proven champion in a sexy event.  Born in Shanghai in 1983 to a working- class family, Liu is very much the face that modern China would like to present to the world. He is tall - 6ft 2\u00bdin - dresses elegantly, speaks confidently and has consistently proved himself capable of leaving the competition in his slipstream. His fans are legion. The members of the Liu Xiang supporters&apos; club are known as Xiangmi, a pun on the athlete&apos;s name and fragrant rice. One of the most enthusiastic is Se Se, a 23-year-old office clerk. &quot;He has realised the dream of every generation of Chinese athletes,&quot; she gushes. &quot;Yet he remains very low-key, never shows off and doesn&apos;t talk about his personal life in public. He has made a deep impression on Chinese people&apos;s hearts.&quot; Naturally this symbol of world-class success is as much sought after by corporate sponsors. Liu has so many commercial deals, including Nike, Visa, Coca-Cola and Cadillac, that his face beams down from advertising hoardings even in the remotest corners of China. A natural athlete, Liu was enrolled in a sports school during his early teens and initially marked out as a high jumper. He excelled in that, winning the national title at this first attempt. But it was meeting the hurdling coach Sun Haiping that made him a global champion. Within three years of starting the event he won the East Asian Games and the World University Games. Improvement was rapid. In Athens he smashed his personal best time by a fifth of a second. Given the way he rose to the occasion in 2004, and again in the athletics world championships last year, Liu is capable of lifting himself to a new peak at the Bird&apos;s Nest on the 21st. All he has to overcome are 10 hurdles, 110metres of track and the weight of 1.3bn expectations.", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-01T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/02/formulaone.motorsports", "sentences": ["Hamilton spun off at Shanghai after McLaren ignored advice from their tyre manufactures."], "title": "Formula One: Alonso uses anniversary to reopen McLaren wounds", "article": "Fernando Alonso&apos;s lingering hostility towards the McLaren-Mercedes team spilled over yesterday when he said that he would not be allowed to win if he were still with the team because their whole approach is slanted towards supporting Lewis Hamilton&apos;s efforts. Alonso, who won the world championship in 2005 and 2006, was speaking on the first anniversary of his acrimonious split with McLaren here in Budapest, a breach which ended with him rowing with the chairman, Ron Dennis, and his right-hand man, Martin Whitmarsh. McLaren sources have since revealed that the Spanish driver was almost fired on the spot after deliberately blocking Hamilton during qualifying for the 2007 Hungarian grand prix, earning himself a five-place grid penalty. &quot;If I was driving for them this year, it wouldn&apos;t make any difference because I would be in just the same situation as [Heikki] Kovalainen and not allowed to win,&quot; he said. &quot;But I am much happier this year [at Renault] for sure. So at least I am happy to be with Renault with the full support of the team and knowing that everybody is working night and day to give me the best car possible. One day we will be seventh, one day we will be fifth and hopefully one day we will be on the podium and everybody on the podium will be there with some excitement.&quot; This could be seen as a deliberately provocative remark intended to offend Dennis, who has specifically denied there were any team orders obliging the Finn to defer to Hamilton in either the British grand prix at Silverstone or the subsequent German race at Hockenheim. It was also viewed as a manifestation of his frustration that, despite him joining McLaren as a double world champion at the start of 2007, the team did not grant him the contractual droit du seigneur over the new boy Hamilton which might have enabled him to round off a hat-trick of titles. Alonso&apos;s return to Renault has turned out to be something of a consolation prize intended to keep him in play in case a better opportunity comes along. His name has been frequently linked with Ferrari but the contractual reality is that the earliest he could join the famous Italian scuderia would be 2010 - and then only in the event that Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s contract is not renewed. Until then Alonso may have to continue to exist in limbo without a car capable of showing off his considerable talent. Speculation that he shook on a deal to join Ferrari some time in the future - at a secret meeting in Rome - with the Ferrari president, Luca di Montezemolo, as long ago as August last year was met with no response from the Alonso camp. &quot;I have a contract with Renault for the long term,&quot; he said ambiguously. &quot;But of course at the end of every season you need to look at what the possibilities are. It is not the time now, but in September and October I will have a think and we will decide.&quot; Asked if he felt he had now made his peace with Hamilton, Alonso dodged the question. &quot;After last year here in my opinion there [is] nothing to say,&quot; he replied. &quot;It was planned before qualifying that it was my turn to do the extra [qualifying] lap but I got penalised and all the mess started.&quot; There is no doubt that Alonso must be ranked as one of the great drivers of his generation, a natural talent who has the potential to race wheel-to-wheel with any other driver on the starting grid. Yet out of the cockpit he is capable of displaying a wilfully capricious streak which often sees him marching to his own beat against what might seem to be his own interests. As another team principal remarked wistfully: &quot;He&apos;s got great talent but, if he can screw over Ron Dennis, then he can do it to anybody.&quot; The Renault team was reeling in the face of the news that one of their senior research and development engineers had been found dead on Wednesday in the grounds of the team&apos;s headquarters at Enstone in Oxfordshire. William Millar, 53, who had been with the team for 27 years, had been seen walking down a bridleway on the Renault site. Shortly afterwards other employees working there heard a gunshot and Millar&apos;s body was found with a bullet in the head. Police have indicated that the incident is not being regarded as suspicious and a file has been passed to the local coroner.  How 2007 unfolded After Hungary, Alonso went on to finish third in Turkey with Hamilton only managing fifth. The team&apos;s performance improved at Monza where Hamilton followed Alonso home for a McLaren 1-2. Relations worsened at Spa when Hamilton, who finished fourth, accused his team-mate of driving him off the road. But Hamilton profited from Alonso&apos;s crash at Fuji, winning the race and moving to within a win of the drivers&apos; title. Hamilton spun off at Shanghai after McLaren ignored advice from their tyre manufactures. Alonso finished second behind Kimi Raikkonen. The FIA announced that they would monitor the McLaren team at Sao Paulo to ensure the drivers were treated equally. Taking a four-point championship lead into the final race, Hamilton surrendered the title to Raikkonen. Alonso, who came third, finished the season level on points with his team-mate.", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "McLaren", "Fernando Alonso"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-01T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/02/fishing.history", "sentences": ["His book combines solid background research with well written reportage that crisscrosses the globe, visiting Canadian lobstermen, London chip shops, Mediterranean marine reserves, Tokyo fish markets and Shanghai restaurants."], "title": "Review: The Last Fish Tale by Mark Kurlansky, and Bottomfeeder by Taras Grescoe", "article": "The Last Fish Tale: The Fate of the Atlantic and Our Disappearing Fisheriesby Mark Kurlansky304pp, Macmillan \u00a312.99Buy it hereBottomfeeder: How the Fish on Our Plates Is Killing Our Planetby Taras Grescoe304pp, Macmillan \u00a312.99Buy it here Prawns were once my favourite dish, but I haven&apos;t eaten them for more than 15 years. I have seen the destruction prawn farms in east Africa and Madagascar have brought to the mangrove ecosystems, and the havoc caused by trawling the ocean bed for shrimp. Many other species are on my forbidden list because, like many divers and naturalists, I have witnessed the decline in marine habitats that overfishing has wrought. Whenever mainstream authors delve into the oceans I am excited and encouraged, hoping the dire news about overfishing will spread. Ten years ago, Mark Kurlansky catalogued the decline of the great cod fisheries of the north Atlantic, and virtually launched a publishing genre: writing that concentrates on a single commodity and extrapolates that material into wider geopolitical and historical issues. As well as producing other non-fiction titles, he followed Cod with Salt and Oyster. I hoped The Last Fish Tale would match Cod&apos;s bravura, bringing the plight of the Atlantic fisheries to a broad audience.  Kurlansky revisits the awful destruction commercial fishermen wreaked on the Grand Banks, where by 1992 cod had been reduced to less than 10% of its original biomass. Basing most of the narrative around the Massachusetts port of Gloucester, he describes the way fishermen adapted to dwindling catches by shifting their attention to dogfish as the cod declined, and then to hagfish. Overfishing is not a new problem, Kurlansky reveals: as early as 1376 the English parliament banned the destructive practice of &quot;beam trawling&quot;, and in the 17th century fishermen petitioned Charles I to protect fishing from &quot;the great destruction made of fish by a net or engine called the Trawle&quot;. The flaw of this book is that Kurlansky chooses to tell the story of the fish stocks of the north Atlantic by measuring the effects of their disappearance on a single town. Gloucester is one of New England&apos;s oldest fishing communities and the author spends much time depicting its character as the home of wave after wave of doughty immigrants: Welsh, English, Sicilian, Azorean. These rough but essentially noble men braved the seas while their steadfast women waited stoically on shore to see which boats would come home after a storm.  Cataloguing the decline of the fishing industry and the gentrifying of the coastline by commuters from nearby Boston, Kurlansky concludes: &quot;Gloucester has become like Penzance or Cape Cod - a fishing town where fishermen can no longer afford to live.&quot;  This book is a muddle. The bare facts of the crisis in the north Atlantic are there - 60% of the world&apos;s fish species are fully exploited, and over a third of commercial fish stocks in the US are overfished. But Kurlansky buries too much of the shocking reality in the ephemera and trivia of the history of Gloucester. There are occasional forays to this side of the Atlantic, but unless you are a descendant of a Gloucester fisherman I suspect Kurlansky&apos;s attention to local detail will feel excruciatingly dull. Taras Grescoe takes a more stimulating approach to the fisheries crisis in Bottomfeeder. His book combines solid background research with well written reportage that crisscrosses the globe, visiting Canadian lobstermen, London chip shops, Mediterranean marine reserves, Tokyo fish markets and Shanghai restaurants.  Grescoe lucidly explains how humankind has gradually been forced to target fish and crustacean species from lower and lower down the food chain. As large predatory fish disappear - swordfish, sea bass, cod, shark and tuna - the lower orders multiply. Fishermen in the Gulf of Maine have switched from pelagic species to lobster, which are now flourishing. This is not good news: the lobsters have multiplied because the kelp beds in which they breed have grown into rampant forests. Once upon a time the kelp was kept in check by sea urchins. The urchins multiplied when the cod disappeared, and were in turn wiped out by fishermen who sold them to the Japanese, who regard them as a delicacy. As the larger predators are removed so the bottom-feeders, the algae and the salps, proliferate. Grescoe&apos;s thesis is chilling: &quot;The lobster boom may be a tiny blip on the slippery slope to oceans filled with jellyfish, bacteria and slime.&quot; Wherever Grescoe focuses his lens, he reveals the gruesome truth about the fashion for fish in expensive restaurants. It makes grim reading. Monkfish, for example, live to be 150 years old, and do not reproduce until they are about 40. We catch and eat them long before they reach that age. Almost half of the Chilean sea bass on sale has been caught illegally. And cod, still allegedly fished sustainably in the Barents Sea, is being targeted during the spawning season and caught undersized.  Grescoe is a gourmet, not a crusading environmentalist who wants us all to be vegans. He is happy to make recommendations about the fish we can eat with a clearer conscience - for example, haddock rather than cod. Bottomfeeder also has a helpful appendix detailing websites where ethically minded diners can learn more about fishing and fish stocks, and which types of fishing are most environmentally damaging.  The crisis in the seas is visible everywhere. Last year Northern Ireland&apos;s only salmon farm was wiped out by &quot;a 10sq-mile flotilla of mauve stingers&quot;, and fishermen are catching about half a million tonnes of jellyfish in the Med each year, twice the catch of 10 years ago.  Grescoe is not afraid to point the finger of blame. In China, demand for sharkfin has reduced global populations of the biggest species to 1% of natural levels. In Japan, bluefin tuna is more valuable than rhino horn, and one fish sold for a staggering \u00a385,000. Once bluefin tuna were monsters of the deep - with mature individuals g rowing to 15ft long. Now, most are a third that size, juveniles caught at two years old and &quot;farmed&quot; in pens until fat enough to sell. But wild tuna only breed at around 11 years old, so the massed juveniles kept in cages never get the chance to breed and have to be fed huge quantities of other fish.  Every page of this book had me reaching for pen and paper to record yet another horrifying statistic about the way humanity is plundering the seas. This is not merely an entertaining treatment of a vital issue, it is an important book that anyone who thinks they care about the environment must read. \u00b7 Tim Ecott&apos;s Neutral Buoyancy: Adventures in a Liquid World is published by Penguin", "tags": ["Culture", "Fishing", "Books", "Environment", "History"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-01T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/aug/03/france.finland", "sentences": ["What&apos;s great about it is that geographically it is on the Great Circle Route between Europe and Asia and there are good connections from the UK to Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, Mumbai and Delhi, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, Bangkok and Seoul."], "title": "The expert panel: Which is your favourite airport?", "article": "Stephen Bayley Observer design critic Airports are best avoided, at least by the fastidious, but I do have a favourite: the magnificently, grandiosely French folly known as the A\u00e9roport International de Vatry.

His account recalls everyday life in the pre-communist Chinese port of the British concession of Tianjin. The book is a sensitive, beautifully written evocation of a vanished past, of the world Power saw and understood (or misunderstood) as a child, free from the usual prejudices of treaty port inhabitants who saw all Chinese servants as thieving and dirty. Perhaps because of his youth, Power was unusually open to the cosmopolitan life of the treaty port, making friends with Russian and Chinese schoolmates. Yet some of the funniest stories in this small masterpiece relate to his father&apos;s friend, Mad Mac, who tuned all the pianos in north China, for missionary and warlord alike, and who described Gordon Hall, the seat of the British administration named after General Gordon, as looking like a lunatic asylum on the outskirts of Edinburgh. First published in 1984, the book was reissued in 2005 and, to Power&apos;s great delight, published in a Chinese translation in Tianjin itself. Power was born in Tianjin, a port on the Bohai Gulf of north-east China. His French-Irish mother was the daughter of Georges d&apos;Arc, who owned a hotel in the city&apos;s Racecourse Road. His Irish father, Stephen, served in the Imperial Chinese Maritime Customs, and was frequently away from Tianjin, dying suddenly in Shanghai when Brian was seven. His unhappy mother, who had always wanted to be a nun, spent much of her time playing the piano; so Brian was brought up by Chinese servants, particularly his beloved amah Y Jieh. She would take him to watch the traditional toymakers at work in the market and she taught him songs and stories from Chinese history and folklore, frightening him with tales of White Lotus bandits. He spoke and thought mainly in Chinese until he was sent off to various schools in Tianjin. Most important was the Jesuit Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales et Industrielles, where his mother played the organ and he served as an altar boy. He was impressed by the Jesuits, notably Teilhard de Chardin, the philosopher and archaeologist, who took tea with the Power family on a rare visit from his archaeological excavations in the Gobi desert. In 1936, Power went to study law at King&apos;s College London, planning to return to Tianjin, perhaps as a lay teacher with the Jesuits. Then came the war, in which he served in the Royal Irish Fusiliers and was severely wounded in Sicily. Recovered, he participated in war crimes tribunals in Germany and Austria. He later settled in London and became a barrister, but he also built up a practice teaching the art of advocacy to politicians, diplomats, industrialists, doctors and soldiers. He married the twice-widowed Prunella Douglas-Hamilton in 1964. She had been running the Women&apos;s League of Health and Beauty (now the Fitness League) since 1935. His marriage brought him a loving family of stepsons and grandchildren, one of whom, Iain, founded the charity Save the Elephants. Power managed to revisit Tianjin, just for a day, in 1973, during the grim autumn of Mao Zedong&apos;s rule. Subsequent visits enabled him to revisit his childhood haunts, which were fast disappearing into the Tianjin Economic Development Area. As well as The Ford of Heaven, he also wrote a life of the last emperor of China, The Puppet Emperor, partly inspired by seeing the youthful Pu Yi and his entourage in Tianjin in the late 1920s, when Japan was plotting to install him as a figurehead ruler in occupied Manchuria. Power sympathised with Pu Yi, who loved bagpipes and all things Scottish, a culture to which he was also attached: he spent many happy months at the family home on Raasay, sailing, walking, painting or writing. He was a veritable Chinese Celt; when engaged in the laborious task of dry stone walling, he was meticulous in selecting stones to fit exactly with each other, thus ensuring a good feng shui for the place. Like his wife, Prunella, Brian believed in keeping fit. In his 90th year, he still cycled regularly to the Hurlingham Club, in south-west London, to join his tennis four (combined age 337); he was a demon with his fading drop shot. He is survived by Prunella and his stepsons, Diarmaid and Iain. \u00b7 Brian St Quentin Power, author and barrister, born July 23 1918; died May 16 2008", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "China", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-03T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/04/china", "sentences": ["Officials said that explosions in Shanghai in May and Kunming last month had been deliberate but not terrorist-related."], "title": "Grenade attack kills 16 policemen on Chinese border", "article": "Suspected terrorists today killed 16 policemen and injured 16 more in north-west China&apos;s restive region of Xinjiang, the state media have reported.  The attack appears to be the most serious incident in the area for several years. Two assailants used a dump truck to target a paramilitary border police station in Kashgar, running down and then stabbing a team of policemen on their morning drills before exploding grenades, the state news agency Xinhua said. The area is already under tightened security in the run-up to the Olympics, which begin in just four days. The authorities have repeatedly accused Uighur Muslim separatists seeking an independent &quot;East Turkestan&quot; of plotting violent attacks and recently claimed to have arrested 82 people in Xinjiang this year in connection with terrorism.  Human rights campaigners and Uighur exiles have argued that the government has exaggerated the threat of violence, and blurred the distinction between extremism, pro-independence arguments and cultural expression to justify repression in the region.  Xinhua reported that the attackers struck as paramilitary police were on their morning drills in front of the Yijin hotel, just outside their station. As the lorry veered off the road, the attackers jumped out, throwing at least two grenades into the barracks and hacking at the policemen with knives.  Fourteen officers were killed on the spot and two more died on the way to hospital. The raiders were arrested. &quot;This is the most serious incident recorded in years,&quot; said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch, who has closely followed developments in the region.  &quot;Ahead of the Olympics, it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in Xinjiang is at an all-time high.&quot; Xinhua claimed today that the region&apos;s public security bureau had clues suggesting that the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (Etim) planned attacks in the run-up to the Olympic opening ceremony on Friday.  A 100,000-strong security force is on standby in Beijing, which lies around 2,500 miles away from Kashgar, China&apos;s western-most city. But terrorism experts had suggested that tight security in the capital meant attacks were more likely elsewhere.  Kashgar, known to the Chinese as Kashi, is an old Silk Road city and an area with a history of Uighur separatist activity.  Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslims form around 8 million of the 19 million population in Xinjiang, a vast mineral-rich region which covers a sixth of China&apos;s territory. Many resent controls on religion and growing Han Chinese immigration. Andrew Gilholm, senior China analyst at the Control Risks consultancy, said Uighur militants were the most likely explanation for today&apos;s attack, but cautioned against linking it to other alleged terrorist plots. &quot;This sounds like exactly the kind of thing that happened in the 90s. I would view this as suggesting localised resurgence in Xinjiang of the capability we know about that has been suppressed in the last few years. I don&apos;t see much grounds to connect it with other things that have happened recently,&quot; he said. Colin Mackerras, an expert on the region and emeritus professor at Griffith University, Australia, said relations between Uighurs and Han Chinese in the region had worsened since a security clampdown in the late 90s, which followed sporadic violence by separatists.  &quot;There&apos;s nervousness and tension among both Uighurs and Chinese ... I think support for the kind of incidents that will embarrass the Chinese has grown,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s an independence movement, but I don&apos;t expect it to succeed and don&apos;t expect many people will want to take part, because they expect it to fail and know the result will be more repression.&quot; Both the United Nations and United States have deemed the Etim a terrorist organisation. But several analysts suggest its links to al-Qaida and its general strength were overstated and have since dwindled.  &quot;There are quite a few groups and the Chinese usually lump them all together as Etim,&quot; said Mackerras. Others suggest it is too soon to label the incident as terrorism at all.  &quot;We don&apos;t know if this was a revenge attack because a tribe got attacked; it is quite tribal there. There could be a number of reasons for this,&quot; said Dr Andrew Fischer, a specialist on western China at LSE. Asked about the implications of the Kashgar incident this morning, Beijing Olympic organisers said they were confident that the capital was secure because of their preparations. &quot;We have strengthened security in all Olympic venues and in the Olympic village. We are well-prepared to deal with any kinds of threats,&quot; said official Sun Weide. Last week, the Chinese officer in charge of Olympics security said that &quot;East Turkestan terrorist groups&quot; represented the greatest threat to the games. But on the same day, Kuerxi Maihesuti, vice-governor of the region, told reporters: &quot;There are only a very small number of sabotage activities in Xinjiang and many were nipped in the bud.&quot; The government has also played down the recent emergence of a video in which men identifying themselves as the little-known Turkestan Islamic party claimed responsibility for bus blasts in China and threatening more attacks during the Olympics.

But when they fall, they fall the furthest.&quot; The most robust of the bric economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China) has been Brazil. The Bovespa index is 5% up on a year ago, though it too has been falling pretty sharply in recent weeks, losing 20% of its value since the beginning of May. The strong performance of the Middle Eastern markets can chiefly be explained by high oil and gas prices, though some have also opened up further to foreign investors over the past 12 months.  Parsons says the relative obscurity of the 10 outperforming markets has played to their advantage. &quot;The ones that became hot spots then collapsed. Vietnam doubled and halved. Shanghai tripled and then halved again.

But with the opening ceremony this Friday, it&apos;s back to business as usual for Olympics \u2013 with business the operative word. In March, after anti-Beijing riots in Tibet left dozens dead and sparked a crackdown by the Chinese military, the world appeared ready to turn its back on Beijing. Protests along the Olympic torch relay route put the spotlight on China&apos;s occupation of Tibet, its war on Tibetan culture and its dismal human rights record at home and even beyond, as enabler-in-chief for Sudan&apos;s genocide in Dafur and arms merchant to Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. The torch relay fiasco also underlined the International Olympic Committee&apos;s failure honour its promise to use the games to leverage greater freedom in China.  Upon winning the right to host the Olympics seven years ago, China pledged to improve its human rights performance. Last week provided evidence, however, of how little China and IOC value that promise. Chinese authorities won&apos;t even live up to an explicit pledge to permit unfettered access to the internet for reporters at the Olympic media centre. Separately, a report from Amnesty International outlines how, rather than encourage greater freedom, the Olympics have given China a pretext to strike harder against dissent.  Amnesty cites expansion of the &quot;re-education through labour&quot; programme to &quot;clean up&quot; Beijing ahead of the games, taking dissidents into custody and shipping them out of town to avoid embarrassing disruptions during the Olympics. Amnesty also reports that Shanghai activists have been put on a tighter leash, barred from leaving the city during the Olympic period and warned against talking to foreigners.  In recent years, China&apos;s standard reply to challenges over its human rights record has been to assert that its double-digit economic growth improves human rights. In that, China echoes the true Olympic spirit: global business. At the nub, today&apos;s Olympics aren&apos;t about puffed up athletes or puffed up nationalism as much as they are about the money. The real gold in the Olympics is reserved for the IOC and its sponsors. The IOC reported income from sponsorships, broadcast rights, ticket sales and licensing of $4.2bn during the 2001-2004 Olympic quadrennium (pdf), the last accounting period for which the IOC published full records, and that&apos;s certain to rise in this Olympic cycle. Income for its global sponsorship programme, The Olympic Partners (TOP), alone has increased from $663m to $866m from 12 global corporate marketing rights purchasers. Domestic sponsorships specific to the host country usually exceed the TOP take, and that should be especially true for the 2008 games when the host country is the world&apos;s largest and most coveted emerging consumer market.  When the IOC and world leaders like George Bush contended after the protests that politics have no place in the Olympics \u2013 a ridiculous notion for an event where participants compete under national flags \u2013 they were really saying: don&apos;t let moral concerns interfere with big business. Olympic sponsors \u2013 who won&apos;t get any free publicity here \u2013 are spending an estimated $2bn to be associated with the games, not because they love sports, but because they want to sell computers and hamburgers and fizzy drinks and cars and phones and watches and shoes all over the world, particularly to 1.3bn Chinese. These games are an affirmation from the sponsors that Chinese consumers are sufficiently advanced to buy their products and from the Beijing authorities that their disciples are sufficiently free to indulge themselves with these trinkets every bit as unnecessary as an Olympic pin.  Today&apos;s true Olympic moment won&apos;t be some pituitary case setting a world record in a sport that&apos;s ignored throughout the four years between Olympics, then sweating out a drug test. It will be a Chinese yuppie plunking down two months salary for one of the sponsors&apos; mobile phones. What we&apos;re seeing in Beijing isn&apos;t China&apos;s coming out party, as some pundits brand it, but a coming in party. The house that Mao Zedong built is entering the big leagues of global consumerism. That this spectacle unfolds under skies as soiled and obscured as the Olympic ideals, in venues as hideous as the Bird&apos;s Nest and the Watercube, tempts belief that there&apos;s a truly Olympian presence, a five ring version of Mao&apos;s picture staring out from the Gate of Heavenly Peace, and like the Great Helmsman, it cannot be pleased with what it is seeing.", "tags": ["China", "Business", "US news", "Olympics 2008", "Sport", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-05T19:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/06/themummy", "sentences": ["Poor John Hannah \u2014 a decent actor who deserves better \u2014 is given some awful lines and awful direction, playing their rackety pal Jonathan, running a club in Shanghai."], "title": "Film review: The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor", "article": "The Mummy franchise now really is dead, dead, dead.

The venture - to be called UCL Partners - seeks to establish London as an intellectual powerhouse for the invention of new drugs and treatments. It is being set up by University College London, its sister hospital UCLH, Great Ormond Street hospital for children, Moorfields eye hospital and the Royal Free Hampstead. The five organisations have a combined turnover of about \u00a32bn. They treat more than 1.5 million patients a year and employ more than 3,500 scientists, senior researchers and consultants. In a statement last night, the partners said: &quot;By pooling resources and expertise we will be able to produce more world-class research in key areas, including cancer and heart disease, and deliver the benefits more rapidly to patients.&quot;  The move followed a recommendation from Lord Darzi, the health minister, for the creation of academic health science centres to speed the transmission of new ideas from the laboratory bench to the hospital ward. There was widespread concern in the medical establishment that Britain would not be able to compete in a global research market without stronger collaboration between academic institutions and healthcare providers. The competition includes long-established partnerships between universities and hospitals in the US, which demonstrated how patients&apos; health could benefit if doctors had access to the latest scientific innovations. The 16 hospitals that came at the top of medical league tables in 2005 were all academic health science partnerships. The UCL partnership will become operational next month, focusing initially on 10 areas of research in which London can aspire to world-class expertise. The priorities will be the nervous system, children&apos;s health, heart disease, transplantation, immunology, ophthalmology, deafness and hearing impairment, dental and oral disease, cancer and women&apos;s health. Malcolm Grant, president and provost of UCL, said: &quot;We have chosen to concentrate on these areas because in all of them we are already leading the way in the UK or Europe. Our goal is to build on that reputation and become genuinely world-class in as many of those areas as possible.&quot; Moorfields and UCL&apos;s institute for ophthalmology are developing a revolutionary gene therapy treatment for inherited blindness. Neil Goodwin, the partnership&apos;s project director, said: &quot;This is about London positioning itself internationally. Other research centres are emerging in Dubai, Singapore and Shanghai.

NXP Semiconductors, the Philips spin-off that makes the system, lost a court battle to prevent the researchers from publishing. People might be able to use this information to ride for free, but the sky won&apos;t be falling. And the publication of this serious vulnerability actually makes us all safer in the long run. Here&apos;s the story. Every Oyster card has a radio-frequency identification chip that communicates with readers mounted on the ticket barrier. That chip, the &quot;Mifare Classic&quot; chip, is used in hundreds of other transport systems as well \u2014 Boston, Los Angeles, Brisbane, Oslo, Amsterdam, Taipei, Shanghai, Rio de Janeiro \u2014 and as an access pass in thousands of companies, schools, hospitals, and government buildings around Britain and the rest of the world. The security of Mifare Classic is terrible. This is not an exaggeration; it&apos;s kindergarten cryptography. Anyone with any security experience would be embarrassed to put his name to the design. NXP attempted to deal with this embarrassment by keeping the design secret. The group that broke Mifare Classic is from Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands. They demonstrated the attack by riding the Underground for free, and by breaking into a building. Their two papers (one is already online) will be published at two conferences this autumn. The second paper is the one that NXP sued over. They called disclosure of the attack &quot;irresponsible,&quot; warned that it will cause &quot;immense damages,&quot; and claimed that it &quot;will jeopardize the security of assets protected with systems incorporating the Mifare IC.&quot; The Dutch court would have none of it: &quot;Damage to NXP is not the result of the publication of the article but of the production and sale of a chip that appears to have shortcomings.&quot; Exactly right. More generally, the notion that secrecy supports security is inherently flawed. Whenever you see an organization claiming that design secrecy is necessary for security \u2014 in ID cards, in voting machines, in airport security \u2014 it invariably means that its security is lousy and it has no choice but to hide it. Any competent cryptographer would have designed Mifare&apos;s security with an open and public design. Secrecy is fragile. Mifare&apos;s security was based on the belief that no one would discover how it worked; that&apos;s why NXP had to muzzle the Dutch researchers. But that&apos;s just wrong. Reverse-engineering isn&apos;t hard. Other researchers had already exposed Mifare&apos;s lousy security. A Chinese company even sells a compatible chip. Is there any doubt that the bad guys already know about this, or will soon enough? Publication of this attack might be expensive for NXP and its customers, but it&apos;s good for security overall. Companies will only design security as good as their customers know to ask for. NXP&apos;s security was so bad because customers didn&apos;t know how to evaluate security: either they don&apos;t know what questions to ask, or didn&apos;t know enough to distrust the marketing answers they were given. This court ruling encourages companies to build security properly rather than relying on shoddy design and secrecy, and discourages them from promising security based on their ability to threaten researchers. It&apos;s unclear how this break will affect Transport for London. Cloning takes only a few seconds, and the thief only has to brush up against someone carrying a legitimate Oyster card. But it requires an RFID reader and a small piece of software which, while feasible for a techie, are too complicated for the average fare dodger. The police are likely to quickly arrest anyone who tries to sell cloned cards on any scale. TfL promises to turn off any cloned cards within 24 hours, but that will hurt the innocent victim who had his card cloned more than the thief.  The vulnerability is far more serious to the companies that use Mifare Classic as an access pass. It would be very interesting to know how NXP presented the system&apos;s security to them.  And while these attacks only pertain to the Mifare Classic chip, it makes me suspicious of the entire product line. NXP sells a more secure chip and has another on the way, but given the number of basic cryptography mistakes NXP made with Mifare Classic, one has to wonder whether the &quot;more secure&quot; versions will be sufficiently so. \u00b7 Bruce Schneier is a security technologist and author: schneier.com/blog", "tags": ["Hacking", "UK news", "Technology", "Data and computer security"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-06T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/07/marksspencer.retail", "sentences": ["Its first store in mainland China is due to open in Shanghai later this year."], "title": "Marks & Spencer leans on Leaver to boost internet business", "article": "Marks &amp; Spencer has handed further responsibiliies to its international strategy director, Carl Leaver, fuelling speculation that he could be a contender to succeed Sir Stuart Rose as executive chairman.  Leaver, the former chief executive of the De Vere hotels group, has been given the additional task of running the retailer&apos;s homewares and internet businesses. He joined M&amp;S&apos;s executive board in May 2007 to develop its international strategy.  The move comes after Rose&apos;s pledge earlier this year to expand some of the roles of his senior management team in an effort to make his own controversial elevation from chief executive to executive chairman more palatable.  He faced down a shareholder revolt at the retailer&apos;s annual meeting in mid-July when more than 20% of investors failed to back his promotion.  Leaver, one of the most senior M&amp;S directors, fills the role left vacant after the appointment of John Dixon as head of food last month. Dixon had been the head of home and the online business, M&amp;S Direct, until taking over from Steven Esom who was fired after a shock profits warning from M&amp;S sent its shares to their lowest level in seven years.  M&amp;S said the board decided last week to hand Leaver the additional responsibilities because he had done a good job on international strategy.  An M&amp;S spokeswoman explained: &quot;Carl was considered to be the best person for the job. It is a way to give him some more hands-on M&amp;S retail experience in two key growth areas.&quot; The homewares and internet businesses generate nearly \u00a31bn in annual sales between them.  The expansion of Leaver&apos;s role has stoked speculation that he could be a contender for the top job when Rose steps down in 2011. Also in the running are Kate Bostock, the head of clothing, and Ian Dyson, the finance and operations director.  &quot;He&apos;s always been one of the contenders for the top job. He&apos;s one of the most senior directors there,&quot; said one retail analyst. &quot;If the stories are true that he was getting bored, then this gives him more of a chance to shine internally.&quot;  However, analysts cautioned that Leaver was still regarded as an outsider who did not know M&amp;S well enough. They noted that he had taken on responsibility for what are still small parts of the business, but had not worked in the retailer&apos;s two main areas, clothing and food.  Leaver, 40, began his career at Pedigree Pet Foods in 1989 and then moved into the leisure industry, working for Forte, Whitbread, running its budget hotel chain Travel Inn, and De Vere. He took charge at De Vere in 2003 at the age of 35 and left three years later when the hotel group was taken over.  Since he joined M&amp;S, Leaver has opened 38 new stores abroad, mainly in central and eastern Europe and struck a deal to expand the retailer&apos;s presence in India where it has 14 stores but plans to open another 30 to 50. Its first store in mainland China is due to open in Shanghai later this year.  M&amp;S wants to beef up its international presence so it accounts for 15-20% of group revenues, up from just under 8% now.  M&amp;S also confirmed the departure of Emma Trayner, a design director on the Per Una clothing brand and the daughter of designer George Davies who created the brand in 2006. She leaves next week to spend more time with her family, after switching to a three-day-a-week role at Christmas. M&amp;S said it would find a replacement internally.

In the aftermath of the Sichuan earthquake, the activities were more sombre than the organisers had anticipated, but at the opening ceremony held in Chaoyang Park officials quietly declaimed their achievements. Five and a half million Beijingers could now speak a foreign language, up from just 3.2 million at the end of 2006, they said. The man behind it all is Liu Yang, the head of the Beijing Speaks Foreign Languages Committee, which was founded eight years ago and entrusted with the task of &quot;creating a good linguistic environment&quot; for the Olympic games. By the end of last year, the committee had organised six English language &quot;park celebrations&quot;, 701 &quot;neighbourhood study spots&quot; and 433 &quot;English corners&quot; in which local students practised rote-learned phrases with one another. They staged foreign song contests, public speaking competitions and free tuition.  The idea, said Liu, was to turn Beijing into the &quot;international city&quot; it was always supposed to be. Although the campaign was spurred on by the Olympic games, efforts would proceed well beyond 2008. The committee also helped to organise a foreign teacher recruitment drive. However, tough visa restrictions in the run-up to the games appear to have stifled those efforts.  The Olympics won&apos;t create miracles, but enthusiasm is half the battle. The 17-day sporting extravaganza represents the culmination of three decades of Chinese efforts to reconnect with the world, and enthusiasm continues to run high.  After the revolution of 1949, Esperanto was the ideal and Russian was positively encouraged, but English belonged to the imperialists. According to Bob Adamson, an expert with the Hong Kong Institute of Education, English was &quot;viewed by some national leaders as a useful tool for the development of the economy but a negative force culturally and politically.&quot; It was put back on the curriculum in the mid-50s, but students would be trained in a Pavlovian manner to recite slogans castigating US foreign policies and proclaiming the inevitable victory of the proletariat. Even Chairman Mao used to study English from the translations of President Liu Shaoqi&apos;s speeches. It was hardly the language of the Olympiad. Long before the Olympic torch was even a twinkle in the eye of China&apos;s leaders, learning English was already high on the agenda. The forces that have driven the country to the brink of its biggest international event in history have also driven its people to embrace English, the lingua franca of global culture and commerce. The education system, at least in the cities, has followed the economy along the capitalist road.  But Liu has sought to target the sort of people who wouldn&apos;t know their Tefl from their elbow. Among them are the cabbies, who remain the most likely to find themselves in the company of foreigners during a 4km snarl-up on the Third Ring Road.  Taxi driver Guo Jingsheng has already been given a special permit to wait outside Beijing&apos;s spanking new Olympic media centre to pick up any one of the several thousand bewildered foreign journalists here to report on the games. &quot;I can understand some English, but I respond pretty slowly,&quot; Guo said. &quot;I don&apos;t have much time to study. I think it is harder for Beijing people.&quot; At least as far as foreign languages are concerned, Beijing has fallen considerably behind the more cosmopolitan Shanghai. Although local polyglots were routinely arrested during the Cultural Revolution, Shanghai&apos;s attitude to foreign languages has rarely been hobbled by political prejudices. Its residents are more amenable to new phrasings: they have had to learn Mandarin on top of their own \u2014 rather distinct \u2014 local dialect. Beijing, on the other hand, is a city of monoglots. Even the Beijing accent \u2014 full of drawling elisions \u2014 seems to confound attempts to learn another tongue. It isn&apos;t that Guo hasn&apos;t been trying. His employer has been offering voluntary evening classes over the past year, and he has been attending when he can.  &quot;They are not forcing us to do it. Most of us just want to do our bit and make some money. Learning English is a good thing to do anyway.&quot; Now in his 50s, Guo is a member of the lost generation. During the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, English classes were cancelled. In 1972, when they were begrudgingly reintroduced in the wake of Nixon&apos;s detente, Guo&apos;s textbooks would have been filled with passages about English being a tool of the class struggle. You still find people, in their late 50s, who know the English words for &quot;hammer&quot; and &quot;sickle&quot; but very little else. The former might finally have some use at one Olympic event.  In recent weeks the press has been packed with stories about patriotic senior citizens, chefs and police officers learning their ABCs in the hope that they can do their bit for the games. Sixty-eight-year-old Auntie Ma told local reporters that learning English made her feel younger. Others said that they just wanted to help out.  Liu is also a senior watchdog in the city&apos;s efforts to eliminate &quot;Chinglish&quot;. The campaign has sought to remove anything that draws attention to the fact that Beijing is not really used to foreign company. The committee&apos;s website has avoided any potential embarrassment by remaining entirely in Chinese.  Already the more notorious solecisms on menus, street signs and government leaflets \u2014 the staple of countless amused blogs and travelogs \u2014 have been replaced with standardised translations. There is still much work to do. In an online test, volunteers are asked to choose between &quot;staff only&quot; and &quot;client stop!&quot;, and &quot;emergency exit&quot; and &quot;emergency out&quot;.  Chinglish, it seems, draws unwelcome attention to the sort of cultural rifts that the Olympic games were designed to smooth over. Foreigners will perhaps be disappointed by the elimination of gems like &quot;racist park&quot; or &quot;Careful Landslip Attention Security&quot;.

Here patriotism is fashionable, revolutionary gestures are hip, and the temptation to believe identity to be essentially national has never seemed so evilly seductive. As a guest of the Shanghai Writers&apos; Association, a state-sponsored literary organisation, for the first time in my life I&apos;m an &quot;official&quot; writer. From the 13th floor of a 50-storey apartment block, in a country bent on demonstrative triumphalism, one gets an odd perspective on Australian literary culture. (I&apos;m tempted to use the word &quot;jaundiced&quot;, since I&apos;m gazing through yellow sky at a vista purely of rubble and skyscrapers.) Compared to China, and perhaps elsewhere, Australia is abashed, sceptical and ironic about its writers. Literary prizes tend to raise little public attention: Australia has no equivalent, for example, of the Man Booker carnival, and there&apos;s no especial public esteem offered to the lucky recipients of awards. The Miles Franklin Award, arguably the country&apos;s most prestigious, raises an eyebrow, but has little hope of competing for cultural attention with the panoptical hyperbole of television or sport. As an individual, I have learnt to practice a kind of Buddhic detachment from literary shortlists - they&apos;re such a contingent, precarious and sometimes perverse system of value; one does well to disinvest, to forget what procedures and judgments they might formally imply, to get on with the more modest, more private work of simply producing a text. I have seen writers tormented by lists, driven to despair by missing listings, and narcissistically inflated to grotesquerie by the mere appearance of their name in a newspaper. The public side of writing includes these ghastly transmogrifications. New writers beware. The ideological import of prizes is another matter entirely. The election of the Rudd Labour government this year recovered hope in the arts community that the languishing sector would be given attention at last. More particularly, the act of public apology to indigenous Australians on February 13, only eleven weeks after coming to power, demonstrated that the new government had some awareness of the force of both language and the symbolic within a national culture, other, that is, than the pernicious regime of &quot;spin&quot;. The announcement of the new Prime Minister&apos;s Award for Fiction was also an early initiative, and in the sense of relief that followed the change of government it was difficult not to believe that a new dawn was coming. It seemed, simply by its announcement, to affirm a new commitment to literary culture, to legitimate its importance, and to suggest, almost heretically, that writing was an activity worthy of serious regard and reward. Now that the shortlist is out, it is also interesting to see what appears to be a heterodox assortment - not just the usual suspects, but a provocative mix that includes a first novel, a second novel and a novel in verse, alongside well-known luminaries like Malouf and Keneally. This alone is bound to cause controversy and seems to signal a new and audacious spirit of cultural appraisal. But should the Australian prime minister have a say in &quot;his&quot; award? Emphatically not. Judging panels are contentious enough without prime-ministerial opinion inflecting adjudication. The winning text risks being seen as content-endorsed, or in some way charged by political approval.

Along the way: There&apos;ll be the Posh and Becks of Chinese badminton, Roger Federer in the tennis (the Murray brothers hit the courts around midday), beach volleyball, fencing, poor horses being forced to serve their masters in Hong Kong, all manner of seafaring Brits in the sailing, and, just getting underway now, Russia v Iran in the basketball. Please keep up my Olympic spirits with emails: observations, Olympic gripes, gentle pedantry, offers of work/friendship/marriage, anything....send it to taimourlay@gmail.com  2am: Right, let the Games begin again.  It&apos;s 9am in &apos;&apos;misty&apos;&apos; Beijing, 2am here in rainy north London, and 5am in war-torn Tskhinvali. One world. One dream. Welcome to day two of the Beijing Olympics. We&apos;ll have live coverage, blogs, comment and instant response to all the breaking news right here throughout the night. According to my trusty, colour-coded timetable that I spent all afternoon trying to decode, there&apos;ll be over 20 sports to run the rule over in the next eight hours and 12 gold medals to be won.  02.05am: Politics schmolitics. Georgia&apos;s athletes spoke out today against Russia&apos;s &apos;&apos;deliberate strategy of aggression&apos;&apos; and President Mikhail Saakashvili has told them all to stay at the Games, despite the ongoing conflict.  First question of the night: Has a war ever broken out on the first day of the Olympics before? Or, indeed, during the Games themselves? If sport is war by other means, watch out for Wednesday&apos;s beach volleyball clash between Russia and Georgia\u2026  02.15am: Britwatch The final session of dressage gets under way in Hong Kong after a rain delay. As things stand Australia are in top spot followed by Germany and the United States with Britain in fourth. With one session left to go, Tina Cook is the best placed Briton in 10th, with Sharon Hunt 14th, William Fox-Pitt 30th and Daisy Dick 32nd.  02.25am: Click here to read about Louis Smith&apos;s journey from hyperactive &apos;Loopy Lou&apos; to pommel horse Olympic finalist.  02 40am: An email finally arrives. &apos;&apos;For those of us distinctly underwhelmed by Dressage at the best of times, are you planning to give us minute-by-minute updates on the Water polo starting at 2:30? Water polo coverage via the medium of text, that&apos;s what I&apos;d like to see. And I&apos;m sure you made up those last two names in the dressage as well. You must think we are stupid,&apos;&apos; complains the mundanely-named Andrew Walters.  If the television shows it, we will cover it. But our fate is in the pro-horsey BBC&apos;s hands, i&apos;m afraid.  02.43am: Dressage - Mary King is up next, the last of the British team.  02.45am: &apos;&apos;Hold it together, Mary!&apos;&apos; exclaims the cut-glass accented commentator. &apos;&apos;Brilliant extended trots!&apos;&apos;, he then adds with gusto. Final score: 38.1! Britain are 12 marks closer to the Australians.  02.50am: Balding Watch - Conor O&apos;Kane is wondering about Clare Balding. &apos;&apos;Does anyone know if she bases her hairstyle on Edward Fox&apos;s in The Day Of The Jackal? The parting is slightly higher than his, but the volume and sweep are exactly the same. Sort of like a well conditioned Shredded Wheat.&apos;&apos; I think we need some documentary evidence to settle this. Give me 10 minutes.  02.54am: Swimming - Phelps is up in five minutes or so. He&apos;s going for his first gold in the 400m individual medley final.  02.59am: Phelps&apos;s main competition will come from fellow American, Ryan Lochte. George Bush is in position at the Water Cube. Go on the Hungarian Laszlo Cseh! Seriously. He&apos;s good.  03.04am: They start with the butterfly. Phelps is half a second under his world record pace. Bald-headed Cseh doesn&apos;t need a swimming cap. He&apos;s in second. Lochte is close by.  03:07am: Cseh and Lochte need to make the move now. Phelps is too strong in the freestyle. A world record is likely.  03.09am: GOLD for Phelps in the 400m individual medley. A new world record. Only seven more to go, then ... Cseh takes a surprise silver, and Lochte bronze.  03.16am: Just minutes after Phelps&apos;s first gold, Rick emails in to gripe and carp and so on: &apos;&apos;In order to truly say Phelps is bettering Mark Spitz&apos;s record, shouldn&apos;t Phelps regrow his moustache? I mean Spitz was giving the other guys a bit of a chance with his facial fuzz masterpiece, said to have increased his weight by at least 2lbs, so lush and absorbent as it was. That&apos;s not to mention the friction factor.&apos;&apos;  03.18am: Team GB - Still at the pool: Jemma Lowe equals the British record (57.78sec) to finish fourth in her 100m fly semi-final. She&apos;s made the final as 6th fastest, having only just sneaked into that semi.  03.24am: Another final at the Cube. Australia&apos;s Grant Hackett, having lost out to Thorpe four years ago (no shame there), is up against South Korean sensation Park Tae-Hwa in the men&apos;s 400m freestyle. There&apos;s a young Beijinger in there, too. He could make history.  03.29am: Park&apos;s got 10 years over the 28-year-old Hackett. He&apos;s watching him all the way. They&apos;re level at 200m.  03.31am: Park wins gold in the 400m freestyle. The South Korean stretches away at the 200m mark. It looks like he could have gone too early but he sustains the break and the 18-year-old wins it. Zhang Lin from China makes a late burst and gets silver. Bronze goes to the American Larsen Jensen, and Hackett languishes in 5th. George Bush waves his flag again.  03.37am: Coda to that 400m. &apos;&apos;Hackett shouldn&apos;t feel too bad,&apos;&apos; chirps Billy Paxton. &apos;&apos;He&apos;s the husband of Australian singer-songwriter Candice Alley. He has a songwriting credit on her last album and is the only other credited writer besides Alley, so despite this poor result tonight he has the consolation of another career to fall back on.&apos;&apos; Yes, I suppose they can pool their resources.  Sorry. Meanwhile, Phelps is on the podium, hand on heart, eyes moistening. Bush looks pretty happy too.  03.44: Team GB Two days after her 19th birthday, Hannah Miley is up next in the 400m individual medley final. She&apos;s in lane eight. But American Katie Hoff is the favourite.  03.52am: Australia&apos;s Stephanie Rice makes the strongest start. But the Hoff is still there. This would be an incredible late comeback. &apos;Smiley Miley&apos;, as the typically imaginative British press have dubbed her, is a long way back.  03.52am: Stephanie Rice wins gold and sets a new world record (4:29:45). And she lets off a primal scream/woop as she does it. The Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry takes silver and Hoff gets bronze. Miley is in 6th - and it&apos;s a poor time, well off her best. &apos;Smiley Miley&apos; lives up to her (awful) nickname - the British press: the best in the world - by giving a very cheerful interview afterwards. She&apos;s still got the 200m to look forward to.  03.58am: Men&apos;s Basketball - Russia beat Iran 71-49, with the naturalised American JR Holden scoring 19 points. That ain&apos;t Olympism, surely.  04.00am: Zhang Lin gets a huge cheer on the podium - he&apos;s the first Chinese man to win an Olympic medal in the pool. The South Korean anthem then blares out for Park Tae-Hwa. Bush Watch: Word reaches me across the newsdesk that George Bush stumbled in the stands at the Water Cube. Must have been all that overly vigorous flag-waving. If there&apos;s a photo of him on his keester, I&apos;ll find it.  04.08am: It&apos;s raining in Beijing, delaying the start of the tennis. But acid showers don&apos;t put off the male volleyball players: China beat Austria 2-0.  04.14am: Team GB - Chris Cook finishes 7th in the 100m breaststroke semi-final in 1:00:81. It&apos;s one second off his personal best and he doesn&apos;t make the final. &apos;&apos;I&apos;m just not on form. That time should have been easy for me to do,&apos;&apos; he says afterwards.  04.19am: Men&apos;s handball Defending champions Croatia beat Spain 31-29.  04.23am: I asked for emails to lift my Olympic spirits. Instead I receive this from Tom Stone, who&apos;s obviously under the absurd illusion that human rights are more important than Yngling: &apos;&apos;The Beijing Olympics are a disgrace. Don&apos;t watch it, don&apos;t blog about it, don&apos;t acknowledge it is happening - without at least first thinking about what this the world&apos;s greatest sport&apos;s event is supposed to represent.&apos;&apos;  04.26: Brit Watch - Another final in the pool. Britain&apos;s women are in lane eight for the 4x100m freestyle relay, the slowest qualifiers. China were the fastest. You make the prediction. I could be mishearing things. The BBC commentators were questioning whether Stephanie Rice was an underwear model or not. Adrian Moorhouse reckons she would be very good at it: &quot;She is very fit...&quot;  04.32am Britain are in equal fourth, surpassing all expectations at the half way stage.  04.34am: But they&apos;ve fallen away now. The Netherlands take gold. Silver to the US. Bronze to Australia. Great Britain take a second off the domestic record but even that&apos;s not enough to catch the four Dutch ladies cavorting in victory at the end of the pool.  04.42am: Team GB Archery - a quarter-final against Japan for the women&apos;s team of Naomi Folkard, Charlotte Burgess and five-time Olympian Alison Williamson. Britain lead by two. &apos;&apos;The hooter for the timing on the archery is clearly the horn off a 1993 Volkswagen Jetta. It&apos;s unmistakeable. I&apos;m surprised Eddie Butler didn&apos;t pick up on it,&apos;&apos; says Gareth Bennett.  04.44am: An email from far, far away! &apos;&apos;Good Morning you poor soul,&apos;&apos; writes Matt, who I warm to immediately since no one else understands me. &apos;&apos;I&apos;m in Seoul spending a Sunday afternoon watching the Korean Olympic coverage on TV. I can&apos;t understand the commentary but it appears Park Tae hwan has won 14 gold medals today; either that or they are showing his 400m race on a constant loop. The commentary was hilarious of the final 25 metres: another 50 and I think the commentator would have soiled himself. Oh, and Korean coverage is making me long for the BBC&apos;s.&apos;&apos; The BBC coverage has been ... Barry Davies-less so far. And that&apos;s not a good thing.  05.02: Team GB - It&apos;s very close in this one. All level with one end to go. Eddie Butler says the word &apos;&apos;sultry&apos;&apos; for the 9th time - it&apos;s hot out east, he seems to be stressing - and there goes the car horn again.  05.10am: Team GB make the semi finals of the women&apos;s archery, seeing off Japan 201 to 188. A 9, 10, 10 in their last set ended the sultry Japanese resistance. They will now face China at 9am-ish BST. Tired of reading my London-based witterings? Read Andy Bull&apos;s Beijing-based profundities. He lays down the gauntlet to Michael Phelps here.  05.13am: What are Asians making of this Chinese Olympics? &apos;&apos;I don&apos;t think the Koreans see any problem with China hosting the Olympics or its human rights record or the rampant nationalism on display: the Korean personality is quite similar. I&apos;m convinced they are more concerned with winning more medals than Japan and protesting about USA beef imports,&apos;&apos; says our Korea correspondent, Matt.  05.22am: Give just a hint of self-loathing, and the supportive emails positively roll in. &apos;&apos;Don&apos;t despair,&apos;&apos; counsels Christian Wolff. &apos;&apos;I&apos;m relying on Guardian updates here in Bangalore, since Indian state TV Doordarshan seems determined to ruin my Olympics experience - despite possessing exclusive national broadcast rights, most of their coverage consists of two elderly gentlemen sitting in a studio re-capping the success of one female badminton player and the failures of the archery team, while completely ignoring any of the LIVE events going on in Beijing...&apos;&apos;  05.25am: The gymnastics are in full swing. Tumbles, tinny classical music, impossibly young Chinese girls looking terrified of the consequences of failure... Speaking of the BBC coverage, Victoria Bingham writes: &apos;&apos;Is is just me or do Matt Baker&apos;s excitable Geordie mutterings seem wildly out of sync with the grace of the gymnastics. Shouldn&apos;t they have him on canoeing or something. He&apos;ll be well used to that. That&apos;s all they do on Blue Peter, isn&apos;t it?&apos;&apos;  05.30am: Gold for China in the women&apos;s 10m air pistol final. Guo Wenjun takes gold. Russia&apos;s Natalia Paderina wins silver with bronze going to Georgia&apos;s Nino Salukvadze.  05.34am:  Andy Bull gets very excited by women&apos;s fencing. Read his theatre review here.  05.39am: A missive from Down Under. &apos;&apos;The Aussie commentators seem a bit disappointed that they didn&apos;t win three golds in the pool this morning,&apos;&apos; writes Paul Meek in Brisbane, who immediately emphasises that he&apos;s a Kiwi. &apos;&apos;Yesterday was the first time they hadn&apos;t won a medal on the first day since 1996 - oh, the humanity! And not sure whether Stephanie Rice has been an underwear model, but she did do a bit of modelling for the local FHM earlier in the year.&apos;&apos;  05.45am: &apos;&apos;Despite actually being in an Olympic city (Hong Kong) I am also bizarrely reliant on your commentary to keep me up-to-date,&apos;&apos; writes the magnificently monikered Kester Bramley. &apos;&apos;All the action is on free, terrestrial TV but since my building has no aerial I have what Pink Floyd called &quot;45 channels of shit on the TV to choose from (choose from)&quot; but no Olympics. I could go out and watch the equestrian events, I suppose - but trottage, or whatever it is called, on a Sunday? Would rather sit by my screen hoping for a blitz of Gary Naylor insights thanks.&apos;&apos; Oh, Naylor, Naylor, wherefore art thou, Naylor? It&apos;s dawn in London. We expect him soon.  05.50: Fencing and judo are continuing apace. To the Beijing University of Technology for the women&apos;s badminton (I almost felt like an anchorman just then), where defending champion Zhang Ning of China has recovered from a shaky start to beat Thailand&apos;s Salakjit Ponsana in three sets, 21-23, 21-17, 21-7.  06.00am: Olympic spirit shames world leaders into stopping all wars for good - Georgia&apos;s Nino Salukvadze took bronze in the 10m air pistol final. After putting down her pistol on her final shot, she wiped tears from her eyes and embraced her Russian opponent, Natalia Paderina. &quot;I&apos;ve been really nervous,&quot; she said afterwards. &quot;Since yesterday I thought we would leave the Games. The Russian political leaders, our political leaders and other state political leaders should sit and talk about this.&quot;  06.05am: We&apos;ve made it past 6am and the reward on the BBC is ... well, i&apos;ll let Conor O&apos;Kane explain: &apos;&apos;You sit up all night with Rishi Persad, and what&apos;s your reward? Adrian bloody Chiles. That&apos;s what the license fee is being used on, flying him to Beijing? As if that&apos;s not bad enough, he&apos;s forgotten the delightful Christine Bleakley from the One show, so we get Hazel Irvine and her massive teeth.&apos;&apos; I think it might be bedtime, Conor.  06.13am: By all accounts the tennis has finally got underway. It&apos;s been a long rain delay, meaning the Murrays won&apos;t be playing their first doubles match for a while yet.  06.16am: Team GB In the sailing, the 49er races have started. Steve Morrison and Ben Rhodes have three 30 minute races today. They&apos;re currently fourth in the opener. Also in Qingdao, Britain&apos;s Yngling crew of Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson are leading from the front.  06.29am:  Germany beat Angola 95-66 in the men&apos;s basketball.  06.30am: Team GB Gymnastics. Qualification phase - Subdivision 2: GB, Italy, Japan and the US.  The shiny-blue-leotarded Great Britain team is warming up for the vault. Remember that Beth Tweddle&apos;s hip injury means she will only compete on the asymmetric bars and the floor disciplines.  06.35am: Conor O&apos;Kane has had a coffee and comes back for more. He obviously pays attention to his sailing, too. &apos;&apos;One of the 49er class boys in the sailing, Stevie Morrison, hopes his boat&apos;s name &apos;Little Miss Pipe Dream&apos; will prove to be apt. The Dictionary says: &apos;A pipe dream is a fantastic hope or plan that is generally regarded as being nearly impossible to achieve.&apos; Little Miss Easy Prospect might have been better...&apos;&apos;  06.40am: Team GB  A good start on the vault for 16-year-old Becky Downie. Her 15.050 is so good it quite literally makes her American opponent cry.  In other gymnastics news, the Americans&apos; leotards are awful: garish red, an ugly great big star, the balance is all wrong. The Italians have gone for delightfully classic white with sparkly bits.  06.52:  Heads up: Former Bluebells bassist Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the China v US basketball game at 2pm BST.  07.00am: Team GB Cycling - The women&apos;s road race is coming up shortly. Nicola Cooke, Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route.  07.03am: Team GB Ben Rhodes and Stevie Morrison made a solid start in their first 49er class race, finishing fourth in Qingdao.  07.06am: There&apos;s no accounting for taste. Sean Dickinson emails from Shanghai to dispute my gymnastics analysis: &apos;&apos;Just wanted to wake you up if you weren&apos;t already asleep which, judging by your presumably worsening eyesight and taste, is evidenced by your lack of appreciation for yellow stars on skimpy red leotards.&apos;&apos;  07.11am: Team GB Cycling The women&apos;s road race is go!  07.14am: Gymnastics Rebecca Wing opens on the beam for GB. I&apos;m told it was good.  Sean Dickinson is pining for the green fields of Hollyoaks: &apos;&apos;Go Tweddle! She&apos;s from my hometown of Chester, and what she did looked impressive to me.&apos;&apos; Beth Tweddle&apos;s score of 15.65 puts her fourth in the bars - the top eight go through. She hit the bar with one of her feet during her routine, costing her points.  07.17am: Team GB Yngling Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson are first in the overall standings after placing fourth in their third race. Holland and Finland follow close behind.  07.23am: In the men&apos;s Judo (66kg), a showdown between a Russian and a Georgian has been narrowly averted. Miklos Ungvari of Hungary beat the Georgian Zaza Kedelashvili to set up a quarter-final with Russia&apos;s Alim Gadanov. The two countries will just have to settle their differences on the battlefield.  07.30am: Road race 110.6km to go. The riders are all bunching together. No one&apos;s yet made the break. Speaking of breaks, I&apos;m off in 30 minutes. Must...keep...typing....But never fear: Alan Gardner will see you through to the end with a laughably easy three-hour shift.  07.34am: Team GB News of Ben Ainslie in today&apos;s Finn event. He&apos;s finished fourth place in race three, which puts him second overall.  07.38am: Team GB Gymnastics  Sixteen-year-old Hannah Whelan does a jig or two in her floor routine. Folkish violins accompany her smiles and wiggles. Then she attempts some real gymnastics. Oh dear. A stumble. Then a pike. Not bad.  07.46am: Team GB Sailing Ben Rhodes and Stevie Morrison finish third in the second 49er race. That puts them second overall. One more race to come today.  07.55am: Team GB Gymnastics Beth Tweddle&apos;s floor routine begins. She needs it to go well.  It&apos;s decent - 14.950 - but she is unlikely to make the final. Overall, Britain lie fifth after four rotations. Team qualification in the top eight will be struggle. Becky Downie is hovering close to individual qualification but there a lot of women to come.  08.13am: Hello all. Taimour has headed off to stare blankly into space somewhere, and I&apos;ll be your Olympic guide for the next few hours. News on Beth Tweddle, and the GB women road racers asap...  8.20am: Team GB rowing Wellity, well, we have a real medal hope to discuss, ladies and gentleman. Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter are going in the mens lightweight double sculls, and they&apos;ve apparently set their hearts on gold. The pair have started smoothly and are holding a comfortable advantage, with two to go through.  8.27am: Team GB rowing Purchase and Hunter are safely through into the semi-final, winning by a length and only 3.7sec outside the world record. Good start for the boat boys.  8.35am: China have picked up another gold, in the women&apos;s synchronised 3m springboard. Guo Jingjing and Wu Minxia, the reigning world and Olympic champions have wrapped things up again. Russia took silver, with Germany collecting bronze.  8.45am: We got mail. And yes, it&apos;s the first of the day from Gary Naylor. &quot;I note from your 7.00am update,&quot; notes Naylor, &quot;that &apos;Nicola Cooke, Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route.&apos; Unless all the competitors are stopping for a pleasant Sunday afternoon picnic with a glass or two of Pimms, I suspect that an average speed of 20km per hour won&apos;t secure a medal.&quot; Well, you know how the British like to do things Gary. In fact, after some rummaging, I can scribble in my official correction highlighter that the women will not be cycling a mere 72km... it&apos;ll be more like double that, once they&apos;ve got up into the mountains (where it&apos;s pouring, apparently), and done a wee jaunt along the Great Wall. They&apos;re not there yet, though.  8.54am: Team GB Cooke, Pooley and Laws are safely ensconced in the peloton... although they may as well be in the pool, the amount of rain that&apos;s washing around their wheels as they head out of Beijing. Meanwhile, Billy Joe Saunders has given his opponent, Turkey&apos;s Adem Kilicci, an absolute tonking in the welterweight class. He won 14-3, and will fight again next Sunday.  8.59am: News from Beijing. Apparently, such is their hatred for the west*, the Chinese equivalents of Adrian Chiles and Hazel Irvine have started mocking our athletes&apos; weight. &quot;Watching here in Beijing on TV, my flatmate just informed me that the Chinese commentators amusingly said the British women couldn&apos;t succeed in diving because they were too fat,&quot; emails Nicky Goh. &quot;To qualify it slightly, they did go on to say that with their weight, it was extremely unlikely they could achieve the necessary body strength to allow for the turning power necessary.&quot; Oh, that&apos;s all right then. *Of course, we know they don&apos;t hate us really  9.04am: Team GB archery Eddie Butler&apos;s mellifluous tones are telling me about the women archers, who are up against the Chinese. Win, and they&apos;re guaranteed a medal; lose, and they&apos;ll have to duke it out for bronze. Currently, it&apos;s in the balance.  9.08am: Team GB rowing Some more success in the mens lightweight four, where Chambers, Clarke, Lindsay-Fynn and Mattick are through in their heat, coming home behind China.  9.15am: Team GB archery At the halfway stage, the British girls trail by just two points, but they need to keep hitting the bullseye to make up ground on their opponents. Interestingly, the announcer in the archery arena appears to be American. Oh, and on that subject, it&apos;s the clash of civilisations, sorry, China v USA in the basketball later today, and Lawrence Donegan will be blogging about it LIVE. It doesn&apos;t start till 3pm, though, so stick with me until then.  9.23am: Team GB archery China will take on the winners of Korea v France for the women&apos;s team gold medal. The Brits can still take bronze though, and it&apos;s no shame losing to the Chinese, who&apos;ve won every gold in female arrers since the 1984 Olympics. In the cycling, the women&apos;s team are well positioned out in a very wet road race. Pooley is right up at the front, and all three managed to avoid a nasty crash that happened a short while ago.  9.32am: Team GB Ben Ainslie is second in the overall standings in the Finn, having won the fourth race ahead of Zach Railey of the USA. Railey currently heads the field, with a score of 11, but Ainslie is just five points behind on 16 (the lower the better). In the rowing, it&apos;s the women&apos;s heavyweight quadruple sculls, where China are out in front, with one spot in the final up for grabs. In fact, they&apos;re miles out in front...  9.35am: Team GB rowing Britain&apos;s women&apos;s heavyweight four, who are the reigning world champions, will go next against the Germans, with both expected to be China&apos;s main oppo in next Sunday&apos;s final.  9.39am: Correction corner. My hideous ignorance of the archery has been revealed. &quot;I think you&apos;ll find it is the South Koreans, not the Chinese, who have won all those women&apos;s archery gold medals,&quot; says Philip Reynolds, all the way from Wellington, NZ. &quot;And it&apos;s not called the bullseye; it&apos;s called the gold or (in Olympic archery) the ten.&quot; I was employing the vernacular, Phil.  9.43am: Team GB rowing The women&apos;s quadruple scullers are moving well out on the water, putting some deep blue between them and the German team.  9.45am: GB being reeled in by Germany, can Grainger and her crew hold on...? Less than 500m to go.  9.48am: Team GB rowing There was enough left in the tank and the ladies will take their place in the final. They&apos;ll be up, as ever, against the Chinese. You can get some background on Katherine Grainger and the GB quad here. Sir Steve (Redgrave) reckons they did pretty well out there.  9.52am: Cycling There&apos;s a Russian out in front in the road race, and she&apos;s putting some pressure on the field. The British trio are still well in contention for a medal, though. They&apos;ve been cycling for nearly three hours now.  9.55am: Team GB rowing In the lightweight men&apos;s quadruple sculls the chaps have pulled hard and qualified in second. I imagine they&apos;ll all be off for an erg now, to celebrate.  10.00am: Team GB cycling Emma Pooley has made a break on the climb, and she&apos;s in a group tailing the Russian, Boyarskaya. Cooke is back in fourth with a strong finish up her sleeve. Hopefully.  10.05am: It seems the media centre in Beijing is falling apart. At least the BBC&apos;s studio is. A violent squall has halted the women&apos;s archery bronze play-off - where we could be looking at a first medal for Team GB - and the women&apos;s cycling road race is similarly pluvial. But the real drama, as I say, is at BBC hq, where someone has joined Hazel Irvine in the studio holding a bucket. They&apos;re crouched discretely behind the sofa... but I can definitely see them holding the bucket.  10.12am: Nigeria are playing Japan in the football. I&apos;m backing the Super Eagles there. Hopefully we&apos;re going to get a GB medal before long, with real prospects in the cycling and the archery. I&apos;d be reet chuffed to break such news, I can tell you. A Chinese rider has slid into the storm drain in the women&apos;s road race. Plenty of names still in the mix... Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli, the oldest lady in the field has just had a go at the front!  10.19am: The cyclists have just reached the highest point along the Badaling Great Wall, and with twelve kilometres to go Tatiana Guderzo of Italy is leading.  10.27am: Medal news. While we wait for Britain to get on the medal table, Thailand have snapped up their first gold. The improbably named Prapawadee Jaroenrattanatarakoon (or Charoenrattanatharakul if you want to go with the Guardian&apos;s Olympic guide) has bossed the field in women&apos;s 53kg weightlifting. Apparently she used to be known as Junpim Kantatian, which is altogether less of a mouthfull. Yun Jin-hee of South Korea took silver and Anastassia Novikava of Belarus bronze. Elsewhere, the rowing has been suspended for the day due to the weather.  10.31am: 1km to go in the women&apos;s road race. Nicole Cooke, fifth in Athens, appears to have lost contact... but apparently she&apos;s recovered.  10.33am: Team GB Cooke leading with 100m to go.  10.34am: Team GB GOLD! Nicole Cooke has claimed the first British medal of Beijing 2008. Some confusion on the broadcast for a moment there, with the Italian Guderzo&apos;s name flashing up on screen as the winner... But Cooke is jubilant!  10.38am: Cooke, swathed in one of those plastic ponchos you get at festivals, is enjoying this. Several vigorous fist pumps, and the Welshwoman couldn&apos;t care a jot about the rain now.  10.42am: A big hand should go to Emma Pooley, who finished 23rd, for her earlier efforts in chasing down the leader on the climb. Cooke really seemed to benefit from her team-mates&apos; support, something she lacked four years ago. That&apos;s the 200th gold medal at Olympic Games for Great Britain.  10.45am: Team GB archery The BBC&apos;s rainfall woes in the studio appeared to have been dealt with... and we&apos;re off to the Bronze medal match in the women&apos;s team archery.  10.49am: The clouds are lowering above the archers, as Britain complete their first end (of four) with a score of 48. The French are just behind on 46.  10.52am: The American guy on the mic is doing a neat job, as the second end gets under way. He might well be Chinese, of course, with a nifty Yankee drawl, but hey...  10.55am: And after the second end, it&apos;s all square, 97 each.  10.56am: Hold on... one of the French arrows has been remarked, and they&apos;re ahead.  11.01am: Good start to the third end, with a full ten for GB, but it&apos;s still tight as we head towards 18 completed arrows. Six more will decide where this bronze is going. GB: 149 plays France: 150.  11.03am: &quot;Isn&apos;t archery just darts for posh people?&quot; wondered Gary Naylor some time ago. Three arrows left and France look like they&apos;re going to sneak it... three points the advantage.  11.06am: Nine, 10, eight for GB. France need 25 points to win from three...  11.08am: France win the bronze medal. Gah! No success in the women&apos;s team archery, then. Two points the margin of victory, and the GB arrer-wielders obviously weren&apos;t posh enough. &quot;No - darts for posh people is d&apos;arts,&quot; counters Philip Reynolds. Touch\u00e9, Naylor?  11.12am: Medal ceremony. Nicole Cooke &quot;conquered the course and tamed the opposition&quot;, apparently. In fact, she beat them in a bike race. And she&apos;s being awarded a gold for her troubles now. Sing with me: &quot;God save our gracious Queen...&quot;  11.18am: Nigeria have knocked one in against the Japanese to take a 1-0 lead in the football. Sharp side-foot finish in the box by Obinna Nsofor. And Everton&apos;s Victor Anichebe has taken the field.  11.22am: The Cooke report. So, we&apos;ve picked up our first necklace of the Games, and it&apos;s a shiny gold one to boot. Read about Nicole Cooke&apos;s success in the women&apos;s road race here.  11.31am: The indomitable Koreans have opened up a lead against the Chinese in the women&apos;s team archery final. Meanwhile, the Croatian water polo team reckon the moustaches they have grown for the Olympics will help them go all the way. &quot;It&apos;s for good luck, but we can&apos;t talk about it, it&apos;s a secret, if I tell you, it will ruin it,&quot; Igor Hinic told Reuters, ruining his precious secret in one flap of the tongue. Maybe they&apos;re right, though. It worked for Mark Spitz, after all. In fact, it&apos;s Spitz Day here at Rebranded Website, and we&apos;re all sporting handle bars.  11.35am: South Korea win gold in the women&apos;s team archery, setting a new world record in the process. China will have to settle for silver.  11.42am: Dave Godman, meanwhile, has trawled his way right down to the 5.22am entry to concur with Christian Wolff&apos;s struggles to comprehend Indian television&apos;s coverage of the Games. &quot;You only watch the Olympics on the state channel here [India] if you have a finely tuned appreciation of surreal farce,&quot; says Dave, avoiding the opportunity to stick a knee in the ribs of the BBC&apos;s (excellent) coverage. &quot;Eight years ago I watched in a hotel room. Random live visual feeds were appearing on the screen, with no sound commentary. It was left to the two talking heads in the studio to figure out what was going on. At one point a handball game manifested, but neither of the commentators had ever seen a handball game before.&quot; Them and me both, to be honest.  11.47am: Nigeria are 2-1 ahead now. No Joseph Yobo there, of course, because the Nigerian FA forgot to include him in their squad. Much to the delight of Everton fans, presumably.  11.53am: Turns out Victor Anichebe scored Nigeria&apos;s second, ultimately the winner. Will England regret not calling him up when they still could? It&apos;s not like the national set-up is exactly overflowing with confident strikers...  11.59am: Team GB swimming Gemma Spofforth and Elizabeth Simmonds have made the semi-finals of the women&apos;s 100m backstroke, after finishing 3rd and 4th in their heats respectively.  12.05pm: Cricket corner. Steve Harmison has knocked over a couple of wickets in the Test. You can follow the action with Carrie Dunn here. Lots of stroking going on at the Water Cube, meanwhile.  12.10pm: Medal news. China have another gold, this time in the women&apos;s judo 52kg weight category. Xian Dongmei beat An Kum Ae of North Korea to retain the title she won in Athens. The crowd quite enjoyed that.  12.19pm: Team GB swimming Robbie Renwick from Aberdeen is racing in the men&apos;s 200m freestyle. He appears to be in second...  12.21pm: Renwick came home in third, and is in with a shout of making the semis. The Baltimore Bullet (surely a more nautical nickname would work better?) Michael Phelps has just flopped into the pool for a lazy 200m of his own. Britain&apos;s Ross Davenport is also racing.  12.27pm: Phelps, sans tache, finishes in second, but is surely saving himself for the crunch. Davenport was sixth. Turns out no one else on the desk has gone with the spirit of Mark Spitz Day, and I&apos;m the only one who turned up with a stylish facial accoutrement. Bah.  12.35pm: Medal news. Japan have taken gold in the men&apos;s 66kg judo, Masato Uchishiba triumphing against Benjamin Darbelet of France. Team GB swimming Despite his third place, Robbie Renwick&apos;s slower heat has meant he will not be in the semis, his time just a hundredth of a second short. Davenport, who was in Phelps&apos; heat, is through though.  12.38pm: Team GB badminton Tracey Hallam is thwacking a shuttlecock back and forth against Kristina Ludikova of the Czech Republic in the women&apos;s singles round of 32.  12.42pm: Team GB swimming Kate Haywood and Kirsty Balfour are off in the women&apos;s 100m breaststroke...  12.44pm: Haywood finished third, Balfour fourth, and they&apos;re both potential semi-finalists.  12.47pm: They&apos;re both through, with the 11th and 14th best times respectively. The Australian Leisel Jones broke the Olympic record in that final heat, so she&apos;s the fish to catch. Haywood and Balfour will need to get to the final before I&apos;m going to be lured into medal talk, though.  12.55pm: In the Olympic football, we&apos;ve got Netherlands versus the US, and Jacqui Oatley on the mic. Real Madrid&apos;s Roysten Drenthe hammers a left foot volley over the bar for the Dutch, as Aston Villa newbie Brad Guzan practises semaphore. Earlier, Ronaldinho scored twice in Brazil&apos;s 5-0 larruping of New Zealand. Argentina nicked it 1-0 against Australia, while Cameroon beat Honduras 1-0.  1.02pm: Team GB swimming Liam Tancock, the British hope in the 100m backstroke comes home third in his heat after torpedoing off the platform. He&apos;ll be back in the semis later.  1.06pm: Tancock goes out quick, that&apos;s what he does. He&apos;s pleased, as is Gregor Tait who&apos;s also in the semi-finals. And you&apos;ll be smiling when you&apos;ve cast your mince pies over these photos from today.  1.10pm: GOAL! USA 0-1 Holland Ryan Babel finishes from close range after some confusion in the box. Liverpool&apos;s wingman gets his first goal of the tournament.  1.14pm: Team GB boxing Bradley Saunders has stopped his Ghanaian opponent Samuel Kotey Neequaye in the first round of their light welterweight match-up. Biff boff.  1.18pm: Just getting a replay of that Saunders fight, and he really crunched the little fella with a body shot. Layed him flatter than a new patio.  1.31pm: The geriatric form of Brian McBride is trundling around the more deserted parts of the pictch, ie. the Dutch half. How old is he? Answers in an email. Meanwhile, shattering news for all male Olympic-watchers:  Anna Ivanovic has PULLED OUT. &quot;This is one of the worst moments of my career,&quot; she said. And I can only echo that statement.  1.34pm: Half time score update: Serbia 1-2 Ivory CoastUSA 0-1 NetherlandsBelgium 1-0 ChinaItaly 2-0 South Korea  1.38pm: Team GB swimming In the women&apos;s 400m freestyle, Jo Jackson has just finished second to Katie Hoff, the US bellwether in the pool, in a time that is just under a tenth of a second outside Hoff&apos;s new Olympic record. Rebecca Adlington, who is being tipped as a British gold medal prospect, goes in the next heat.  1.44pm: Adlington pushes the current world record holder Federica Pellegrini all the way in their heat, the Brit finishing second with the second-quickest time overall. Pellegrini also broke the Olympic record just set by Hoff, as it goes.  1.50pm: Team GB badminton Gail Emms and Donna Kellogg are playing their Chinese opposition in the women&apos;s doubles. Earlier, Tracey Hallam progressed in her singles match, with a 21-18, 21-13 victory.  1.53pm: The US men&apos;s 4x100m freestyle relay team has just set a new record over in the Water Cube. And Michael Phelps wasn&apos;t even near the pool. Apparently they&apos;re the US B-team. It&apos;s those Speedos, I tell you, should be banned... Great Britain are about to go in the second heat.  1.58pm: Team GB swimming The British lads have gunned their way through that heat, finishing in fourth and sealing a spot in the final. They smashed the British record by five seconds, in the process.  2.01pm: China have hoovered up another gold, this time in the men&apos;s 56kg weightlifting. Long Quinquan won from Anh Tuang Hoang of Vietnam and Indonesia&apos;s Eko Yuli Irawan.  2.06pm: GOAL! USA 1-1 Netherlands Sacha Kljestan hammers a strike through the Dutch stopper after Freddy Adu&apos;s clever reverse pass. Yes, that Freddy Adu.  2.12pm: Team GB hockey The girls from Blighty are taking on the Germans as I type, with the scores currently tied nil all. Someone has just been shown a green card - which means little to me, but is &quot;akin to a professional foul&quot; apparently. The best news though is that the legendary Barry Davies is providing the verbal annotation.  2.17pm: GOAL! USA 2-1 Netherlands Jozy Altidore, newly-signed by Villarreal, has put the septics in front. Meanwhile, according to Sean Dickinson in Shanghai, someone in the China-Belgium game has been &quot;sent off for what appeared to be hitting someone [else] off the ball when the ref&apos;s head was turned&quot;. If that&apos;s clear.  2.25pm: Team GB hockey - GOAL! Germany 1-0 Great Britain &quot;Beautifully done,&quot; exclaims Barry Davies, as the GB ladies turn their opponents inside then out. Moments later Germany take the lead from a penalty corner.  2.30pm: GOAL! Germany 1-1 Great Britain Back in the game. A penalty corner at the other end and the ball squirts into the goal off the wet surface.  2.33pm: GOAL! Germany 2-1 Great Britain Ach, as soon as they&apos;re level there&apos;s a loss of concentration at the back by Britain and the red-clad Germans have the lead again.  2.35pm: Olympic football - GOAL! USA 2-2 Netherlands The 34-year-old Gerald Sibon, who once played for Sheffield Wednesday, drills a free-kick under the wall and past Brad Guzan. That will certainly change the state of Group B - although I&apos;m not entirely certain in what way.  2.46pm: Final scores in the football for you: Serbia 2-4 Ivory CoastUSA 2-2 NetherlandsBelgium 2-0 ChinaItaly 3-0 South Korea It appears the hosts ended up with just nine men on the pitch in their loss to Belgium. Seems like the inventors of football are as adept at rolling over as we are.  2.50pm: Team GB badminton After that flurry of GOALs I forgot to inform you that Emms and Kellogg were defeated in their first round doubles match against China&apos;s Zhang Jiewen and Wei Yili, losing 21-19 21-13. Still 2-1 to Germany in the hockey.  2.55pm: Pat on the back dept. As this mbm prepares to roll up its bumper Olympic guide and head into the Beijing sunset, David Lloyd&apos;s email lands: &quot;I&apos;ve been living in north China for around 18 months now, generally having a great time in an amazing country. So I&apos;ve obviously been looking forward to these Olympics for a long time as you might imagine. To date however it&apos;s not been the best of starts. I was up at 5.30am to witness the torch relay but couldn&apos;t get within 30 metres of the road barrier, then the typhoon in South China kept me and my mate stranded just long enough to miss the football match in Tinajin last Wednesday night, for which I had tickets. Now to cap it all, I find that of the endless CCTV channels showing Olympic coverage, including the specially set up one, none have any spoken or written English language coverage. Considering all the effort the Chinese have put into these games, that&apos;s a big oversight if you ask me, especially when considering the tens of thousands of English speakers who&apos;ve travelled here specially, not to mention the good ol&apos; expat community.&quot; Glad to have been of service, David. We&apos;ll be here all fortnight.  3.01pm: Team GB hockey - GOAL! Germany 3-1 Great Britain Looks like a wrap there then. With day two drawing to a close, I shall bid you all goodbye. If you fancy following the almighty ding-dong that&apos;s bound to ensue between China and the US in the basketball, slam-dunk you way across to Lawrence Donegan&apos;s blog now. And if diving and histrionics are more your thing, why not join Paul Doyle for the FA Community Shield.

Its practitioners tend to lock themselves in a box of absolute concentration and present a rather detached face to the public. Outside influences are best avoided. But there was no shutting out the storm that blew over the archery field, just as the semi-finalists were turning into gold or bronze finalists. It lightly fell on the British trio of Alison Williamson, Naomi Folkard and Charlotte Burgess as they lost to China, and it absolutely drenched the French as they did the inevitable and lost to Korea. Western Europe were poured out of the top places by the waters of the Far East. Of the two European teams, France dried themselves off the better. Sophie Dodemont shot an eight with her last arrow to secure a first-ever medal for the French women&apos;s team. It was close, but without Williamson at her best the British team were always chasing the game, as I&apos;m sure they don&apos;t say in archery clubs. When the weather had been kinder in the morning, with no wind and no rumblings of the thunderstorm to come, Korea made a grand entrance. With their first 24 arrows they not only made a good Italian team look decidedly second-best - Natalia Valeeva is the reigning world champion - they also smashed the world record set by themselves, naturally, in Shanghai 2006. Ranked one, two and three in this tournament, Yun Ok-Hee, Joo Hyun-Jung and the remarkable Park Sung-Hyun rattled up 231 points from a possible 240. They looked a bit sorry that it wasn&apos;t more. They say they have spiritual powers handed down by their ancestors, and something special going on in their fingertips. Whatever, they were also on the promise of 50,000 dollars each for winning gold. Britain had qualified in second place and that meant they would avoid Korea. They beat Japan in the quarter final, despite trailing by a point going into the final 6-arrow end. Here, Williamson was at her best, scoring a couple of 10s when it really mattered. With home support behind China, the semi final was always going to be tough. In vain, the announcer asked the crowd not to blow whistles as the archers were about to shoot. Britain looked a little ill at ease. Not so Korea. With just as many of their own supporters in the stands as Chinese, they shut out the whistles and steam-rollered to victory. If they had lost it would have created a storm in archery that would have made the day&apos;s tempest seem like a soft shower of summer rain. Talking of sweet rain, poor Alison Williamson couldn&apos;t stop a few tears from falling as she spoke to us of her disappointment. Sometimes when you shut things out for a time, a point of release is reached.

It shows that Chinese women have much narrower variances in bust, waist and hip than those in the west. The US market needs more than double the number of clothes sizes to reach the same proportion of the population compared with China, the study claims. It was produced by Alvanon, a New York-based consulting firm, which scanned more than 28,000 people at shopping malls in four key regions of China. Alvanon clients include retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, Tesco and Laura Ashley. The study found that body shapes in China are, on average, much smaller and more homogenous than in the US and Europe. Men have similar average heights in China and the US but have dramatically different average chest and waist sizes as well as weight. Body shapes in the UK are similar to those in the US.  Whereas the US clothing and shoe market is expected to increase gradually to $323bn (\u00a3168bn) by 2011 - up 7.3% from 2006 - the Chinese market is expected to nearly double to $184bn, according to Euromonitor International. &quot;There is an unprecedented retail opportunity in China,&quot; said Janice Wang, the Hong Kong-born chief executive of Alvanon and a former Chase Manhattan banker. &quot;As China becomes much more wealthy, we are seeing this huge move to luxury products. The Chinese are very fashion conscious.&quot; The survey comes as M&amp;S prepares to open its first store in mainland China. And Topshop is thought to be close to opening a branch in Shanghai, while also looking at locations in Bejing and Hong Kong. Because of changes in diet and lifestyle, the younger generation in eastern China is growing taller and heavier, bringing it more into line with westerners. More than 30% of Chinese city dwellers are considered overweight, and women aged 35 to 45 have put on the most weight.

But there was no shutting out the storm that blew over the Archery Field just as the semi-finalists were turning into gold or bronze finalists. It fell on the British trio of Alison Williamson, Naomi Folkard and Charlotte Burgess as they lost to China, and it absolutely drenched the French as they did the inevitable and lost to Korea. Western Europe were poured out of the top places by the waters of the Far East. Of the two European teams, France dried themselves off the better. Sophie Dodemont shot an eight with her last arrow to secure a first-ever medal for the French women&apos;s team. It was close, but without Williamson at her best the British team were always chasing the game, as they no doubt say in archery clubs. When the weather had been kinder in the morning, with no wind and no rumblings of the thunderstorm to come, Korea made a grand entrance. With their first 24 arrows they not only made a good Italian team look decidedly second-best - Natalia Valeeva is the reigning world champion - they also smashed the world record set by themselves, naturally, in Shanghai 2006. Ranked one, two and three in this tournament, Yun Ok-Hee, Joo Hyun-Jung and the remarkable Park Sung-Hyun rattled up 231 points from a possible 240. They looked a bit sorry that it was not more. They say they have spiritual powers handed down by their ancestors and something special going on in their fingertips. Whatever, they were also on the promise of $50,000 (\u00a325,000) each for winning gold. Britain had qualified in second place and that meant they would avoid Korea. They beat Japan in the quarter-final despite trailing by a point going into the final six-arrow end. Here Williamson was at her best, scoring a couple of 10s when it really mattered.  With home support behind China, the semi-final was always going to be tough. In vain, the announcer asked the crowd not to blow whistles as the archers were about to shoot. Britain looked a little ill at ease. Not so Korea. With just as many of their own supporters in the stands as Chinese, they shut out the whistles and steamrollered to victory. If they had lost it would have created a storm in archery that would have made the day&apos;s tempest seem like a soft shower of summer rain. Talking of sweet rain, poor Williamson could not stop a few tears from falling as she spoke to us of her disappointment: sometimes when an athlete shuts things out for a time, a point of release is reached. She now dries herself for the individual competition starting tomorrow . &quot;I am really disappointed,&quot; said Williamson, an individual bronze medallist in Athens four years ago. &quot;I feel basically that I let the other two down, that I should have pulled my weight more and I didn&apos;t. &quot;It&apos;s really frustrating and disappointing when you are that close to a medal that you are almost touching it. Four years is a long time to wait to try again.&quot; Burgess, from Stockport, said: &quot;The weather didn&apos;t help.

On this night of nights the gentle giant from Shanghai was a man possessed, the heart and soul of a country united by the outlandish dream of beating the most powerful basketball nation on earth. It was entirely fitting that he opened the scoring in this contest, sinking a three-point shot from what seemed like downtown Beijing. &quot;I shot the ball and it just went in,&quot; said the seven-foot five-inch Yao, who has spent his entire career parked under the basketball net, flipping in two-point shots from all of six inches. Fleetingly home hopes soared. But more often than not sport is the place where unlikely dreams go to die and this was one such night. One return trip down the court, one LeBron James dunk later and reality made its presence known. Forget the nonsensical allegories which painted this, the opening game of the Olympic basketball tournament for both sides, as a clash of civilisations. Forget, too, the presence of George W Bush, who turned up to hitch his fading reputation on an inevitable American triumph over the coming global superpower. This was, when all was said and done, a game of basketball - with all the razzmatazz, noise and colour it entails. The few remaining souls who still doubt China&apos;s willingness to embrace western culture need worry no longer. They even do cheerleaders these days, not to mention hot dogs on sticks. But if East was more than a match for West when it came to unspeakable grub and sparkly Lycra, it came up woefully short when the court was cleared and whistle blown. There was a simple reason for this; in basketball one against five are never good odds. This US squad - replete with NBA stars - has talent to burn, boasting global brands James (Cleveland Cavaliers), Kobe Bryant (LA Lakers), the old-school legend Jason Kidd (Dallas Mavericks) and a fistful of hungry young guns - Chris Paul (New Orleans Hornets), Carmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets) and Dwayne Wade (Miami Heat) - to name but three. China had Yao although, on a night when most of his team-mates froze in the spotlight, one or two did not, most notably the point guard Chen Jianghua, who briefly took over the burden of responsibility. One move, which saw him dribble from one end of the court to another, stripping the great Bryant of his dignity en route, will live long in the memory. The two points gave the home side an 11-9 lead. Alas for Chen, alas for China, Bryant is a prideful man who is disinclined to put up too long with such public humiliations and he quickly restored the US&apos;s lead with a couple of baskets. In the end the Los Angeles Lakers star - widely acknowledged as the greatest individual talent in the game - scored 13 points, many of them sculpted by athleticism and agility of which others can only dream. Yet it says much about the talent available to the US coach, Mike Krzyzewski, that Bryant took second billing on the night to his team-mates, James, who scored 18 points, and Wade, who shot a perfect seven out of seven shots, scoring 19 points. China&apos;s top scorer was, naturally, Yao, who managed 13 points, the majority of them in the first half, when the two sides exchanged the lead. But it is exhausting work carrying a nation of 1.3 billion people on your back and eventually not even the big man was capable of stemming the tide. Four points up at the end of the first quarter, the US established a 49-37 advantage by half-time. Thereafter it was simply a question of by how much, as the greater size and strength of the American players wore down their opponents. With defeat inevitable, and vital qualification games ahead, the Chinese coach, Jonas Kazlauskas, took the precaution of resting his star but even from the bench Yao struck an imposing figure as he cajoled his team-mates in pursuit of a dignified ending. That they did not - a 31-point defeat is not the result the Chinese nation had imagined, not even in its darkest moments - was a pity but from a neutral&apos;s perspective it was hardly unexpected. Nor was it hard to explain. &quot;Psychologically it was very difficult for us to play in this game because these guys [James, Bryant] are heroes to some of our players,&quot; said Kazlauskas afterwards. This was an honest appraisal from an honest man but he had no reason to feel so glum. In Yao Ming China he has the greatest hero of all.", "tags": ["Olympics 2008: Basketball", "Olympics 2008", "Sport", "USA Olympic team", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-10T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/11/healthandwellbeing.transport", "sentences": ["But if you go to some of the cities where cycling has a prouder history than in Britain - cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin or Shanghai - you will find very few cycle helmets."], "title": "Stuart Jeffries explores British and French attitudes to wearing cycle helmets", "article": "&apos;Why on earth,&quot; says Anne Portehault, chaining her bicycle to a railing opposite the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Paris, &quot;would I want to put a cycle helmet over my hair? I would look ridiculous.&quot; Well, not ridiculous, I counter, but you would certainly look less chic and enviably coiffed than currently. The 39-year-old is angry enough that from the autumn, Parisian cyclists will be required to wear fluorescent jackets. &quot;They only cost a couple of euros but they make anyone who dresses well - such as me - look absurd. That yucky yellow - I&apos;ve got nothing to match it in my wardrobe. What am I going to do?&quot; But what about the danger of your brains spilling out of your head after being knocked over by one of the French capital&apos;s aggressive drivers? Isn&apos;t ridiculousness a small price to pay? I remind Portehault that it was nearly on this spot, outside the BHV department store on the Rue de Rivoli, in 1980 that the life of one of France&apos;s great penseurs, Roland Barthes, was brought to an end when he was run over by a van. &quot;I pay a lot of attention to the traffic,&quot; replies Portehault. &quot;I&apos;m very careful when I cycle. So, no, I don&apos;t think looking ridiculous is worth it.&quot;  It&apos;s worth pointing out that it&apos;s not only Parisian women who worry about their hairdos being mangled by helmets. A young man chaining his bicycle to a lamppost, who declines to give me his name, says: &quot;I&apos;ve spent ages gelling my hair. I&apos;m not going to ruin all that work, thanks very much.&quot; I find Marco Simioni, 45, a Paris-based architect and artist who originally hails from Vicenza, poised to ride off on a hired cycle. &quot;I&apos;ve only been cycling for four months and I try to be very careful, but it&apos;s true I run a risk not using a helmet. It&apos;s a risk I&apos;m prepared to take.&quot; I&apos;ve come to Paris to find out why there is such a difference between French and British cyclists when it comes to wearing helmets. A few years ago, when I worked in Paris for the Guardian, I always wore a helmet when I cycled through the Marais to my office near the Op\u00e9ra Garnier and looked in disdain at the flowing locks of my more hirsute fellow cyclists as they cheated death and looked glamorous. Now, thanks to mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb&apos;s bicycle rental scheme, V\u00e9lib, which was introduced just over a year ago, there are more Parisian locks flying in the wind than ever. In France there is a slang phrase &quot;C&apos;est relou&quot;, which translates as &quot;It&apos;s boring.&quot; &quot;C&apos;est relou de porter un casque,&quot; several cyclists told me. It&apos;s boring to wear a cycle helmet. But not just boring: ugly, unstylish, fundamentally un-French. &quot;There is a great cultural difference between the English and the French,&quot; says Anne Portehault. &quot;We are very, very independent and very rebellious. This is the home of liberty, after all.&quot; Portehault, who rides horses in the morning and works in an American law office in the afternoon, doesn&apos;t use the sturdy V\u00e9lib bikes that can be hired from ranks one finds every 300m in Paris. Instead, she favours a venerable yellow number dating from the 1960s, which used to belong to her sister. &quot;It works but it looks rubbish. So no one&apos;s going to steal it.&quot; I&apos;m not sure that Gallic rebelliousness tells the whole story of why, if you cross the Channel, helmet-wearing cyclists become much rarer. Perhaps, and this is just a theory, the British are more risk-averse than continentals. Indeed, the difference is not just between Britons and continental Europeans, but between many anglophone countries and others. Cycle helmets are common in the UK, the US, New Zealand and Australia. But if you go to some of the cities where cycling has a prouder history than in Britain - cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin or Shanghai - you will find very few cycle helmets.  Of course, it&apos;s unfair to over-generalise. On a nearby side street, I find a Parisian cyclist wearing not only a helmet, but a fluorescent jacket and sensible gloves. Why, I ask 35-year-old Laurent Marin, do you not bend your knee to Paris&apos;s prevailing sartorial strictures for cyclists? &quot;A few years ago I was cycling at the Porte de la Villette when I saw a motorcyclist was run over by a car. It was horrible. I rang my wife and said: &apos;I&apos;m going to be late because I&apos;m going to buy a helmet.&apos; Now I won&apos;t let my wife or my children go cycling without helmets.&quot; Courier Felix Nizard, 20, tells me that he wears a cycle helmet his friend gave him. It seems several sizes too big, I say. &quot;Yes, but it looks kind of cool with the advertising all over it,&quot; he retorts. &quot;I feel happier wearing it now with all the V\u00e9libbers around. They are making the city more dangerous.&quot; The number of cycle journeys has grown exponentially in Paris since the introduction of the V\u00e9lib scheme, and many of the inexperienced users do indeed &quot;cycle like idiots&quot;, as Marin says. That said, there have only been three reported cases of V\u00e9libbers being killed. On France&apos;s bicycling blogs, this is a hot issue. One blogger, a man who styles himself Ludovic Bu, wrote recently: &quot;The figures are clear: three deaths in a year and 24m journeys on V\u00e9lib bicycles. That amounts to a 0.0000125% probability of killing yourself while using a V\u00e9lib bicycle.&quot; But he adds that in Paris last year, 53% of those who died or were injured on Paris streets were motorcyclists, 22% pedestrians, drivers of four-wheeled vehicles 18% and cyclists only 7%. &quot;Thus, one can well see that it is less dangerous to travel on a bicycle than on a motorbike, on foot or by car.&quot; I&apos;m not at all sure these figures warrant the inference that cycling in Paris is safe, but that doesn&apos;t matter: such rhetoric contributes to a blithe attitude on the part of Parisian cyclists towards sustaining death or serious injury. It makes them less likely to even consider whether wearing a helmet would be worthwhile. Delan\u00f6e&apos;s aim, according to many Parisians I spoke to, is to make Paris more like Amsterdam, where cycling is such a venerable and popular mode of transport that cyclists ride without helmets with a confidence that actually has some foundation. One Dutch idea that both the British and French authorities might consider introducing is the law of &quot;strict liability&quot; whereby, in any collision between a cycle and a car, the motorist is deemed to be responsible. This makes motorists much more wary. And what about the woonerf, a street or group of streets where pedestrians and cyclists have legal priority over motorists, and where motorised traffic is restricted to a speed limit of &quot;walking pace&quot;? In Germany, they have similar zones called Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich, where motorised speed limits are restricted to 7km/h. If only Paris&apos;s Rue de Rivoli or, say, London&apos;s Embankment became woonerven or Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich tomorrow, then I might consider leaving my helmet at home. But they aren&apos;t, so I won&apos;t. Matt Seaton, the Guardian&apos;s former cycling columnist and author of On Your Bike!: The Complete Guide to Cycling, distinguishes sharply between cycling in continental northern Europe and elsewhere. &quot;In northern Europe, especially in countries such as Holland and Denmark, there is much more of a consensus that bicycles have priority. In Britain, it&apos;s much more of a war of all against all. France is somewhere in between. In Britain our road environment is much more of a free market and that may make cyclists ride more quickly and aggressively than they do in the rest of Europe.&quot;  It is also worth pointing out that in Britain we tend not to ride the sit-up-and-beg bicycles common in Holland; we ride mountain bikes and racing cycles that, you might well think, facilitate aggressive cycling. I once saw a cyclist respond to being abused by pedestrians for jumping a zebra crossing by leaping off his bike waving a D-lock like a mace. There is a medieval flavour to London&apos;s cycle scene. In that road environment, British cyclists dress up like extras from Rollerball or Blade Runner, almost as if they are going to war and expecting serious injury. The cycle helmet is part of the uniform.  But is wearing a helmet actually going to save one from injury? This is a vexed issue among cyclists. The fact that London&apos;s tousle-haired Tory mayor Boris Johnson now eschews a cycle helmet has focused the debate. &quot;It&apos;s a very bad example for the leader of a capital city to set,&quot; said Simon Turner, a 41-year-old cyclist who suffered permanent brain injuries as a result of falling from his bicycle in Richmond Park. &quot;He&apos;s saying, &apos;Don&apos;t worry, take the risk.&apos;&quot;  &quot;In my efforts to do the right thing,&quot; Johnson replied in a newspaper column, &quot;I have ended up giving offence to both opposing factions. As soon as I started to wear a helmet , I was denounced as a wimp. As soon as I was pictured not wearing a helmet, I was attacked for &apos;sending out the wrong signal&apos;.&quot; Cyclists, he argued, should have the right to choose &quot;hatless, sun-blessed, windswept liberty&quot; or &quot; helmeted security&quot;. What would happen if Boris&apos;s brains were spilled, say, at the cycle lights next to Islington Central Library on Holloway Road near the mayor&apos;s home? Would cyclists pull up to his twitching, prone form, solemnly remove their helmets and say, &quot;Told you so&quot;? The issue was recently aired in the London Evening Standard, where columnist Dr Mark Porter defended Johnson&apos;s decision to cycle helmetless on the grounds that in over 20 years in medicine he had never had to treat a cyclist with a life-threatening head injury. &quot;Indeed, the Bicycle Helmet Research Foundation estimates that the average cyclist would have to pedal the roads for more than 3,000 years to suffer a serious head injury, let alone one that would be mitigated by a cycle helmet,&quot; wrote Porter. &quot;Research suggests that the mere donning of protective gear such as helmets encourages cyclists to take more risks on the road, and therefore, paradoxically, increase their risk of serious injury.&quot; Porter added that he was happy for his children to cycle without helmets. This column provoked a letter from Dr Andrew Curran, consultant paediatric neurologist at Alder Hey hospital. &quot;The probability of having an accident resulting in a serious head injury which could be mitigated by a helmet is mercifully low: there are many kinds of high-impact crashes where a helmet, or any form of body protection, would not save you. But the issue is that if an unhelmeted child is involved in a non-fatal crash resulting in a serious head injury, there is a 50 to 70% chance it will result in a serious cognitive deficit . . . It seems sensible that, just as we immunise children against serious diseases they are very unlikely to catch, we ensure they take precautions against the possibility of head injuries, however rare. The blase attitude of Boris Johnson and cycle campaigners on this point surprises me.&quot; The rise in cycle helmet use in the past quarter of a century suggests that Johnson is swimming against the tide. From the mid-80s onwards, a steadily increasing proportion of cyclists has worn helmets. The Department for Transport found in 2006 that cycle helmet-wearing had risen from 28.2% on major roads in 2004 to 30.7% in 2006, while on minor roads the figures were 9.6% and 13.8%. The total number of deaths of cyclists in the UK has been falling almost steadily since 1934, when there were 1,536 cyclist deaths. In 2007, there were 136. No one, however, has yet demonstrated that the rise in helmet use has made any contribution to that decline. Indeed, there is a statistic that associates a rise in helmet use with an increased risk of cyclists suffering  serious head injuries. When cycle helmets were made compulsory in Australia the number of people cycling fell by a third, and although the number of serious head injuries fell, too, it only fell by 11%. So, despite a large rise in Australia in helmet use, the risk of head injury among those who continued to cycle actually rose. Of course, one can&apos;t infer from this that cycle helmets cause serious head injuries, but the statistical association of a rise in both helmet use and in head injuries is embarrassing for those who advocate helmets. What is a bicycle helmet supposed to do? The short answer is that it is supposed to reduce the risk of both skull and, more importantly, brain injuries caused by the brain jolting around inside the skull as the result of collision. According to the DfT&apos;s paper Bicycle Helmets: A Review of Effectiveness, &quot;While simple fractures to the skull can heal, brain injuries, unlike those to other body regions, do not and can lead to long-term consequences. &quot;A bicycle helmet is supposed to perform three functions, namely: &quot;reduce the deceleration of the skull; spread the area over which the forces of impact apply; and prevent direct impact between the skull and impacting object.&quot; The DfT paper concludes: &quot;There is now a considerable amount of scientific evidence that bicycle helmets have been found to be effective at reducing head, brain and upper facial injury in bicyclists.&quot; How are they supposed to do that? According to the DfT: &quot;These three functions can be achieved by combining the properties of the soft, crushable material [usually polystyrene] that is incorporated into helmets, usually referred to as the liner . . . and the outer surface of the helmet, usually called the shell.&quot; Historically, helmets had hard shells but now the tendency is for there to be no shell at all or a very thin shell. The blogosphere, however, seethes with sceptics who argue that bicycle helmets do not work when they are struck by fast-moving vehicles or when a cycle helmet hits a kerb or road at speed. Some argue that they may produce a false sense of security and a cavalier attitude to risk. &quot;Their design-intended strength is equivalent to a impact speed of about 12.5mph,&quot; writes cycling blogger Patrick Herring. &quot;They were never intended for collisions with cars. They&apos;re not a cycle-equivalent of motorbike crash helmets (and you can&apos;t wear one of those because your brain would boil). They work by the outer shell keeping the polystyrene in place whilst it absorbs the deceleration by being crushed. Counter-intuitively, if the shell breaks in the initial contact the total energy absorbed is a lot less: a broken helmet is one that didn&apos;t work.&quot; This, he says, means that above about 12.5mph the helmet has little effect; certainly it won&apos;t make a 30mph crash feel as if it happened at 17.5mph.  One psychological study, meanwhile, suggests that helmets make cyclists more, not less, vulnerable. Two years ago, Dr Ian Walker, a travel psychologist at the University of Bath, had his bicycle fitted with a special sensor and then went off riding, sometimes wearing a helmet, sometimes not, and sometimes wearing a wig intended to make him look like a woman. It is, incidentally, marvellous that a) there is such a thing as a travel psychologist and b) that they get to do such fun-sounding research. The sensor measured the proximity of passing traffic. When Walker rode bareheaded, cars gave him a wider berth than if he was wearing a helmet. They gave, on average, an extra 85mm. Dr Walker concluded that this was because his dearth of proper kit indicated a lack of cycling competence that might result in wobbling, unannounced 45-degree turns, unscheduled wheelies etc. Helmetless, he looked more vulnerable. When he wore a helmet, motorists passed closer. On two occasions they passed so close that they hit him. &quot;One of the main findings,&quot; says Dr Walker, &quot;was that a behaviour intended to reduce risk (putting on a bicycle helmet) might paradoxically increase one&apos;s overall level of risk because drivers react to its presence by changing their behaviour.&quot; But it&apos;s what Dr Walker did next that I find particularly suggestive. He cycled about wearing a black wig that made him look - at least to his satisfaction - like a woman from the rear. He found that motorists gave him a wider berth than normal, which he ascribed to a gender effect: motorists are more considerate of women rather than men cyclists. Of course, there is another possibility, namely that Dr Walker was so poor a female impersonator that motorists, possibly out of solidarity with real women, or conceivably because they thought he looked barmy, steered clear. I haven&apos;t seen the photos of the experiment, so I can&apos;t be sure. What I find interesting is that this research suggests that women cyclists with more hair than is fair (or men cyclists impersonating such women) are less likely to be run over than mugs like me who wear cycle helmets. Which brings us back to Anne Portehault.  I forgot to tell her that there is a new, putatively stylish cycling helmet cover devised to &quot;encourage females to cycle&quot;. The &quot;cycle head dress&quot; is essentially a hat that you can put over your helmet to make yourself look chic. Have a look at their range at hi1-designs.com.  Portehault probably wouldn&apos;t have liked the cycle head dress. After all, Parisiennes like her have no need of helmets or helmet covers, and they have research from Bath University to support their lifestyle choices. There she goes now, cycling down the Rue de Rivoli, one of Paris&apos;s more terrifying one-way boulevards, wind in her hair, as chic as can be as the photographer takes her picture. You&apos;ll have to excuse me for feeling more than a little jealous. If only I had more hair and was a woman, I think as she rides off towards the Palais de Louvre, I might feel safe without a helmet as I cycled. Or maybe I should get a wig.

Le Pen, 79, triggered soul searching among many in France after reaching the run-off in the 2002 presidential election. Since then his party&apos;s fortunes have suffered.  Le Pen has already auctioned off his bullet-proof car, a Peugeot, on eBay to raise money before agreeing to part with his old headquarters, nicknamed &quot;the cruiseliner&quot;.", "tags": ["France", "World news", "Politics", "Immigration and asylum", "Jean-Marie Le Pen", "The far right", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-11T17:15:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/aug/11/dragonsdenseries6episode4", "sentences": ["Ching-He Huang has just had her show hijacked by her parents, brother and sister-in-law who have turned up unannounced from Shanghai, and it&apos;s all gone a bit Surprise Surprise."], "title": "Dragons' Den - Series 6, Episode 4", "article": "Forget dedication.

Last week, Deborah Meaden loosened her purse-strings to invest in the Misfuelling Prevention Device, and Heidi continued her frankly rather worrying Peter Jones obsession. This week, I&apos;m advised we should be eagerly anticipating yet more underwear, and a self-wiping motorcycle helmet. 8.58pm: The dishes being served up on Chinese Food Made Easy are making me hungry. Ching-He Huang has just had her show hijacked by her parents, brother and sister-in-law who have turned up unannounced from Shanghai, and it&apos;s all gone a bit Surprise Surprise. And I&apos;ve gone a bit tearful. 9pm: &quot;These are the Dragons...on their way to the Den.&quot; For this is DRAGONS&apos; DEN. Montage of the Dragons being mean. They know how to succeed. They are enterprising and wealthy, and built their fortunes up from scratch (just like Rex. Grrrr). You know who they are, you know what they do, so let&apos;s get on with it. 9.03pm: Semi-clad man alert! Presumably he&apos;s modelling the new range of underwear. Heidi, do you think Peter will try some on? 9.04pm: Michael North from Somerset wants \u00a350,000 for 10% of his business. He bids them greeting, and he wants to introduce them to the &quot;Fresh Olive Oil Club&quot;. Olive oil is even more diverse than wine, and thus lots of people will want to join the club. Well, 57 people will. That&apos;s all he has so far. Theo asks him about himself. He used to be an engineer. He sold insurance. He lived in Greece, and then moved to the UK. He is very keen on olive oil. James asks about his business plan. There won&apos;t be one bottle of olive oil delivered a month - &quot;This is something you&apos;ve got to try and get your head around,&quot; says Michael - and he admits that he&apos;s not very good with figures. So James does some elementary maths testing with him, planning for the next three years, and realises that his money is not safe with a man who cannot multiply by three. Deborah likes olive oil because she likes food, and wants to know when she can expect her bottles to be delivered. Michael waffles about her not understanding his business, and Duncan agrees that they&apos;re all idiots. Heh. Deborah then tells him that she buys expensive olive oil in the shop all the time, and Michael tells her that she doesn&apos;t. She says she does. It then descends into him telling her that she is wrong every time she says something, which is an interesting tactic to get money out of someone. Michael distributes samples of oil and teaches them how to taste it. Peter is laughing as he drinks. Deborah smiles and then hides it. Peter says that he can feel pepper at the back of his throat, and is told that he&apos;s dehydrated. WRONG and DEHYDRATED - what next? Criticising James&apos;s facial hair? Theo says, &quot;You are the easiest person in the world to fool. I don&apos;t want to invest in your business. If I invested in you, I would have to run your business.&quot; He&apos;s out, obviously. James says membership clubs are not big businesses, and he is out. Duncan says it is a great business model to get a couple of hundred quid off thousands of people each year, and use their money to travel round the world having a great time. Ouch. Deborah would love to invest because it&apos;s dear to her heart, but as a consumer she wants olive oil on her salad in the summer, not when they can be bothered to send her a bottle. She&apos;s out. It&apos;s all on Peter. He likes &quot;colourful&quot;, viz a viz Levi Roots, and thinks it&apos;ll be successful, but it&apos;s a shame that he can&apos;t get into the retail end of the market, and he&apos;s out. 9.17pm: A man from Essex selling pants utterly loses his train of thought and stops talking. Then he brings in a lovely model in lovely pants, and Deborah covers her eyes in horror. Theo likes pants, as we know, particularly lovely ones, and especially these special ones that sculpt, ahem, a gentleman&apos;s undercarriage. Peter thinks they are a bad idea because it&apos;ll just result in disappointment when the pants are taken off. &quot;By the time you get to the pants, it doesn&apos;t matter if you look good or not!&quot; says Duncan. No investment. Is that it? Oh, Dragons&apos; Den, you tease us. 9.19pm: Two ladies want \u00a380,000 for 10% of their company, which produces the Buggy Boot. Basically it&apos;s like a little platform to keep your basket on when you go round, and load your bags on to when you&apos;ve finished. They&apos;ve had lots of interest already. Peter Jones has five children, whom I&apos;m sure he takes round the supermarket all the time, and he wants to know how long they&apos;ve been going and how much they&apos;ve invested (answers: three years, and \u00a3100,000). At the moment, there&apos;s no other product that does what their product does, but there are simpler ones. Duncan is pulling his sceptical face and wants to know how you&apos;d disassemble the platform for installation on another buggy. The ladies tell him you&apos;d need a key. He&apos;s not impressed. He&apos;s out. Theo asks about expenditure and what they&apos;ll do with the money. They want \u00a340,000 to pay for an admin person. Wow. Let&apos;s all apply for that job. Theo&apos;s out. Deborah wants to talk about the distribution deals they&apos;ve got, which combine to 3,000 units overall. James asks how they got the money they invested - &quot;Did you remortgage your homes?&quot; They did NOT. They worked and saved. Deborah offers \u00a380,000 for 30% of the company on the condition they write off their directors&apos; loans. Peter was thinking about investing, but he&apos;s out. James would think about it, but he wants a higher percentage, so he&apos;s out, but he recommends that they accept Deborah&apos;s offer. The nice ladies go to the back of the room to have a quick board meeting. They come back and ask if she&apos;d negotiate. Of course she won&apos;t bloody negotiate. They then ask what she&apos;ll do for their company. HAHAHAHA, are you seriously asking? Like you&apos;re doing her a favour by letting her invest? Deborah quite rightly slaps them down, they accept the original offer, and there are hugs and kisses all round. 9.31pm: Oh dear me, Mark from Liverpool is pitching his motorcycle visor by wearing his helmet and then spraying water on his head. Theo tells him to go away and talk to some manufacturers. Peter tells him to go and get a patent, and then make a fortune. A lady with a dog pitches the Poo Pod, which is like a dog-lead handle that flicks open, and then when your dog messes when you&apos;re out for a walk, you can bag it and clip it in there. The Dragons like it but they&apos;re not going to invest. &quot;Good luck, come up with some other ideas,&quot; says Peter. &quot;Seems like you&apos;re pretty good on dog poo.&quot; 9.34pm: Father and son David and Robert want \u00a350,000 to enter the Formula Ford championship. He&apos;s in his leathers, he has a billion trophies, and David is quite rightly proud of him. I&apos;m welling up again. In return for investment, they are offering ad space on the car, and 40% of Robert&apos;s driving earnings over the next ten years. Robert does a little talk about how he believes he will make it as a Formula One driver. That&apos;s quite touching too. Shockingly, Deborah isn&apos;t all that bothered about car-racing, so she wants to know some hard facts about rankings and famous people she might have heard of who have driven in the same sort of competition. Robert likens himself to Jenson Button. Duncan tells him investment is a gamble, and he doesn&apos;t want advertising space. &quot;We know the only way we can progress his career is to find serious sponsorship,&quot; says David. Duncan can&apos;t get past them offering 40% of future earnings, and he and David have a little swipe at each other. Peter likes fast cars, and thinks this is a great opportunity. He suggests that he and Theo could advertise their company Red Letter Days on the car, and then gets carried away with the excitement. Theo tells him to shut up, and asks David and Robert what would happen if the results in the competition didn&apos;t go as well as expected. &quot;We&apos;d have to raise more money,&quot; says David, and then lets slip that to move up the classes towards Formula One, an investor would need to fork out millions. And Robert doesn&apos;t get paid for driving in Formula Ford. So he&apos;s basically asking for enough money to get him into Formula One, and there&apos;s no guaranteed return on any of it. Duncan&apos;s out; James admires the passion and wishes him well, but he&apos;s out; Deborah says it&apos;s not a business opportunity, so she&apos;s out, and Robert is actually going to cry. Theo says it&apos;s not investable for any of his companies, including the ones he runs with Peter, so he&apos;s out. Peter is impressed with what they&apos;ve done, but he&apos;s out. 9.45pm: A man pitches an internet site where you can track people according to their mobile phone signals. Peter is worried that wives might find out their husbands are in the pub when they should be at home. A couple pitch a big old slidey photo frame for parents and schools to put children&apos;s artwork in. Duncan likes them and buys one for a tenner. Peter wants one too. They don&apos;t like them enough to invest, though. 9.48pm: Andrew has bought a factory rather than a house. He wants \u00a3150,000 in exchange for 15% of his company, which is called Rapstrap. He manufactures polyurethane cable ties that you can clip down and reuse, and are intended to replace the nylon cable ties that are on the market at the moment. Shouldn&apos;t it be called Wrapstrap? Seeing as it&apos;s a strap that wraps round, and all? Theo decides to destroy the product sample he&apos;s given, and wonders why people wouldn&apos;t prefer the stronger nylon cable tie. Andrew tells him that people don&apos;t need strong cable ties, they just need to tie things together, and Theo suggests using Velcro instead. That&apos;s too expensive, counters Andrew. Under questioning from James, we learn that Andrew has had interest from lots of places but has put production on hold until he secures investment. Duncan asks about finance and patents and the legal shenanigans, and then Deborah wants to know exactly what has been patented, which is a reasonable question. Andrew does a little gesture-based demonstration, which is strangely endearing, and then confesses he&apos;s expecting to make a loss in Year One, and a tiny profit in Year Two. Peter is not impressed by the slim profit margins. Theo declares himself out, and Andrew asks if he&apos;d stock the (W)Rapstrap in his stationers&apos; shops. He laughs. James will make him an offer of \u00a3150,000 for 50%, shared equally with Duncan, as they&apos;re both shareholders in Choc Box, which retails electrical stuff. Gosh, this is all very dramatic. Peter tragically admits that James and Duncan offer better value than him, and Deborah concurs for her, and so they&apos;re out. Andrew tries to negotiate. Why do these people never learn? They don&apos;t budge, and he accepts the offer. That was a strangely unembarrassing episode of DD, wasn&apos;t it? Usually I have to switch over for some kind of relief from the blushing by proxy. Now, I&apos;m flicking over to Channel 4 for you-know-what. Next week, we have tongue-tied ladies and blow-drying gentlemen!

These are somewhat different times, though, and so it is that a new face in town has parked itself right across the street. As this establishment&apos;s waitresses shriek in unison at arriving customers: &quot;Welcome to Hooters Beijing!&quot; Behold the new face of Chinese capitalism. And please try to stay looking at its face.  Whilst other bars in the area were ordered to close for the Olympics by the state authorities, Hooters was never under threat, being one of Beijing&apos;s relatively tiny amount of sports bars, and a source of faintly misplaced early-capitalist pride. Following successful openings in Shanghai and Hangzhou, the Atlanta-based chain last year rolled out its nuanced vision of post-feminism-with-buffalo-sauce to Beijing, and the busy new branch is pushing itself as the perfect place to keep your eye on several events at once, on the many screens garlanded with Olympic and Chinese flags. &quot;Can you keep it on the beach volleyball?&quot; demands an American concerned at moves to switch channels on his nearest portal into the Corinthian contest playing out at venues across the city. Clientele is 50% foreign, 50% Chinese, says Rachel. Rachel will be your server today - she calls herself Rachel in keeping with the Chinese practice of adopting a Western name they like or which sounds most like their real one - and she&apos;s wearing Hooters&apos; international uniform of tight white vest and exceedingly short orange shorts.  She recently graduated from university in the city, and confirms this is a almost exclusively a graduate job, partly because of the requirement for decent English, but mainly because of the pay. Hooters waiting staff can expect to be paid 1400-1800 RMB (\u00a3106-\u00a3137) a month, plus tips. The restaurant&apos;s turnover is up to 900,000 RMB (\u00a368,000) a month, according to manager Alfie, who says pointedly that he does not encourage his staff to bring their families to the restaurant.  Hooters not translating as a pun in Mandarin, Rachel is unaware that the word emblazoned across her vest refers to something other than the owl that goggles away in its logo, as she takes orders beneath a large sign reading &quot;Caution: blondes thinking&quot;. Unsurprisingly, given it is entirely staffed by local Chinese women, there are no blondes, but the Hooters approach would appear to be: why tamper one iota with a winning formula? Almost every other globalised brand that has made incursions into China has adapted itself to some degree, with McDonalds&apos; menus reflecting regional tastes, for example, whilst IKEA produces Chinese-influenced furniture designs. At Hooters, not so much as a buffalo duck wing corrupts that sacred template, and the Guardian&apos;s Chinese translator confirmed the sight of Beijinger waitresses dancing provocatively to Hey Mickey jarred markedly with Beijing&apos;s still-conservative culture. Frankly, watching them giggle slightly self-consciously through the choreographed routines, one senses that even were Hooters to roll out its franchise to the Vatican City, it would demand zero deviation from its global standard, for all the likely shortage of suitable applicants. Shanghai is far more progressive and westernised than the capital, landing it the honour of China&apos;s first Hooters four years ago, but in Beijing the idea that sex sells is still in its very early days. Hang around long enough in Hooters Beijing, though, and you are left with the impression that the sports stuff is just there to sweeten the pill - Hooters is actually pioneering an approach that, all things being well, will lead to the utopian state already achieved in the west, where you can barely buy an overpriced broadband package without the mirage-like promise of a bunk-up. The US-based website The Smoking Gun recently published Hooters&apos; employment guidelines, which state: &quot;The Hooters concept is based on female sex appeal and the work environment is one in which joking and sexual innuendo based on female sex appeal is commonplace&quot;. Do they follow that code to the letter here in Beijing? Official guidelines merely stress applicants must be &quot;cheerful in a lively way and like the sports&quot;. Management stresses all applicants are required to have a good knowledge of local sports - especially Olympics at this time - on which they are examined before being given the job. They must also &quot;create joyfully the lively dining room atmosphere&quot;. &quot;I like Hooters. It&apos;s very happy. It&apos;s enthusiastic and energetic. I love Hooters,&quot; runs a typically on-message verdict from a Beijing branch waitress - a reminder that Hooters women across the world love their jobs, and the guys they get to serve. Yet the banner near the restaurant entrance reads &quot;Hooters Beijing loves the Olympics!&apos; and that one feels even easier to buy into.", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Sport", "Duck", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-11T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.china1", "sentences": ["But in Shanghai, the figure was +10%."], "title": "Olympics: Child singer revealed as fake", "article": "When nine-year-old Lin Miaoke launched into Ode to the Motherland at the Olympic opening ceremony, she became an instant star. &quot;Tiny singer wins heart of nation,&quot; China Daily sighed; &quot;Little girl sings, impresses the world,&quot; gushed another headline, perhaps in reference to Lin&apos;s appearance on the front of the New York Times. Countless articles lauded the girl in the red dress who &quot;lent her voice&quot; to the occasion. But now it emerges that Lin was lent someone else&apos;s voice, following high-level discussions - which included a member of the Politburo - on the relative photogenicity of small children. The recording to which Lin mouthed along on Friday was by the even younger Yang Peiyi. It seems that Yang&apos;s uneven teeth, while unremarkable in a seven-year-old, were considered potentially damaging to China&apos;s international image. &quot;This is in the national interest. It is the image of our national music, national culture. Especially the entrance of our national flag; this is an extremely important, extremely serious matter,&quot; Chen Qigang, the event&apos;s general music designer, explained to a Beijing radio station. Chen said that director Zhang Yimou - who created the ceremony - had demanded a &quot;very cute&quot; child; a standard certainly met by Lin and, many would suggest, by Yang. &quot;We made the decision that the voice we would use was Yang Peiyi&apos;s. The child on camera should be flawless in image, internal feelings, and expression. &quot;Lin Miaoke is excellent in those aspects. But in the aspect of voice, Yang Peiyi is flawless,&quot; he explained. But at the last minute, officials decided a switch was needed, according to the translation by the China Digital Times website. &quot;We had been through several inspections - they were all very strict. When we rehearsed at the spot, there were spectators from various divisions, especially a leader from the Politburo, who gave us his opinion: It must change,&quot; said Chen. &quot;I think it is fair to both Lin Miaoke and Yang Peiyi. That is to say, we have a perfect voice, and a perfect image and representation - in our team&apos;s view - combined together.&quot; It appears that Lin, already a veteran of TV adverts, may not have been aware that Yang&apos;s voice was used. Chen said they had recordings of both girls and their voices were fairly similar. Yang appears to have taken the snub in her stride. Asked by a CCTV journalist whether she was sad to have missed the opening ceremony, she replied: &quot;No, my voice was there.&quot; Not everyone has reacted so calmly. &quot;Adults may lie, but leave the kids out of it,&quot; one angry internet user wrote. Her tutor, Wang Liping, wrote in her blog that Yang is cute and well-behaved, with a love for Peking opera. &quot;She doesn&apos;t like to show off. She&apos;s easygoing,&quot; she added. Yang&apos;s school could not be reached today. The switch may reflect underlying cultural preferences as well as the incredible attention paid to Olympic preparations. Research by Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas, has suggested that the &quot;beauty premium&quot; in parts of China is far more pronounced than in the west for women. Dr Hamermesh&apos;s work shows that ugly people earn below the average income while beautiful people earn more. In Britain, attractive women enjoy a +1% premium.

The state-run Xinhua news agency said the attack took place at 9am in the town of Yamanya, in Shule County. It said the number of assailants was unknown and that they were still at large. Yamanya is a mere 20 miles or so from Kashgar, where last week two alleged Muslim jihadists drove a lorry at high speed into a rank of jogging paramilitaries, and killed the survivors with bombs and knives.

It was sponsored by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, the ministry in charge of policing the internet. The meeting was attended by US-based Lucent, Sun Microsystems and Cisco, European wireless giants Nokia and Ericsson, and Canada&apos;s Nortel Networks, among many others. The main event was China&apos;s Golden Shield Project \u2013 an ambitious plan to link China&apos;s national and internet surveillance networks, public record databases, CCTV cameras, speech and face recognition databases, smart cards, credit records and a myriad of regional and national ministries. Their mission was to make the network &quot;see, hear and think&quot; in the continuing effort to solidify state control.  Nortel Networks continues to work with the Chinese Tsinghua University on developing speech recognition software, often used in surveillance of telephone conversations, allowing the network to hear. It has also widely distributed its &quot;personal internet suite&quot; to providers in Shanghai, Beijing and other major Chinese cities. The software allows IPs not only to monitor what their subscribers are doing online, but to control what information is delivered to them. Content requested from a home computer for topics deemed undesirable will be stored against that person&apos;s personal file in numerous databases. The network rolled out with product and knowledge support from western IT firms is designed to think \u2013 that is, to identify individual subscribers when they log on, matching names to IP addresses, and learning, over time, what interests them. The Golden Shield Project also integrates a facial recognition system (FRS), partly developed by Acsys Biometrics, a Canadian company. Rolled out across closed-circuit video surveillance networks in Chinese cities, it allows the Golden Shield to see. Rick Collins, senior manager of Nortel&apos;s advanced research laboratory, ProtoNet, said of the Acsys system: &quot;Layering Acsys&apos; face recognition&apos;s capabilities within Nortel Networks&apos; solutions will make communication networks more personal. I envision a network that knows who you are, where you are and can reach you whether you&apos;re on your mobile phone or at your desktop.&quot; An enthusiastic business partner of the Chinese state apparatus has been Cisco. Notorious for its several appearances before the US House of Representatives to explain their role in supplying virtually the entire hardware on which the Golden Shield Project operates, as well as multiple systems to assist Chinese ministries responsible for catching political and social dissidents and censoring the internet. In 1997, Cisco won the contract to supply internet &quot;firewall boxes&quot; and, by 2006, they supplied 60% of the Chinese market for routers, switches and other sophisticated networking gear. Its estimated annual revenue from China is $500m. In 2003, Cisco&apos;s &quot;Policenet&quot; software was rolled out as the backbone of the Chinese state security system. This software, in conjunction with Intel&apos;s fingerprint technology, is compatible with the Chinese surveillance systems and allows a policeman stopping a person on the street to scan that person&apos;s ID card and access instantly the individual&apos;s past political and social behaviour, family history and recent internet activity. Terry Alberstein, director of corporate affairs for Cisco Systems (Asia Pacific), confirmed in 2005 that Cisco does indeed sell networking and telecommunications equipment directly to the Public Security Bureau and other law enforcement offices throughout China. Cisco recently stated that it also provides service and training to Chinese police officials. Unlike other IT companies, Cisco has signed contracts directly with Chinese public security authorities.  It is futile to argue whether western corporations are directly responsible for the uses to which China puts their technologies. Following basic free-trade principles, products are most likely sold &quot;as is&quot; to (rather than customised for) the Chinese government or third-party resellers. However, just as in the arms trade, these practices have led to the creation of a hostile digital environment, inhabited by Da Ge (pinyin for Big Brother).

Photograph: PR    Skyscrapers are architecture&apos;s sunflowers. Given a good, sunny financial climate, they will soar into the urban firmament, blossoming extravagantly, heady, ostentatious symbols of high rolling cities.  But, when the financial climate is poor, they refuse to grow so very high; and sometimes, as in the case of British Land&apos;s &quot;Cheesegrater&quot; in the City of London, they stay in the ground waiting for the good times to come again. The &quot;Cheesegrater&quot; is just one of several skyscrapers currently planned for the City of London and originally due for completion at much the same time - between 2010 and the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games. The seeds of this latest generation of high-rise buildings have been planted by developers. This is architecture as a cash crop, designed primarily not to adorn the City&apos;s skyline, but to generate ambitious and even sky-high profits. This is not to say that such buildings can&apos;t be inspiring and even beautiful; they can. One of the most aggressively commercial of all skyscrapers was the Empire State Building. Completed just in time to meet the full effects of the Wall Street Crash, this astonishing building \u2013 the tallest in the world in 1930 \u2013 stood mostly empty for the much of the 1930s.  Known as the Empty State Building, its seemingly endless office floors only finally filled up after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. Government war departments found a home here and the building came into its own.  The Empire State Building, though, was always special. It was such an astonishing, bravura performance, that it somehow won the hearts of the majority of New Yorkers and became, instantly and despite its initial poor economic performance, a wonder of the modern world. Today, it&apos;s a national treasure and global tourist magnet as well as a busy commercial building that more than earns its keep.  Manhattan, however, is dotted about with any number of dull built-to-let skyscrapers that, while looking good en-masse, especially when seen from a distance, are pretty disappointing as works of architecture when seen close up.  These are very much gigantic machines for making money. In London, where there have been great concerns about the look and character of the skyline surrounding St Paul&apos;s Cathedral in recent years, there had been an attempt to make at least some of these big-buck buildings look half-decent. Developers have taken to employing architects like Richard Rogers (the &quot;Cheesegrater&quot;) and Renzo Piano (London Bridge Tower, or the &quot;Glass Shard&quot;) precisely because their talented firms are able to make ruthlessly commercial skyscrapers look good. Reaching for the skies Even so, the fate of these buildings, especially in their early stages of development, is very much at the mercy of economic swings. Their very height is determined by economic forecasts, although to build as high as both the &quot;Cheesegrater&quot; and the &quot;Glass Shard&quot; developers have to take a big gamble. Contemporary city skylines can almost be read as graphs of the ups and downs of the economy at any given time. When the going is good for developers, tall buildings reach as if for the stratosphere. When the going gets tough, the skyline dips. The City of London is, of course, a machine for making money. Much of its architecture over the past 25 years has been pretty horrendous stuff. In the Eighties boom, when flashy postmodernism was the vogue amongst architects and planners, many had something of the look of a shiny, padded-suited broker. More recently, City buildings have tended to resemble giant mobile phones.  Although the &quot;Cheesegrater&quot; is among the better looking of the latest wave of City of London skyscrapers, many people in and out of London will breathe something of a sigh of relief that the recent high-rise boom has been curtailed by the current downturn in the economy.  Here is a time to pause and to think of what the City of London might appear to be in a decade&apos;s time. Should it really have the look of today&apos;s Shanghai \u2013 which it increasingly does \u2013 or might it find its very own style again, as it did in the days of both Sir Christopher Wren (the late 17th and early 18th centuries) and of Sir Edwin Lutyens (the early to mid 20th century)?  I guess, though, that the &quot;Cheesegrater&quot; and its rival City skyscrapers are simply biding their time. When the financial sun is shining brightly once more, these aggressive, and occasionally stylish, buildings will soar again, as high into the sky as any developer dares and as any City planner encourages them.", "tags": ["British Land", "Architecture", "Business", "UK news", "Communities"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-14T14:19:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/15/madonna.50.pop.facts", "sentences": ["To give you an idea of how bad she thought the screenplay was, films Madonna said yes to include Shanghai Surprise, Swept Away, Dick Tracy, Body of Evidence and The Next Best Thing."], "title": "Madonna: 50 Poptastic Facts", "article": "1. Madonna&apos;s &quot;Confessions ...&quot; tour was the highest-grossing tour by a female artist. In your face, Lisa Scott-Lee. 2. Madonna was only inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year because the Hall of Fame requires a minimum career length of 25 years. Therefore, we still have a while to wait until the Hall of Fame is able to recognise the genius of Gary Lightbody, Roy from Scouting for Girls or Shaggy. Perhaps it is time they looked at making a few exceptions for these titans of popular song. 3. Madonna likes clothes. Madonna also likes money. Happily, she has found a way to combine these two passions, having appeared in advertisements for Gap - with Missy Elliott - and H&amp;M, for whom she designed (&quot;designed&quot;) a range of clothes. 4. During the course of their training all local TV news reporters and tabloid journalists are coached in referring to Madonna as &quot;The Material Girl&quot; at least twice every 18 months. This is in reference to Madonna&apos;s hit single Material Girl. 5. According to her brother Christopher, the only thing Madonna can cook is Rice Krispie cakes. This means that dishes she is incapable of serving up include La Isla Bolognese, Dear Jelly, Hanky Lamb Shanky, Don&apos;t Cry for Me Polenta, and Crazy for Yule Log. 6. People call her Madge, although not to her face. 7. Felix Howard, the fresh-faced 13-year-old in the Open Your Heart video, is now a music business bigwig and has written songs for artists including Amy Winehouse, Kylie Minogue and Sugababes. 8. Like A Virgin was originally written for a MAN. Disgusting. 9. Artists to have sung songs about Madonna include Robbie Williams (the Pet Shop Boys collaboration She&apos;s Madonna was the best song on Rudebox, whatever that counts for), Sparks (&quot;Madonna&quot; tells the story of a late night cab right with The Madgster) and the Androids (Do It With Madonna is about rumpo). Madonna is also referenced in Sophie Ellis-Bextor&apos;s New York City Lights: &quot;Madonna says it&apos;s true, the town gets hold of you&quot;. Quite a good line. 10. It&apos;s a myth that Madonna went to Times Square with only $35 and some ballet shoes, according \u2013 once again! - to her brother. Apparently, she went there with money and loads of contacts, although if you&apos;re going to have a go at a master manipulator like Madonna for rewriting her own past then you might as well go around shouting at cows for mooing and shooting milk out of their tits. 11. The best Madonna headline ever to have appeared in the popular press was Fallen Madonna With The Big Boobies, although for that to make any sort of sense you need to know that it was just after she fell off a horse, and even then you&apos;d still be confused if you weren&apos;t familiar with British 80s sitcom Allo Allo. You had to be there, etc. 12. Madonna has performed at Live 8, Live Aid and Live Earth, although somehow the world is STILL plagued by hunger and poverty and the environment STILL looks like it is all going tits up. The looming inevitability of the latter catastrophe is all the more surprising given that Madonna actually wrote a new song, Hey You, for Live Earth. Clearly, &quot;the environment&quot; is no fan of good music. 13. Betty Boo tells an amusing story about Madonna giving her one of her jackets. Madonna was quite keen on Betty Boo at one point in the 1990s, describing her as &quot;criminally overlooked&quot; and attempting to sign the cat-headed songstress to her Maverick label. 14. Other artists to have been signed to Maverick include Alanis, the Prodigy, Mirwais, and a load of people you have never heard of. 15. Norwegian songbird Annie sampled Madonna&apos;s Everybody on her debut single, Greatest Hit. Establishing a pattern that continues to plague Annie&apos;s career in 2008, the song was not in fact a great hit at all, but was very good indeed. 16. Madonna reportedly turned down Prince when he asked her to take the female lead in his Graffiti Bridge movie, because the screenplay was awful. To give you an idea of how bad she thought the screenplay was, films Madonna said yes to include Shanghai Surprise, Swept Away, Dick Tracy, Body of Evidence and The Next Best Thing. She has received Razzie awards for Worst Actress (several times) and Worst Supporting Actress (twice), also being half responsible for winning Worst Screen Couple (twice), and, in 2000, Worst Actress of the Century. 17. Madonna has scored 64 (SIXTY FOUR) UK Top 40 hits. That will be a flash, but probably quite expensive, box set when Warners put it out in time for Christmas now that Madge has pissed off to Live Nation. 18. Like a Virgin has made a huge impact on British popular culture, and for evidence of this we need only direct our attention toward the Okey Cokey Karaoke episode of sitcom Birds of a Feather in which comedic nymphomaniac Dorien sings the song in a nightclub. It&apos;s testament to this set piece&apos;s earth shattering amazingness that the directors of the half-hour sitcom opted to include the song from beginning to end.  19. At the UK media playback for Confessions on a Dance Floor there were Madonna-branded DJ slipmats. Very clever. Dance floor. DJs. Decks. 20. At the UK media playback session for Hard Candy there was a massive mosaic of the album&apos;s sleeve, made out of Jelly Belly sweets. Very clever. Candy. Candy. 21. Also at the Hard Candy playback was an ocean of free booze which, with hindsight, may go some way to explaining the largely glowing reviews of what, in the cold light of day, turned out to be a deeply underwhelming album that has alienated even some of the singer&apos;s hardcore fans. Many of these fans still admire Madonna&apos;s continued hunger for success, but feel that in chasing the popular music style of the day rather than setting her own agenda she has, for perhaps the first time, begun to show her age. 22. Her age, incidentally, is 50. Hence these 50 amazing facts. Other singers to be 50 this year include Michael Jackson, Prince, Kate Bush and Ice-T. If one were to put them in order of who had grown old the most gracefully, Madonna would be slap bang in the middle. 23. Other dishes Madonna cannot cook include Another Fruitcake in Another Hall, Take a Bowl of Porridge, Who&apos;s That Grill and What it Feels Like for a Viennese Whirl. 24. Madonna&apos;s wealth is estimated to be well in excess of $400m, although you can expect this to rocket when the Hard Candy &quot;millions&quot; start rolling in. 25. During the recording of Hard Candy one of the album&apos;s producers, Pharrell Williams, made Madonna cry &quot;like a baby&quot;. 26. It can be stated without any waiting or hesitating that Madonna is not the world&apos;s greatest lyricist, although her words do have &quot;a certain charm&quot;. Her best lyrics are on the Like a Virgin album, but she didn&apos;t really write those, except for album track Shoo-Bee-Doo. (Oh dear.) 27. Madonna once noted: &quot;I want to be like Gandhi and Martin Luther King and John Lennon - but I want to stay alive.&quot; 28. A song Madonna quite likes is the Todd Terry remix of Everything But the Girl&apos;s Missing. 29. The Babyface-produced single Take a Bow remains Madonna&apos;s longest-running No 1 single in America \u2013 it topped the charts for seven weeks, but in the UK the ballad ended a 10-year run of consecutive Top 10 singles when it wound up at No 16 around Christmas in 1995. Shouldn&apos;t have chucked in some sleigh bells. 30. Madonna has had a single in the UK Top 40 every year except 1988, 2004 and 2007. After these &quot;breaks&quot; she returned with Like a Prayer in 1989 (amazing), Hung Up in 2005 (amazing) and 4 Minutes in 2008 (sort of amazing). 31. Vogue was originally going to be a B-side because Madonna didn&apos;t think it would be strong enough to be released as a single. 32. Madonna is the best-selling female artist of all time, but you probably could have guessed that. 33. Madonna gave her song Love Won&apos;t Wait to Gary Barlow for his second solo single which, despite being absolutely terrible, became a No 1 hit single. Madonna&apos;s version remains unreleased \u2026 34. Film soundtracks on which Madonna appears include Die Another Day, At Close Range, With Honours, The Next Best Thing, A League of Their Own, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and various others. 35. American Pie, from The Next Best Thing, is actually brilliant. Although you cannot buy it on iTunes, for some reason. 36. In 1982, as Everybody was proving &quot;big in the clubs&quot;, Madonna auditioned for Fame but didn&apos;t get the part of Leroy. 37. Madonna&apos;s first band was called The Breakfast Club. 38. 4 Minutes is actually four minutes and four seconds long \u2013 a disastrous misfire which could have been remedied if Timbaland had increased the song&apos;s speed by just one beat per minute. 39. Madonna lost her virginity in the back of a Cadillac, later explaining that she saw it as a career move. 40. Madonna once stated that she thought her Dick Tracy album I&apos;m Breathless was her best because it was &quot;different&quot;. 41. Ingredients Madonna does not have in her kitchen \u2013 because she cannot cook \u2013 include Cumin Nature, Bedthyme Story, and This Used to Be My Playground Nutmeg. 42. The Immaculate Collection is one of the best titles of a greatest hits album in the history of pop. 43. It is certainly better than GHV2. 44. Earlier this month Madonna&apos;s was named the &quot;ultimate face&quot; in a New Yorker feature on plastic surgery, with surgeons explaining that hers is one of clients&apos; most sought-after &quot;visages&quot;. 45. Men to have recorded cover versions of Madonna songs include Marilyn Manson (Justify My Love), Marc Almond (Like A Prayer), KMFDM (Material Girl) and Teenage Fanclub (Like a Virgin). 46. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Madonna at No 36 in their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time poll. Not bad for a girl, right lads? 47. True Blue remains Madonna&apos;s most successful album, shifting 24m units. 48. Madonna&apos;s family own a vineyard in Michigan where one can purchase limited-edition Madonna wine. 49. Supernatural, the B-side to Cherish, is about a ghost who has sex with Madonna. 50. Back to the cooking, though. Because she cannot cook very well she probably eats a lot of biscuits. One can imagine her emerging from a kitchen brandishing a plate containing including a Bourbonline and a Guy Richtea. Maybe there would be a choc ice, too, but she&apos;d bring that out later because it&apos;s Frozen. She is certainly not a True Cordon Bleu.

Like many people who have travelled to China, I was startled: isn&apos;t lactose intolerance the norm among the Han Chinese, who form 92 per cent of China&apos;s population? Though you could sip an American ice-cream soda in Hong Kong, I never saw any dairy produce at all during my trips to mainland China in the 1980s, with the single exception of &apos;fried milk&apos; in a restaurant in Guangzhou.  We now hear there are milk bars in Beijing, while the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says China&apos;s consumption of milk has gone from 26 kilocalories per person per day in 2002 to 43 in 2005. Is it coincidental that in 2006 Chinese children were reported to be an average 6cm taller than they were 30 years ago? The answer, of course, is that this is the result of increased calorie consumption from all food sources, just what you&apos;d expect in a booming economy.  Milk aside, there&apos;s no doubt that visitors to the Olympics will experience very different food to what was on offer until comparitively recently. The most notable change is the existence of restaurants serving non-Chinese cuisines. If you go to Shanghai, as did chef Kylie Kwong for My China Cookbook: Stories and Recipes From my Homeland (Collins \u00a330), you can eat world-class cosmopolitan food in her friend Michelle Garnaut&apos;s M on the Bund. Elsewhere, Kwong, a fourth-generation Chinese-Australian, engagingly admits to having eaten some terrible MSG-laden meals and justifiably rails that the &apos;inevitable pollution ... affects every part of the food chain&apos;. There&apos;s a breathless, whistlestop aspect to her travels, but Simon Griffiths&apos;s photographs are often as moving as Kwong finding her family in Guangdong, and the resulting book is beautifully produced. Many of her recipes call for fillet of beef, brown rice vinegar or brown sugar, but I trust her palate. A good deal more sophisticated, Beyond the Great Wall: Recipes and Travels in the Other China (Artisan \u00a330) by Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid, a Canadian couple who travel, write and take terrific photographs, is a collection of recipes from the other 8 per cent of China&apos;s population - its 125 million members of China&apos;s official 55 non-Han minority peoples, most of whom live outside the Great Wall. Duguid first went to China in 1980, and her recollections, especially of &apos;Chinese regional food prepared by gifted chefs in banquet style, which meant there were many refined dishes and very little rice&apos;, exactly match my own. But despite the good writing and intrinsically interesting subject, you&apos;d be hard pressed to love these recipes. The Olympics, though, are bound to raise our Chinese food awareness. What classic Chinese cookery books might I recommend? The British cherish the Chinese-American Ken Hom (below) even more than his compatriots do. Any of his books will serve, but the one I like best is A Taste of China (1990, Pavilion). The late Yan-Kit So was a deeply scholarly person and you can rely on her recipes. I favour her Classic Chinese Cookbook (1984, Dorling Kindersley)and her Classic Food of China (1992, Macmillan). The undisputed champion currently writing about China is Fuchsia Dunlop; perhaps her Hunanese book, The Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook (2006, Ebury). A specialised, out-of-the-way book on my favourite meal is Dim Sum (1985, Macdonald) by Margaret Leeming and May Huang Man-Hui, with dozens of dumpling recipes.", "tags": ["Kylie Kwong", "Books", "Culture", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-16T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/aug/17/gapyeartravel.ethicalholidays", "sentences": ["Ferries to Japan from China go from Tianjin or Shanghai to Kobe and Osaka, take around 48 hours and are good value (try shanghai-ferry.", "Work permits for Canada or America are tricky; they could try Australia instead, applying for aworking holiday visa (immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday) before they go.&apos; Rough Guide&apos;s Doug Lansky: &apos;After the trans-Mongolian to Beijing, they should head to Shanghai or Hong Kong to catch a freighter to Australia (strandtravel.co.uk, freighterworld.com, freighter-cruises.com), or continue to Singapore and pick up a boat there."], "title": "Need big ideas for your gap-year adventure?", "article": "The Post-grad Gapper&apos;After my masters, time for something really different&apos; Mushtaq Patas, student, 22, from Leicester The brief: &apos;I&apos;m studying at Nottingham University for an MA which finishes in October, and after working for six months, I&apos;m planning a six-month trip. I really want to go to South America, and am particularly interested in the Galapagos Islands. I would love to spend some time volunteering there. I&apos;d also like to learn Spanish and travel around the region. But I would consider other destinations, such as India and Sri Lanka.&apos; Budget: At least \u00a34,000 The solution: Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;There are lots of volunteer projects available on the Galapagos Islands. Mushtaq could try the Darwin Foundation (darwinfoundation.org), though it requires a minimum commitment of six months (volunteers pay their own transport, living expenses and insurance). Gap-year providers such as i-to-i.com or gapyearforgrownups.co.uk offer places on various projects, i-to-i has one- to eight-week conservation projects (from \u00a3385 for the first week, \u00a385 a week thereafter, excluding flights).  &apos;He could start in Quito (return airfare \u00a3500-800) and sign up for a language course (doing so on arrival means he can compare schools before committing), often the school can sort out a homestay too. He can then head off to travel around South America. The Gap Year &amp; Round the World branch of Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorntree website (lonelyplanet.com/thorntree) is a good source of ideas.  &apos;Or he could fly to Delhi from London, exploring India overland before flying from Chennai in the south to Sri Lanka. (Flying London-Delhi, then Chennai-Colombo-London will cost around \u00a3750; if he decides to visit only India, London-Delhi costs from \u00a3400 return.) The Confederation of Voluntary Associations (covanetwork.org) could match Mushtaq with a programme that requires his skills.&apos;   Real Gap&apos;s Helen Guyver: &apos;Mushtaq could start by learning Spanish at our school in Quito (from \u00a3449 for two weeks, \u00a3999 for four), then choose between our Galapagos Giant Tortoise Volunteer Project (from \u00a3899 for two weeks or \u00a31,199 for up to four weeks - he can combine this with the language school and get a discount), or teach English to children in the Galapagos (from \u00a3849 for two weeks or \u00a31,099 for four weeks). On either project he would be working alongside international volunteers, many of whom would be travelling independently afterwards. Then he could head back to the Ecuador mainland and down through Peru and Bolivia. In Bolivia he could volunteer at the Sucre orphanage (\u00a3799 for two weeks&apos; language school and four weeks&apos; volunteering).&apos;   Year Out Group&apos;s Richard Oliver: &apos;India is a very popular destination for volunteers, Sri Lanka less so, not least because of the security situation. The key to a successful placement is research. Year Out Group&apos;s website lists a huge range of volunteering organisations, and has a planning checklist. Mushtaq should also ask to be put in touch with someone who has recently returned from that placement.  &apos;Changing Worlds offers childcare, medical, journalism and teaching placements in India from \u00a32,665 for three months, including flights, a two-day course in the UK, three-day familiarisation on arrival and basic food and accommodation. Projects Abroad offers placements in India and Sri Lanka in teaching, care, conservation, journalism, business and veterinary medicine starting at \u00a3845 for a month and \u00a31,395 for three months (slightly more for Sri Lanka). The price includes food and accommodation, transport to and from the airport and insurance. Placements can be extended for \u00a3395/\u00a3495 a month.&apos; The Big Spenders&apos;Six months to see the world&apos; Jackie, 60, speech and language therapist, and Warwick Turnball, 61, university social work tutor, from Leeds The brief: &apos;We&apos;re planning a six-month trip from around November 2009. We&apos;re both in good health and young in attitude. We&apos;d like to include south-east Asia. New Zealand is also a must, probably touring in a camper van. We would like to include South America, particularly Machu Picchu in Peru and the Galapagos Islands. But we&apos;re open to suggestions.&apos; Budget: \u00a330,000 The solution: Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;The first step would be to pick up a round-the-world ticket - try Western Air (westernair.co.uk), Round the World Tickets (roundtheworldtickets.com) or Round the World Experts (www.roundtheworldexperts.co.uk). A route might be Manchester-Bangkok-Singapore-Sydney-Auckland-Santiago-Lima-Quito-Manchester (around \u00a32,250). They could do the Bangkok-Singapore section overland or arrange a tour from Bangkok to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, with Explore (explore.co.uk). Then they could fly to Singapore, and train, bus or boat it to Malaysia (try the Perentian Islands). After touring in New Zealand, they can fly to Santiago in Chile, then fly or travel overland to Lima and Machu Picchu, then Ecuador for a cruise around the Galapagos Islands (try happygringo.com).&apos; Real Holiday&apos;s Philip Davies: &apos;The oneworld airline alliance, which includes BA and nine other carriers, offeres a &apos;Global Explorer&apos; multi-stop ticket at just over \u00a32,000, allowing up to 10 stopovers. I would suggest they start in South America, hitting New Zealand for Christmas and south-east Asia in the spring when the weather&apos;s perfect. They could start in Quito, Ecuador, with Imaginative Traveller&apos;s (imaginative-traveller.com) 23-day &apos;Galapagos and Inca Explorer&apos; trip (it includes Machu Picchu). We could tailor a 14-day trip in Chile taking in the Atacama Desert, the lakes and Santiago. Next they could fly to Auckland, stopping off on Easter Island and Bora Bora in French Polynesia. In New Zealand we could tailor-make a trip, but a camper van gives flexibility. They could drop the van in Christchurch and fly to Thailand via Sydney. That would leave \u00a39,000 for an independent adventure around Indochina.&apos; Trailfinders&apos; Andrew Appleby: &apos;To make the most of each region, they should book open-jaw flights and travel overland between the main cities. We&apos;d recommend flying into Bangkok, out of Singapore, into Auckland, out of Christchurch and into Santiago and out of Lima. A British Airways &amp; Qantas World Discovery ticket for the basic route costs from \u00a31,549; we can add other flights. Trailfinders offers a range of tours such as a seven-day independent Peruvian tour with GAP Adventures covering Cuzco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu, from \u00a3755 per person. Or we can tailor-make an itinerary - with their budget, the sky is the limit. If they tour New Zealand in a camper van, they should be sure to take in the dramatic scenery around Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu on South Island. Vans cost from \u00a340 a day.&apos; A Solo Trip&apos;Getting under the skin of a place&apos; Susan Thompson, 59, NHS business manager, from Chester The brief:  &apos;I&apos;m looking to set myself a new challenge. I&apos;m planning a solo trip next year of between three and six months and am flexible about where to go, although my first call will be Japan as I have family there. I&apos;d prefer to travel slowly in a couple of countries and really get to know them and the culture. I want to do some voluntary work and I&apos;d like the money I spend to benefit local people.&apos; Budget: \u00a36,000 The solution:  Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;Susan should buy a flight to Japan via Bangkok (\u00a3800). On the return leg, she can explore south-east Asia, perhaps heading for Malaysia or Vietnam to volunteer, as these are particularly unthreatening countries. A good place to start research into voluntary work is lonelyplanet.com/volunteer, which advises on how to best benefit local people. I-to-i (i-to-i.com) offers possibilities such as building homes in Vietnam (\u00a3595-1,595/two-12 weeks). For other building projects try Habitat for Humanity (habitatforhumanity.org.uk), which runs building projects (\u00a31,876/two weeks in Cambodia). Or in Pokhara, Nepal, she could help at the Rainbow Orphanage (orphancarenepal.org/volunteer.php - \u00a3350/two months).   Real Holidays&apos; Philip Davies: &apos;Susan could book a return flight with Sri Lankan Airlines from London to Tokyo via Colombo. If she departs in late September and stays for a month she will enjoy the autumn colours, and have time to see her family and travel. She can then use the Tokyo-Colombo leg of her ticket to connect to Cochin in southern India and join a 29-day North and South India Trip with Intrepid Travel (intrepidtravel.com). Susan could jump ship at the end of the southern section at Masinagudi, close to the Jungle Retreat in the Nigiri Hills for wildlife experiences - where dormitory accommodation costs less than \u00a310 a day. Then she could fly from Bangalore to Delhi to pick up the northern half of Intrepid&apos;s trip, with its Moghul and Rajput highlights. It ends in Delhi so she could fly south to Colombo in January and start six weeks of volunteer work organised by i-to-i (details as before). With international flights at \u00a3810, internal flights at \u00a3400, Intrepid&apos;s tour at \u00a3890, a week at the Jungle Retreat from \u00a350 and a six-week children&apos;s home volunteering placement coming in at \u00a3695, Susan will still have half her budget left for travelling in Japan.&apos;  Gap Year for Grown Ups&apos; Helen Guyver: &apos;She could fly from London to Tokyo, then to Auckland, on to Adelaide, overland to Perth, then back via Bangkok and Delhi for around \u00a32,200. After two weeks in Japan she could join our &apos;Grand Island Explorer&apos;, a 21-day adventure tour of New Zealand which costs \u00a31,499, followed by the &apos;Ultimate Road Journey&apos; in Australia, taking nine days to explore the southern coast, with bush walking, swimming with dolphins and camel trekking. She could then spend four weeks doing community development work in Thailand, teaching English, with a week on a beach too, for \u00a3999, and possibly finish off with four weeks&apos; volunteering in India at the Kanjar Community Development in Rajasthan for \u00a3649. If this is too much she could just choose parts of it and stay longer.&apos; The Green Travellers&apos;We don&apos;t want to fly&apos; Lise Hovesen, 22, and Temujin Doran, 24, art students, from Falmouth, Cornwall  The Brief: &apos;We&apos;re planning a round-the-world trip by land and sea \u2013 we don&apos;t want to fly \u2013 starting in October . We need to start in Berlin and would then like to travelto St Petersburg and on to Moscow for the Trans-Mongolian train to Beijing. We&apos;d like to spend some time in China and about a month in Asia, possibly getting a ferry to Japan. We have heard that some people will take you on as crew on boats \u2013 is this &apos;sea hitch-hiking&apos; viable? We like the idea of a cargo ship across the Pacific from Hong Kong to Canada and would like to spendtime in Canada and America, possibly looking for work to top up our budget. &apos; Budget: \u00a36,000-plus between us The solution: Ed Gillespie: &apos;For the Trans-Siberian and Mongolian railways they need to book well in advance through a Russian agent (G&amp;R International via hostels.ru/en); both get very busy. Ferries to Japan from China go from Tianjin or Shanghai to Kobe and Osaka, take around 48 hours and are good value (try shanghai-ferry. co.jp ). They can get a cargo ship from Japan to Canada (freightertravel.co.nz) but freighters cost \u00a360-80 a day. For security reasons cargo ship &quot;hitchhiking&quot; is not possible these days, but they maybe able to ride free on a yacht (crewseekers.net) . They should not tiethemselves to an itinerary - half the fun lies in plans changing!&apos; Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;They could look for work teaching English in China or Hong Kong (overseasjobcentre.co.uk). Some freighter ships accept paying passengers (http://studenttravel.about.com/od/boardaboat/a/boattravel.htm) but they&apos;re no bargain when a Tokyo-California voyage lasts 13 days. Work permits for Canada or America are tricky; they could try Australia instead, applying for aworking holiday visa (immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday) before they go.&apos; Rough Guide&apos;s Doug Lansky: &apos;After the trans-Mongolian to Beijing, they should head to Shanghai or Hong Kong to catch a freighter to Australia (strandtravel.co.uk, freighterworld.com, freighter-cruises.com), or continue to Singapore and pick up a boat there. From Adelaide they can take a container ship to Auckland (six days) and try to hitch a ride on a yacht to Tonga, Fiji, Hawaii or the US from Auckland, Opua or Whangarei. Or they could stay in Australia and look for a ride from Townsville, Airlie Beach or the Whitsundays. In the US, take Greyhound buses (greyhound.com), Amtrak trains (amtrak.com) or do a driveaway (driving someone else&apos;s car ) to cross the country. For driveaway sites try roadtripamerica.com&apos;. The Student Adventurer&apos;I want to climb some seriously high mountains&apos; Sam Hewlings, 18, student, Barnet, London The brief: &apos;I&apos;m taking a gap year prior to university and am currently working to fund it. I am hoping to climb three of the Seven Summits (the highest mountains on each of the seven continents) \u2013 MountElbrus in Europe (5,642m) , Kilimanjaro in Africa (5,895m ) and Aconcagua in South America (6,962m ). I have some climbing/mountaineering experience, but training is something to consider. I&apos;ll be travelling alone, but will most likely join a guided group.&apos; Budget: Around \u00a35,000 (excluding equipment) The solution: KE Adventure Travel&apos;s Pete Royall: &apos;None of these three summits is technically difficult but all require good fitness and stamina, mainly to deal with the effects of high altitude. Of the three, Elbrus is the only one where Sam will definitely need crampons, ice axe and basic mountaineering skills. He could perhaps enrol on a winter skills course before attempting this peak. The budget is not really enough for all three peaks as they are on different continents; I would suggest he concentrate on the highest two and enjoy travelling in Africa and South America . He will have the best chance of success if he joins an organised expedition. This will ensure a good acclimatisation programme and he&apos;ll share the adventure with like-minded people. KE Adventure Travel offers a nine-day ascent of Kilimanjaro for \u00a3795 excluding flights, and park fees will add another \u00a3370. KE&apos;s 22-day Aconcagua ascent costs \u00a31,995 excluding flights, and climbing permits are \u00a3165 in December or January, or \u00a3115 in February. With careful selection of routes and airlines Sam should be able to keep total flight costs under \u00a31,500. The best season to climb Aconcagua is December to February. Kilimanjaro can be climbed pretty much all year round, though it would be sensible to avoid the two wet periods of April/May and November.&apos; Climber magazine&apos;s Kate Burke: &apos;The obvious route for Sam is to join a guided group. Companies such as Jagged Globe run trips to the Seven Summits, providing not only a guide, but also porters, food, permits and even equipment . The full cost of a trip to one of these peaks with a UK organisation could be in the region of \u00a32,000 . See climber.co.uk/marketplace for a list of companies offering expeditions. Finding a guide or group in the nearest town (eg. Moshi for Kilimanjaro) may be cheaper, but he won&apos;t know the credentials of the guide. Kilimanjaro does not require technical ability, but a high level of fitness is essential. Aconcagua is much more challenging: as well as fitness and mental strength, experience with crampon and ice axe is useful, as is experience of moving together roped up. It may be worth going on a winter mountain skills course beforehand. Plas y Brenin in Snowdonia and Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore offer a range of courses. Sam may struggle to find an expedition to Elbrus, as the Foreign Office currently advises against travel to this area [the Caucasus], due to political problems.", "tags": ["Gap year travel", "Ethical holidays", "Adventure travel", "Budget travel", "Travel", "Green travel", "Ethical and green living", "Backpacking holidays"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-16T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsathletics4", "sentences": ["Let alone the Speedo suit which i believe only let three golds out of its grasp (the Italian and the two German) - for London 2012 they should just let the races be run in the middle two lanes of the local council pool, with rowdy kids in the shallow end and the teens dive bombing in the deep.&quot; He then adds some always-welcome Aussie banter: &quot;Oh, and the Aussies seem a bit crestfallen with only six [swimming] golds in these Games, they seemed to have penciled in at least another three - but now they are talking up the rowing and sailing...&quot;  6.22am: Australia, the gauntlet has been thrown down... &quot;On the point of Aussie bashing,&quot; writes Michael Lee from Shanghai."], "title": "Olympics: day nine - as it happened", "article": " Howard will be here from a little after midnight.  A little after midnight: And here I am.  12.10am: The first minute-by-minute report I ever wrote at the home of minute-by-minute reports was the dead rubber in the group stages of Euro 2008 between a second string Portugal and the host-with-the-least Switzerland. &quot;The only way is up,&quot; I thought, a touch naively, as it turned out. Welcome to &quot;Up With a Partridge!&quot; It&apos;s a little after midnight in Farringdon, and a little after 7am in Beijing, where Paula Radcliffe is limbering up to get her thing on in the women&apos;s marathon. There&apos;s not a great deal of hyperbole surrounding our Paula this time, thanks partly to the success of the cyclists, sailors and swimmer(s) of Team GB! GB! GB!, who have already given us a Golden Saturday, and a not too shabby Friday, if memory serves. But there are big question marks over Radcliffe today, most notably because she&apos;s recovering from a stress fracture of the leg, which would seem to be an important factor in the success of any marathon runner. But fear not, we also have Mara Yamauchi to cheer on/patronise if things go snap for Paula. We start in Tiananmen Square in about ten minutes. Emails are always welcome.  12.20am: Radcliffe has had just three to five weeks&apos; training for this, and the main question being posed by the Paxman-she-ain&apos;t Hazel Irvine is &quot;How long with Radcliffe&apos;s race last today?&quot; The portents for the full 26 miles aren&apos;t good, it seems. On previous form, Radcliffe is three minutes faster than anyone else in this field, and she&apos;s talking up her form, jesting that she&apos;s &quot;the freshest in the race.&quot; But she&apos;s not fooling me.  12.30am: The bookies, for what it&apos;s worth, have Radcliffe at about 5-1, &quot;with a run&quot;, meaning they weren&apos;t even sure if she was going to go. But go she is: she&apos;s standing behind a thick blue ribbon with the rest of them at the moment.  12.31am: And. They&apos;re. Off.  12.34am: Here&apos;s the betting. Chunxiu Zhou 2/1; C Ndereba 3/1; P Radcliffe 5/1; G Wami 9/1; B Adere 10/1; G Bogomolova 16/1; R Tosa 16/1; Shujing Zhang 16/1; S J Kosgei 20/1; Xiaolin Zhu 20/1; D Kastor 25/1; M Yamauchi 25/1. Yamauchi is a Japan-based Briton, so we can get on her side. And Liz Yelling, whose a Britain-based Briton (200-1) has taken an early lead, as they approach the Temple of Heaven. Anyone back from the pub yet?  12.38am: This is going to be a tough commentary. Although that&apos;s going to help: one of the runners just ran head-first into the 1km marker post, which was positioned in the middle of the road. It wasn&apos;t Paula.  12.40am: There are an extraordinary number of flag-wavers lining the streets of Beijing tonight. And a couple of brass bands. Meanwhile, the talk in the television commentary box is of an &quot;anti-gravitational treadmill&quot; which Brave Paula has been using in her recovery attempts. She&apos;s right near the front at the moment.  12.43am: It&apos;s a slow pace apparently, a full minute slower already than world record pace as they approach the two-mile marker. One thirteenth of the way through. Hang on.  12.45am: The variety of belly buttons on display here is staggering. Innies, outties, half-in, half out. Marily dos Santos, of Brazil, is wearing a kind of poncho thing, perhaps embarrassed of a disfigured belly button.  12.49am: They&apos;re in a park. Paula included. Liz Yelling is out front still, althou... wait! An email! &quot;Consider this a solidarity email,&quot; writes my colleague Taimour Lay, who I know has done this kind of through-the-night shift himself, and lived. &quot;Entirely unrepresentative vox pop: I met a Chinese guy tonight in Tufnell Park who said the Olympics were $25bn too expensive, an insult to poverty-stricken Chinese, and London 2012 will be an awful, expensive failure. It really put in an Olympic spring in my step I can tell you. Made all our work worthwhile. See you in 7 hours when I assume you will be an ashen-faced, broken shell of a man.&quot; Is it wrong to admit that I&apos;m ashen-faced already?  12.52am: Here&apos;s how ruthless night-time online journalists can be: &quot;That&apos;s quite a good thing to happen, that,&quot; says my colleague Gregg Roughley, as the American athlete Deena Kastor collapses in agony onto the Beijing street, her four years of preparation rendered useless, her dreams shattered, her life a misery. &quot;Good for minute-by-minute reporting.&quot; Indeed it is: the American athlete Deena Kastor has just collapsed in agony onto the Beijing street, I can delightfully report.  12.55am: &quot;Something just popped,&quot; Kastor said, during that moment of agony. Blister? Balloon? Probably not. She&apos;s out of this race, with what could well be some kind of bone break. Back among the running, Liz Yelling still leads for GB! GB! GB! although the experts reckon she&apos;ll not be there come the end.  1am: Scramble for the drinks station in Beijing, similar to the scrum I left at a friend&apos;s birthday party moments before coming here. A band named Bombay Monkey had just taken to the stage, and I&apos;ve just won a bet by mentioning that.  1.03am: Liz Yelling is still leading here. Or Beijing, rather. The pack is kind of stretching out a bit, but they lost three or four runners within the first mile or so, the Eric the Eel kind, presumably. Brave Paula is still a-nodding in about fifth or sixth.  1.06am: They&apos;re currently running through a part of Beijing that I think they modelled on Gerrard Street, London. Liz Yelling is the fastest through 10km, in 38.10, which is very slow, I&apos;m told.  1.10am: They&apos;ve now just jogged past the &quot;Building of the People&quot; which was, apparently, the headquarters of the Communist Party. A fire truck is leading, then a family saloon car, then a motorbike and then Mamorallo Tjoka, who has overtaken Team GB&apos;s Liz Yelling.  1.12am: And another one bites the dust. Having just taken over the lead, Mamorallo Tjoka, of Lesotho, has just pulled up lame. Another 32 or so, and this is in the bag for Paula.  1.16am: Hold on, Tjoka is back. She definitely grimaced, swerved off to the side of the track, clutched her foot, but now seems to have run it off and is back out front. Brave Paula is still looking comfortable in the leading pack of about 20, with a couple of straggling packs now sliding backwards.  1.19am: An insight into what this is all about: &quot;Paula has just grabbed a sponge!&quot; says Steve Cram in the commentary box, and this is worthy of a super slo-mo replay as Brave Paula dabs first her hair, then her arms and then discards the sponge. It&apos;s a GB! GB! GB! one-two at the moment, as Yelling and Radcliffe lead the pack.  1.22am: It&apos;s not just athletics today, and there are 34 gold medals up for grabs in Beijing, according to the Guardian&apos;s &quot;definitive&quot; guide to the Olympic Games, which makes it the busiest single day of competition. There&apos;s swimming, badminton, horsey things, arguing, shooting, table tennis, volleyball and all sorts.  1.24am: A few umbrellas are up in Beijing, and there&apos;s water on the camera lens. That means rain. The field is gradually being strung out, although the leaders are still tightly-knit. They include Paula.  1.26am: Mamorallo Tjoka is now definitely done. She&apos;s pulled up lame again, clutching her left calf, and although she&apos;s grabbed a bottle of water and attempted to continue, I know an injured marathon runner when I see one, and Mamorallo Tjoka is one.  1.31am: Trip, tumble, graze, yelp! That&apos;s the last minute or so for Liz Yelling who has just tasted the taste of Beijing tarmac after getting caught up in the pack and wiping out, big time. Her back is all red and grazed and her running shorts are stained. She&apos;s up and running again, but that can&apos;t be good, in anyone&apos;s book.  1.33am: I&apos;ve got two emails. Count them. Two. The first is from the night editor, who wisely suggests I punctuate this dirge with a link to an interview with Paula Radcliffe about her chances in the marathon. Done. The second is from Geoff Gilbert, who says: &quot;If Usain Bolt ran the marathon, without slowing up any more than he does in the last bits of the 100m, seems to me he would run it in about an hour and seven minutes. Worth trying?&quot; Well, he&apos;s got the 200m later in the week, so let&apos;s not rule it out for 2012.  1.35am Liz Yelling has shown her grazed back to the rest of the field as she takes to the lead again. Paula Radcliffe&apos;s stress fracture is bearing up nicely, it seems, as she&apos;s bobbing along in the main pack just behind.  1.40am: Tim Chesnutt is in Canada, and has an email address, which is music to my ears: &quot;My gal Stacy is not only serious amateur marathoner, but a huge Paula fan,&quot; says Tim, who then confuses me by continuing: &quot;and is hard into training for the Ironman World Championships in Hawaii in another six weeks or so.&quot; Is that what they call it? The Ironman? For women? That is political correctness gone, etc., etc.  1.43am: OK, this is kind of vile. The Chinese directors have got a new tool called &quot;super slo-mo&quot; and they&apos;re using it like a kid in control of a video camera&apos;s zoom, ie, too much and inappropriately. So it is, that there are images on my screen of rippling muscles pulsating, bulging and oozing. It&apos;s not nice.  1.46am: No Paula! No! Brave Paula suddenly disappears from the leading pack and drifts off the course to the side of the road. Why? No one knows, although she does have previous with those unscheduled bathroom breaks. By the time the camera picks her up again, she&apos;s making her way back onto the road and is catching up again now.  1.53am: The Japanese runner Reiko Tosa, a favourite for this, apparently, is not looking too clever. In fact, she&apos;s practically in tears with some injury or another, her dreams dying step by step. &quot;That Japanese woman really needs to stop running now,&quot; sympathises Rebecca Strickson. &quot;It&apos;s not big and it&apos;s not clever.&quot;  1.55am: Constantina Tomescu, of Romania, has had enough of this dawdling, and has taken the lead by herself. She&apos;s a good 100 yards ahead of everyone else now, with Brave Paula leading the chasing pack. They seem perfectly content to let Tomescu go it alone.  2.00am: Is a &quot;pit stop&quot; a euphemism for having a wee?&quot; asks Helen Burrows, who I think knows the answer to that, especially as she&apos;s referring to Team GB&apos;s weak bladder Paula Radcliffe and that brief diversion a few kms ago. &quot;The BBC are being surprisingly coy. Hurrah for internet coverage, though, as I can watch this in bed!&quot; continues Helen, which has also confused me. Do people have computers at the end of their bed these days instead of TVs?  2.01am: We&apos;re through 25k now, and the Romanian Tomescu is streets ahead, but looks like she might be regretting it. Brave Paula is leading the following pack. Meanwhile, Reiko Tosa is practically dead but still running. &quot;That&apos;s the Olympic spirit right there,&quot; says Gregg Roughley.  2.05am: Brave Paula is beginning to do that head-bobbing thing that always makes you think she&apos;s about to peg out, but which has often preceded gold medals. Tomescu now leads by 44 seconds as they pass Beijing University.  2.10am: Bad news for Paula fans, I&apos;m afraid. The pace has picked up a touch and Radcliffe is struggling to keep up. She&apos;s drifted to the back of the main pack, as four or five athletes try to make up ground on Tomescu.  2.12am: And we reach our level: &quot;Monty Python did that infamous bit about pit stops in their &quot;incontinence marathon&quot; sketch, where the lead keeps changing every few seconds as runner after runner went off into the bushes for a wizz,&quot; nostalges Brian Gibson, who is from Canada, but is in a hostel in Cardiff at the moment.  2.16am: Tomescu still leads by a significant distance -- 55-odd seconds -- and Radcliffe is still just clinging on in the chasing pack. Tomescu is definitely struggling, with Steve Cram predicting, and me agreeing, that the medallists are likely to come from that chasing group. I&apos;ll do my best to get a few names of those in the Radcliffe pack in a moment.  2.22am: These are some of the athletes in the chasing pack, which is now drifting clear of Paula Radcliffe: NDEREBA Catherine, SIMON Lidia Elena, KOSGEI Salina, ZHOU Chunxiu, TIMOFEEVA Irina, KOMU Martha, and let&apos;s give a big Team GB! GB! GB! welcome to Mara Yamauchi, who is also up there. Yes, I&apos;ve copy-pasted them, but it&apos;s the best I could do.  2.28am: If Paula Radcliffe was to peel off her own skin and hand it to a child-murdering sadist in return for the safety of 34 orphans, she couldn&apos;t be more brave than what she&apos;s doing here, according to Brendan Foster and Steve Cram in the television commentary box, who have never ever seen anything braver, nor can conceive of anything braver than her finishing ninth or tenth in this race. She&apos;s now drifting way behind the leaders, who are busy winning the thing, but we wouldn&apos;t know about it at the moment, I&apos;m afraid, because it&apos;s all about bravery today in Beijing.  2.33am: Putting bravery aside for one moment, Tomescu is still way out in front, as they reach the two hour mark. The Chinese athletes Xiaolin Zhu and Chunxiu Zhou are also in the chasing pack, but they&apos;re allowing the Romanian to get a lead that may be unassailable. Mara Yamauchi, who&apos;s GB! GB! GB! through and through, is also in that group and I&apos;m officially switching my allegiance. Brave Paula is done, I&apos;m afraid.  2.36am: Constantina Tomescu leads by more than a minute now, and is now being referred to as Constantina Tomescu Dita, having apparently had the time to get married and adopt another name since this race began.  2.40am: Seven athletes remain in the &apos;chasing&apos; group, although they&apos;re not getting anywhere near Tomescu Dita. The Romanian is now sniffing some kind of energy-boosting smelling salts/poppers kind of thing, and is ahead by far.  2.42am: Five kilometres left and Tomescu Dita is about three of them ahead of the pack. Brave Paula is still struggling on, but is way out of medal contention. Mara Yamauchi remains in the pack of seven who are closest to Tomescu, but if I know marathons (and I don&apos;t) Tomescu has this wrapped up.  2.44am: Non-marathon news: Great Britain&apos;s men&apos;s hockey team are 1-0 down to Canada in their latest group match.  2.46am: The Olympic dream is over for Paula Radcliffe. She&apos;s now broken down on the Beijing road, stopped, walked, screamed out, cried, and inadvertently posed for all the photos you&apos;re going to see on your newspapers on Monday morning -- and no doubt on this website in a couple of minutes. She&apos;s started up again, but that was proper anguish from Brave Paula, whose stress fracture couldn&apos;t hold up to the demands of the marathon. A sorry sight.  2.49am: Tomescu Dita is now in sight of the Bird&apos;s Nest Stadium, but is showing the strain. There&apos;s super slo-mo anguish etched onto her Romanian face and the pack is slowly catching. But only a mile to go. Come. On. Mara. Yamauchi. She has a chance of a bronze here, which we&apos;ll take.  2.52am: Less than a mile left, and Tomescu Dita leads by a minute, from, in this order: Zhou, Zhu, Ndereba, Komu and Team GB! GB! GB!&apos;s Mara Yamauchi.  2.54am: The artist formerly known as Constantina Tomescu, who was temporarily known as Constantina Tomescu Dita, is now being referred to as Constantina Dita, the relevance of which I know not. But she&apos;s in the stadium now and looking nailed on for gold. Mara Yamauchi has slipped back and is now battling for sixth place which, remarkably, would still be the best performance by a British woman in an Olympic marathon.  2.56am: A huge cheer for Constantina Tomescu Dita, who comes bounding and waving into the Bird&apos;s Nest. She&apos;s running as ungracefully as any runner is likely to in this Olympics, but after 26 miles, who cares. There&apos;s an almighty battle going on for the silver between Ndereba and Zhou.  3.00am: Constantina Tomescu Dita, of Romania, wins the women&apos;s marathon in 2:24.44. Catherine Ndereba, of Kenya, is second. Chunxiu Zhou, China, is third. Britain&apos;s Mara Yamauchi was sixth. Paula Radcliffe is still running at time of writing. Really.  3.05am: Brave Paula Radclliffe, stress fracture and all, hobbles and limps into the Bird&apos;s Nest and finishes in, who knows what place. The official counters have stopped. She&apos;s in floods of tears as she&apos;s consoled by team-mate Liz Yelling and I&apos;m going to stop this because the gushing commentary from Steve Cram and Brendan Foster is too much to bear.  3.07am: Team GB are 1-1 in the hockey against Canada, although the feed has disappeared from my screen. And there&apos;s a reason for that: it&apos;s over. They drew 1-1.  3.08am: &quot;I felt like I was just running on one leg,&quot; says a tearful Paula Radcliffe in her track-side interview.  3.09am: &quot;This is not the end of the Paula Radcliffe story, please tell us that,&quot; pleads the BBC&apos;s trackside interviewer. Then: &quot;brave, blah, blah, brave, brave, blah, blah.&quot; &quot;Is this redemption for Athens?&quot; he then asks. &quot;Nah,&quot; says Paula.  3.11am: &quot;That was a really brave and amazing effort.&quot; &quot;We knew her body might let her down today, but not her head or her heart.&quot;  3.13am: Liz Yelling, it seems, might have cracked a rib in her tumble in the marathon. More bravery from Team GB! GB! GB! &quot;They&apos;re bloodied, they&apos;re battered,&quot; says Hazel Irvine. Enough. Already. Enough.  3.15am: Right, that&apos;s the women&apos;s marathon done and thank the lord for that. We&apos;re now back in the swimming pool, where there&apos;s not quite as much bravery, but hopefully a degree more sanity. It&apos;s the men&apos;s 1,500m freestyle, with Britain&apos;s David Davies going. Aussie Grant Hacket is the hot favourite.  3.17am: Grant Hacket leads after 400m. Davies not in the top three at the moment.  3.20am: &quot;David Davies is having to swim more. He&apos;s got smaller arms and a smaller stroke,&quot; says Andy Jameson, commentating on the swimming. Ryan Cochrane goes into the lead.  3.23am: The Canadian Ryan Cochrane leads at the half-way point. Grant Hackett is second and Yuriy Prilukov third.  3.25am: Swimming: The Tunisian Oussama Mellouli has swum himself into contention here and has gone ahead of both Cochrane and Hackett.  3.27am: Swimming: Mellouli has gone for it from lane two. He&apos;s put the pedal to the metal in a swimming kind of way and has burst a good length or so ahead of Cochrane and Hackett with six lengths left. David Davies is fifth, sixth or seventh.  3.29am: Swimming: Mellouli leads at the bell, which means two lengths left in swimming. Hackett is on his tail, but the Tunisian is ahead at the final turn. But...  3.30am: Swimming:Mellouli hangs on. Grant Hackett starts to come back at him in the final 50m, but the Tunisian keeps ahead and takes gold, his first medal. Hackett was going for his third consecutive gold in this event, but is beaten. Ryan Cochrane, of Canada, is third and GB&apos;s David Davies was sixth.  3.33am: Just to whet your appetite for the coming hours: Michael Phelps goes for his eighth gold in the 4x100m medley relay and, put it this way, my colleagues are currently writing an article that begins: &quot;Michael Phelps won his eighth gold medal of the Beijing Games.&quot; In the velodrome, GB&apos;s all-conquering cyclists go in the team pursuit qualifying pretty soon. They&apos;re last on the track. (Currently France lead.) If you want to read about Paula Radcliffe and the marathon, click on that shiny hyperlink above.  3.42am: Swimming: The German Britta Steffan wins gold in the women&apos;s 50m freestyle. It&apos;s her second gold of the Games, I think. The American pensioner* Dara Torres wins silver, and Sharon Davies tells me (not exclusively, she&apos;s on the telly), that Torres won her first medal in 1984. *Real age: 41  3.48am: Hold on, what&apos;s this? Team GB! GB! GB!&apos;s women&apos;s medley swimmers are in the final and doing mighty well after the first, back-stroke leg. Gemma Spofforth is second as she hands over to the breast-stroker.  3.50am: The Aussies are cruising to victory, but the butterfly swimmer Jemma Lowe has brought Team GB! GB! GB! back into contention. Freestyle now.  3.51am: Australia break the world record by about yesterday in the 4x100m medley relay. They&apos;re so far ahead of the moving green line that indicates world record pace that it&apos;s barely even on the screen. Team GB come in fourth, despite Spofforth&apos;s opening leg breaking the European record.  3.54am: Swimming The British swimming women aren&apos;t happy with their fourth. In fact, they&apos;re crying. &quot;I&apos;m so gutted,&quot; says Fran Halsall. &quot;Well, that&apos;s encouraging,&quot; says Hazel Irvine. They break the European record but feel they could have done better and that actually is kind of encouraging I suppose.  3.58am: Cycling: Britain&apos;s team pursuit team are off, and looking comfortable in the qualifying round.  3.59am: Cycling After 2km, the British cyclists are only just behind their own world record pace.  4.01am: Cycling: The British team pursuit team qualify for the final. They&apos;re a full two seconds faster than their closest rivals, the New Zealand team, and look good for another velodrome gold. It&apos;s the third fastest ride over this distance of all time.  4.07am: Swimming: Hazel Irvine knows how to set a scene: &quot;It&apos;s time for history to be made.&quot; She means Michael Phelps and she means the 4x100m medley relay in which the best advert for a good solid English fry-up is going for his eighth gold.  4.09am: Swimming: Team GB! GB! GB! are also in this relay race, but even this proud jingoist has been swept away in the Phelps-ian myth-making. The USA lead after the first leg, but apparently it&apos;s by no means good enough and SHOCK! and HORROR! the Americans might not win this.  4.10am: Swimming: Phelps takes over with America third. Third! Can you imagine?!?  4.12am: Swimming: Phelps takes over the lead for the United States, and Lezak has clear water in front of him for the freestyle leg. The Australian team challenge for a moment, but Phelps is not to be denied. Another World Record, incidentally, but this is all Michael Phelps. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. And...GOLD!  4.14am: Swimming: Team GB! GB! GB! finish sixth in the 4x100m relay.  USA win the gold medal and break the world record. Michael Phelps wins his eighth gold medal of the Games, breaks Mark Spitz&apos;s record of seven gold medals in a single Games, eats 912 eggs, 16 omelettes, 11 hamburgers and 14 pork chops, cures cancer, kills Lex Luther, and becomes the most winningest Olympian of all goddam time.   4.20am: Back to reality: There&apos;s the women&apos;s beach volleyball quarter-finals on, there&apos;s Australia v Russia in the women&apos;s basketball, and there&apos;s a MBM reporter dashing off for a quick &quot;pit stop&quot; Paula Radcliffe-style.  4.27am: Cycling: More wonderful velodrome-based Team GB greatness as Victoria Pendleton qualifies fastest in the women&apos;s individual sprint. She&apos;ll be back to claim inevitable gold ... yawn ... on Tuesday. But there&apos;s a guaranteed gold and silver in the individual pursuit later tonight/today when Rebecca Romero and Wendy Houvenaghel go head-to-head.  4.34am: Beach volleyball, basketball? Basketball, beach volleyball?  4.38am: I know China are winning everything at these Games, but beach volleyball? Seems likely at the moment as the Chinese pair are thrashing the hapless Austrians (hardly a beach volleyball force themselves, admitedly) in the quarter finals.  4.40pm: Amy Hordes wants basketball, but with Australia playing Russia in a women&apos;s preliminary group game, and what with it being 4.40am, I&apos;m going to struggle to find the inspiration. It&apos;s 28-19 to Russia in the second quarter. &quot;Are the Germans or Swedes doing anything of note?&quot; Amy also wants to know and the answer is: &quot;Kind of.&quot; It&apos;s very very quiet at the Games at the moment, but Germany&apos;s Britta Steffen won her second gold in the swimming pool about an hour ago. Swedes? Shmedes.  4.50am: Cycling: More Germany news: Stefan Nimke just set a new Olympic record during qualifying in the men&apos;s individual sprint. Britain&apos;s Chris Hoy and his elephantine thighs are out on the track again soon, so not sure how long that record will last.  4.54am: Lo and behold, Chris Hoy breaks the Olympic record in the men&apos;s individual sprint set about 30 seconds ago. Safe to say he&apos;s the favourite for gold in the men&apos;s individual sprint. Jason Kenny, another British whirlwind, had previously broken Nimke&apos;s record. Meanwhile, Amy Hordes isn&apos;t satisfied with Michael Phelps: &quot;Is he scheduled to swim again today, or is it back to omelettes and mayonnaise?&quot; she asks. Phelps is done for this Olympics, Amy. Lightweight.  5.01am: Catch up on what&apos;s happened while you were out shoving Bacardi Breezers down your necks and eating kebabs:Phelps wins eighth and final goldHackett fails in bid for 1,500m trebleBritish women&apos;s relay team pipped to bronze  5.03am: And on the eighth day, God created Alan Gardner, and here he is to take over this flailing, flagging Saturday night, Sunday morning MBM. Perk him up with some emails to alanrgardner@gmail.com. Thanks for all your efforts. Please try harder for Alan.  5.12am: Howdy insomniac Olympic fans. While the British cyclists continue to eat Olympic records for breakfast in Beijing, sprinkling the tears of their broken rivals on top for good measure, in 119 Farringdon Road we&apos;re gearing up for Spectacular, Super Duper, Splendidly Successful, Smashtastic Sunday, as the headline writers will doubtless have it. But, before the main course, an entree - it&apos;s Australia v Russia in the women&apos;s basketball. Aus 32-37 Rus in the third quarter. Stay tuned, folks.  5.15am: Team GB sailing My official Guardian summary for today reads like this for the next couple of hours: 5.00/12.00 \u2013 Ainslie, wind permitting (GOLD MEDAL)6.30/13.30 \u2013 Yngling, wind permitting (GOLD MEDAL) So that&apos;s what&apos;s on the menu - and don&apos;t blame me if either don&apos;t come good. Ainslie should be out on the water, looking for a gentle breeze to blow him to victory, so I&apos;ll keep you posted.  5.19am: It&apos;s also a big day for the Chinese - well, just another 24 hours in Beijing really - with the first Table Tennis gold up for the winning. Not even Forrest Gump is likely to stand in their way, but for now we&apos;re in bronze play-off territory.  5.24am: &quot;Morning Alan,&quot; begins John Johnstone in such a charmingly convivial manner that I can hardly refuse him internet publication. &quot;Here in Canada I have been stuck with a swimming commentator who won&apos;t say Olympics. Instead he talks about &apos;the last quadrennial&apos;, or &apos;the next quadrennial&apos; or even &apos;this quadrennial&apos;. Are there any other phrases people are already sick to death of?&quot; How about: &quot;And that&apos;s gold for Michael Phelps&quot;?  5.27am: Free shots for Straya in the basketball, who have moved ahead of Russia, 46-43 up now. &quot;Brave, brave Paula Radcliffe&quot; has been worn a bit thin in the last few hours too, dontcha think?  5.30am: &quot;What happened to the aussie bashing,&quot; asks Nick Evans, who appears to delight in typing &apos;Aussie&apos; with a lower case &apos;a&apos; solely to wind up his spell checker. Aussie bashing, Nick, can certainly be found on this forum. I&apos;m cheering for the Russians as we speak, whilst totting up the potential golds from today which will take us above those infernal, bragging Wallabies...  5.33am: Indifferent to my support, the Australians now appear to be crushing the Soviet Bear: 55-47 now. Meanwhile, news from the &apos;jing is that Ben Ainslie will be setting off on his gold medal victory parade at 7am BST.  5.39am: CELEB ON THE LINE! Yes, it&apos;s the husband of the American beach volleyball coach. Welcome to the MBM, John Clamberson, all the way from Hermosa Beach, CA, US of - who !CELEB ENDORSEMENT ALERT! is also the proud manager of a Guardian Fantasy Football team. Here&apos;s an anecdote about China&apos;s nascent love affair with bashing a ball back and forth over a net stuck in the sand: &quot;When the Chinese won the rights to hold the Summer Games, they decided beach volleyball was a sport worth pursuing. Next thing you know, there was a gaggle of Chinese athletes and coaches standing in the sand in Hermosa, wanting to learn the game. Several years later, the Chinese women are #2 and #4 (or so) ranked teams in the world. My role was teaching some of the athletes some excellent drinking games and introducing the guys to California girls. They seemed to like that. Their coaches not so much.&quot; Ah, John. For all your efforts, the Chinese are incorruptible. But thanks for trying.  5.43am: Cruel mocking of a true British hero. John - whose thoughtful email has brightened my morning, and almost made up for the fact that nothing is happening in Beijing apart from USA chuckball, as well as my inablitiy to tpye anymroe - continues: &quot;I&apos;ve seen Paula Radcliffe on television twice in my life, both times involved pain and tears. Is that habitual or coincidental?&quot; Let&apos;s not talk about it, eh, John. It&apos;s a bit of a sore point.  5.48am: &quot;Here in New Zealand I&apos;m sick of rowing commentator Peter Montgomery telling us that someone is &apos;laying into it&apos;,&quot; writes Joanne Harris, from Kiwi. &quot;It doesn&apos;t seem to matter where in the race they are, if there&apos;s a push going on, then they&apos;re &apos;laying into it&apos;. It&apos;s not even a particularly good comment for rowing; Montgomery&apos;s a sailor, that&apos;s the problem. I&apos;m also sick of adverts every ten minutes, beach volleyball, and Michael Phelps (as great as he undoubtedly is).&quot; Anymore for anymore? Aus 73-55 Rus, and the Aussies are going through from their group.  5.52am: Wish I could add to the &apos;repetitive and annoying Olympics phrases&apos; thread, but I&apos;m struggling to remember anything other than that GB IS GOING TO WIN GOLD, GOLD, GOLD TODAY. The frequency of references to how much the Games mean to China has got to be up there.  Ooh, lookit. I think there may be a repeat of the football on Eurospor. Huzzahs!  5.55am: Al Parkes, a frequent contributor to our early morning talking shop, has a suggestion for John Clamberson: &quot;Maybe he shouldn&apos;t watch Paula if she hurts him and makes him cry.&quot; Al, I think John was expressing sympathy, without claiming to have suffered agonies of the soul.  6.00am: However, if John, Al, or any of you do fancy exercising those tear ducts, you could do worse than flip yourself over to Paul Kelso&apos;s blog on champion nearly-woman Radders. I&apos;m all cried out, but if anything could wring a drop more of emotion from me, it&apos;s Paul&apos;s 600 words.  6.04am: BBC zinger alert &quot;A new world record for the Real McCoy, Chris Hoy...&quot; Yup, creative commentary aside, we&apos;ve been doing that record-breaking thing over in the velodrome. We&apos;ve got plenty of rowing coming up later today, as well as a guaranteed British one-two in the women&apos;s cycling. And the Yngling is about to start, gusts permitting, of course.  6.09am: Shamani, who is &quot;still curious&quot;, from Singapore, chips in on the Radcliffe debate: &quot;I&apos;m a bit puzzled by this Radcliffe thing as well. Earlier they had a sort of Google Earth thing of the route with the leading Romanian, the chasing pack and Paula marked out with sort of &apos;moving round things&apos;. Radcliffe was about a hundredth at the time, I think. Does she have really good sponsors? How come she gets her own moving round thing?&quot; Moving round things? Moving round things? What coverage was this? Anyway, more opinions, more (they save me from typing) - is Paula a plucky loser who we should love for trying, or a gushy failure who gets on your wick?  6.11am: Team GB sailing Update from the Yngling, it&apos;s neck-and-neck and the Brit girls are trying to fend off the Hollanders. It&apos;s a real pea-souper with extra drizzle out there...  6.14am: There&apos;s a camera on the Dutch boat which is bobbing from side to side more violently than Paula Radcliffe&apos;s head. It seems the GB Yngers have the advantage, so top stuff. Meanwhile, John Johnstone has good news from Canada: &quot;I can report that I&apos;m not annoyed with the Canadian cycling commentators as CBC are definitely giving &apos;nuff respect to Team GB at the velodrome.&quot; Boo yah.  6.19am: Artificially-enhanced swimmers grumble. Paul Meek in Brisbane challenges Michael Phelps et al: &quot;If the Water Cube was an athlete, it would be dope tested twenty times a day the last week - seriously, 24 world records in a meet? Let alone the Speedo suit which i believe only let three golds out of its grasp (the Italian and the two German) - for London 2012 they should just let the races be run in the middle two lanes of the local council pool, with rowdy kids in the shallow end and the teens dive bombing in the deep.&quot; He then adds some always-welcome Aussie banter: &quot;Oh, and the Aussies seem a bit crestfallen with only six [swimming] golds in these Games, they seemed to have penciled in at least another three - but now they are talking up the rowing and sailing...&quot;  6.22am: Australia, the gauntlet has been thrown down... &quot;On the point of Aussie bashing,&quot; writes Michael Lee from Shanghai. &quot;I wonder how long it will be (in nanoseconds) between us Brits overtaking them in the medal table and sore Aussies writing in to complain that &apos;you lot have three times the population of us&apos;. I am going for at least 3, maybe 4 nanoseconds\u2026&quot; Too generous, for my money.  6.27am: I don&apos;t know why, but I&apos;m irresistibly drawn to publishing emails that jibe the Aussies. I absolutely don&apos;t know why... &quot;If the Canadians and Kiwis think they get bad commentary they should try the abysmal coverage here in Aus,&quot; chirps a Pommie b*stard all the way from Queensland. &quot;Example from yesterday: an Australian rower had just won his third gold in consecutive games and the post-race interviewer said &apos;Three golds in three games!!! It doesn&apos;t get any better than that!!!&apos; I assume this expert journalist has somehow missed Steve Redgrave&apos;s achievements. Winners from other countries get a couple of seconds of comment followed by minutes glorifying the Aussie that comes in 14th. Then repeat endlessly until 2am.  And P. B*stard has more: &quot;The main man, Bruce McAvaney, can&apos;t even correctly pronounce the names of countries, let alone the athletes. It&apos;s easy for us to mock the Beeb until you&apos;ve seen what the rest of the world offers. One small crumb of comfort is that Steve Ovett is allowed to comment on some of the track events.&quot; I small shaft of light in the dark there. And we&apos;re back with Yngling, where the Brits are still ahead of the Dutch.  6.31am: Team GB sailing The BBC guy out in Fushan Bay is literally being drowned in service of the national broadcaster. Apparently we&apos;re getting to the crunch, and the Brits are closing on the finishing line and GOLD, GOLD, GOLD...  6.34am: Team GB GOLD Here we come Australia! Pommie&apos;s gonna getcha... The three blondes in a boat have sealed victory in the Yngling and if they feel like &apos;yngling&apos; for compliments I&apos;m sure there&apos;ll be plenty forthcoming. Hyuck hyuck. It&apos;s properly choppy out there, and it&apos;s also coming down cats&apos;n&apos;dogs, which must&apos;ve suited the ladies.  6.38am: Dave Bartram, who&apos;s dossing about in his student digs, has a request: &quot;I see the New York Times has the US top of their medal table because they have the most medals overall, whereas the China Daily Post has China top because they have the most gold medals. Could the Guardian please find a way of rejigging the medals table to put Britain top?&quot; Dave, we&apos;re not going to need to resort to artifice.. Team GB is gunning up the table. We&apos;ll be top by teatime!  6.46am: So, what&apos;s everyone up to this fair Sunday morn? Still gripped by OLYMPIC FEVER?!!?! The BBC are taking a valedictory interview tour of Team GB&apos;s medal winners. &quot;Pure perfection,&quot; that&apos;s how the Ynglingers summed things up.  6.53am: Paul Meek, who I didn&apos;t realise was a Kiwi, is sceptical about Team GB&apos;s chances of winning the 29th Olympiad: &quot;There are what, another 28 golds being handed out today? It could happen - if you Brits had qualified in them all. Oh, what is that, a passport age clarification? Well, there you go then, in all the finals [sly dig at wee British pup, Tom Daley, I think]. Re: Paula Radcliffe, she reminds me of my beloved All Blacks - all conquering in between the biggest contest on the planet (rugby World Cup, Olympics) but absolute pants when it comes to the big show.&quot; Enough of your cheek, Meek. How many medals have you islanders got, five?  6.58am: Andrew Jolly would &quot;like to second the Pommie B[*]sta[r]d from earlier on. The pile of vomit that Channel 7 have offered up as their &apos;coverage&apos; of the Olympics makes Channel 9&apos;s coverage of cricket look like BBC&apos;s sport coverage during Des Lynam&apos;s prime. There are no times given for when anything is going to be on - &apos;later&apos; is all we are told. Worst of their crimes against TV is that there are more replays than live sport, and even those are interspersed with ads every 10 minutes. I think the 100m last night was probably live, but it&apos;s difficult to know, as there is never any distinction given. I could go on. But I won&apos;t. Google Channel 7 Olympic coverage for an idea of the level of vitriol - it&apos;s even made the news over here.&quot; There, I saved you all of seven seconds of your collective lives.  7.00am: A question that needed to be asked: &quot;Are there any actual sports to report on? Or is today&apos;s only event Verbally Bashing Former Colonies?&quot; That from Amy Hordes. Well, largely no, and apparently yes, Amy. I am but a cypher. However, Elena Dementieva and Dinara Safina have just trotted out for the final of the women&apos;s tennis. Lovely.  7.05am: Team GB The umpire is a Brit! C&apos;mon. The girls are warming up, but there&apos;s absolutely no one in the stadium to watch them. Apparently this has been rescheduled. Or maybe the Chinese couldn&apos;t care two figs about the women&apos;s tennis?  7.07am: The Russians are guaranteed gold and silver here, of course. Then Rafael &apos;Biceps&apos; Nadal will take on Fernando Gonzalez afterwards in the men&apos;s final.  7.10am: The Beeb&apos;s commentary team is in a right old funk about the lack of spectators &quot;for this, an Olympic final&quot;. The rearrangement has left the crowd completely wrong-footed. First bit of stick for the Chinese&apos;s organisational skills, by my count.  7.12am: Hot blondes talk. &quot;The doom-mongers seem to think genetic doping is the next scourge that the Olympics and sport in general has to fight,&quot; announces Tim Maitland, off the cuff, like. &quot;I just wonder if anyone has checked the proportion of British female medalists with blonde ponytails. Could it be it&apos;s arrived sooner than they feared?&quot; Well, if the future is a little Stepfordian, I for one shan&apos;t complain.  7.16am: Usain Bolt has just run 9.69sec in the 100m!!! Oh, wait a mo, it&apos;s a dang repeat. Ben Ainslie&apos;s parade to GOLD out on the waves has been delayed again. They&apos;ve lost the wind, or it&apos;s blowing backwards, or something.  7.19am: Alex Pace tosses out a suggestion for putting GB top of the medal table, although I have no idea how much weight to give it... &quot;How about medals to geographical land mass \u2013 surely we&apos;d be top, surely.&quot; Surely? Safina is broken by Dementieva in her first service game. 2-0  7.21am: Qiu Jian takes gold for China in the men&apos;s 50m rifle. Ukraine and Slovenia take silver and bronze respectively. That&apos;s 28 gold medals for the host nation, who can probably open a bank or two on the back of their haul.  7.25am: Squeak, squeak, squeaky, squeak. Gnnnnrh, gnnnnnnnrh, gnnnnrh. Break and break again in the women&apos;s tennis. It&apos;s 2-2 now, as Safina and Dementieva&apos;s grunts echo around the empty gym hall.  7.30am: Team GB sailing It&apos;s lashing it down in Qingdao where Ainslie is loitering in his boat waiting for the final Finn race to begin. The commentators up in the BBC studio are having a chuckle about the fella out on the water - the one braving pneumonia and a fate with the fishes to deliver a soundbite or two.  7.34am: There&apos;s a lot of &quot;Olympic spirit&quot; being bandied about on the BBC couch. Liz Yelling has plenty, while Paula Radcliffe can barely run for the OS dripping from her shoulders. Or maybe from the fractured shin, I don&apos;t know. If Ben Ainslie&apos;s Finn race cannot be completed today, it will be tomorrow, so say the benevolent and watchful powers-that-be.  7.37am: Much discussion on how we can wangle it so that Team GB! GB! GB! (there, I did it) can top the medal table. Andrew Jolly is working on some kind of &quot;annual rainfall/days with no sunshine&quot; coefficient, while both he and Paul Meek reckon the Koreans might outstrip us in the medals per square kilometre stakes.  7.43am: News digest. Speaking of Korea, they are one game to the good against Japan in the women&apos;s Table Tennis bronze medal play-off. Team GB&apos;s Nick Dempsey has finished 17th in his RS:X (windsurfing to you and I) race, placing him fourth overall. Bryony Shaw earlier finished sixth in the women&apos;s RS:X, leaving her sixth in the standings. Dinara Safina is 5-3 up and serving for the set in the women&apos;s tennis final, but Dementieva looks like she might break back...  7.47am: Nope, Safina has closed it out to take the first set, 6-3. Apparently Dementieva has had a bit of a wobbly... not a happy devushku.  7.53am: Shock news from Aus, where most of this morning&apos;s correspondents seem to have been based. Andrew Collings is so disgusted with Channel 7&apos;s coverage that he has &quot;conceded the remote to allow the girlfriend to watch Will and Grace reruns for a bit&quot;. Quel horreur! What next, Andrew? Offering to do the washing up without being nagged? Going to the toilet to pass wind? Once you start making concessions, who knows where it will end...  7.56am: Gary Naylor&apos;s dystopian view of the post-marathon future for our unlucky-in-26.3-mile-road-race princess: &quot;So what&apos;s next for Paula? Given her hair colour, I guess a spot on the BBC team. Failing that, it&apos;s reality TV with Lee Sharpe isn&apos;t it?&quot; Two games to one in Korea&apos;s favour in the Table Tennis.  7.59am: This Table Tennis lark is quite fascinating, appearing akin to trying to land a cricket ball on a postage stamp, for the best part. Ping, pong, pyingyangyong. Korea looking good.  8.01am: Here&apos;s the question, but what&apos;s the headline that waggish Alex Pace is referring to? &quot;Will any of the papers be running this headline alongside pictures of our sailing heroes in the rain?&quot; Best guesses please, the winner getting a Beijing 2008 branded toothbrush holder.* *The winner will not receive a Beijing 2008 branded toothbrush holder.  8.05am: Safina and Dementieva are russian(!) around all over the place on their blue Beijing hard court, and it&apos;s 1-1 in the second set. Korea look to be on the brink of the bronze, to the delight of a shrieking crowd.  8.09am: I think the results of this little stunt are actually quite embarrassing, but anyway, here are the fruits of Andrew Jolly&apos;s labours... &quot;So if you get three points for a Gold, two for a Silver and one for a Bronze the top 10 points by area are: South KoreaTrinidadJamaicaSlovakiaSwitzerlandArmeniaCzech RepublicSloveniaTEAM GB! GB! GB!Netherlands&quot; Switzerland?!? They haven&apos;t even got bloody Federer to fall back on. And what have Trinidad won so far...?  8.14am: &quot;Am I the only one finding the &apos;three blondes in a boat&apos; talkcringeworthy?&quot; queries Peter Hobley, whilst curling his toes and grimacing like someone&apos;s put bulldog clips on his nipples. &quot;It&apos;s a bit patronising isn&apos;t it? Also at the post-victory interview the now non-drowned reporter even said they were &apos;sexy&apos;! FFS! (I&apos;m not saying they&apos;re not, but is it relevant?)&quot; As if the media would ever latch onto an easy label/focus on something as irrelevant as sex, Peter.  8.17am: I&apos;m scarpering dept. Thanks for all your emails, ladies and gents, and sorry about any I couldn&apos;t use. My sleep-deprived, Olympics-jaded colleague Taimour Lay will be slipping seamlessly into the MBM control pod, to guide you through the next half an hour of... nothing. And then whatever comes after (some British rowing, I&apos;ll wager). But keep him company until then, eh. Ciao  8.28am: Morning all. To be honest, my Olympic spirit was flagging somewhat. But a ninth listen to &apos;Welcome to Beijing&apos; has got me back on track. That, and three Hazelnut coffees (grade 4 in strength, the Guardian machine informs/warns me).Coming up: Medals aplenty in the rowing. And my sources in China tell me Ben Ainslie will finally get his chance to seal gold in the Finn in about 20 minutes time. The wrong kind of rain has been holding it all up in Qingdao.  8.34am: Naylor speaks out  &quot;Three blondes in a boat&quot; is exactly the mix of infantile talk laced with the promise of tabloid-friendly pictures that the Media can&apos;t resist (especially the BBC) - and it&apos;s pathetic. Yesterday, when the blokes won in the rowing, it wasn&apos;t &quot;four toffs in a boat&quot; was it? Although, obviously, it was.&apos;&apos; Isn&apos;t one of them ginger anyway? At least, more browny-russett than blonde. Sorry, I&apos;m being sucked in like the rest of the pro-blonde London media.  Speaking of which, Kenny Reid reckons the BBC is the culprit too. &apos;&apos;Just realised that the BBC is operating a &quot;blondes only&quot; policy for its female Olympic presenters, namely Hazel Irvine, Jill Douglas, Sharon Davies, That Scottish Sailing Woman, Clare Balding and Sue Barker. Why this anti brunette bias?&apos;&apos;  8.39am: Team GB Rowing The men&apos;s lightweight double sculls final is imminent. Mark Hunter and Zac Purchase will fancy it. The Danes are pretty good too. They&apos;re the Olympic champions.  8.42am: Drugs bust Greece&apos;s defending Olympic 400m hurdles champion Fania Halkia has tested for a steroid after officials from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) visited a training venue in Tokyo last week. Halkia has now hopped it from Beijing and returned to Greece after being informed of the positive finding. The hurdler faced a barrage of questions in Athens after a startling improvement saw her come from being a virtual unknown to win gold. &quot;Why do people want to give a negative impression of sports?&quot; Halkia said then. Yes, why? You tell us, Fania.  8.46am:  Andrew Jolly&apos;s alternative medals table debate continues. &apos;&apos;For the record, Switzerland won a gold medal in the men&apos;s doubles tennis and Trinidad came 2nd in the 100m last night. We could rule out countries that had only won a few medals, but we&apos;d still have the Koreans above us. Maybe Kim Jong-il could see sense and agree to reunification in the next few days, that might help us out.&apos;&apos;  8.48am: The BBC are interviewing &apos;Grandma Purchase&apos; in the stands. She obviously doesn&apos;t merit mention of her real name. And she&apos;s got a lucky bag with her! Grandson Purchase can&apos;t lose now. It&apos;s how cause and effect operate. And the race is about to start ...  8.50am: Team GB Rowing Purchase/Hunter who, for reasons of speed and efficiency in this commentary will henceforth be called &apos;Punter&apos;, have a made a decent start.  8.52am:  Punter = silver medal position nearing the halfway stage.  8.54am: Team GB Rowing double sculls Punter = gold medal position by a length ... Greece in second. Denmark in third.  8.54am: Gold to Great Britain! Mark Hunter and Zac Purchase win it, the first British pair to ever take gold in the lightweight men&apos;s double sculls. Greece second. Denmark third. &apos;&apos;Granny&apos;s bag will go home with a gold medal in it!&apos;&apos; the commentator bellows. I told you it would work: cause and effect, see.  8.59am: British expats rile the Australians again Peter Bridger in Papua New Guinea is feeling &apos;&apos;isolated&apos;&apos;. &apos;&apos;Our local TV channel gets a significant amount of feed from Channel 9 Australia and we even managed to see the swimming finals this afternoon (about 30 minutes delayed). But what did we get after? No more Olympics \u2013 power boat racing and Sunday Afternoon Footy (Rugby League).&apos;&apos;  9.03am: Team GB Sailing Ainslie has got going. He&apos;s leading with a quarter of the race gone.  In the women&apos;s tennis final, the two Russians are now a set apiece.  9.07am: This medal table obsessing has to stop! Email after email after email. Hang on, they&apos;re the only communication I have with the outside world. Keep them coming.  9.09am: Team GB Men&apos;s lightweight four final Four Brits, no time to type their names, and they&apos;re away ...  9.11am: Women&apos;s tennis final Elena Dementieva is a break up in the final set against Dinara Safina.  9.12am: Halfway mark. GB are third and the Poles are catching up. The Danes are storming it.  9.15am: Team GB finish fourth in the men&apos;s lightweight coxless fours Denmark take gold. Poland silver. Canada bronze.  9.17am:  &apos;&apos;Is Northern Ireland competing separately in these Olympics or as part of a united Ireland? Or is Team GB actually Team UK, and someone forgot the Irish? Or are there just no Irish athletes so it doesn&apos;t really matter?&apos;&apos; asks Robin Hazlehurst. The latter?  9.20am: Gold to Ben Ainslie in the Finn class! It&apos;s all wrapped up in Qingdao.  9.22am: &apos;&apos;Who invented this Team GB label?&apos;&apos; asks Robert Mullins. &apos;It&apos;s ugly and clumsy and the media are using it as if they&apos;ve been ordered to by the Queen. Can&apos;t we get back to INDIVIDUAL Olympians?&apos;&apos; We have been ordered to use it, Robert. The Compulsory Patriotism Department in Whitehall will revoke my license to MBM if I betray a whiff of national betrayal. And is there anything more important than consistent branding? Speaking of which, TEAM GB are now third in the medals table. Extraordinary.  9.28am: Team GB Women&apos;s quad sculls final  Katherine Grainger et al are up next. Geography/politics lesson: &apos;&apos;The Great Britain team includes athletes from Northern Ireland because, while Northern Ireland is not geographically on Great Britain, it is a constituent country of the United Kingdom. The name was assigned by the International Olympic Committee for the 1908 Summer Olympics along with the IOC country code GBR despite including athletes from Ireland, which was part of the UK, but not part of Great Britain.&apos;&apos;  9.32am:  China are the threat here. Grainger is the most successful female rower in history but doesn&apos;t have an Olympic gold. GB still leading. But the Chinese are coming!  9.34am:  Great Britain are holding it together. Half a length from China.  9.35am: Team GB Bronze By &apos;&apos;holding it together&apos;&apos;, I of course meant &apos;&apos;tiring rapidly and about to throw it away&apos;&apos;. Agony for Grainger, Annie Vernon, Debbie Flood and Frances Houghton. China finally made the move with 500m left to take gold. Great Britain hold on for silver. Germany take bronze.  9.42am: Women&apos;s tennis Elena Dementieva is serving at 5-3 for Olympic gold.  9.43am: &apos;&apos;Golden Sunday&apos;&apos; is the label Alex Pace wants to use to describe today. You may. I won&apos;t. Consider me the Kim Philby of MBM-ers. By the way, not since 1908 has Great Britain made it to the top three of the medals table. 21 in total. 10 golds. Pah!  9.51am: Read all about Team GB&apos;s watery day of glory.   9.53am: Women&apos;s tennis Elena Dementieva has beaten fellow Russian Dinara Safina 3-6 7-5 6-3 to win gold.  9.55am:  &apos;&apos;It&apos;s an exciting moment for Britain, and celebration&apos;s definitely in order, but facts are facts, and it&apos;s a tie for third in the medals table with Germany at present,&apos;&apos; Amy Horde tells me. Quite right! Sod it, let&apos;s have a joint European effort to challenge China and America&apos;s global domination. Britain as part of an integrated EU are top of the medals table.  9.59am:  &apos;&apos;Here in Australia, where to my knowledge they have not covered one second of the sailing, I&apos;m just wondering how to say &apos;Yngling&apos;, so that I can casually drop into Monday&apos;s water cooler Olympics conversation &apos;Hey what about that Yngling?&apos;&apos;&apos; Yes, keep it casual at the cooler, Alex. Well, I have said Yingling, Ingling and Why-gling - and alternate between these three options depending on mood and the amount of sleep i&apos;ve had - since social conventions should not dictate pronunciation. Liberate yourself from the fear of office embarrassment.  10.05am: Team GB Cycling At the velodrome, Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny are both through to the next round in the men&apos;s sprint.  10.07am: Medal table obsessing continues Oliver Pattenden exposes Amy Hordes&apos; lies! &apos;&apos;Unless Germany won a gold you haven&apos;t reported then Amy is wrong. Your table isn&apos;t updated but by my count Team GB is a gold ahead in third.&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;Consider this,&apos;&apos; orders Benjamin Arthur. Please. Don&apos;t make me. &apos;&apos;Were it not for Michael Phelps&apos;s 8 golds, Great Britain would currently be lying 2nd in the medal table. Ahead of the USA, France, Germany, Russia, Japan and, most importantly, Australia.&apos;&apos;  10.10am: Team GB Cycling Women&apos;s Individual pursuit Former rower Rebecca Romero against Northern Ireland&apos;s Wendy Houvenaghel. Gold and silver stand-off. Guaranteed British medals here.  10.13am: Romero is the Olympic champion! The time: 3.28.321. She won silver in Athens in the double sculls rowing. Remarkable. That&apos;s four golds for Great Britain already this morning. And it&apos;s stopped raining in London so, yes, ok, i give in, let&apos;s christen this day: &apos;Golden Sunday&apos;.  10.18am: Dark and disastrous Sunday  In the women&apos;s rowing eight final, Great Britain, missing two crew with illness, finish fifth. The Americans took gold.  10.21am: A man with a swear word for a name keeps banging on a pointless hypothetical drum: &apos;&apos;If it wasn&apos;t for Michael Phelps Team GB would have the same amount of golds as the USA. When was the last time that happened?&apos;&apos; But Phelps does exist. And if he didn&apos;t, someone else would. And they&apos;d probably be American, too. If Red Dwarf taught me any science (and it did get me through a physics GCSE) I accept that there might be a parallel universe somewhere in which Britain heads an Olympic medal table but my mind and body are currently rooted in this space-time reality and there&apos;s nothing you can do about that.  10.27am: Last bit of rowing. The men&apos;s eight final. Coming soon-ish/now.  10.28am: Apocalyptic Waterworld &apos;&apos;No idea if the Beeb are covering it, or even whether Channel 7 are showing it live, could be from yesterday for all I know, but the final of the 49er sailing appears to be happening in the middle of a hurricane, pretty much all boats have capsized, the Aussies went in the drink twice as we overtook them. Great TV for once! So they cut to rowing.&apos;&apos; Thanks to Andrew Jolly. That was live, i think. And Spain got gold.  10.29am: 63kg Wrestling Japan&apos;s five-time world champion Kaori Icho has retained her title.  10.31am: Team GB Rowing Men&apos;s eight  Canada lead. Netherlands second. Britain are &apos;&apos;comfortably&apos;&apos; third.  10.33am: Team GB Rowing SILVER MEDAL Canada take gold. The United States have the bronze.  10.38am: Counterfactual ponderings Oliver Pattenden picks up the hypothetical baton: &apos;&apos;If Michael Phelps didn&apos;t exist, would world hunger?&apos;&apos;  10.40am: Women&apos;s tennis doubles final The Williams sisters have won gold, after beating Spanish duo Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-2, 6-0 in just over an hour. Yan Zi and Zheng Jie of China beat Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine 6-2, 6-2 to take the bronze.  10.45am: Men&apos;s tennis final Rafa Nadal is a break up in the first set against Chile&apos;s Fernando Gonzalez.  10.50am: More team GB Cycling World champion Victoria Pendleton is through the first round of thr women&apos;s sprint. Oh look, the BBC are showing the &apos;&apos;Yngling Blondes&apos;&apos; again ...  11.15am: Sorry about that hiatus. I just did battle with some HTML coding and came off bloodied and bruised.  11.20am:  And just when I was as beaten and humiliated as humanly possible, the code returned to pound me again. Fortunately, we haven&apos;t missed much Olympic action. I promise. Right, let&apos;s get this show back on some kind of road.  11.23am:  &apos;&apos;Why are so many winners photographed attempting to eat their medals? If anyone has smeared them with steroids, we could be in for a right old mess,&apos;&apos; predicts Gary Naylor.  11.24am:  Amandine emails from the Indian Ocean, suggesting we turn the Olympics into a global imperial grudge match. &apos;&apos;Can anyone do a Cold War medal table with the old USSR&apos;s medal totals combined? I&apos;m too lazy but would like to know how the old empire is doing. Then why not one from the 19th century with the English empire medal totals combined? Maybe then we will be top. Just a thought.&apos;&apos;One world. One dream. That fell by the wayside pretty quick, didn&apos;t it?  11.29am: Men&apos;s tennis final Rafa Nadal takes the first set against Gonzalez 6-3.  11.34am: Coming up  The athletics gets going again at midday. And Briton Louis Smith has a medal hope in the gymnastics - the men&apos;s pommel horse, to be precise. There&apos;s badminton, softball, tennis and hockey, too.  11.40am: Gymnastics men&apos;s floor final  Another gold for China. Zou Kai took it, Spain&apos;s Gervasio Deferr has the silver and Russia&apos;s Anton Golotsutskov the bronze.  11.41am: Who on earth is this a description of? &apos;&apos;Her thighs are like Bavarian hams; I assume she has to talc them every half hour to stop them chaffing when she walks. Slightly incongruously, her top-half is marginally slenderer, and on top of her head she has a side-parted ginger bouffant.&apos;&apos; Read Andy Bull&apos;s latest blog to find out.   11.40am: Two Danes in a dodgy boat Denmark won the 49er skiff sailing earlier today, but race officials say they cannot confirm the medal because they are handling three protests against the result. The mast on the Danes&apos; boat broke shortly before the start and they rushed back to port to borrow a skiff from the Croatian team, which had failed to make the field of 10 boats for the race. If the Danes are disqualified, Spain&apos;s Iker Martinez and Xabier Fernandez, winners of the medal race, will retain the title they won in Athens fours years ago.  11.54am: Cycling Team Pursuit Britain&apos;s men just annihilated Russia to make tomorrow&apos;s final against Denmark. It&apos;s a world record from Ed Clancy, Paul Manning, Geraint Thomas and Bradley Wiggins. Elite Performance Director Clive Woodward is beaming from the side because that victory was all about visualisation and rugby balls and motivational mantras and middle-class self-aggrandisation.  12.01pm: Imperial Hangover Medals Table According to Andrew Jolly, &apos;&apos;the Soviet Union would only have 13 golds, and would be in 3rd. Depending on who you count as being in the British Empire, we could be up to 23 gold medals and 2nd place. We&apos;d need to invade China to get anywhere...&apos;&apos;  12.06pm: Common English Usage &apos;&apos;When did medal become a verb?&apos;&apos; asks Michael Bryan in Brussels, who I guess is upset about language being in flux.  12.10pm: Gary Naylor tells it like it should be: &apos;&apos;Andrew Jolly&apos;s suggestion that we invade China in order to top the medal table is plainly ridiculous. We should do what we did in the 19th century and flood the country with opium.&apos;&apos;  12.15pm: I&apos;m pooped. Tom Bryant is taking the MBM baton and he&apos;ll run with it all the way to 3pm.  12.25pm: Afternoon all. You&apos;ll be pleased to learn that Lolo Jones has won her 100m hurdles heat. &quot;My body knows what to do now. It felt really easy,&quot; she says modestly. Meanwhile Rafa Nadal is two sets up and 2-1 ahead in his hunt for gold. And that is all the news I&apos;ve managed to find in a desperate two minute flick through various TV channels.  12.28pm: An email about Olympic medals that relates to several earlier emails that I haven&apos;t yet had a chance to read dept: &quot;I make it 47 golds for the British Empire. Mind, I&apos;m including the USA and France in those figures,&quot; says Colin Williams, controversially.  12.32pm: It&apos;s noisy down near the start of the final heat of the women&apos;s 100m hurdles and one of the runners is getting aggro about it. Well, if raising a polite hand and standing up is aggro. It affects the Guinean runner, who runs straight into the first hurdle, making little attempt to jump it, and then falls over. Her Olympic Games has lasted precisely 1.23 seconds. It could only have gone worse if she&apos;d been disqualified for two false starts.  12.35pm: Meanwhile, in the hammer, there are some big men wearing improbably skimpy outfits. The Belarussian thrower has more to throw for then just gold, too. He&apos;s been promised a lifetime&apos;s supply of suasages if he wins. Tasty. Bridgitte Foster-Hylton won that 100m hurdles heat, by the way, and Brit Sarah Claxton has also progressed. Good for her.  12.37pm: &quot;The Chinese team are very poor in the catching the hammer event,&quot; chortles Gary Naylor of the antics of the Chinese judges scurrying about measuring the throws.  12.40pm: North Korea&apos;s Hong Un Jong has claimed the women&apos;s gymnastics vault gold, and is proudly raising her bouquet of flowers to the assembled jumping and tumbling fans in attendance. There&apos;s some hot Brit action coming up soon on the pommel horse, too, I&apos;ve been reliably informed.  12.42: In equestrianism news ... it&apos;s still going on. How can this be? Is there anything left for them to jump over? Meanwhile, the man from Belarus has just furthered his lifetime of suasages cause after spinning and hurling his hammer 81.61m - which is a long way in hammer terms, apparently. However the Slovenian has just thrown 82.02m, jeopardising the suasage riches for the Belarussian.  12.45pm: The sausage man&apos;s name, incidentally, is Vadim Devyatovskiy. Probably should have mentioned that earlier. Rafa Nadal is now 4-2 up in the third set, so expect him to be another to do that &apos;hilarious&apos; biting-the-gold-medal-to-see-if-it&apos;s-real routine.  12.46pm: Make that 5-2 now for Nadal.  12.49pm: Stuck in an epic deuce battle, Nadal has had three gold medal points and blown them all, he&apos;s now up 5-3. There&apos;s a lot of grunting going on - even more than in the hammer.  12.50pm: &quot;On the BBC trailer that they&apos;ve been using to show the favourites for some of the track and field events, there is a load of text on the screen. Am I right in thinking that this is Japanese text and not Chinese?&quot; asks Ruth Jones who, despite having the title Dr in her email address, thinks that I&apos;m the man who might know. I&apos;ll put this one over to the learned readers, Ruth.  12.53pm: Brit Jeanette Kwkye is running in the semi-final of the women&apos;s 100m ... and ... she gets a good start ... and finishes in third! That means she&apos;s in the final. Nadal has clinched gold in the Olympics and is rolling about on the floor as if to convince people that this actually means something to him.  12.55pm: &quot;If Gary Naylor thinks the Chinese bad at the hammer catching, he obviously hasn&apos;t seen their catching the javelin team in action \u2013 absolute rubbish, I could do better,&quot; ho-ho-hos Michelle Houtman.  12.57pm: &quot;What a swing to be able to rescue an exploding set of legs like that,&quot; is how the commentator in the gymnastics starts his coverage of the Chinese competitor Xiao Qin&apos;s efforts on the pommel horse. Disappointingly, the man in question&apos;s legs appear to be resolutely unexploded. Shame.  1pm: Once you do those flares, you are risking everything,&quot; the commentary team continue of the American&apos;s efforts on the pommel. There&apos;s also more talk about exploding legs. I have absolutely no understanding of this sport at all. Is this the most incomprehensible, yet exciting sounding, terminology of any event?  1.02pm: &quot;8,000 pairs of eyes staring down at you - that&apos;s pressure,&quot; says one commentator. &quot;That&apos;s 36,000 eyes in total,&quot; confirms the other one, helpfully. And here comes Louis Smith for Team GB.  1.05pm: &quot;There&apos;s the spindle and here&apos;s the triple Russian ...&quot; continues the nonsensical commentary. However young Louis seems to have done well. He did a good undercut out but broke form, too - meaning he has lost out in style, which must mean something to somebody. He scores 15.725, putting him into silver medal position with two gymnasts to go.  1.06pm: Louis Smith will definitely get bronze! The next competitor has fallen off the pommel, blowing his chances. That&apos;s GB&apos;s first ever gymnastic medallist at the Olympics.  1.07pm: &quot;When he exploded, he had nowhere to go,&quot; says the commentator of Fuentes Busmante, before adding &quot;he ran out of leather there&quot; for good measure. &quot;When you lose that swing, there&apos;s no return,&quot; confirms the other. WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT?!  BRONZE FOR BRITAIN Louis Smith gets third after being beaten into second by Croat Felipe Ude. China get the gold. But that really is fantastic from Smith - that&apos;s Britain&apos;s first ever men&apos;s Olympic medal on the apparatus. Well done to the 19-year-old.  1.12pm: &quot;Do those guys wear anything to protect their knackers on the pommel horse?&quot; asks Alex Pace, not unreasonably. Given the insanely tight trousers they are wearing, it&apos;s very easy to confirm that, no. No they don&apos;t.  1.14pm: &quot;I&apos;m sure that was novelty 80s band Bad Manners&apos; front man Buster Bloodvessel competing for Poland in the hammer. We&apos;ll know if he sticks his tongue out,&quot; Gary Naylor. Hey! Less of the novelty, Gary, Bad Manners are ska royalty. The Sausage man hammer thrower may be going hungry for the foreesable future. His last throw of 81.51 only gets him into third place.  1.16pm: &quot;Colin Williams is not entirely wrong to include USA in our British Empire tally ... never forget that the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, signed at the end of the War of Spanish Succession, granting Her Majesty&apos;s Government \u2013 in addition to medal-free zones like Gibraltar \u2013 the entire eastern seaboard of (what is now erroneously known as) USA as far south as Philadelphia,&quot; writes Jonathan Myerson. &quot;So we would have to find out which state each competitor comes from but I think worth it in the long run.&quot; I beg to differ, Jonathan.  1.19pm: Josh in Singapore writes to let us know that: &quot;Your coverage of the China vs Singapore women&apos;s team table tennis final is shocking to say the least!&quot; Helpfully, he seems to be applying for the position. &quot;This will be Singapore&apos;s first Olympic medal in 40 something years if they win. The hilarity being that all the Singapore girls are born and bred Chinese. Anyway, the Chinese girls are up 1-0 after the first singles game in this best of 5.&quot; So now you know.  1.26pm: Tasha Danvers has won her 400m hurdles heat in impressive style. That&apos;s a good run for the Brit. In fact, this weekend is shaping up to be one of the Britain&apos;s most successful sporting weekends ever. Makes a nice change, doesn&apos;t it?  1.29pm: &quot;What is it with Nadal&apos;s knickers?&quot; writes Al Parkes. &quot;On his way to winning gold, on every one of his serves, I was reminded of a quote by the great Jim Royle: &quot;I paid a pound for these underpants and I&apos;ve got 50 pence worth stuck up me arse&quot; He&apos;s got nothing on the gymnasts, Al. Both meat and two veg were very much on display there.  1.32pm: The most tedious game of baseball ever has finally reached it&apos;s conclusion. After four rain-affected days and 10, 10, scoreless innings, the epic battle between South Korea and China is over after a stunning* 1-0 win for the South Koreans. The winning run was scored in the bottom of the 11th. As my colleague, Taimour, has just said: &quot;Bet the Chinese crowd forced to watch that to make up crowd number enjoyed that one&quot;.  * Use of the word stunning may not be strictly accurate  1.34pm: Kozmus has won the hammer, while the sausage man comes in second. He&apos;ll be both angry and hungry - which is a dangerous combo for a big man who throws hammers for a living. Don&apos;t get in his way later. From the TV pictures I&apos;ve just seen, the winner of the women&apos;s 400m hurdles heat ran the second half of the race with her shoelaces undone. Does that mean she gets more points?  1.39pm: Benjamin Arthur has helpfully emailed in what I presume is a complete summary of all the medals that would be claimed by the British Empire in the Imperial Olympics. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t open it on my computer. However, I&apos;d suggest that, if he has that much time on his hands, he might like to click here.  1.43pm: Christine Ohuruogu is no doubt stretching, lunging and doing whatever else these runners do to warm up as she&apos;ll be going round the track in the 400m semi-final in 20 minutes&apos; time. Provided, of course, she remembers to turn up, which is by no means a guarantee given her previous form in keeping her athletic commitments.  1.46pm: While you wait for that you can, of course, head on over to Paul Doyle to find out what&apos;s going on in Chelsea&apos;s tussle against Portsmouth. Provided, of course, that you come straight back here after, like. Even better, you can catch up with all the events so far today, written up in a far more professional manner that you&apos;ll find round here.  1.56pm: Having previously ridiculed Benjamin Arthur for perhaps not having enough to fill his time, I now wholeheartedly apologise. He&apos;s emailed his workings to me again in a form I can read and the results are, it&apos;s safe to say bewildering. Almost totally worthless, but bewildering nonetheless. Here they are: Based on medals table Sunday 17th August 1300 GMT Total medals won Gold, silver, bronze, total 1. 2nd (Communist) World: 58, 55, 65, 178 2. British (Anglosphere inc USA): 45, 42, 49, 136 3. Third Reich/European Axis: 35, 42, 43, 120 4. Roman Empire: 37, 34, 44, 115 5. Evil (Former Eastern Bloc): 25, 37, 47, 109  6. Napoleonic Empire: 26, 27, 32, 80 7. British Empire (19th Century): 26, 23, 25, 74 8. USSR: 14, 23, 37, 74 9. Current Communist Bloc: 33, 18, 18, 69 10. Chinese Empire (China 2008): 31, 13, 11, 55 11. French Colonial Empire: 5, 11, 16, 32 Notes:Communist World = ALL the current or former communist countries of the 20th century \u2013 i.e; pre-1989 communism (I may have left some out but Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea, PRC &amp; the whole eastern bloc are included)I have only counted the European Axis powers although of course if Imperial Japan and her colonies (inc South Korea) were to have been included then likely they would top the table \u2013 especially if one counts the parts of the Chinese mainland that the Japanese conquered. Roman &amp; French Empire numbers likely to significantly increase as the Africans come to the fore on the track over the coming week (ditto British)Roman Empire includes ALL figures for Germany even though they conquered less than half of modern GermanyFrench Colonial Empire includes ALL figures for Canada even though they didn&apos;t really administer most of the country.No Time to consider Mongol, Ottoman, Habsburg, Prussia, Spanish, Portugese, Dutch , Japanese empires and COUNTLESS others! But these are some of the main players.   1.59pm: Anthem watch: As Usain Bolt is awarded his gold medal it&apos;s safe to say that the Jamaican anthem is not a belter.  2pm: Good news: Ohuruogu has turned up for her heat. She&apos;s standing by her blocks looking nervous, if truth be told.  2.02pm: They&apos;re off, and Christine Ohuruogu leaves her attack late, waiting until the final bend before getting her engine going. She eventually finishes in first, with a time of 50.14 her best of the season. She&apos;ll be in the 400m final now. Woo!  2.05pm: That was a very good run from Ohuruogo who breathlessly says she was pleased with it afterwards. Meanwhile, Benjamin Arthur&apos;s list - ranked in order of golds won, looks like this: 1. 2nd (Communist) World: 58, 55, 65, 178 2. British (Anglosphere inc USA): 45, 42, 49, 36 3. Roman Empire: 37, 34, 44, 115 4. Third Reich/European Axis: 35, 42, 43, 120 5. Current Communist Bloc: 33, 18, 18, 69 6. Chinese Empire (China 2008): 31, 13, 11, 55 7. Napoleonic Empire, 26, 27, 32, 80 8. British Empire (19th Century): 26, 23, 25, 74 9. Evil (Former Eastern Bloc): 25, 37, 47, 109  10. USSR: 14, 23, 37, 74 11. French Colonial Empire: 5, 11, 16, 32  2.06pm: &quot;From one medal table obsessed saddo to another, I salute you,&quot; writes Andrew Jolly. But what about the Ottoman Empire, eh?  2.09pm: Sanya Richards has gone off like a mentalist in her women&apos;s 400m heat. Good lord, she&apos;s killing the competition. She finishes in first in 49.9 and she slowed down considerably towards the end. Hmm, Ohuruogo might struggle there.  2.11pm: &quot;We&apos;ve been sitting here debating &apos;sports&apos; that should be dropped from the Olympics and ping pong was top of the list. The rest consisted of anything with a bat and a ball, anything with a bat and a net, anything with water and a net, indeed anything with a net. And synchronised swimming,&quot; writes a man apparently named Pommie Bastard. My opinion is that, any sport in which winning the Olympic gold isn&apos;t the absolute pinnacle should be dropped - so that&apos;s football, too. By the way, Briton Lee McConnell came in fourth in her 400m heat. She&apos;ll be off home, then.  2.14pm: Nicola Sanders is on the blocks for Heat Three of the women&apos;s 400m. The gun goes and ...  2.16pm: ... and she comes in fourth. Thats a shame. It was a tough race though and she was in the outside lane, which didn&apos;t help, but she flagged on the back straight and probably won&apos;t even get in as a fastest loser.  2.19pm: &quot;Has Benjamin Arthur told you the countries he used to create his list?&quot; asks Bob O&apos;Hara. &quot;I&apos;m curious to (a) see if Finland counts as part of the Axis, and (b) to see how long it takes before the history wonks start arguing about the correctness of the list.&quot; Hmm, this Olympic minute-by-minute is in danger of becoming a battle-ground for history professors unable to take the weekend off. 50.71 was Nicola Sanders time. Good but not good enough.  2.21pm: Nicola Sanders looks absolutely crestfallen. &quot;I gave it my all, being in lane nine didn&apos;t help ... but I just didn&apos;t have it in my legs,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn&apos;t expect this. I&apos;m really disappointed.&quot;  2.24pm: John in Singapore - not Josh, sorry about that - from 1.19pm is still keen for the mantle of table-tennis correspondent. &quot;One more gold for the communists. The Chinese Chinese wiped the floor with the Singapore Chinese 3-0 in the women&apos;s table tennis team final. It was fantastic ping pong to be fair to both teams, though. Well done to Singapore for getting their first medal in 48 years.&quot; Well done, indeed.  2.25pm: &quot;We were talking about Olympic football earlier on, and we reckon that it should just be the U21 World Cup. Get rid of this U23 plus extras nonsense, that way, it would matter, and the guys in the teams would actually want to play and win,&quot; reckons Andrew Jolly. &quot;Also, get rid of the tennis, they don&apos;t need another event that isn&apos;t a Grand Slam.&quot;  2.27pm: There will be a short break in the apparently never ending equestrian competition, after which the British team will be competing. I&apos;m of the opinion that the equestrianism should be dropped from the Olympics, preferably this very instant. Surely just making the barriers slightly more ornate and moving them inside does not warrant the insane amount of horse jumping there has been during these games?  2.30pm: Imperial medal historian and all-round spare-time king Benjamin Arthur emails again to let Bob O&apos;Hara know that he did include the list of countries that were used on the list but, unfortunately, they were on the document I can&apos;t open. He also adds: &quot;I have included Finland as a part of the European German Axis; its 1,1,1 count is included in the grand total.&quot; So there you go.  2.34pm: &quot;Could you let us know what&apos;s happening in the women&apos;s 3m springboard final?&quot; asks Bronwen Jones. &quot;Isn&apos;t it going on now? There&apos;s been no mention of it anywhere and you&apos;re constructing medals tables based on defunct empires instead! As a Canadian living in London, I want to know how Blythe Hartley is doing.&quot; Well, Guo Jingjing is currently winning, while Yuliya Pakhalina is in second. Not sure where Blythe is at the moment - I&apos;ll let you know if I find out.  2.37pm: Blythe is in third. She&apos;s just launched a two-and-a-half somersault with pike and the thoughts are that she did it very well, despite her flat feet. Anything else you want to know, Bronwen, then you know where we are.  2.43pm: The women&apos;s steeplechase record has just come tumbling down. Russian Gulnara Galkina-Samitova has just romped home in a time of 8:58.81 - the first female athlete to ever break nine minutes for the steeplechse - beating her own record of 9:01.59. There was also a brilliant fall halfway round from one of the medal contenders, who doesn&apos;t look terribly chuffed.  2.46pm: Hot Brit action on the horses and it&apos;s Nick Skelton competing, who seems to be having no trouble staying on the back of his horse as it runs round the arena. This sport looks easy.  2.48pm: The commentator says Skelton&apos;s riding for his life, though, which would make this considerably more exciting if true. He finishes in a strong time but gets eight faults. No idea whether that&apos;s good or bad.  2.53pm: They&apos;re playing Abba&apos;s Dancing in between dives in the women&apos;s 3m springboard diving final. I mention that by way of providing &apos;colour&apos;. Blythe Hartley nails another two-and-a-half somersault with pike and it&apos;s another good dive, which bumps her up into first for the time being. There you go, Browen. Beat that for personalised journalism delivered straight to your door.  2.56pm: Back to sports that should or shouldn&apos;t be included in the Olympics - Steve Dove has a radical idea: &quot;I think we should get back to the Olympic ideal - stark naked, no animals, no nets, and the only judges are the ones who hold the tape.&quot; Kinky, Steve. Very kinky. Except for the removal of animals, obviously.  2.58pm: This equestrianism really is nonsense. I have no idea what the point of it is - nor do I have any understanding of how the times, scoring and jaunty jackets have any bearing on proceedings. As a result, I&apos;m just going to ignore it. Unless Britain win a medal, at which point they will obviously be heralded as great.  3.02pm: Bad news for the Canadian diver, whose progress, bafflingly, I appear to be covering. China&apos;s Guo Jingjing has taken the gold. There&apos;s a bit of history between Blythe and Guo, apparently. No matter, Guo has now won the most women&apos;s diving medals in Olympic history. Yulia Pakhalina of Russia has finished second, while Wu Minxia has come second. Sorry Bronwen.  And that, I&apos;m afraid, is that. I&apos;m off and so is this here minute-by-minute. Thanks for all your emails throughout the night and day. There will be more Olympic coverage starting in the early hours of tomorrow morning. Meanwhile, for other sweaty minute-by-minute action - head to here and, from 3.45pm this afternoon, join me again here.", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Olympics 2008: Athletics", "Sport", "Paula Radcliffe", "Olympics 2008: Cycling", "Olympics 2008: Hockey", "Olympics 2008: Sailing", "Olympics 2008: Gymnastics", "Louis Smith", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-16T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/18/olympics2008.retail", "sentences": ["Powerful &quot;They are absolutely neck and neck,&quot; said Terry Rhoads of Shanghai-based sports specialists Zou Marketing."], "title": "Marketing: The real Olympics competition: Nike and Adidas claim China's heroes", "article": "When China&apos;s biggest sports star takes to the starting blocks this week, the nation will pray for him to end the race with a gold medal around his neck. But executives are more worried about the rest of Liu Xiang&apos;s attire. He will cross the finishing line of the 100 metres hurdles with a swoosh on his shoes - but if he makes it to the podium, he will have three stripes on his sleeve.  Never mind the athletics. The real battle in Beijing is not the struggle to top the medal table, but the multibillion-dollar fight between two giant brands intent on conquering the fastest-growing sportswear market in the world. Adidas and Nike have invested unprecedented sums in wooing Chinese consumers during the Olympics. The German firm is estimated to have spent $190m (\u00a3100m) on sponsorship and associated marketing; its US rival has stumped up close to $150m. Adidas is sponsoring the games itself and the Chinese Olympic committee. Torchbearers, officials and volunteers are all clad in the brand; so too are Chinese champions. &quot;Every single Chinese athlete winning a medal will be in Adidas on the podium,&quot; says Paul Pi, vice-president of marketing for Adidas China. But Nike has fought back by sponsoring the Chinese teams in 22 of 28 Olympic sports. &quot;The moment for Chinese fans is when the gun goes off and when he crosses the finish line. If Liu&apos;s in first place, the whole nation will go completely insane with excitement - and he will be wearing swooshes,&quot; says Nike spokesman Charlie Brookes. At the root of this rivalry is a market a fraction the size of the US - but growing at 30% annually for the past five years. Pi concluded, &quot;If you want to lead globally, you have to lead in China.&quot; Nike says it passed the $1bn sales mark this spring, a year ahead of schedule. Adidas says it has leapfrogged its rival in becoming market leader by the start of the games, with sales up 60% in the first half of 2008 - though its claim is based on factors such as brand image. It is &quot;on course&quot; to reach $1.5bn by 2010. Powerful &quot;They are absolutely neck and neck,&quot; said Terry Rhoads of Shanghai-based sports specialists Zou Marketing. He estimates China could overtake the US as the biggest single market by 2025. &quot;Adidas had to have this sponsorship,&quot; added Greg Paull, co-founder of marketing consultants R3, who believes the brand was at risk because of Nike&apos;s deals with individual athletes. &quot;We expected the Olympics would not be a powerful marketing tool - but the opposite has been the case. The market hasn&apos;t matured to the stage of the US or UK in terms of marketing literacy and the celebrity aspect is still very strong. If you can tie Liu Xiang or Yao Ming to your product, that has a big impact.&quot; Adidas has tapped into the national passion for sport with a campaign that gives its standard slogan a patriotic twist: &quot;Together in 2008 - Impossible is nothing&quot;. &quot;Other countries are interested in the Olympics. But in China well over 90% of people are passionate and supportive and want to be involved,&quot; said Pi. Meanwhile, Nike&apos;s &quot;Courage&quot; spots emphasise individual achievement. &quot;For us, it&apos;s about connecting with athletes: we make products that make them perform better and then build on the excitement that creates,&quot; says Brookes, citing the ultralight Hyperdunk shoe for Kobe Bryant or Asafa Powell&apos;s Zoom Aerofly. He pointed out that ordinary consumers benefit from the the same technology. The real race is outside the Olympic zone. Adidas, which is opening stores at the rate of two a day, will have 5,000 shops in China by the end of the year. Its new store in Sanlitun - several miles away from the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium - opened last month and is the largest in the world, with 3,170 sq m of retail space over four floors. There is a rooftop basketball court, a smoothie bar, computer terminals to customise trainers and exercise stations. A gallery showcases the footwear Adidas has made for the games, from boxing boots to slides for divers - all presented in glass cases and lit with artistic reverence. Nike has slightly fewer outlets, and its main store is a mere 1,208 sq m, but its Wangfujing location is one of Beijing&apos;s premier shopping hubs. It also boasts a gallery in the 798 art district, where the current exhibition traces the brand&apos;s development - and not a single item is for sale. Flair Meanwhile, the two companies face competition from sporting icon turned entrepreneur Li Ning. The three-time gold medallist demonstrated his gymnastic flair as he &quot;ran&quot; around the top of the Bird&apos;s Nest Stadium before lighting the Olympic cauldron - albeit dressed in Adidas. But to many young Chinese people he is as well known for his eponymous sportswear brand: sales reached $750bn last year. After his appearance, his Hong Kong-listed stock rose 3.5%. But its appeal may be flagging for shoppers like Yang Yang, who visited Sanlitun&apos;s Adidas store shod in Nike trainers this week. &quot;I do wear some Chinese brands - mostly Li Ning,&quot; said the 26-year-old sports teacher. &quot;They&apos;re a lot cheaper, but the style and technology of Adidas and Nike are better. I usually buy Nike for running, but a lot of the Adidas casualwear looks really good.&quot; Rhoads believes that consumers like Yang will leave both Adidas and Nike winners for many years to come. &quot;This market is phenomenal,&quot; he said. &quot;China has 400 million under-20s who are watching the Olympics and falling in love with sports. Most people in China still are not playing sport.

Two days before the end of the last Olympics, the young sprinter from Shanghai established the format for the next four years of his life when he won gold in Athens, the first Chinese man to triumph in a track and field event in the history of the Games. It was a masterplan that had its route mapped out. Its destination was this Thursday night, the evening of the final of 110m hurdles final in Beijing. It did not need repeating because 1.3 billion people knew what they would be doing no more. This morning at the Bird&apos;s Nest Stadium here in Beijing, China&apos;s glorious, spectacular production of the greatest sports show lost its star performer. At 11.45am, workers across the country had stopped when Liu Xiang made his way from the call-room to the track, being greeted by close on 90,000 for a session of track and field where only one race mattered. It was the first round of the 110m hurdles, and from the moment the picture of him warming up hit the giant screens, the cheering started. As he emerged on to the track, the flag-waving began. He took his place in lane two. He adjusted his starting blocks and he took off his tracksuit top. But then when he walked to the line, he had more than a slight limp. He stretched out his right leg. He slipped into position. He moved hesitantly when there was a false start. He stood up and, as quickly as he entered, he left. No matter how many gold medals the host nation win or how fast Usain Bolt ran in the 100m or how often Beijing is mentioned in the same sentence as Michael Phelps, Liu Xiang had provided China with its seminal moment of these Games. The shock was palpable on the people. Workers who had united to watch the first appearance of their sporting hero did not utter a word when he wandered away. They just looked at each other, in disbelief. It does not matter if he returns to the Olympics in London in 2012 to make up for this hell. Or if he regains the world record. Or if he wins the world title next summer. Liu Xiang - and those 1.3 billion people - cannot replace their loss. Since that August evening in Athens in 2004, his every move had been scrutinised. He did not hide away. But he was advised to allow it become part of his preparation. Whatever happened, he would be in the spotlight, and it was only going to grow brighter. Few athletes knew what he was going through, but Cathy Freeman was the exception. In Sydney in 2000, the Australian 400m runner was carrying the weight of a country, an Aborigine who bridged the gap of a nation. &quot;For me, I couldn&apos;t afford to get too sentimental about how I made people feel, it&apos;s such a personal time in his life, he shouldn&apos;t compromise,&quot; she said of Liu. &quot;He has to maintain his priorities, keep his perspective. He&apos;s already proven that he can perform under pressure and he should pretty much take that model and use it. It&apos;s just another day at the office. &quot;I was absolutely honoured. I didn&apos;t see it as a distraction or as a negative, I was so confident in my abilities as an athlete ... there was nothing that was going to detract from my performance.&quot; And so it proved when she won gold. Only at the end of the race, when she sat on the track looking into space, did the whole occasion get the better of her. She would have still been sitting there if she had her way. Liu knew the pressure, and nothing was going to stop his progress towards Beijing. Except, the curse of the untimely injury. Since May, he has been battling to be fit. Yet it did not stop the biggest scramble for tickets for Thursday night in the Bird&apos;s Nest, let alone this morning&apos;s round of heats. He had entered the public&apos;s prominence when he won gold in Athens, at the time equalling the world record-holder held by Colin Jackson, of Britain, of 12.91. He was the gold medallist in the sport that often defines a Games. China had their talismanic figure, and his every move has been dissected ever since. His victory at the world championships in Osaka last summer only increased the excitement. He had been injured, yes, and in June he had also lost the world record he had taken to 12.88 when Dayron Robles, of Cuba, ran 12.87 in Ostrava. But he did not want to let the people down. The biggest night of them all here was set to be a duel between the pair, but the drama arrived before the final act. Silence among the people. All 1.3 billion of them.", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Olympics 2008: Athletics", "Athletics", "Sport", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-18T07:14:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/18/originalwriting.chineseliterature", "sentences": ["He co-wrote the film Shanghai Triad, which was directed by Zhang Yimou."], "title": "Extract from Three Sisters by Bi Feiyu", "article": "Bi Feiyu is one of the most respected authors and screenwriters in China today. He was born in 1964 in Xinghua, in the province of Jiangsu, China. He co-wrote the film Shanghai Triad, which was directed by Zhang Yimou. His new novel, Three Sisters, portrays three sisters struggling to change the course of their destinies in a China that does not belong to them. Yumi uses her dignity, Yuxiu her seductive powers, and Yuyang her desire for success in a shared refusal to dissolve into collective anonymity. In this exclusive extract from Howard Goldblatt&apos;s translation, the village Party Secretary&apos;s oldest daughter, Yumi, meets her future husband, Peng Guoliang, for the first time The arrival of Yumi brought the story to a climax. After the women had taken her brother away from her they opened a path to her home and dragged her along it. This was a scene they had been awaiting for a long time, and once it had been acted out they would all breathe easier. So they walked her home, one step at a time; she didn&apos;t have to do anything but lean back and let the others do all the work. When she reached the gate her courage abandoned her and she refused to take another step. A couple of the bolder young maidens pushed her up until she was standing right in front of Peng Guoliang.  The crowd thought he might actually salute her, but he didn&apos;t. Nor did he snap to attention. He was, in fact, barely able to stand, as he just kept opening and closing his mouth. When Yumi sneaked a look at him, the expression on his face put her at ease, though she was fidgeting bashfully. Beet-red cheeks made her eyes seem darker than ever, sparkling as they tried to hide from view. To the villagers outside the door she was a pitiful sight; they could hardly believe that the bashful girl they were looking at was actually Yumi. In the end, it seemed, she was just a girl. So, with a few lusty shouts from the crowd, the climax passed and the tense mood dissipated. Of course they were happy for Peng Guoliang, but it was Yumi who was really on their minds. Wang Lianfang walked out to treat the men in the crowd to cigarettes and even offered one to the son of Zhang Rujun, who was cradled in his mother&apos;s arms, looking foolish as only a baby boy can. Wang tucked the cigarette behind the boy&apos;s ear.  &apos;Take it home and give it to your daddy,&apos; he said.  They&apos;d never seen him be so polite, though clearly that was meant as a joke. A chorus of laughter made for a delightful atmosphere before Wang shooed the crowd away and, with a sigh of relief, shut the door behind them. Shi Guifang sent Peng Guoliang and Yumi into the kitchen to boil some water. As an experienced housewife, she knew the importance of a kitchen to a young couple. First meetings always turned out the same, with a pair of shy and unfamiliar youngsters seated behind the stove, one pumping the bellows while the other added firewood, until the heat turned their faces red and slowly loosened them up. So Guifang opened the kitchen door and told Yuying and Yuxiu to go somewhere else. The last thing she wanted was for the other girls to hang around the house. Except for Yumi, not one of her daughters knew how to behave around people. While Yumi was lighting a fire, Peng Guoliang gave her a second gift. The first, in accordance with an age-old custom, had to be a bolt of fabric, some knitting yarn, or something along those lines. By coming with a second set of gifts, he showed himself to be different from others. He gave her a red-barrelled Hero-brand fountain pen and a bottle of Hero-brand blue-black ink, a pad of forty-weight letter paper, twenty-five envelopes, and a Chairman Mao pin that glowed in the dark. There was a hint of intimacy attached to all the gifts, each of which, at the same time, represented a cultured and progressive spirit. He placed them all on top of the bellows, beside which he had laid his army cap, with a star that shone bright and deep red. With all these items arrayed on the bellows, silence spoke more loudly than words. Peng Guoliang worked the bellows, each forceful squeeze heating up the fire in the stove. Flames rose into the air, like powerful pillars, moving from side to side each time he brought his hands together. For her part, Yumi added rice straw to the pillars of fire, moving in concert with him, as if by design, and creating a moving tableau. When the straw fell from the fire tongs onto the flames, it first leaped into the air, then wilted and turned transparent before finally regaining colour and creating both heat and light. The two stove tenders&apos; faces and chests reddened rhythmically from the flames; their breathing and the rising and falling of their chests, too, had a rhythmic quality, though both required adjustments and extra control. The air was so hot and in constant oscillation it was as if a private sun hung above each of their heads, all but baking them, in jubilant fashion, a sort of heated tenderness. Their emotions were in chaos, rising and falling in their breasts. There was confusion, at least a little, and something in the air that could easily have led to tears, here one moment and then gone the next. Yumi knew she was in love, and as she gazed into the fire, she couldn&apos;t stop the flow of warm tears. Peng Guoliang noticed, but said nothing. Taking out his handkerchief, he laid it on Yumi&apos;s knee. But instead of using it to dry her tears, she held it up to her nose. It smelled faintly of bath soap, and nearly made her cry out loud. She managed to hold back, but that only increased the flow of tears. Up to that moment they hadn&apos;t exchanged a single word and hadn&apos;t touched one another, not even a finger. That suited Yumi perfectly. This is what love is supposed to be, she told herself, quietly sitting close but not touching, somewhat remote but in silent harmony. Close at hand, though longing in earnest and calling to mind some distant place. As it should be. Yumi&apos;s glance fell on Peng Guoliang&apos;s foot, which she could see was a size 42. No question about it. She already knew his sizes, all of them. When a girl falls for a boy, her eyes become measuring tape. Her gaze stretches out to take a measurement, then, when that&apos;s done, snaps right back.Custom dictated that Peng Guoliang not stay under the same roof before Yumi became his wife. But Wang Lianfang was in the habit of breaking rules and dedicated to transforming social traditions.  &apos;You&apos;ll stay here,&apos; he announced. He took great pleasure in seeing Peng Guoliang walk in and out of the yard; his presence created an aura of power around the house and brought him high honour.  &apos;It&apos;s not proper,&apos; Shi Guifang said softly.  Wang Lianfang glared at her and said sternly, &apos;That&apos;s metaphysical nonsense.&apos; So Peng Guoliang took up residence in the Wang home and stayed put. When he wasn&apos;t eating or sleeping, he spent his time behind the stove with Yumi. What a wonderful spot that was. A sacred spot for village lovers. He and Yumi were talking by this time, though the strain on her was considerable, since words in the national dialect, putonghua, kept cropping up in his speech. She loved the way it sounded, even if she hadn&apos;t mastered it, because those few added words conjured up distant places, a whole different world, and were made for talk between lovers. On this particular evening the fire in the belly of the stove slowly died out and darkness crept over them, frightening her. But this sense of fright was augmented with complicated feelings of hope and anxiety. Budding love is cloaked in darkness, since there is no road map to show where it&apos;s headed; neither partner knows how or where to start, and that usually makes for awkward situations. They maintained a respectful distance out of fear of touching, absorbed in feelings of anxiety. Peng Guoliang reached out and took Yumi&apos;s hand. At last, they were holding hands. Admittedly, she was a little scared, but this was what she&apos;d been waiting for. Letting Guoliang hold her hand instilled in her the satisfaction of a job well done, and a sigh of relief emanated from the depths of her heart. Strictly speaking, she was not holding his hand; her hand was caught in his. At first his fingers were stiff and unbending, but slowly they came to life, and when that happened they turned wilful, sliding in between hers, only to back out, unhappily, seemingly in failure. But back they came. The movements of his hand were so new to Yumi that she had trouble breathing. Then without warning, he put his arms around her and covered her lips with his. \u00b7 This is an exclusive edited extract from the first translation of Three Sisters, due to be published by Telegram in early 2009, price \u00a38.99", "tags": ["Original writing", "Chinese literature", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-18T12:16:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/18/stockmarkets.china", "sentences": ["The Shanghai Composite Index shed 5.3%, to close at 2,319.87, while the Shenzhen Composite Index slipped 5.9% to 656.08.", "The talks suggested that the authorities &quot;would not take any move to save the poor market,&quot; said Zhai Peng, a strategist at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai."], "title": "Chinese shares slump to 20-month low", "article": "Chinese shares slumped to a 20-month low today, with airlines, oil companies and other stocks dropping sharply amid anxiety about the wider economic outlook.

WPP said that its performance in 2008 should match that of last year, despite economic uncertainty, due to major advertising drivers such as the US presidential election and the Beijing Olympic games. WPP&apos;s performance in the first half of the year, a marked improvement after Sir Martin Sorrell&apos;s company saw a deterioration in growth at the end of the first quarter, was fuelled by a strong performance in emerging markets such as Asia. &quot;The group&apos;s profit performance in the first half of the year was strong and ahead of most estimates, despite the general economic tightening in the United States and western Europe in the second quarter,&quot; the company said.

In emerging markets such as Latin America and Asia, the company&apos;s revenues were up 10.7% in the first six months. Overall, WPP managed to increase its operating margin by 0.5% to 13.6%.

A marvellous goal by the 20-year-old Angel Di Maria was enough to see off Nigeria, who missed good chances in both halves of a match played in searing heat in the Bird&apos;s Nest. So fierce were the conditions that the game was interrupted in each half by a formal time-out in which the players could rehydrate themselves. Such an unwanted innovation, breaking the flow and the rhythm of the game, was necessitated by the ludicrous decision to schedule the kick-off for noon in order to leave the national stadium clear later in the day for events more to the liking of US television. Sergio Batista was in charge of the Argentina squad, assisted by Jose Luis Brown and Hector Enrique, all three of them Maradona&apos;s colleagues in the 1986 World Cup winning lineup. The value of continuity could be seen in the fluid movement of a team built around Lionel Messi and two over-age midfield players, Juan Roman Riquelme, their captain, and Javier Mascherano, the only survivor of the 2004 final, when Argentina beat Ecudador in Athens with a single goal from Carlos Tevez. This match was a replay of the marvellous final of 1996, in which Nigeria became the first African country to win a major senior international football tournament. The Super Eagles that day included Jay Jay Okocha, Taribo West, Daniel Amokachi and Sunday Oliseh, plus the then-unknown Nwankwo Kanu and Celestine Babayaro.  In the semi-final they had achieved a pulsating 4-2 defeat of the Brazil of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos. A couple of days later, in front of 86,117 people in the Georgia Tech football stadium, they took on a team featuring Claudio Lopez, Hernan Crespo, Ariel Ortega, Roberto Ayala, Javier Zanetti and Diego Simeone, their 3-2 victory reaching its climax with Emmanuel Amunike&apos;s lovely improvised flick. No one who attended those matches, or the 89,102 who almost filled Beijing&apos;s National Stadium yesterday, would dream of questioning the place of football in the Olympic Games. The connection goes back to 1908, when a Great Britain team won the first tournament in London, and it has never been broken. Indeed it was so successful in its early years that after Uruguay&apos;s two victories in 1924 and 1928, Fifa took note and created the World Cup. When the Uruguayans promptly won that at the first time of asking in 1930, they could justifiably claim a hat-trick of world titles. It still means something, not least to Brazil, who would dearly love to win it but have only two silver medals (from 1984 and 1988) and, now, two bronze to show for their efforts. This time it was Argentina who knocked them out in the semi-final, gaining quick revenge for last year&apos;s hurtful defeat in the final of the Copa America. Coached by the much criticised Carlos Dunga, Brazil beat Belgium 3-0 in Friday night&apos;s bronze-medal match in Shanghai. Nigeria&apos;s raking speed and sudden switches of the point of attack caused problems for the Argentina defence throughout the first half. Foraging down the right, Solomon Okoronkwo was constantly creating promising combinations with Peter Odemwingie, the squad&apos;s sole over-age member. The dangerous Victor Obinna had a long-range drive palmed away by Sergio Romero, and Okoronkwo&apos;s cross was missed by both Argentina&apos;s central defenders before bouncing harmlessly off the unmarked Promise Isaac, the team&apos;s captain, at the far post. With more of the ball, Argentina were creating fewer chances. Riquelme and Messi probed the fringes of the Nigerian defence, looking for the chance to set Sergio Aguero free, but too often the timing of the final pass or the run was marginally awry. On the stroke of half-time, however, Di Maria had Ambruse Vanzekin scrambling to meet a howitzer shell sent in from long range. Thirteen minutes after the interval Argentina found the timing and precision they had been looking for. Messi took possession just inside his own half, wheeled on the ball and stroked it behind the right back, Olubayo Ademefi, inviting a run by Di Maria. The tall winger, who moved to Benfica for \u00a34.78m after starring in last year&apos;s under-20 World Cup, made ground towards the advancing Vanzekin before lifting the ball neatly over the goalkeeper. It was all Argentina required. Mascherano&apos;s attempted clearance rebounded off Ebenezer Ajilore and bounced just wide of the post, Sani Kaita fired over the bar from outside the area, Odemiwingie and the substitute Emmanuel Ekpo unaccountably missed Obinna&apos;s cross from the right, and when Everton&apos;s Victor Anichebe, another substitute, hustled in to meet another Obinna cross at the near post, Romero clawed the ball off the line. But Argentina held out and secured their medals as they did four years ago, using their close skills to retain possession and hold the effects of the heat at bay. Although this tournament is supposed to be for under-23 players, those who enjoy football&apos;s higher arts would have been pleased to see the 30-year-old Riquelme, one of the game&apos;s authentic poets but seldom a winner at the highest level of international football, with gold around his neck. He is currently the leading scorer in the South American qualifying group for the 2010 World Cup, and we may not have seen the last of his great talent.

Given each lord&apos;s age, gender and peer-group interests - the highest fashion consumption rates are for women in their early thirties who read glossy magazines - the peers&apos; share will come in well below the average of 35kg of textiles per person per year (mostly clothing). Much of this will be thrown out within a year; a small part will be recycled or donated to charity, and the rest will be chucked in the bin. Last week&apos;s waste reduction report from the Lords committee read a little in places like an analysis of the woodland defecation procedures of bears. &apos;[The] culture of &quot;fast fashion&quot; encourages consumers to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new, cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months,&apos; announced the venerable lords in tones of shock and awe.  Many women are inured to the obscene excesses of fast fashion. One pound in four is now spent on &apos;value&apos; fashion as provided by the likes of Primark, Asda and Topshop, which has had huge success with model Kate Moss&apos;s range of clothes. Between 2003 and 2007 garment prices fell by an average of 10 per cent and over the past five years the rate of frenzied buying has accelerated, while we make room for it by discarding some two million tons every year. The true weight of this addiction has only really been felt by an unfortunate few such as the Salvation Army which, with around 2,750 of the UK&apos;s 9,000 charity clothing banks, has been faced with an ever growing mound of tat to flog to consumers indifferent to pre-worn unless it happens to be vintage. Value fashion retailers will debate forever as to how they can sell clothes so cheaply, usually citing economies of scale, but it has been clear to recyclers for some time that a fall in fibre quality and finishing is part of the equation. This makes the resale of last season&apos;s paper thin, slightly shrunken sun dress a distinctly unappetising commercial proposition. Besides, there isn&apos;t much incentive for consumers to buy worn when a new dress costs less than a lunchtime panini and coffee. The bulk of discarded fast fashion is chucked into landfill. Meanwhile, the fashion industry has been particularly adept at avoiding green censure and criticism. While more prosaic sectors - food and drink, electronics, detergents and even car manufacturers - have been forced to own up to environmental shortcomings either to pre-empt legislation or conform to new regulations (such as the EU directive that means your hairdryer or washing machine can no longer be flung into landfill) fashion appears to have charmed us all in a haze of sequins, air kisses and the seemingly boundless dynamism of fast fashion with its high street empires and super-rich moguls. But when Defra, the department for the environment, began to analyse the impact of different materials in the nation&apos;s landfills a couple of years ago, fast fashion&apos;s get-out-of-jail-free card was unexpectedly revoked. The nation&apos;s penchant for &apos;McFashion&apos; - as one-night-only T-shirts and skinny jeans have been dubbed - was found to translate into more than three million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.  More significant to millions of fashion-lovers than the opinions of a Lords committee or Defra will be the opinion of the style press. And even those who formerly and gleefully proclaimed Primark the new Prada are now suggesting that fast fashion has rather had its day. Apparently it is all about &apos;investment dressing&apos; - buying one piece and loving it for a long time - now as fashionistas tighten their tiny little belts. &apos;Gucci or gas?&apos; asks the September issue of Harper&apos;s Bazaar, advising fashion-lovers feeling the credit crunch to survive on &apos;one big ticket item, something in between or a little bit of both&apos;.  There&apos;s some validity in this argument, as anything that cuts down the rapid turnover begins to reverse the fact that - according to Matilda Lee from the Ecologist - just 2 per cent of the average clothing budget goes on services that repair or lengthen the lifespan of our garments and accessories. However, to be truly sustainable, the fashion parameters will have to be widened. If fashion is about ingenuity and innovation, this is a good time for the industry to draw on these qualities and return to measuring fashion in terms of something other than quantity. There has already been a shift. Phil Patterson, once textiles manager at Marks and Spencer, has set up ecotextile.com to allow consumers to assess their wardrobe in terms of environmental damage units (EDUs) with the goal that they&apos;ll be more fibre-discerning in future. The London College of Fashion recently launched its Centre for Sustainable Fashion and there has been a renaissance of thrift fashion ideas from reworking existing pieces to sewing classes, kit fashion, clothes swaps and clothes and accessory libraries.  There would appear to be some ethical motivation for change too. In the aftermath of the Observer and Panorama expos\u00e9 of child labour used in manufacturing a line for Primark, an ICM research poll, commissioned by Drapers magazine, found that 42 per cent of people who shop at Primark were less likely or a lot less likely to shop at the retailer because of what they had heard.  In reality, any demise of super-cheap, super-fast fashion probably comes down to market economics. Labour costs have increased 50 per cent in the past four years across provinces in south-eastern China, the sewing room of the world. Meanwhile, fast fashion is scarily dependent on cheap fibres, namely polyester and cotton - which together account for more than 80 per cent of all fibre production worldwide. Both are dogged by sustainability issues. As petroleum production declines, polyester prices are soaring, while cotton&apos;s insatiable need for water (and agrichemicals), coupled with the fact that two-thirds is still rain-grown in areas where rainfall has declined, means there&apos;s not enough to go around. Add to this a new, hungry consumer in the form of the Chuppie (the Chinese yuppie) who has developed an appetite for fast fashion herself, meaning that Chinese producers are less eager to export.  It will almost certainly get slower. In order to keep up with the trend for two new lines a week, brought to the high street by Spanish fashion giant Zara, competitors are increasingly reliant on air freight, and that is becoming hugely expensive.  Shipping a standard container from Shanghai to America&apos;s east coast costs $8,000 (\u00a34,315) today, as opposed to just $3,000 a few months ago. Container ships are slowing down to cut fuel costs. If fashion stays fast it will need to become more localised, which will increase cost. So it can be slow and cheap, or fast and expensive. It is the combination of cheap and fast that is unsustainable.  In any case, we shouldn&apos;t overly mourn the passing of cheap fast fashion. We may be short on cheap fibre and oil, but one thing we have an abundance of is creativity. The demise of fast fashion could be as revolutionary as the mini skirt, the Ugg boot and Agyness Deyn all rolled into one. \u00b7 Lucy Siegle is the Observer&apos;s Ethical Living columnist and Visiting Professor at the London College of Fashion", "tags": ["Life and style", "Ethical and green living", "Recycling", "Environment", "Retail industry", "Business", "Fashion"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-23T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/26/universitycollegelondon.universityrankings", "sentences": ["UCL climbed three places to 22nd in the annual international rankings published last week by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China."], "title": "UCL overtakes rival Imperial in world university rankings", "article": "University College London has overtaken its rival Imperial in the most highly rated world rankings of universities. UCL climbed three places to 22nd in the annual international rankings published last week by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. In a statement, UCL said the latest annual tables of research universities indicates that UCL&apos;s place among the world&apos;s leading universities &quot;has risen again&quot;. UCL president and provost professor Malcolm Grant said: &quot;These new rankings confirm UCL&apos;s strengths - and steady improvement - on the global stage.  &quot;We know that the UCL community conducts excellent research and teaching, but it is our commitment to applying that excellence to the world&apos;s major problems that make us London&apos;s global university.&quot; Imperial dropped from 23 last year to 27th in the 2008 tables. The universities of Cambridge and Oxford have maintained their 2007 positions of fourth and 10th in the world respectively. The tables are dominated by the US universities, with Harvard ranked top in the world, but UK universities continue to be among the best, with five institutions, including UCL and the universities of Manchester and Bristol, improving their international positions on last year. The UK has 11 universities in the world&apos;s top 100, the second highest number after the US with 54.  The universities of Manchester and Bristol improved on their 2007 standing, climbing eight places to 40th and one place to 61st respectively. Kings College London rose two places to 81st in the world and Birmingham university climbed one place to 91st. Four UK universities slipped down the league table, most notably Imperial. Sheffield University dropped the most, falling five places to 77th in the world, while Edinburgh University slipped two places to 55th and Nottingham University fell to 82nd in the world from 81st last year. The figures show that UK universities continue to punch above their weight compared with the performance of institutions in other countries. For example, Germany invests around 6% of its gross domestic product in its universities, compared with 4.9% in the UK. But only six German institutions are among the top 100 compared with 11 from the UK. Seventeen of the top 20 institutions are from the US. The universities of Harvard, Stanford, and California, Berkeley, maintained their 2007 first, second and third places in the league table respectively. \u00b7 Full tables are available arwu.org", "tags": ["Higher education", "UCL (University College London)", "Education", "University of London"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-25T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/26/cribsheet", "sentences": ["&quot;They can&apos;t all be foreign-born.&quot;Chris Arnot What we learned this week Our weekly round-upOn the global stage, this year&apos;s Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings of research universities confirmed the dominance of American institutions, with plucky little Britain hanging in for silver."], "title": "Crib sheet: Home schooling | Islam MA| Weekly round-up", "article": "Oh!

Our cover story last week - No school like home - provoked a battle between staunch advocates of home education and traditionalists who insisted a classroom was a better place to learn than a lounge. The article looked at research that claimed home education can be an &quot;astonishingly efficient&quot; alternative to school.  And, on education.theguardian.com, the knives were out - first from home education&apos;s defenders. &quot;Earthtracer1&quot; wrote: &quot;Until more than a few decide to stop pandering to the profitable establishment business that is modern schooling, we are unlikely to see the changes required [to our education system].&quot; &quot;Nefertare&quot; agreed. &quot;If I want my children to have the education I think they deserve, I&apos;ll be teaching most of it to them,&quot; he wrote.

Or so they&apos;d like to think, anyway.Jessica Shepherd The senior adviser on the right track After the day job in Whitehall as senior adviser on Muslim issues to Hazel Blears at her Department for Communities and Local Government, Maqsood Ahmed heads for two hours of study on the train on the way home to Leicester.  Slacking on his part would make the dropout rate 100% for Warwick University&apos;s MA on Islam in Contemporary Societies - Ahmed is the only student so far to tackle the full course. At the end of the first year, he says with characteristic enthusiasm: &quot;The course has exceeded my expectations. Even we so-called Muslim experts need to expand our understanding. Instead of just accepting the subjective view from my background, for instance, one of my tutors has lent me books by mainstream, non-Muslim academics on subjects like Islamic family law.&quot; &quot;I feel that this course is the only one of its kind that deals with Muslims in societies where they&apos;re in a majority as well as a minority,&quot; says Muhammad Anwar, one of four highly qualified academics able to provide Ahmed with one-to-one tuition. (There are other students, but they&apos;re taking one or two modules rather than the whole MA.) Anwar is research professor in Warwick&apos;s Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations (Crer) and one-time head of research at the Commission for Racial Equality. &quot;I&apos;ve known him since 1999, when we were both speaking at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies,&quot; Ahmed confides. &quot;But that doesn&apos;t stop him putting me through it when we meet at Warwick,&quot; he adds with a grin. &quot;It can be quite brutal.&quot; Despite the ongoing threat of home-grown terrorism, Ahmed declares himself &quot;very optimistic&quot; for Britain&apos;s third-generation Muslims - substantial numbers of whom have embraced education and are making their presence felt in a wide range of professions. &quot;The chaplain at a top university like Warwick tells me that there are at least 1,000 Muslim students,&quot; he says. &quot;They can&apos;t all be foreign-born.&quot;Chris Arnot What we learned this week Our weekly round-upOn the global stage, this year&apos;s Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings of research universities confirmed the dominance of American institutions, with plucky little Britain hanging in for silver. There were interesting movements within the UK contingent (see page 6), while in Asia, China&apos;s universities still lag behind Japan and Australia, and the top Chinese institutions belong to Taiwan and Hong Kong. But Beijing takes a long view and will eventually overtake Asian rivals - and who knows, even mighty Harvard.  Back in the UK, the helicopter parents have landed. Last week, we learned that the admissions service Ucas had capitulated to pressure and allowed parents to manage their children&apos;s applications for the first time. One in 10 of this year&apos;s half a million university applicants have named a parent or guardian as their agent in the race to secure a place. The five types of helicopter parent werei dentified by Paul Redmond in Education Guardian earlier this year and involve themselves in every aspect from applying onwards - open days, halls of residence, etc. The mobile phone, remarks Redmond, is surely &quot;the longest umbilical cord in history&quot;. Parents will have been closely involved in the dramas played out over the past two weeks in the Clearing process, which seems to have been even more fast and furious than ever.  Helped by record A-level results, acceptances to universities from students in England for 2008 were up 6% (more than 15,000) on this time last year, Ucas announced. A record 375,104 applicants had had their university and college places confirmed so far and the numbers who had accepted places through Clearing had also risen 11.6% on last year to 9,263. And a possible first?

One person who does stand out, however, is former id designer American McGee, whose unusual name and raft of quirky, Tim Burton-esque titles ensure that people keep watch on what he&apos;s doing. Currently living in Shanghai and trickling out Grimm, his latest anarchic opus based loosely on the fairy tales of the Brothers of the same name, the gamesblog tracked him down to find out where the other auteurs are, what it takes to be a free spirit in an industry obsessed with the bottom line, and what he&apos;s learned living in China. Explain Grimm to my mum. Grimm is a video game presented like a television show. The &quot;host&quot; is a crabby dwarf named Grimm who&apos;s had enough of fairy tales made too sweet by modern day political correctness. He longs for a time when fairy tales meant something, when they had teeth, contained lessons, and could frighten good behavior out of bad children. Each week he re-introduces a well-known tale in its current-day, toothless form. He then invites the player to help him return it to a grimmer state. The game play of Grimm is designed to be highly accessible - you &quot;paint&quot; darkness on the world by running around. Everything in the world can transform, the rocks and trees to the birds and bees convert from wholesome to horrific. When the work&apos;s done Grimm once again presents the tale. But this time things are more to his liking: Justice is served, naivety and bad deeds are punished, and all&apos;s well that ends up dead. In total there are 24 episodes of Grimm, delivered in a unique weekly fashion. You can get the episodes for FREE during the first 24 hours after their weekly launch, just like television. After that you can still play the game using a variety of pay methods, either via GameTap&apos;s site or other digital distribution partners. Your games have a distinctive style and a dark humour that&apos;s unusual in games. Where do you get your inspiration? My childhood was bizarre and often scary. I was fed an odd mix of media, real life drama, and travel. I suppose the heavy rotation of Jacques Cousteau and Monte Python took its toll. These days I take inspiration mostly from the artist and creators that surround me at work. We&apos;ve assembled an eclectic bunch here in Shanghai. People from around the world, with a variety of odd background, all intent on expressing themselves through games. Nothing better than collaborating with a group of interesting and odd people to get truly inspired. Which distribution model encourages the most creativity? Why? A finance and distribution model that allows an audience time to find a product is best. The current retail box-product model suffers not because of the distribution - but because of the limited availability of shelf space at the retail outlets. Scarcity of shelf space means a game must perform exceptionally well - beating out all other competitors for shelf space - the moment it hits the shelves or be considered a failure. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, relegating good games to obscurity, and limiting customer choice. A publisher who funds and distributes with digital distribution in mind, creates an environment where creativity can be encouraged. Designers aren&apos;t forced to fit into pre-defined genre slots or to focus on &quot;me-too&quot; designs that kowtow to market expectations. Bigger risks can be taken on smaller projects. And successful small projects can be expanded on when appropriate. In general the industry needs more forms of incubators. Where do you see the most creativity in gaming coming from? Are there any people/studios you keep an eye on? It seems that a lot of the most successful creativity is being expressed in smaller format games and (as is the case with the Wii) on innovative platforms. Studios that embrace alternates, be it in distribution, development methods, interface devices, or explore other untested concepts in gaming, tend to produce the most interesting content. I&apos;m particularly interested in things coming out of Nintendo, Media Molecule, Telltale, GameTap, Valve, and EA Partners. Each of these groups is helping to reshape various aspects of game development, distribution, interface, and financing. You&apos;ve developed a reputation as a creative and Tim Burton-esque developer: an independent spirit with big budget funding. Why is this so unusual in the industry? Independent spirit maybe, big budget funding barely. But the budgets (as long as they aren&apos;t painfully limiting) aren&apos;t the point. I think my reputation (good and bad) has come from the fact I&apos;ve been consistently unusual in my approach to development (location, methodology), storytelling (themes, characters), and the presence of my name in association with the game titles. People know to expect the unexpected. Compared with other (perhaps wiser?) developers and studios who strive for consistent, if somewhat repetitive, development and market performance, I&apos;m more interested in testing new ideas. Looking back at your career, where do you think you learned the most, in terms of the skills you have today? A lot of the foundation came from id - the understanding of the dedication and creativity needed to produce good games. The business understanding came in part from the time I spent with EA, and also in large part from the time I&apos;ve spent as an independent developer. But the hardest and best lessons certainly came with the development of my last game, Bad Day LA. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong, and I walked away with a mountain of lessons. Until the point that development skidded off the track and crashed I held in my mind that any problem, no matter how big, could be solved - any broken project fixed. Perhaps true when there&apos;s unlimited time and resources - but the reality of the world outside places like id and EA is that things can just break beyond fixing. The realization of that fact has increased my respect for good planning and management as well as my admiration for solid game development teams in general. I&apos;m still learning a huge amount every day - thanks to being in Shanghai, starting a new studio, and working on some innovative projects like Grimm. Being here is a challenge on every level - culturally, linguistically, and physically. Nothing can be taken for granted, everything must be proven and re-proven - from handling of company finances and planning, to development processes, team building, and interface with the local community. Thankfully, all these challenges are interesting and very rewarding. You currently live in Shanghai. How have you been influenced by that culture in your game designs and development styles? It&apos;s had a tremendous impact on my development style. Living in China has made me more respectful of the limited nature of things: time, resources, and energy. It has impressed upon me the importance of process, clear communication, and strong team culture. And it has really opened my eyes to the chemistry of people - human nature, personality types, and shared expectations. All of this has driven me to take a very personal and humanistic approach to how the studio has grown and our projects are planned. As the development environment in China is still new and has a lot of growing to do, I think one of the most important things our studio can do to influence the future is to illustrate a more human approach to development. With that in mind we plan and prioritize to avoid overtime and &quot;crunch&quot; work. We emphasize health and rest as keys to higher productivity and creativity. And we encourage openness and communication between people and departments as a way of working more effectively. Our games are of course impacted by exposure to the environment here. Now that we&apos;re starting work on a game specifically designed for the China market I see myself leveraging the past 4 years of language, culture, and understanding into the game concept, design, and creative direction. It&apos;s an odd thing to be a foreigner building games for the Chinese market - but so far, so good. We&apos;re having a lot of fun, learning a lot, and I hope bringing to life something rewarding for our team and our audience. What will be the next revolution in gaming? I think we&apos;ll continue to see updated interface devices at the forefront of the mini-revolutions in the years to come. Ultimately, I think this is all heading to one uber-revolution in the shape of seamless computer-human interfaces, ala &quot;The Matrix&quot;. It&apos;ll be great to get away from the dated keyboard/mouse, monitor, speakers way of interfacing with our content. As soon as someone starts offering trial &quot;implant&quot; testing - I&apos;ll be first in line. I just hope I don&apos;t crash my brain, it would take a lifetime to reinstall everything.

When asked what measures the west could take against Russia in the crisis over Georgia, Bernard Kouchner told a press conference in Paris: &quot;Sanctions are being considered.&quot; He gave no details, but the threat reflects western impatience at Moscow after its invasion of Georgia and its recognition of Georgia&apos;s breakaway provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as independent. Despite Kouchner&apos;s comments, it will not be easy to reach consensus on sanctions within the EU as some states will be unwilling to jeopardise mutually beneficial relations with Moscow. In particular, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is unlikely to support any moves that could damage relations and interrupt the flow of gas and oil to Europe. It is the first time that France, which prides itself on good relations with Moscow, has raised the possibility of sanctions or other measures in the standoff between the west and Russia. &quot;I do not want to prejudge the issue before the EU summit on Georgia has taken place,&quot; Kouchner said. &quot;But we will work hard with our 26 partners to draft a strong statement that signifies our refusal to accept the situation in Georgia. France does not support breaking off relations with Russia. This will have to be sorted out through negotiation. This will take time, we are not deluding ourselves.&quot; Analysts say the EU is not contemplating the type of sanctions imposed on Iran or Zimbabwe, which include arms embargoes and travel bans. But the EU is likely to postpone talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia scheduled for September, or at the extreme, break them off indefinitely. Similarly, France, which is scheduled to host a biannual meeting of the EU-Russia council in Nice in November, may decide it is not the time to roll out the red carpet for the Russians. Recent moves to forge security ties with Russia appear doomed. Moscow has expressed interest in having a role in attempts to forge a common European defence policy. Russia had offered the use of helicopters to the EU as an incentive for being included. On the economic front, analysts speculated the EU could take a closer look at the activities of Gazprom, the Russian energy giant in Europe. Gazprom gets 70% of its profits from sales to EU countries, and the size of the market gives the EU important leverage. The flipside is that Europe, particularly Germany, depends heavily on these supplies. As to support for Georgia, the EU could improve visa access for its citizens, give Tbilisi greater trace access to the EU, or hold an EU-Georgia summit. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, dismissed the idea of sanctions as the product of a &quot;sick imagination&quot;. &quot;My friend Kouchner also said that we will soon attack Moldova and Ukraine and the Crimea ... But that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well,&quot; he told reporters at a security meeting in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe. &quot;I think it is a demonstration of complete confusion.&quot; France, which brokered a ceasefire between Russia and Georgia, has called an emergency meeting of EU leaders on Monday to discuss the most serious rupture between Russia and the west since the end of the cold war. Russia failed to get the robust support it was seeking from its allies on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a security group that includes China and that Russia help set up. After a meeting in Dushanbe, attended by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, the group condemned the use of force and called for respect for every country&apos;s territorial integrity.  &quot;The SCO states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the South Ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully, through dialogue, and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks,&quot; the final declaration said. Britain said it would not accept the redrawing of Europe into spheres of influence. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said such concepts were &quot;anathema&quot; and belonged to the second world war era of Yalta. He rejected the argument that Nato was an offensive alliance seeking to encircle Russia. The 1945 agreement at the Yalta conference, between the leaders of Britain, the US and the Soviet Union, saw the allied powers accept that eastern Europe fell into Moscow&apos;s sphere of influence. Miliband&apos;s comments on BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme followed a tough statement signed by himself and the foreign ministers of the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan deploring Moscow&apos;s &quot;excessive use of military force&quot; in Georgia. The statement, described as an &quot;unprecedented step&quot; by the Foreign Office, followed a warning from Miliband delivered in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to Medvedev that he bore a &quot;big responsibility&quot; not to provoke a new cold war. The foreign ministers said Moscow&apos;s recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violated Georgia&apos;s integrity and sovereignty. &quot;We ... condemn the action of our fellow G8 member. Russia&apos;s recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and is contrary to UN security council resolutions supported by Russia.&quot; In his interview, Miliband rejected the notion that his visit to Ukraine had been provocative. He said he went there because it was important to say to a friendly country that &quot;we support their democratic choices&quot;. The foreign secretary reiterated Britain&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s wish to be in Nato and rebuked Russia for treating its neighbours as if they were either &quot;enemies or vassals&quot;. Miliband, tipped as a future Labour party leader and potential prime minister, went to Kiev to deliver a speech flying the flag of western democracy on Russia&apos;s doorstep, while seeking to avert a new crisis on the Crimean peninsula, home to an ethnic Russian population and Moscow&apos;s Black Sea fleet. The speech represented the strongest criticism of the Kremlin from a leading European government official in years, delivered in a country that is Russia&apos;s neighbour and which Russians view as the cradle of their civilisation. Miliband declared a turning point had been reached in Europe&apos;s relations with Russia, ending nearly two decades of relative tranquillity. He said Tuesday&apos;s decision by Medvedev to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent represented a radical break and a moment of truth for the rest of Europe. &quot;[Medvedev&apos;s] unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance,&quot; Miliband said. &quot;It is not just the end of the post-cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around Europe.

The French are chairing the EU and have called Monday&apos;s summit, the first time such an emergency meeting has been staged since the lead-up to the war in Iraq in 2003. &quot;Certain countries have asked that sanctions be imposed,&quot; said Kouchner. &quot;Sanctions are being considered and many other measures.&quot;  He said the aim on Monday was to demonstrate strongly that Europe did not accept what had happened in Georgia. EU ambassadors are to meet in Brussels tomorrow to argue over how to respond to the Georgia crisis. Despite Kouchner&apos;s words, economic or trade sanctions are not likely to be imposed by the European leaders whose countries are highly dependent on Russian gas and oil supplies and whose big business has much at stake in Russia. There is some pressure for diplomatic retaliation against Moscow and to call off scheduled negotiations on a new strategic pact between the EU and Russia.

What broke was not only the columns of Russian tanks the Georgian artillery was aiming at. It was a 16-year post-Soviet consensus about the power of Russia to affect the course taken by its neighbours. The cold, unspoken western calculation was that, the quicker we pushed eastwards with a combination of political, oil and military projects, the less Russia could resist. Even an economically resurgent Russia was still judged to be either too weak, too poor or just too ramshackle to stop it. To claim, as David Miliband did yesterday, that Nato did not have a sphere of influence and that the eastern expansion of the military alliance was merely an expression of individual democracies exercising their new-found sovereignty, was breathtakingly disingenuous. In May, a subcommittee of the Nato Parliamentary Assembly, a body that brings together parliamentarians from Nato members and its partners visited Romania and Bulgaria, two of the six states along the Black Sea and the latest members of Nato. The topics discussed on this visit strayed far from its brief - energy and environmental security. The committee heard how Romania and Bulgaria occupy a strategic position between Europe, the largest energy consumer, and the oil-producing countries. Two rival oil and gas pipelines, the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline and the South Stream project backed by Russia, arrive here. Talk of oil and gas led seamlessly on to the military role Nato could play in securing this supply. Paragraph 28 of the executive summary of this visit reads: &quot;Nato has not traditionally played a role in energy security matters ... It can however play a more active role defending energy infrastructure and the flow of oil and gas on the high seas ... Nato might also provide security for infrastructure in energy-producing states facing unrest.&quot; Nato yesterday brushed aside Russian claims that an naval exercise in the western part of the Black Sea had anything to do with the crisis going on in the eastern shore. The Nato parliamentarian&apos;s visit held before the Georgian crisis erupted says otherwise. If this is not a &quot;sphere of influence&quot; being constructed and planned by Nato&apos;s existing members along Russia&apos;s most sensitive border in the South Caucasus and right though Russia&apos;s most sensitive sea, what is?  The cold war was a nuclear standoff between two military superpowers with mutually opposed economic systems and ideological beliefs. The new period we could be entering lacks many cold war ingredients. Russia is weaker militarily than the Soviet Union was and its reach is not global. It can sell arms to Syria or Iran, but it can no longer restart the revolution in Angola or Cuba. Russia is unashamedly capitalist. But it is also now allergically anti-western and free to form its own alliances. That was evident in the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev flying eastwards to Tajikistan on Wednesday for a summit with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, an assembly which includes Russia, China and four former members of the Soviet Union. The way to counter the forces unleashed on August 7 is clear: stop rearranging the furniture on Russia&apos;s sensitive southern border; stop militarising the Black Sea; stop pretending that this is only a conflict about loftier goals, a simple struggle between authoritarianism and western liberal democracy. The ethnically driven post-Soviet map is more complex than that. Local conflicts should be kept local. As things stand, everything is being done to widen them out to the regional level.

At a summit in Tajikistan of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which Putin set up seven years ago, China and four ex-Soviet central Asian countries called for respect for the territorial integrity of states and criticised the use of force to redraw borders, a rebuke of Russian conduct. President Dmitry Medvedev went to Dushanbe, Tajikistan&apos;s capital, to try to drum up support for Russia&apos;s position. But the summit statement only served to highlight Russia&apos;s worsening isolation. &quot;Russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated,&quot; said Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador in Brussels. He warned the EU that it would come off worse than Russia if a summit of EU leaders on Monday decided to impose sanctions on Russia, as suggested yesterday by Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister. The EU summit, called by France, is the first such emergency meeting since the lead-up to the war in Iraq in 2003. &quot;Certain countries have asked that sanctions be imposed,&quot; said Kouchner. &quot;Sanctions are being considered and many other measures.&quot; He said the aim on Monday was to demonstrate strongly that Europe did not accept what had happened in Georgia. EU ambassadors are to meet in Brussels today to debate how to respond to the Georgia crisis. Despite Kouchner&apos;s words, economic or trade sanctions are not likely to be imposed by the European leaders whose countries depend on Russian gas and oil supplies and whose big business has much at stake in Russia. There is some pressure for diplomatic retaliation against Moscow and to call off scheduled negotiations on a new strategic pact between the EU and Russia. But the European commission said the next Russia-EU negotiations were still scheduled for next month and Chizhov said he knew of no plan to cancel them. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, treated the talk of European sanctions with contempt. &quot;That&apos;s a demonstration of complete confusion, the product of a sick mind,&quot; he said. Sanctions, said Chizhov, &quot;will be to the detriment of the EU as much if not more than to Russia. I certainly hope reason and common sense will prevail&quot;. Jean-Pierre Jouyet, France&apos;s minister for Europe, made it plain that Paris did not want to sever channels of communication with Russia. &quot;The essential aim [of the summit], following the latest Russian declarations, is to show Europe&apos;s unity and capacity to act, balancing the need for dialogue and the need for firmness towards Russia,&quot; he told a meeting of diplomats. In an interview with CNN, Putin, seen as the main force behind Russia&apos;s hammering of Georgia, amplified conspiracy theories aired in the Russian media - that the war was created by Dick Cheney, the US vice-president, and McCain to create an international crisis and fan anti-Russian hostility that would undermine Barack Obama&apos;s chances of getting to the Oval Office. &quot;The suspicion arises that someone in the United States especially created this conflict to make the situation more tense and create a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of US president,&quot; Putin said. The White House said Putin&apos;s allegations were &quot;patently false&quot; and the state department said it was &quot;ludicrous&quot; for the Russians to say they were not responsible for what had happened in Georgia. \u00b7 This article was amended on Monday September 1 2008.

What could happen next? The first significant development will be at the emergency summit of the EU on Monday, when discussion of sanctions will be on the table. These could include a visa ban on officials from the breakaway regions, a ban on Russian property investment in Europe or the postponement of new partnership accord talks between Moscow and the EU, which are scheduled for September 15.  Will the EU go that far?

Russian president Dmitry Medvedev anticipated that, and expressed his disdain.  What he apparently did not anticipate was the disapproval by China, an ally in their joint opposition to the hegemony that the United States has enjoyed since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The difference between the two powerful neighbours came to the fore at the annual summit of the six-member Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe on Thursday. Medvedev failed to convince the other leaders that Moscow&apos;s actions were essential to prevent Tbilisi&apos;s aggression against South Ossetia.  The SCO, originally known as the Shanghai Forum, was established in 1996 as a confidence-building regional organisation to defuse tension on the Sino-Soviet border. It initially consisted of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, with its headquarters in Shanghai. It then graduated to a regional body with a broader mandate for security, acquired Uzbekistan as its sixth member, changed its name to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and resorted to holding joint military exercises.  The SCO&apos;s backing for the Kremlin&apos;s actions in South Ossetia and elsewhere in Georgia would have provided Medvedev with a powerful diplomatic tool to counter Western opposition, but he seems to have overlooked the &quot;concern&quot; Beijing had expressed over the Kremlin&apos;s action in Georgia before the SCO summit. Where the Chinese president seems to have taken an uncompromising stance at the Dushanbe summit is on the cardinal principle of the territorial integrity of a state. This has been one of the five pillars of China&apos;s foreign policy since the mid-1950s, called panchsheel (Five Principles). The others are: mutual non-aggression; mutual non-interference in each other&apos;s internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful co-existence. It is in the light of the panchsheel that Beijing&apos;s recent moves in Sudan and Zimbabwe ought to be seen.  At the SCO summit, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, sharing borders with Russia and China, would have backed the Chinese line strongly. Though the overall parity that ethnic Slavs, mainly Russians, enjoyed with ethnic Kazakhs on the eve of Kazakhstan&apos;s independence in 1991 no longer exists, some Kazakh areas adjoining Russia have a Slav majority. So, in future, that region could demand independence from Kazakhstan just as South Ossetia and Abkhazia did in the case of Georgia.  As for China, the demand of many native Uighurs in the vast Xinjiang province for independence has a long history. This is equally true of Tibet. Therefore it would have been unthinkable that Beijing would condone Moscow&apos;s recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Yet China shares its leadership of the SCO with Russia. So the communiqu\u00e9 issued by the summit in Dushanbe was a compromise. SCO presidents reaffirmed their commitment to &quot;efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity&quot; while expressing their approval of &quot;the active role of Russia in assisting in peace and cooperation in the region&quot;.  Taking their cue from the SCO summit, the policymakers in the Kremlin would be well advised to seek a compromise with the west by using its recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as a bargaining chip to secure a reversal of the west&apos;s earlier recognition of independence of Kosovo from Serbia.

And so it is that BBC fiction controller Jane Tranter is considering a job running BBC Worldwide&apos;s productions in Los Angeles. But, to paraphrase Mrs Merton, just what is it that attracts the Brits to the glamorous, sun-soaked lifestyle and big pay packets of the US TV industry? Stories are rife of showrunners and executive producers on big shows such as American Idol earning north of $500,000 (\u00a3274,000) an episode. And with rewards that make Jonathan Ross&apos;s wages look like peanuts, it&apos;s no wonder British producers are tempted to cross the pond. Management earn less than those behind the camera, but still, US companies pay around double UK salaries. One British executive who worked for a major network was earning more than $1m a year before family commitments forced him back to these shores.  US networks pay more because they have a bigger market - they invest around $250m on pilots they expect to shelve. As Tom Gutteridge, the founder of LA and London-based Vine Media, says: &quot;They also commission faster. And have more resources. When I worked on Paradise Hotel in America, we had 24 edit suites, compared with the two you usually get in the UK.&quot; Plenty of Brits have made it in the US, such as ex-The Last Resort producer, now HBO Films chief, Colin Callender. And Nigel Lythgoe, former Big Brother producer Conrad Green, ex-Gladiators producer Ken Warwick and former Ant and Dec producer Georgie Hurford-Jones have, between them, overseen American Idol, America&apos;s Got Talent, and Dancing with the Stars.  But if you make the move, don&apos;t brag too much. In the ruthless US market your show can be axed instantly - leaving you shamefaced on the next plane home. Writer Steven Moffat only found out NBC was cancelling the US version of Coupling &quot;when I read it on the internet&quot;. Michael Grade flopped as an independent TV producer in LA in the early 80s. He admitted: &quot;I thought I was tough, and by British standards I was, but in LA I was out of my depth.&quot; But Tranter is renowned for her resilience. Plus she will have the backing of BBC Worldwide. It seems unlikely she will end up agreeing with Moffat&apos;s description of working in LA: &quot;We thought it was not much fun. Frankly, we should get off our knees about America.&quot;Tara Conlan ChinaCool commissionAs the dust settles after the Beijing Olympics and reporters move on, media executives are left looking for business opportunities in the People&apos;s Republic of China. ITN On - the multimedia wing of ITN - has signed a deal with the Shanghai Media Group to produce 50% of the content for a new show, Cool Edition, on the country&apos;s largest English-language channel.  The 10-minute-long, magazine-style show will air at 6.30pm Monday to Friday on ICS, which has a daily reach of 18 million. It is aimed at a young, professional, English-speaking Shanghai elite, and will carry details of - you guessed it - all things &quot;cool&quot;, from west to east.  The International Programme Content Network (IPCN), the 14-month-old independently owned company that brokered the deal, believe this is the largest commission from China for any UK company.  ITN On&apos;s contribution to Cool Edition will feature fashion, music, sport, celebrities, and &quot;the five coolest facts of the day&quot; from the UK, according to Mick Desmond, the chairman of IPCN. A Chinese producer will mix the British broadcast with local content.  &quot;If there is something fantastically cool that has happened in the world that day, that will be reported as well. But there is so much going on both in the UK and China that there will be enough fantastic facts and cool stories each day. It&apos;s easy to put together,&quot; says Desmond. An advert on the IPCN website calls for a presenter for the show who can demonstrate &quot;trendy, funky, cool, attractive presenting styles&quot;. Doing business in China is not a simple process, and there are plenty of regulatory flashpoints for media hopefuls. A magazine-style show about east/west coolness is safe enough to get past the censors, but, Desmond admits, &quot;hard news would be a very different proposition&quot;. Nicholas Wheeler, managing director of ITN On, is confident that Shanghai-dwellers are just itching to watch what&apos;s going on in Cool Britannia. He believes that the success of the Olympics is evidence that the Chinese are learning English on a large scale and are &quot;interested in the rest of the world and how it works and what we do&quot;.  He also points out that &quot;Shanghai is a very westernised, urban, groovy sort of place&quot;. So, as long as what&apos;s &quot;cool&quot; in the UK continues to revolve around celebrities, sport and fashion rather than, say, democratic freedoms, Cool Edition looks set to be a success.Heidi Blake Student pressWhat Bullingdon pic?Politicians are no strangers to old stories from their student days resurfacing - from Bill Clinton not inhaling to Tony Blair&apos;s Ugly Rumours - but today&apos;s students are acting to expunge any potentially damaging skeletons in their digital closets even before they are famous. As editor of the Oxford Student newspaper last year, I received a call at least once a week from students past and present asking to remove their names from online articles. The calls increased after the photograph of David Cameron and Boris Johnson trussed up in \u00a31,200 tailcoats for the 1987 portrait of the Bullingdon Club turned up.  It&apos;s unlikely that the young Cameron had considered the fact that membership of this highly elitist club might damage an attempt to rebrand the Conservative party several decades later, but current members of a university that has provided 25 prime ministers obviously are. Last March, news organisations were banned from republishing the 1987 photos. When, during his leadership bid, journalists unearthed an article the Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne wrote for Isis magazine condoning the use of hard drugs, Huhne said he didn&apos;t remember writing it, although it bears his byline.  Last year, one former history student took issue with a gossip page from 2003 that claimed she slept with someone because of her involvement in student politics. Now hoping to progress in a political career, she said: &quot;I hope to be pretty high profile and this won&apos;t look good if I succeed.&quot; Student misdemeanours can attract a lot of attention, as Ben Tansey, PPE student and ex-president of the Oxford Union knows. Last year, a penchant for drunken naked wrestling landed him in the student papers - and the Daily Mail. &quot;Last summer I had an internship at a major bank and was reprimanded for my appearance in the press,&quot; he said. Oxford Gossip, an online forum where people could anonymously post gossip about their peers, was recently forced to delete all content, and shut down last year amid threats of legal action. Perhaps Oxford students are sensible to limit the fallout before it happens. On the other hand, Boris Johnson freely admitted that after the Bullingdon Club photo was taken, &quot;the party ended up with a number of us crawling on all fours through the hedges of the botanical gardens trying to escape police dogs&quot;. Last time I checked, he was doing fine.Samira Shackle", "tags": ["Television industry", "Media", "Politics", "Student politics", "Boris Johnson", "David Cameron", "Conservatives", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-08-31T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/03/usopentennis.andymurray", "sentences": ["This win lifted him to a career-high No5, making it virtually certain, barring injury, that he will be in Shanghai later this year for his first appearance in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup, limited to the world&apos;s top eight players."], "title": "US Open Tennis: Andy Murray unfazed by Juan Martin Del Potro duel after near-perfect night against Stanislas Wawrinka", "article": "There was a gorgeous moment after Andy Murray had hit a particularly imperious double-fisted backhand down the line under the floodlights in the Arthur Ashe stadium here on Monday evening when his coach, Miles Maclagan, flicked his eyebrows in an expression of &quot;where the hell did that come from?&quot; surprise. This 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 fourth-round victory over Switzerland&apos;s Stanislas Wawrinka, the world No10, and Olympic doubles gold medal winner with Roger Federer, was as near perfection as Murray has ever achieved at grand slam level. He quite clearly believes that today, when his quarter-final will switch from night to sunshine, that he can achieve something similar against Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, currently in the middle of the richest vein of form in his teenage life. &quot;He doesn&apos;t miss a whole a lot and he moves pretty well for a big guy,&quot; said Murray. &quot;But when you watch him I don&apos;t think that you see anything that&apos;s unbelievably special.&quot; If this sounded as if Murray was damning the 6ft 6in Argentinian with faint praise then it would not be too far from the truth. The two have met only once before, at the Italian Open this year, when the Argentinian retired with a back injury, although not before a minor altercation sparked by Del Potro when he drilled a ball at Murray, refused to apologise, and then made remarks about his mother, Judy, who was there supporting him. &quot;I haven&apos;t spoken to him since, but for me it&apos;s another tennis match. When you get on the court you&apos;ve got to put your emotions aside and get the job done. Whether I like Del Potro or not really doesn&apos;t make any difference,&quot; said Murray whose professionalism and maturity have increased markedly this year. There will be blips both on and off the court but here is a British player resolute in the belief that he can win a grand slam title. And, unlike Tim Henman, he has the ability and game to back it up. This win lifted him to a career-high No5, making it virtually certain, barring injury, that he will be in Shanghai later this year for his first appearance in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup, limited to the world&apos;s top eight players. The gap between him and Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic remains considerable, although he has twice beaten the Serb this summer, and holds a 2-1 career advantage over Federer. At Wimbledon, after defeating France&apos;s Richard Gasquet over five sets in the fourth round, he never remotely looked like defeating Nadal. &quot;I got killed. He played way too good for me, but I feel like I&apos;m playing better now. I&apos;m definitely going to be more rested this time round and hopefully play a better match.&quot; Should he defeat Del Potro then Nadal may be his semi-final opponent, though for now all thoughts are focused on the Argentinian who since an early exit at Wimbledon has won four tournaments in succession. His 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 fourth-round victory over the 18-year-old Kei Nishikori, the first Japanese man to reach the last 16 of this tournament since 1937, extended his unbeaten run to 23. &quot;I&apos;ve known him since we were juniors,&quot; said Murray. &quot;I wasn&apos;t really great friends with him before, and I don&apos;t need to be now.&quot; The most impressive aspect of Murray&apos;s win over Wawrinka was the way he took control. The Swiss was nervous and Murray rarely allowed him a whiff of sustaining oxygen. His groundstrokes were stunning and the 24,000 crowd could only admire what they saw. &quot;I&apos;d been looking forward to playing my first night match in the Arthur Ashe for a long, long time, and then to play like that made it pretty special,&quot; he said. &quot;It is such a huge stadium that there is always a buzz. I loved every minute of it.&quot; Several times Murray gazed up at the giant electronic scoreboard as the replays were shown. &quot;I think most players watch. They normally only show good points, so that&apos;s why,&quot; Murray smiled. He had good reason too, and will hope to again against Del Potro today. &quot;I think I&apos;m playing well enough to win.&quot; If he can replicate his performance against Wawrinka then it seems altogether likely.", "tags": ["US Open 2008", "US Open tennis", "Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport", "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-02T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/3", "sentences": ["&quot;When I packed to go to Shanghai and Beijing to open the London Olympic bid&apos;s offices, I hadn&apos;t been aware that as I packed my underpants one of the kids had unpacked them, so I arrived in Beijing and realised that I&apos;d got no pants,&quot; he told the paper."], "title": "Hugh Muir's Diary", "article": "Barack Obama&apos;s Irish ancestry barely rates a mention as he tells his American story, but the roots, if genealogists are to be believed, run deep.

Of course, we know Spicer for other things too. There was the arms-to-Africa saga of the late 1990s - when his previous firm, Sandline, shipped weapons to a Sierra Leone militia leader - and also some shenanigans in Papua New Guinea. He was also, during his eventful time in the British army, the commanding officer of two Scots Guards convicted of murdering Catholic teenager Peter McBride in north Belfast in 1992. Barack Obama, way back in 2005, wrote to a constituent voicing distaste for Spicer, and the letter has since been given a fresh airing by the Pat Finucane Centre, the civil rights group in Belfast. &quot;Given his history, I agree that the United States should consider rescinding its contract with his company,&quot; Obama wrote. And they won&apos;t let him forget it. \u00b7 The game&apos;s up. The signs are unmistakable. With 18 months to go until the expiry of Sir Ian Blair&apos;s contract as commissioner of the Metropolitan police, he&apos;ll soon hear whether he can expect a renewal. The hope is slim, but Slim left town. High noon indeed. The challenge is to find anyone who believes that Sir Ian will get an extension. The Tories are coming, and they don&apos;t like him, but neither would he receive sufficient support from Labour. The continuing unease about the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes has weakened him immeasurably, as has dissension within the senior ranks - not to mention the investigation into his longstanding friendship with a well-paid Met contractor. Dark days ahead. And long nights. \u00b7 Yes, the news is bad at present, and the latest setback concerns suggestions that Andy Hayman, the former head of the anti-terrorist squad, may weave tales of his difficulties at the Met and of the deterioration of his relationship with Sir Ian into a troublesome new book. Little wonder, then, that the powers are assessing the alternatives. Paul Stephenson, Sir Ian&apos;s deputy, seems a possibility, as does Hugh Orde, chief constable in Northern Ireland, and Norman Bettison, the top man in West Yorkshire. Bettison has issues, having lost a legal battle last year to fatten up his pension, but some still say he could bring calm after the turbulence of the Blair years. It&apos;s all relative. \u00b7 Ken Livingstone has spoken out on Sir Ian&apos;s behalf, but then Ken speaks out on many things.

He was given the death sentence. But few would have expected the public reaction to his case, which has been of widespread sympathy and has sparked debate about the police&apos;s treatment of suspects in what has become a Chinese cause celebre. Now a prominent intellectual has asked the supreme court to intervene and order a public retrial. The artist Ai Weiwei, who designed the Olympic Bird&apos;s Nest stadium, has written that the case&apos;s impact is so great that an open hearing is needed to demonstrate the country&apos;s commitment to judicial reform. A closed court in Shanghai found Yang guilty of premeditated murder earlier this week. According to the official media, the unemployed 28-year-old from Beijing attacked the station on July 1. He threw Molotov cocktails at the building and injured the security guard before bursting inside where he slashed at officers, killing six and wounding four more. But his case caught the public imagination following claims that he was seeking revenge for earlier mistreatment by officers. Thousands of messages supporting Yang - many removed by censors - appeared on blogs and bulletin boards. Some have even described him as a hero, though more have suggested his case raises alarming questions about the police treatment of suspects and the judicial process. Police said at a press conference that Yang, from Beijing, was angry because officers at the station in Zhabei district detained him last year for allegedly stealing a bicycle that he had in fact rented. He later demanded around 10,000 yuan (\u00a3800) in compensation for &quot;mental anguish&quot;. The Guangdong-based Southern Weekend newspaper reported that Yang had claimed he was beaten during the interrogation, although the police denied it. The supreme people&apos;s court now reviews all death sentences under &quot;kill fewer, kill carefully&quot; reforms introduced two years ago. But in his letter, Ai argued that a full retrial is needed, arguing the original investigation and hearing had been handled improperly. &quot;Since this case has generated enormous social impact, it should not be ignored ... To go through a public and transparent judicial procedures is to safeguard the constitution as well as test China&apos;s determination and power of its judicial reform.&quot; Yang&apos;s relatives now fear that he may lose his chance to appeal. Xiong Liesuo, a Beijing lawyer hired by Yang&apos;s father, told the Guardian that the court refused him access to the defendant, saying Yang had already accepted a lawyer arranged by his mother. The couple divorced some years ago. But Yang&apos;s mother has been uncontactable since she was questioned by Beijing police following the Shanghai attack.

His case has raised widespread controversy in China, and beyond, not because of the crimes for which he was convicted, but because of the way the authorities handled the case \u2013 and the deep-rooted, long-ignored social problems that had been revealed during the trial. Born in Beijing, Yang Jia had lived with his mother after his parents divorced 14 years ago. He had worked temporarily in a supermarket, but quit a year later. Since then, the entire family income had been the 1,500-yuan (US$214) pension of his mother. During a trip to Shanxi province two years ago, Yang was wrongly arrested, questioned and beaten by local police. Through persistent petitioning, he finally received some compensation from the police. Then, in a trip to Shanghai last year, Yang was questioned by police on suspicion of stealing a bicycle which he had rented. Feeling insulted, Yang stormed into a police station in Shanghai on July 1 and went on the rampage with a knife.  These horrific killings shocked the public, but the way Shanghai police handled this case soon also became a cause for concern. Yang was defended by a lawyer who, appointed by the authorities for this case, had previously worked closely with the local police force. Seeing this as a conflict of interest, 16 lawyers in Beijing jointly issued a statement, questioning the validity of this appointment. Yang&apos;s mother, who the public believed was the only person capable of helping to find a lawyer for Yang, and who could provide some background information about Yang&apos;s motivation, vanished after Yang was charged. It was widely believed that Yang&apos;s mother had been secretly detained by Shanghai police.  Yang&apos;s trial was first scheduled for July 29. When the case became increasingly sensitive, it was postponed to August 26, two days after the end of the Olympic Games. The trial was held in closed session despite public calls for an open trial.  According to Chinese law, a convicted murderer like Yang would invariably be sentenced to death. No one, then, doubted the verdict or was surprised by the sentence. But people were upset by the secretive and opaque handling of the trial process. Some even suggested that to wreak such crazy revenge, there must have something extremely wrong about the way Shanghai police had handled Yang&apos;s bicycle theft investigation: one message posted on an internet forum alleged that Yang had been severely beaten by the police during questioning. The person who posted this message was quickly arrested for disseminating false information. For many years, compared with China&apos;s unprecedented GDP growth, moves towards democratic accountability and social progress have lagged far behind. Yang&apos;s case exposed again the poor transparency and competence of China&apos;s judicial system. The one positive development in this sorry story is that legal professionals and the public came together in this case to call for greater openness and fairer procedures.", "tags": ["China", "Human rights", "World news", "Olympics & the media", "Law", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-05T07:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/05/marketturmoil.creditcrunch", "sentences": ["Markets across Asia fell in the wake of Wall Street&apos;s overnight plunge, but the decline in China reinforced pessimism among investors who have seen the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fall by more than 63% from its October peak.", "&quot;The recent continuous declines caused panic,&quot; said Zhu Kangping, a strategist at Shenyin Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.", "Losses outnumbered gains by 827-47 in Shanghai and 702-32 in Shenzhen, with refiners, property firms and banks among the biggest losers.", "PetroChina, the Shanghai index&apos;s biggest traded share, fell 4.2% to 11.94 yuan while Sinopec, dropped 1.59% to 9.88 yuan.", "&quot;The index dropping is becoming a trend - the turnover drops, and prices drop, and the index drops,&quot; said Zhang Qi, analyst at Shanghai Haitong Securities."], "title": "China's stockmarket tumbles to 20-month low", "article": "Chinese shares slid to a 20-month low today, capping the sixth straight week of bad news for the troubled stockmarket.

Analysts agree that the stockmarket was vastly overvalued last autumn as speculators piled in and that a correction was needed. But it has fallen further and faster than most anticipated, at a time when the Chinese economy faces a host of problems.  While consumer inflation has fallen from a 12-year high this spring, producer price inflation has shot up - an additional headache for exporters struggling with the appreciation of the yuan and the global credit crunch.  Some economists have called for tax cuts to boost growth despite government hopes that growth would fall back. Growth has run at 10.8% annually over the last five years. Earlier this week, Gao Lingzhi, strategist at Great Wall Securities, predicted that the index would fall to around 1,750 eventually, reflecting expectations that profit growth at listed companies might fall to zero next year from a forecast 16% this year. &quot;The index dropping is becoming a trend - the turnover drops, and prices drop, and the index drops,&quot; said Zhang Qi, analyst at Shanghai Haitong Securities. But he added: &quot;Being at 6000 points during October last year just wasn&apos;t sustainable, and these low prices imply that in the short term it might stay like this.  &quot;But in three to five years there will be value for investment, as it is becoming closer to overseas markets.&quot;", "tags": ["Market turmoil", "Business", "Credit crunch", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-05T12:02:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/06/snooker", "sentences": ["The veterans Jimmy White, 46, and Steve Davis, 51, qualified at Prestatyn yesterday for the final stages of the Shanghai Masters."], "title": "Snooker: Old guard through in Shanghai", "article": "The veterans Jimmy White, 46, and Steve Davis, 51, qualified at Prestatyn yesterday for the final stages of the Shanghai Masters.

The \u00a3210m investment is supposed to buy a top finish in the Premiership and then the Champions League, where the real money is made. It could also buy a seat at the top table in the new world of diplomacy - where, pound for pound, the soft power of football can outpunch gunboats or armies. The new emissaries, the players, can achieve things diplomats can only dream of - flying the flag and winning recognition, even adoration, from millions of foreigners. Nothing could be more conducive to clinching trade and investment deals. Ten times more people watch Premier League football on television in China than in Britain, and in the remotest villages where the locals speak hardly a word of English, they usually know how to say Manchester United. The emirs of Abu Dhabi hope they will be able to manage the word City. On planet football the US is no more than a developing country. England is the true superpower. The Premier League is the richest and best loved of all the world&apos;s football leagues, a global super-brand. The big money and the best players may be foreign, but they play on English soil in front of mostly English crowds. Gordon Brown has tried to press this advantage. He calls it &quot;England&apos;s secret diplomatic weapon&quot; and his forays abroad have often been wrapped in football paraphernalia. When he visited Shanghai as chancellor three years ago he latched on to the fact that the city was twinned with Liverpool and took with him Liverpool and Everton kits. Britain is not alone in using football as diplomatic currency. Armenia&apos;s president, Serge Sarkisian, has invited his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, to a 2010 World Cup qualifier today to break the ice between the two countries. Australia&apos;s decision to switch from the Oceania World Cup qualifying group to the Asian Football Confederation was taken largely to raise the country&apos;s image in the emerging economies of the east. Individuals can play the game as well. Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea not only as an expensive plaything. The purchase also stitched him into the fabric of British (and global) sporting life to the extent that it could make him untouchable if the tides turn against him in Moscow. For the princes of Abu Dhabi, the advantages are both personal and diplomatic. According to Mamoun Fandy, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, it is about keeping up with Dubai, Abu Dhabi&apos;s greatest rival among the seven statelets of the United Arab Emirates. &quot;There is a general feeling in the Emirates that Dubai has become the brand name for the country, while Abu Dhabi - though the capital and largest emirate - is receding in the background. The whole plan is putting Abu Dhabi back on the map,&quot; Fandy said.", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-05T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/06/gapyears.gapyeartravel", "sentences": ["Visit Florence, Venice, Verona, Siena, Rome and Naples and study Italian art \u00b7 Work at an internationally recognised architecture and graphic design firm in Shanghai with Travellers Worldwide (travellersworldwide.com) \u00b7 Combine learning Spanish and Spanish literature with Cesa Languages Abroad (cesalanguages.com)."], "title": "The knowledge gap", "article": "For me, the words &quot;gap year&quot; conjure up many images - tearful airport goodbyes, a sea of neon kanji, bad karaoke booths and sumo. Yes, I spent my gap year in Japan. Even though the Jet programme - a government scheme which places graduates from around the world to teach English in schools - continues to offer the same opportunities that I had nearly a decade ago, gap-year travel has moved on somewhat. Now, instead of being faced with fairly limited options to combine travel, work, adventures and hopefully the chance to pick up a few new skills, there are limitless opportunities to suit every kind of person. From marine conservation projects in South America and learning Russian in St Petersburg to building schools in Mozambique and working at the New Zealand Cricket Players&apos; Association - heading off on the obligatory &quot;Oz experience&quot; trail just doesn&apos;t seem to cut it any more. And if you are going to use your gap-year experiences to impress future employers, it&apos;s important to sift carefully through all the potential placements to decide which one is the best fit. &quot;Too many people go off and do independent travel and think it is going to show they have a good understanding of the world, when actually it looks pretty blank on a CV,&quot; says Richard Oliver, chief executive of Year Out Group, an association of year out organisations. &quot;Just saying I&apos;ve travelled through New Zealand, Australia, Thailand and China for six months will mean little to the person who is interviewing you. Telling them you have travelled through all those places, settled down in China and taught English as a foreign language to a group of university students - now that&apos;s interesting, especially if you are going to a big company which is looking to do business in China.&quot; Finding a placement that would give her conservation work experience was a major factor when Nadia Daer chose to travel to Guyana with the company Trekforce. The 24-year-old built a ranger station on the only major road to cut through the rainforest, providing a much-needed checkpoint to prevent illegal logging and poaching. &quot;I&apos;ve always been interested in wildlife conservation, so on my gap year I wanted to go out into the world and actually see some of the animals that I&apos;ve watched on documentaries,&quot; Daer says. &quot;I did loads of research, but found it very hard to pick one experience because there are so many to choose from. Eventually I chose the Amazon as it is one of the most important areas in the world for wildlife. The chance to see it and then to try and be part of protecting it really captured me.&quot; Oliver says that for graduates who are interested in environmental or conservation work, this type of volunteering placement is often the only way to get the relevant experience that many employers require. Similarly, he recommends volunteering with children for those students between school and university who want to enter the caring professions. &quot;Universities like these kind of applicants to demonstrate that they have a caring approach, and spending three months working on the right kind of project is a good way of ticking that box,&quot; he explains. Of course, the gap-year experience doesn&apos;t have to be directly related to your future career to be useful at interviews, as Paul Young, a PR executive for Taverstock Communications discovered. The psychology graduate spent 11 weeks in Canada on a ski instructor course with Non-Stop Ski and Snowboard after he graduated from Exeter University in 2006. With 60 other skiers and 40 snowboarders he spent four days a week on the slopes perfecting his technique and teaching skills, culminating in two ski-instructor qualifications that allow him to teach around the world.  He has since taken time out from his job to teach schoolchildren for a week in the Italian resort of Courmayeur and says that although his current role isn&apos;t related to skiing, it added an extra dimension to the recruitment process.  &quot;When I went to the interview my time away was valuable because some of the interviewers were keen skiers too - it immediately gave me a platform to get on with them,&quot; he says. &quot;It is quite a young company too, so my employer could clearly see the benefits of the programme.&quot; One of the major new trends in gap-year travel is the combination of experiences. Ticket to Ride offers the chance to spend three months learning to surf in South Africa while also getting involved with community projects. Recent research by Year Out Group found that volunteering is the top choice for a gap-year placement, with winter and watersports courses coming close behind, so this trip provides the best of both worlds. Sarah Woolf completed the South Africa expedition earlier this year and says the mix-and-match approach worked for her, with highlights including bungee jumping, sky diving, quad biking and visiting different townships, as well as surfing at different locations. &quot;I had always wanted to learn to surf but I also liked the idea of combining it with other activities,&quot; Woolf says. &quot;I ended up with surf instructor and beach lifeguarding qualifications, as well as lots of happy memories.&quot; Five productive ways to spend your gap year \u00b7 Teach rugby in the South Pacific with Madventurer (madventurer.com).

And one of them is Andy Murray. &quot;There is absolutely no doubt that he is in the mix now,&quot; said the television commentator Tracy Austin, who won the women&apos;s title here as a 16-year-old. &quot;Rafa Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have been up there in the stratosphere, and those who were just behind them like Spain&apos;s David Ferrer and Nikolay Davydenko of Russia didn&apos;t really have the skills to challenge. But Andy has - and I think we have only scratched the surface when it comes to what he can achieve.&quot; Murray, who began the tournament at No6 in the world, is now assured of the No4 spot and a place in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, his main objective for the year - at least until this week. Now, after a quarter-final victory over Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, he has his sights on an altogether higher target, his first grand slam title. And standing in his way today is the current best player in the world, Nadal, who he has met five times previously and lost every time. The reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion is himself attempting to become the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the last three slams of the year, so Murray&apos;s task could hardly be more formidable. On Thursday he practised and then went off to Chelsea Piers on the west side of the city where they have golf driving ranges, baseball cages, basketball hoops, bowling alleys and soccer, and where Murray and the gang were having a mini-Olympics. Then there was a longer practice session yesterday and then some television watching. &quot;I sleep fine at tournaments. Always eight or nine hours, no problem, and I don&apos;t do a whole lot when I am off the court. It is good when you get a couple of days off like this.&quot; He is unfazed by his 5-0 losing record against Nadal, and by the generally held opinion in the locker room and beyond that he is unlikely to win this time. &quot;It is a tough one and the courts are pretty quick here,&quot; Murray said. &quot;But everyone was saying the same thing about Djokovic when I lost against him four times in a row. I think if Nadal goes on the court thinking it will be an easy match he will be wrong. It won&apos;t be easy.&quot; Murray has won his last two matches against Djokovic on the American hard courts this summer, while he holds a 2-1 career advantage over Federer. Nadal thumped him at Wimbledon this year, where Murray was playing his first-ever slam quarter-final, although on hard courts the matches have been considerably closer. One certainty is that the Spaniard will not underestimate him. He never underestimates anybody at any time, and perhaps the greatest hope for Murray is that Nadal, after his multiple exertions through the clay-court season, Wimbledon and winning the singles gold medal at the Olympics in Beijing, is feeling a little jaded. &quot;I don&apos;t think he has been quite as sharp here,&quot; said Austin, a view that was confirmed by Tim Henman, who lost his US Open semi-final against Roger Federer here four years ago, a match Murray watched. &quot;I really think this is the best situation for Andy to take on Rafa. He is absolutely ready to win this, although even a slightly tired Rafa is still the best athlete and the best competitor in the game,&quot; said Henman. Whereas a year ago critics and friends continued to question Murray&apos;s physical capacity there is now no doubting that he has, as Americans would say, worked his butt off. &quot;If you&apos;re going to compete with the big three, being able to match them physically is almost the most important thing,&quot; said John Lloyd, Britain&apos;s Davis Cup captain, who has watched every Murray match here. &quot;Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are all great athletes and they&apos;re almost a league apart from the rest, though Andy is getting much closer to them. You have to be able to come back after three or four hours against them because they just pound away at you. Andy&apos;s been doing that against other players here. He wears them down, which is just what Nadal, in particular, does.&quot; Murray reiterated his commitment to the physical hard work here where his fitness trainer, Jez Green, and his coach, Miles Maclagan, have watched his every move. &quot;Everything is working well. Everyone gets on with each other. There are no egos involved. No one is out there for themselves. That has been the biggest benefit,&quot; said Murray. &quot;When I sat down and spoke to Jez, I told him that if I am not working hard enough, tell me. If I am only at 80 or 90%, he must let me know. I want to be the best and I will work hard. Miles is a hard worker and we have had some long chats when I have had some tough matches. Like I said, no egos. If it is not going right, we speak about it openly.&quot; So far Murray can walk around Manhattan without anybody paying him too much attention. He visits Starbucks every morning, a routine he slipped into here when Brad Gilbert (a super ego) was his coach, and he occasionally wanders around the sights. &quot;If I go to Times Square and stuff I sometimes hear someone shout &apos;That&apos;s Andy Murray&apos;. It&apos;s a bit embarrassing but I keep walking.&quot;  A victory over Nadal today, and then a second against either Federer or Djokovic and life will never be the same for Murray again. But he expects that. He expects to win slam titles, he expects to be up there with the best players in the world. And now he is. &quot;When I was Andy&apos;s age, I was still trying to establish myself in the top 100,&quot; said Henman. &quot;It just shows how good he is that he has got this far at such a young age.&quot; Win or lose against Nadal, Murray has entered the tennis stratosphere, and he has the talent and strength of will to remain there. Serbia&apos;s Jelena Jankovic reached her first grand slam final yesterday with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Elena Dementieva, the Olympic champion. She will now meet Serena Williams, an eight-times slam champion, after the American beat Dinara Safina of Russia 6-3, 6-2 in her semi-final. Where the match will be won and lost First serve Rafael Nadal has made a big improvement, adding a lot of pace. He has a high percentage on it but cannot match the power of Andy Murray, although his first serve is still too inconsistent Second serve Nadal usually places it to the backhand side, which is Murray&apos;s return strength. But it has to be a great return otherwise Nadal will be all over him Return This is Murray&apos;s forte, making him permanently dangerous. Nadal&apos;s returns have improved, though, and he gets a lot of balls back, which is what you don&apos;t want Forehand It&apos;s Nadal&apos;s biggest strength: a big, topspin brute. If he is put off balance he sometimes plays it very short but still with a lot of spin. Murray will need to jump on that Backhand Murray&apos;s great strength. Double-fisted, but Murray has beautifully soft hands and can suddenly power the ball down the line with ferocious speed. Nadal has added the floating slice, playing it very deep, while his backhand cross court is an increasingly dangerous shot Nadal comes more to the net now. Murray will need to not get pinned to the baseline, and to cut Nadal off at the net, though it is a ploy fraught with danger. Murray is a good volleyer; Nadal decent Overall strategy Nadal&apos;s main tactic is to try to hit the big forehand, while he is the best defensive player because he runs down so many balls. Murray is capable of varying his game to suit the occasion, and chipping away at his opponent&apos;s confidence. Nadal relies a little bit more on his physical conditioning, because he doesn&apos;t have as many strokes and mentally he just knows that whenever he goes on court, he is going to win. And that is tough to face Murray on Nadal &apos;It&apos;s not really that hard to come up with a game plan against him because it&apos;s quite obvious: don&apos;t leave the ball in the middle of the court to his forehand. If you do that, you&apos;re going to do a lot of running. The guy&apos;s ridiculously strong. That&apos;s the main difference between him and the rest of us young guys&apos; Nadal on Murray &apos;I know I have to play well and get at him. I must keep up my rhythm.

Some people even think asexuality doesn&apos;t exist. It&apos;s so underrepresented, I can understand why people are skeptical. I was too, even though I was perfectly used to thinking of myself in this way. For years I just thought I was the only person in the world who felt like this.  My parents are agricultural scientists, so I&apos;ve lived overseas since around the age of 10. I was in India until I was 16, then Zimbabwe for two years, and then Kuwait. I studied in China and New York, before settling in London. Even at 10, I had a sense that I didn&apos;t want to get married and have children. I know a lot of kids say things like that, but I didn&apos;t change my mind about it later on. I wasn&apos;t interested in relationships or finding a girlfriend, and was very sure I didn&apos;t have an interest in boys either.  Gradually my school friends spent more and more time talking about girls and pursuing relationships, but I could never grasp what they were expecting to get out of it. There were family parties in India where all the kids would gather outside in the garden.  I was 13 and had a best friend, Kasim, who was a year younger than me. He had a crush on an Australian girl called Jessica - everyone seemed to think she was the prettiest. We had lots of whispered discussions about what he could say to her, and even though I thought it was a ridiculous game, I wanted to fit in, so I pretended I had a crush too - on a French girl called Sylvie. She was a safe bet because she was so unlikely to reciprocate. I knew she wasn&apos;t at all interested in me. I&apos;d just discuss her with the boys.  There were times as I got older when girls did seem interested in me, but I always deliberately ignored their signals. I wanted to avoid getting into a situation I&apos;d feel uncomfortable with, so I never even kissed a girl. The first girl I kissed became my wife.  When I was 13, my father gave me a book on sex education. I felt as if I was reading about a foreign culture; I just couldn&apos;t see why anyone would go to so much trouble just to have sex. I tried looking at pornography on the internet. I wasn&apos;t disgusted or appalled - it was just boring, like looking at wallpaper. Masturbation was another topic of conversation in those days, and I did masturbate. It wasn&apos;t a sexual urge for me, I didn&apos;t fantasise, it was just something my body decided to do. People say about asexuals: &quot;But if they masturbate doesn&apos;t that make them sexual?&quot; It&apos;s hard to explain, but if you&apos;re asexual you don&apos;t necessarily feel an explicit connection between masturbation and sexual orientation. It&apos;s just part of having a human body - a physical, biological process.  After we moved to Zimbabwe I went back to visit my old friend Kasim. The last time we&apos;d seen each other we&apos;d been into computer games, drinking Coke and going for pizza. Two years on, it was a shock to see how much Kasim had changed. Sex was his major preoccupation. He had a girlfriend and was on the brink of going all the way with her. One afternoon we were with some of Kasim&apos;s friends, and he began goading two of the girls into kissing each other in front of a camera. The whole atmosphere was really charged, and I felt out of my depth. I&apos;d fallen behind. Kasim had been my friend a long time, but he&apos;d entered this different world without me.  By the time I went to university, I was happy to let people wonder about my sexuality. I wasn&apos;t pretending to talk about girls any more. Some people assumed I was gay, but my best friend Simon was the first person to confront me directly. We were studying in Hangzhou, in China, just south of Shanghai. It&apos;s a very beautiful city, on a lake with mountains, and we were walking through the streets when Simon asked me outright. First he made a joke about whether &quot;I liked girls ... or boys?&quot; I laughed but he persisted and said &quot;So what are you?&quot; I just said, &quot;I&apos;m not straight and I&apos;m not gay, and that&apos;s it, full stop.&quot; Back then I didn&apos;t know what term to use. The following summer I was surfing the internet when I read a post from a girl who wasn&apos;t attracted to anyone. Someone had suggested she should be aware of &quot;asexuality&quot;, and gave the address of a website: asexuality.org. When I went to the site and read the material, I was quite dismissive at first, because you just don&apos;t hear about other asexuals. Since Freud and Kinsey, and even to an extent the sexual revolution of the 60s, we tend to believe anyone without a sexual orientation must be repressed or delusional. Asexuality is therefore an impossibility. Kinsey labelled us &quot;X&quot;, a statistical throwaway category for anyone damaged to the point where they can&apos;t express any sexuality.  Gradually, though, through visiting the site, I came to realise that these were just ordinary people; people who were writing things I&apos;d thought myself, but had never heard anyone else express. It was such a relief. Finally I had a label - a way to explain myself that could settle all the awkwardness and questioning.  I told my close friends straightaway. Only one female friend didn&apos;t really believe me. I think she thought I was secretly in love with her.  Back at college I decided to get it over with in one day by wearing a T-shirt saying: &quot;Asexuality is not just for amoebas&quot;. I was nervous, but I&apos;d already told a dozen or so people, and was used to answering the same questions over and over. No one has ever reacted really badly to me - I&apos;ve been lucky.  I told my mother shortly after finding the asexual website, and she said: &quot;Well as long as you understand the possibility that one of these days you&apos;ll meet someone and want to settle down with them.&quot; I wasn&apos;t so sure. I&apos;d already resigned myself to a solitary existence. I&apos;d convinced myself I could form strong friendships and was independent enough to fare OK. Luckily my mother always ends up being right about everything. When my studies took me to New York, I got more involved with the asexual community there. I posted messages on their website and there were regular meet-ups in a little pink tea shop in the East Village - I guess you could call it the asexual equivalent of a gay bar. One day I got an email from Amanda. She was asexual, living close by, and offered to show me around the neighbourhood. In case she was cruising for an asexual boyfriend, I responded with a warning that I was &quot;vehemently anti-romantic&quot;. But we met up anyway, for tea and ice-skating, and we took to meeting a lot.  I loved Amanda&apos;s attitude to life and enjoyed hanging out with her. And she was pretty. At first I tried to treat it like any other friendship. Then I found myself travelling four miles downtown to deliver sandwiches when she told me she was hungry. Two months in, we were at a gig and it seemed like a good idea to hold her hand. I felt cautious about it but just wanted to. I wondered if I could. Then I found I couldn&apos;t let go.  That evening ended with us agreeing that our friendship was an important thing. We wanted to commit for life. In the asexual community we don&apos;t form relationships lightly. If you don&apos;t want to spend the rest of your life with a person, there&apos;s no reason to make such a special commitment.  When we announced our engagement, our families were happy for us, and our friends in the asexual community were particularly pleased. On our wedding night, my mother-in-law insisted on booking us into a honeymoon suite, so we invited all our friends to an after party. We played Scrabble late into the night and everyone stayed over and slept on the hotel-room floor.  People always ask how our marriage is different from just being friends, but I think a lot of relationships are about that - being friends. We have built on our friendship, rather than scrapping it and moving on somewhere else. The obvious way we differ is that we don&apos;t have sex, though we do kiss and cuddle. We like to joke that the longer we&apos;re married the less unusual this is. By the time we&apos;ve been married five years we&apos;ll be just like everyone else.  Do I feel as if I&apos;m missing out on something? Not really. We&apos;ve decided that if either of us wants to try sex out in the future then we will see what we can do. We would both be willing to compromise because we&apos;re in a relationship and that&apos;s what you do.  When it comes to the future and to children, we&apos;re big advocates of adoption. We&apos;re not so fussed about passing on our own genes. Right now we&apos;re quite happy with what we&apos;ve got. After moving around so much, I can say now that wherever Amanda is - that&apos;s home.  \u00b7 Paul Cox was interviewed by Bridget O&apos;Donnell.

The Englishman appeared to have won the Belgian grand prix at the end of a tense race-long duel with Finland&apos;s Kimi Raikkonen but he was later judged to have gained an unfair advantage as his McLaren-Mercedes and the Ferrari came close to colliding at the start of the penultimate lap. Raikkonen later spun off, leaving Hamilton to finish 14 seconds ahead of his closest championship rival, Brazil&apos;s Felipe Massa, and a further seven seconds in front of Nick Heidfeld&apos;s BMW. But a 25-second penalty dropped Hamilton to third place, a decision McLaren have appealed against. The weekend until then had been too good to be true. After the poisonous atmosphere at Spa 12 months ago when motor sport&apos;s governing body, the FIA, had fined McLaren \u00a350m for their part in a spy scandal involving Ferrari technical information, this year&apos;s event had been epitomised by the sheer drama of the racing as Spa, the longest circuit in formula one, delivered its traditional spectacle. The captivating action would last for an hour and 23 minutes as Hamilton took what appeared to be his fifth win of the season in superb style. Then the FIA stewards stepped in. There had been action from the start as Hamilton took advantage of pole position and led through the first corner, a tight hairpin where, as has become a habit at Spa, several cars either collided or had near misses. The track, difficult at the best of times, was made even more treacherous by the remnants of a light sprinkling of rain which had left the circuit damp in places but not bad enough to warrant wet-weather tyres.  Massa, holding second place, was more careful than most as the field swept into the dip at Eau Rouge and began the long climb to the top of the circuit. Seeing his team-mate&apos;s caution, Raikkonen seized his chance as the Ferraris ran side by side at 180mph, the Finn then easing Massa towards the grass, much to the Brazilian&apos;s surprise. &quot;I made a mistake by thinking Eau Rouge was wetter than it was,&quot; said Massa. &quot;Kimi then passed me on the hill. He was going to pass me anyway. For some reason he closed the line [cut across]. I don&apos;t know why he did that.&quot; Raikkonen set off after Hamilton and then found himself in the lead when the McLaren driver locked his brakes at the end of the lap and spun. Hamilton was fortunate to recover and lose only one place. &quot;That mistake was quite costly,&quot; he said. &quot;It put us on the back foot. We switched to a shorter middle stint in the race. I rejoined in traffic and used a lot of the life of that set of tyres early on. But, after the second [and final] stop, it was really good. I took a chunk out of Raikkonen&apos;s lead. I was really going for it.&quot; The next 15 laps of the race were mesmerising as Raikkonen and Hamilton, separated by no more than five seconds, traded fastest laps. &quot;I was on every limit, and even beyond,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;I was pushing as hard as I could but I couldn&apos;t get too close without the handling of my car being upset behind the Ferrari. It was one of the most exciting races for a long time - and I wanted it to rain. I was praying: &apos;Rain, rain, rain.&apos; I wanted the rain to come. Just a few droplets would make it a little bit easier for me and then we could have a good battle towards the end. That&apos;s exactly what happened.&quot; When a light shower arrived with three laps to go, Hamilton closed on Raikkonen and made a try for the lead as they arrived side by side at the chicane. &quot;I had nowhere to go,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;So, rather than hit Kimi and maybe take us both out, I went on to the escape road and rejoined in front of him. The team told me straight away that I had to let him back in front - and that&apos;s what I did. &quot;My heart was racing more than it ever has before,&quot; he added. &quot;I am a racing driver. This is what I do best - you race down to the last minute. You don&apos;t turn the engine down and back off and just take the points in that situation.&quot; The stewards later decided that Hamilton had not backed off enough as the Ferrari went past. Hamilton&apos;s attempt to dive inside under braking for the next corner was blocked by Raikkonen, Hamilton then running round the outside and taking the lead, Raikkonen hitting the back of the McLaren as he did so. The drama was not yet over on the track. Halfway round the next lap, the leaders came across the spinning Williams of Nico Rosberg and almost hit the German. Hamilton took to the grass and Raikkonen retook the lead - only to spin not long afterwards. Hamilton was back in front again and Raikkonen then spun off for good a few corners later. &quot;The final lap was so slippery,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;I had no temperature in the tyres after driving in the wet for a lap and half. I was braking very, very early and still arriving at each corner knowing the car could step out of line and there would be nothing I could do about it. You have to turn on your senses to full power and react as best you can to any moment you may have. I was looking in the mirrors and saw Felipe was going even slower. It was a long lap and a long way home and I didn&apos;t want to throw it away.&quot; He had no need to worry. The FIA was about to do that for him. Who will have the edge in sprint to the wire? Italy Monza  September 14  The one circuit on the calendar that requires even more full-throttle running than Spa-Francorchamps, venue of yesterday&apos;s Belgian grand prix. Keep in mind that Ferrari will have the psychological benefit of competing on their home track and, more significantly, that Massa&apos;s car will be fitted with a new engine for this first race of the next  two-race cycle Hamilton or Massa? Massa likely to give the Prancing Horse a home victory. Singapore Marina Bay September 28 On the face of it all bets are off for the first race on the new Singapore waterfront circuit which will also be the first formula one race on the calendar to be held after dark under floodlights. Ultimately it will all come down to which team have done the most accurate pre-event simulation work and which driver can best adapt to the challenge of an unknown environment.  Hamilton or Massa? Hamilton. On balance his current momentum and unique flair will give him a slight edge.  Japan Mount Fuji October 12  Very much a circuit of two distinct parts, dominated by a long start/finish straight which is supplemented by a succession of twisty corners, which means that big compromises will be required when it comes to aerodynamic and suspension setups. Last year&apos;s race was run in torrential rain and was dominated by Hamilton&apos;s McLaren. Hamilton or Massa? Hamilton. Wet or dry he seemed to master this revised circuit last year.  China Shanghai  October 19  A challenging circuit with a wide range of tricky corners and, oddly, a venue at which the great Michael Schumacher never seemed much at home. Also the scene of one of Hamilton&apos;s biggest failures last year when he slid into the gravel trap at the pit-lane entrance at what seemed little more than walking pace as he hurried in to change badly worn tyres.  Hamilton or Massa? Hamilton. Before his mistake in last year&apos;s race he had built a commanding lead. Brazil Interlagos  November 2 Bumpy, rutted and rather ramshackle circuit on the edge of Sao Paulo on which Massa won in 2006 and might well have repeated the success last year had not Raikkonen slipped by at the last round of refuelling stops to take the victory. A track simply steeped in Brazilian motor racing folklore.  Hamilton or Massa?

He was rarely at ease when Brad Gilbert was his coach but Team Murray currently suits him perfectly. &quot;He needs to feel comfortable with those immediately around him,&quot; said his mother, Judy.  It was a thoroughly relaxed, if weary, Murray who talked about the road ahead a few hours after losing his first grand slam final 6-2, 7-5, 6-2 against a player he regards as the &quot;greatest ever&quot;. The 21-year-old knows this is the first stepping stone, the launch pad to becoming the first British male player since Perry here in 1936 to win a major. &quot;I was effectively three sets away from winning a slam, which is much closer than this time last year,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve worked very hard to get to this stage, so winning a slam is really the only goal I have left. I&apos;m going to have work even harder, improve my game and get physically stronger if I&apos;m going to do that.&quot; Murray had deliberately cut himself off from all the hype surrounding the final. &quot;I&apos;ve not turned my computer on at all since I&apos;ve been here and I&apos;ve just got a new phone as well so not too many people have my number. I&apos;ve kind of been a bit shielded from it all, but I&apos;m sure when I get back I&apos;ll have a better understanding of everything. &quot;You have to be boring for a few weeks just to be professional and do all the right things, take all the other elements out of the game and just focus on tennis for a couple of weeks.&quot; Without doubt he will receive a hero&apos;s reception when Britain play Austria in a Davis Cup world group qualifying match starting a week this Friday on Wimbledon&apos;s No1 court. &quot;Ideally I wouldn&apos;t want to be changing surfaces again but it&apos;s a really good opportunity for the team - and the other guys as well - to get back into the world group. I&apos;ll meet up with them, I guess, at the weekend and before that take three or four days off now before getting back in the gym.&quot; Murray takes some stick for his public demeanour - and the grey shirt and non-shaven look hardly helped here - but beneath it all is a young man of singular determination who has become a thorough professional. He is now No4 in the world, joining Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in an elite quartet at the top of the game. &quot;There is no doubt that Andy is right there in the mix,&quot; said Tracy Austin. &quot;And I think we have only scratched the surface of his ability.&quot; Beating Nadal for the first time in the protracted semi-final, after five previous defeats to the Spaniard, was the highlight for Murray. &quot;It was the biggest achievement for me in such a big match, particularly with the rain and then being down in the fourth set as well. I just think that was mentally huge for me. In the past I might not necessarily have come back from that and I did. I played aggressive and took the ball on and did what I had to do to win. &quot;I got killed by Djokovic quite a few times as well and it&apos;s only been recently that I&apos;ve understood how to play against him and figured out how to beat the top guys. This year I&apos;ve beaten Federer, Djokovic, Nadal, Davydenko, Wawrinka and they are all in the top 10. I guess I just need to do it in the big tournaments now, and this was the first time I&apos;ve done it.&quot; Few doubt that he will do it again.

Those of 8/8, for instance. On August 8 2008, two mighty nations announced their return to history. Russia, invading Georgia, did it with tanks. China, launching the Beijing Olympics, did it with acrobats. The message was the same: world, we&apos;re back. Don&apos;t get me wrong. A grave threat from jihadist terrorists, potentially armed with atomic, biological or chemical weapons, hangs over us still. They have a faith-based ideology with proven appeal to a minority of disaffected Muslims, especially those living in the west, and the means to wreak cut-price mayhem are alarmingly easy to find. Even as you read this, another hard-to-detect groupuscule, working in a back room close to you, may have taken the occasion of the 9/11 anniversary to try again. They won&apos;t always be foiled. Protecting us from another 9/11, while not destroying our freedom in order to save it, remains a major challenge to political leadership in every free country.  What has proved false is the neoconservative claim that this single threat defines the whole pattern of world politics in our time; that, as Norman Podhoretz puts it, the struggle against Islamofascism is world war four. Returning to the United States after a year&apos;s absence, I&apos;m struck by how relatively little even the American right is talking about the &quot;war on terror&quot;. Beyond terrorism, two giant changes define our world. Both can, to a large extent, be traced back to the worldwide spread of marketised economic development (or globalisation). The first is the &quot;rise of the rest&quot;, made manifest on 8/8. Non-western powers challenge the economic dominance of the west. They are beating the west at the game it invented, and quietly changing the rules along the way. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that by 2040, China, India, Russia, Brazil and Mexico will have a larger combined economic output than today&apos;s G7. The date matters less than the trend. Even today, the shifts in economic power are translating into political and military power faster than many anticipated.  At the same time, worldwide economic development on the basis of the free movement of goods, capital, services and, to a lesser extent, people, is exacerbating transnational problems. CO2 emissions that accelerate climate change, mass migration, the risk of pandemics: all these cry out for international, cooperative responses. The need for liberal international order has never been greater. Yet, by contrast with the 1990s, when president George HW Bush hoped to replace the cold war with a &quot;new world order&quot;, the prospects of achieving it no longer look so good. Power is diffused to too many competing states, many of them illiberal, as well as elusive networks like al-Qaida. So we of the FLIO (friends of liberal international order) must now confront the prospect of a new world disorder. Or rather old-new, for disorder rather than order is the more natural condition of international society. International order, which may also be called peace, is a fragile achievement. It hardly needs repeating that in its response to the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration has, over these seven lean years, contributed to the erosion, rather than the building, of international order. The Russian invasion of Georgia was, among other things, payback for the US invasion of Iraq. While order is threatened, liberty is no longer on the forward march. The French refer to their 30 years of economic growth after the second world war as the trente glorieuses. Future historians may regard the three decades from Portugal&apos;s revolution of the carnations in 1974 to Ukraine&apos;s Orange revolution in 2004 as trente glorieuses for the spread of liberty, in Europe but also in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia.  Russia and China are not just great powers challenging the west. They also represent alternative versions of authoritarian capitalism, or capitalist authoritarianism. Here&apos;s the biggest potential ideological competitor to liberal democratic capitalism since the end of communism. Radical Islamism may appeal to millions of Muslims, but it cannot reach beyond the umma of the faithful except by conversion. More important, it cannot plausibly claim to be associated with economic, technological and cultural modernity.  By contrast, the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, like the skyscrapers of Shanghai, show us how authoritarian capitalism already stakes that claim. In the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium, the latest audiovisual hi-tech was placed at the service of a hyper-disciplined collectivist fantasy, made possible by financial resources no democracy would have dared devote to such a purpose. Zhang Yimou, the artistic director of the games ceremonies, said only North Korea could have matched such feats of mass synchronisation. For close to 500 years, modernity has come from the west. The historian Theodore von Laue called this The World Revolution of Westernisation. In 20th-century Europe, liberal democracy faced two powerful versions of modernity that were western but illiberal: fascism and communism. Part of these systems&apos; appeal was precisely that they were modern. (&quot;I have seen the future and it works,&quot; said one enthusiast, returning from Moscow.) Liberal democracy finally saw them both off, though not without a world war, a cold war, and a lot of help from the US.  In China, we glimpse the prospect of a modernity which is both non-western and illiberal. But is authoritarian capitalism a stable, durable model? That, it seems to me, is among the greatest questions of our time, which is still a post-9/11 time, but also a post-8/8 time, and, ecologically, a five-minutes-to-midnight time. As we of the FLIO think about how to respond to this multiple-front challenge, I have more sympathy than many Europeans do for the notion, canvassed by American policy intellectuals supporting both John McCain and Barack Obama, of a &quot;concert of democracies&quot;. We should look first to those countries who share our values in the way they govern themselves - and there are more of them now, after these trente glorieuses for liberty. But only with several vital caveats. First, we should not kid ourselves that we can have only liberal democracies as partners. Our values may pull us that way, but our interests will necessarily push us to relationships and even partnerships with currently illiberal states as well. So any institutionalised League of Democracies, arrayed against an Association of Autocrats (Robert Kagan&apos;s vivid term), is a seriously bad idea - even assuming you could agree who merits inclusion in the league. Bipolar disorder would be no improvement on multipolar. It&apos;s also not the smartest idea to identify this vision of a concert of democracies too emphatically with the west, as in the former French prime minister Edouard Balladur&apos;s proposal for what he calls a Western Union. Historically, both modernity and liberalism have come from the west. But the future of freedom now depends on the possibility of new versions of modernity evolving - whether in India, China or the Muslim world, which are distinctly non-western yet also recognisably liberal, in the core sense of cherishing individual freedom. I wouldn&apos;t bet on this outcome, but working towards it is the best long-term chance we have. Pessimism of the intellect must be matched by optimism of the will.

The accident happened after torrential rain caused walls to burst at the Tashan mine in Linfen City. Mud and iron ore waste swamped a village of 1,000 people in Xiangfen county, leaving just a handful of houses still standing.  Authorities have declined to confirm how many people were missing, saying an investigation was continuing. But there have been reports that hundreds may have been buried in the sludge. &quot;There&apos;s almost no hope of their survival ... they have been buried for three days under two metres of slush,&quot; Wang Jun, head of the state administration of work safety, said.

Officers were still visiting various households in the area and interviewing residents for a final tally on the number of people missing. A preliminary investigation showed the landslide was triggered by heavy rains that brought down a retaining wall at a waste dump operated by an illegal mine, said Wang Dexue, deputy head of the state administration of work safety. The wall&apos;s collapse sent a wave of grey sludge over the town, located just below the waste site, washing out homes, cars, and buildings, including one where more than 100 people from a local mining company were holding a weekly meeting, the Shanghai Morning Post said. A relative of one of the company&apos;s employees told the paper that only three of those at the meeting were believed to have survived. The landslide occurred just as business at a busy outdoor market was getting under way, the report said. The disaster underscores two major public safety concerns in China: the failure to enforce protective measures in the country&apos;s notoriously deadly mines, and the unsound state of many of its bridges, dams and other ageing infrastructure.

A great fan of the Guardian&apos;s Free our Data campaign, he rightly rails against organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that charge for statistics that have already been paid for by the taxpayer. It makes his job working for a not-for profit organisation (recently acquired by Google) much more difficult. He has a vision of statistics being made available with enough detail for members of the public, using his graphs, to dis-aggregate the information so they can find out about, say, infant mortality rates in a region of Glasgow in an understandable way. Professor Rosling reels out pithy phrases like a stand up comic. The BBC, he says, is fantastic with animation but it is all spent on branding not making data come alive.

The world has stopped waiting for the US - and its next president - to declare its roadmap for the future. Instead, the other 96% of the planet has decided to move on with its business. And business is booming. The major emerging powers, production centres and financial capitals - Russia, China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates and others - are creating connections among themselves. While some Americans gloat that the global economic slowdown is evidence the world has not &quot;decoupled&quot; from it yet, the situation would have been much worse if emerging markets were not robust centres of growth.  This new economics is the foundation for a new geopolitics to which the US is more responding than shaping. To claim the world will warm to the return of the kinder, pre-Bush America requires a heroic leap of faith. Will Russia stop using Gazprom diplomacy and military muscle to bully Ukraine and occupy its near abroad? Will Iran stop seeking nuclear weapons? Will China stop providing military, financial, diplomatic and other lifelines to every country the US deems a &quot;rogue state&quot;? Only if America can change any of these should the next US president have any right to declare the next &quot;new world order&quot;. To speak of world order is to speak of a stable distribution of power in the world. But no such predictable pattern exists. Power has diffused not only to heavyweights such as China, but the EU - the most formidable economic force in the world. Militarily, rapid build-ups are occurring in the Middle East and east Asia - and now also Latin America, with Venezuela welcoming Russian bombers for training exercises this week. It would be far more appropriate to speak of a &quot;new middle ages&quot; than a new order, for we live in a world not just of nations, but of empires, multinational corporations, religious crusaders, non-governmental activists and mega-philanthropists operating on all layers of the complex matrix of 21st-century power. Order will have to be thought of as regional at best - with east Asia falling under the Chinese sphere of influence, and north Africa increasingly under the European - rather than global.  The institutional underpinning is not only under strain, but has in effect collapsed. Regional and bilateral preferential trade agreements are proliferating at the expense of the WTO, whose Doha round fell apart weeks ago. The UN security council has not changed since before the end of the cold war. The IMF and World Bank have become marginal players in their own fields as aid falls out of favour in competition with faster and more voluminous foreign direct investment. Where is the architecture for a new world order for a new middle ages? It emerges either after a major war or from the bottom up. The latter is happening already in the far east. The only question is how far it will stretch. Asia has the largest populations and the most money. In the past years an alphabet soup rivalling the EU has emerged, with ASEAN+3 among a host of acronyms that reveal how China is co-opting Japan, Australia and Korea through trade, investment and non-aggression pacts.  This is not mere cant - Asian diplomacy has achieved concrete results. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation&apos;s border patrols manage counter-terrorism and trade in central Asia, and might soon be invited to help Nato stabilise Afghanistan. East Asia&apos;s major powers conduct defence exercises together, and are planning joint energy exploration agreements. Beyond Asia the Persian Gulf oil producers, and their sovereign wealth funds, are starting to quickly reorientate themselves towards Indian and Chinese demand and markets - far more lucrative than the west. Maybe the west can one day be independent of Middle East oil, but that only increases eastern leverage over the energy-rich lands in between. In Africa, many nations have profited from Chinese investment. Some decry China as the &quot;new colonialists&quot;, but in the age of transparency it is likely to learn the power of shame far more quickly than the west did.  So perhaps there will be a new world order - but one dictated not from Washington but Beijing. The cold war was never truly an east-west rivalry - only now is the real east rising. Whichever world order project we embark on in the coming years, it will have to balance east and west, north and south, public and private, international and global. Whatever we call this order, it involves all of us much more than any of the past.  \u00b7 Parag Khanna is a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation and author of The Second World  paragkhanna.com", "tags": ["World news", "Philanthropy", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-11T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/13/jgballard.biography", "sentences": ["While his boyhood experiences in Shanghai are familiar from Empire of the Sun, recollections of skin infections, weevil-infested congee and sudden sickening violence bear unflinching witness to both human resilience and cruelty.", "He can also be donnishly wry: a rickshaw driver unleashing a torrent of diarrhoea in the street leaves the future medical student pondering the microbes to be trodden through Shanghai&apos;s offices."], "title": "Review: Miracles of Life by JG Ballard", "article": "A revered author writing his autobiography after a terminal cancer diagnosis might decide he has the right to turn in a showy memorial to his legend.

On a freezing afternoon yesterday at the World Athletics final, Britain&apos;s only track-and-field gold medallist from Beijing was beaten by Sanya Richards. It hardly mattered. As the American said: &quot;I wanted to win today but I really wish this could have been Beijing. That is the title I hope to have. Christine has it, and she is a great champion.&quot; It is also a title that Ohuruogu would like to keep when the Games arrive in her own backyard. As the main grand prix season closed, Ohuruogu&apos;s bright smile shone through once more for British track and field after a summer that brought only four Olympic medals and the subsequent decision not to renew the contract of the national performance director, Dave Collins. Ohuruogu has become the standard-bearer for the rest of the team. &quot;I have the biggest accolade one can ever wish for in athletics and I am very happy with that,&quot; she said. &quot;It will be a changing time [for the sport] but we will have to wait and see what happens.&quot; The Dutchman Charles van Commenee remains the favourite to become the new head coach, and he will have little trouble in motivating Ohuruogu. The east Londoner was brought up only 15 minutes from the epicentre of the next Olympics in Stratford and she does not want to extend her body too far before then. The Games might be 1,411 days away, but there is nothing like early preparation. &quot;In terms of longevity, you have to get it right,&quot; said Ohuruogu, who will be 28 by 2012. &quot;I will think about the next four years so that I do not do too much, but just enough to sustain me. I am going to sit down with my coach and work stuff through. It is a matter of planning sensibly. If I am looking to go to 2012, I will have to play my cards right for the next four years.&quot; Ohuruogu has become supreme at timing her season to perfection for the major championships. It is why she is the Olympic, world and Commonwealth champion, while Richards, by far the more consistent athlete on the grand prix circuit, remains without a major individual honour. Though she does not run many 400m races during the season - yesterday was only her sixth of the summer outside of the Olympics - it is possible that Ohuruogu might compete over the distance even less. It was no surprise that Richards won yesterday. As in Beijing, the American made a fast start, but unlike the Olympics, there was no sign of her slowing when the home straight arrived. She triumphed in 50.41sec from Ohuruogu in 50.83, with Jamaican Novlene Williams third in 51.30. But she agreed it was a hollow victory. &quot;Of course it was,&quot; said Richards, who was in lane five, one ahead of Ohuruogu, and introduced to the crowd following a rousing reception for the Olympic champion. &quot;It is tough. It is very meaningful to win the World Athletics final, but my No1 goal this year was the Olympics.&quot; While Ohuruogu is thinking about London, Richards knows that she must change her own strategy for the world championships in Berlin next summer. &quot;Christine performs really well at the big meets,&quot; said Richards. &quot;I am going to have to get tougher and compete with her next year. She handles pressure really well and I don&apos;t. I get so caught up and I want to win so badly. At the smaller meets, I don&apos;t think about my race so much. I just go out and run and have fun. I have to find a way to do that at the big meets.&quot; Ohuruogu, who has one final race at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix on Saturday before ending her season, yesterday banked $20,000 (\u00a311,176) for finishing second as Richards won $30,000. But it was a great deal more than that earned by Natasha Danvers, the most surprising of Britain&apos;s four athletics medallists in Beijing. Danvers, who won bronze in the 400m hurdles, blew a big pay-day after tripping over the second barrier and finished last in 58.40 as Melaine Walker, the Olympic champion from Jamaica, won in 54.06. The Briton received $2,000 for eighth place.  &quot;It has made my decision to go back to 14 strides between the first three hurdles,&quot; said Danvers. &quot;I have been taking 15 and that was what made me fall because I was too close to the hurdle.&quot; End-of-season report Good year Germaine Mason A new name for high jump to conjure with after Olympic silver Stephanie Twell  A brilliant gold in the 1500m at the World Junior Championships and a personal best yesterday in the 3,000m in Stuttgart for this 19-year-old  Christine Ohuruogu  The only British woman to win a gold medal in a track event at Beijing with her 400m triumph  Bad year Mo Farah  Once seen as one of Britain&apos;s great hopes, he failed to make the final of the 5,000m in Beijing Paula Radcliffe She overcame injury to make it to the start- line of the Beijing Olympic marathon, yet finished 23rd Craig Pickering  In Beijing, ran out of his changeover zone, resulting in sprint relay disqualification for the British team", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-14T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/15/blog.politics", "sentences": ["Mica Yushu, a blogger in Shanghai, told me that most of her middle-class friends didn&apos;t crave political change."], "title": "Media: The role of blogs in politics", "article": "During the recent war between Georgia and Russia, bloggers on both sides of the conflict provided searing accounts of atrocities and manoeuvres unseen by western journalists. In a country such as Russia the space for alternative and critical views are rare. The war showed an authoritarian regime&apos;s narrative being challenged by a handful of insiders and outsiders. The government-run media looked staid by comparison.  This was merely the latest example of bloggers beating mainstream journalists at their own game. Online media have exploded in western nations, challenging decades-old business models and forcing reporters to answer questions about their methods and sources. But in repressive states, blogs and websites have become essential sources of information on topics - from women&apos;s issues to sexual orientation, dating rituals to human rights - routinely shunned by channels for official propaganda.  These openings for citizens in the non-western world to be heard are far more empowering than the equivalent outlets in our own societies. But how often do we hear these voices in the west? September 11, for example, should have been the perfect opportunity for the western media to listen to the grievances of the Muslim world. Alas, with notable exceptions, indigenous voices were excluded then and still remain largely absent from the pages of the world&apos;s leading papers. It is as if only a western journalist&apos;s filter can validate such perspectives. Hearing local voices In 2007 I travelled to Iran, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Cuba and China to speak to dissidents, bloggers, writers, politicians and ordinary citizens about how the internet is changing their countries. I wanted to gauge their interests, desires, frustrations and attitudes towards each other and the west. My new book, The Blogging Revolution, is a chance for these local voices to reveal how the web has democratised their minds - although it also reflects the fact that the vast majority of global netizens prefer online dating and downloading pirated films and music to challenging political orthodoxy.  Also addressed is whether multinationals such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Cisco have played a part in assisting net filtering and censorship in China, Cuba and the Middle East. On the eve of the Beijing Olympic Games, Naomi Klein wrote that western firms were essential in &quot;authoritarian communism - central planning, merciless repression, constant surveillance - harnessed to advance the goals of global capitalism.&quot;  How much do we know about Yahoo&apos;s or Google&apos;s willingness to modify their behaviour to please paranoid officials? I discovered that the western executives of these companies have been more than comfortable with allowing their Chinese counterparts to self-censor thousands of sensitive keywords; far more than just &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;Falun Gong&quot;. Moreover, they are ignoring disturbing developments such as Yahoo China&apos;s decision earlier this year to post images of wanted Tibetans on its home page after the Lhasa uprising.  Democratic force An important question the book poses is whether the web is an automatic democratiser, as is widely assumed in western media circles. The general consensus, across the globe, was that political and military meddling by Washington and London was making the job of real democrats much more difficult.  As one blogger told me in Tehran: &quot;Most of the people I know are in favour of reform, not revolution, because people are too tired to experience another revolution.&quot; I found the same message echoed throughout the countries I visited: the desire to experience incremental change without foreign involvement. Take China. It has 250 million internet users - now the largest online community in the world, far surpassing America - based in both the cities and rural areas. Politics is often the furthest thing from their minds, but connecting with friends has become an essential part of life. I met very few bloggers who wanted to discuss anything political and most expressed general satisfaction with the regime&apos;s economic policies. No great desire for &quot;democratisation&quot; there.  Mica Yushu, a blogger in Shanghai, told me that most of her middle-class friends didn&apos;t crave political change. &quot;We use the internet mostly for entertainment, sharing information, earning money or other fun,&quot; she said. The sight of darkened internet cafes across the country was something to behold, with thousands of users gaming, watching soft-core pornography, blogging and instant messaging. A recent study by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project found that the vast majority of China&apos;s web users expressed support for Beijing managing or controlling the internet, including the banning of &quot;pornographic&quot; sites. This is not to say that the Chinese desire authoritarian rule; but while they want change, curbing corruption and ensuring essential services are their top priorities, not the advances in human rights the west puts at the top of the agenda.  After the Beijing Games, Chinese bloggers fiercely debated the economic direction the country should take over the coming years. It was a far more robust debate than one would expect from coverage of China in the west, where the emphasis is always on rampant nationalism.  One anonymous blogger noted - after sarcastically praising the country&apos;s free-market reforms as the &quot;best system seen not just in Chinese history, but also in humankind&apos;s&quot; - that greater political development could only come with a &quot;basic welfare system.&quot; Such discussions on a massive scale were impossible in China before the internet. Equally important debates are occurring in every country I visited.  Allowing people to speak and write for themselves without a western filter is one of the triumphs of blogging. The online culture, disorganised and disjointed in its aims, is unlike that of any previous social movement. While some want the right to criticise their leaders, others simply want the ability to flirt and listen to subversive tunes. That is revolutionary for much of the world. \u00b7 Antony Loewenstein is a Sydney-based journalist, blogger and author of The Blogging Revolution", "tags": ["Digital media", "Media", "Blogging", "Politics and technology", "Politics", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-14T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/marketturmoil.stockmarkets", "sentences": ["The European markets were the first major indices to react to the drama on Wall Street, as both the Tokyo and Shanghai stock exchanges were closed for a public holiday."], "title": "Wall Street crisis: Investors dump shares after Lehman collapse", "article": "     Shares nosedived in London and New York today as traders dumped stock following the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which has left thousands of staff facing redundancy. As distressed employees arrived at Lehman&apos;s offices in Canary Wharf and on Wall Street, with some fearing that they may not be paid this month, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares plunged by more than 5%. By the close it was down 212.5 points at 5204.5, down 3.9%, with \u00a350bn wiped off the value of Briain&apos;s top 100 companies. The Dow Jones industrial average also fell sharply, losing 283 points by early afternoon in New York to 11138, a 2.5% decline. HBOS, which owns Britain&apos;s biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, led the London fallers for most of the day, shedding 17.5% of its value by the close as the credit crunch entered a new phase and investors piled into gold and government bonds. Markets were left reeling by the triple whammy of the failure of Lehman Brothers, the shock sale of Merrill Lynch, and the revelation that AIG, the world&apos;s largest insurance firm, may need to raise as much as $40bn (\u00a322.2bn).  Lehman became the biggest casualty of the ongoing financial crisis early this morning when it admitted it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, after last-ditch rescue talks collapsed. &apos;My career has been screwed&apos; Staff arriving at Lehman&apos;s Canary Wharf offices today had to negotiate crowds of media and security guards before being told that they were excused work for the rest of today. Some left the bank carrying their belongings in cardboard boxes, while others sorted out their expenses or spent the balance of their credit at the canteen. Some staff even spoke of heavy drinking up on the seventh floor of the building. The atmosphere outside was a mixture of anger, shock and confusion, especially among the graduate trainees - who only started work at Lehman this month. &quot;My career has been screwed,&quot; said Jack Reynolds, who joined the graduate scheme last Monday. And Duo Ai, aged 26 from New York, who works in the research department, said that there was a lot of anger about Lehman&apos;s demise. &quot;Everyone&apos;s understanding is that everyone has to go. Everyone is clearing their desks and everyone is very sad,&quot; said Ai, who must now apply for a new visa to stay in the UK. Ai added that staff are concerned that they may not be paid this month. Edouard d&apos;Archimbaud, 24, from Paris, had a particularly nasty shock when he arrived in Canary Wharf for his first day of work as a trader this morning. Having overcome travel problems following the Eurostar fire, he was told that everyone at the bank had been fired. &quot;I&apos;ve taken out a six-month lease on a flat and I don&apos;t know how I will pay for it,&quot; he said. The bank employs 26,000 people worlwide, including 4,000 staff in London and another 1,000 in High Wycombe. A rumour even swept the City that the bonuses already handed to staff could be clawed back, if it could be proven that Lehman was no longer solvent when the money was paid. Across the Atlantic, staff leaving Lehman&apos;s New York office found that they had become the city&apos;s latest tourist attraction - as Lehman-branded items began appearing on eBay. Market gloom Banks were hit hard in London, amid fears that they could suffer badly from Lehman&apos;s collapse into bankruptcy. HBOS lost more than 30% at one stage but closed down 49.5p or 17.5% at 232.5p. Barclays ended down 34.5p at 316p and Royal Bank of Scotland lost 23.4p at 210.5p. Today&apos;s losses wiped out the FTSE&apos;s recovery last Thursday and Friday, pushing it closer to its lowest closing point in the last year, 5071 points, set on July 16 2008. Stockmarkets across Europe also took a bath, with Germany&apos;s DAX index losing 2.7% and the French CAC falling by 3.8%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.5%, or 283 points, to 11138 by 6.15pm BST. Shares in AIG crashed more than 50%, while Merrill Lynch gained 26% after being bought by Bank of America. The sharp falls came despite the central banks pumping billions of fresh liquidity into the system in an attempt to stabilise the market. The Bank of England offered \u00a35bn of new funding, which was five times oversubscribed, and the European Central Bank awarded \u20ac30bn (\u00a323.8bn) which was three times oversubscribed. John McFall MP, chair of the Treasury select committee, told Guardian.co.uk today that he fears that more banks will collapse. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve seen a weekend like it since the late 1920s,&quot; said McFall. &quot;It proves that the market is different. Indeed there is no market, it&apos;s all falling back on the state.&quot; And City commentator David Buik warned that a painful recession was inevitable. &quot;The fact that banks&apos; capital bases have been hit hard again means there is less money to be lent and in a more discerning fashion, which will result in less disposable income being spent in the shopping malls which will trigger higher unemployment and the inevitable fall in to recession,&quot; he said. The European markets were the first major indices to react to the drama on Wall Street, as both the Tokyo and Shanghai stock exchanges were closed for a public holiday. Smaller markets in Asia had already shown they were spooked by the events, with Taiwan losing over 4%. And while share prices fell, bringing more pain to long-suffering investors, commodities including gold rose sharply.", "tags": ["Lehman Brothers", "Market turmoil", "Shares", "Business", "UK news", "World news", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2008-09-15T17:15:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/16/formulaone.lewishamilton", "sentences": ["Shanghai, same again."], "title": "Formula one: Title run-in will suit me and we're going to attack, says Lewis Hamilton", "article": "Lewis Hamilton yesterday joined the chorus of praise for Sebastian Vettel&apos;s victory in Sunday&apos;s Italian grand prix at Monza. &quot;He&apos;s been getting stronger all year,&quot; he said of the young German. &quot;Having won, it shows how good he is.&quot; The Briton&apos;s main focus until the end of the season, however, is to fend off the title challenge of Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa in Singapore, Japan, China and Brazil. Hamilton finished seventh in Italy, just over a second behind Massa, having started 15th on the grid in his McLaren because of a tyre-choice error during Saturday&apos;s rain-soaked qualifying session.  Last year he had a 17-point lead in the world championship with two races to go but Ferrari&apos;s Kimi Raikkonen won in China and Brazil to take the title by one point. This year, with four races to go, Hamilton&apos;s lead has been narrowed to one point over Massa and he knows he must keep his nerve.  &quot;Kimi is world champion, so it is his championship to lose,&quot; Hamilton said yesterday, although the Finn is almost out of the running after a third successive race in which he failed to score a point left him trailing Hamilton by 21.  &quot;Singapore is going to be a great experience. I&apos;ve never been to the city before, and I love the fact we&apos;re going back to a street circuit. Fantastic. Fuji [Japan], you know what I&apos;m like there. I drove quickly in both the dry and wet. Shanghai, same again. I was very quick there last year and I know the car I have will be fantastic there this year. And then Brazil, we&apos;ll be quick there again. But I would say none of them will be particularly key. In each race we&apos;re going to be attacking.&quot; The former world champion Niki Lauda said yesterday: &quot;It really is quite extraordinary how tight the championship battle is at this late stage of the season and I couldn&apos;t choose between Massa and Hamilton at this point.&quot;  Lauda lost the 1976 world championship in his Ferrari, by a single point, to McLaren&apos;s James Hunt. &quot;I know the situation I faced that year was different in the sense that I was coming back from the grave, if you like, after I was badly burned at the N\u00fcrburgring,&quot; he said. &quot;But I had a big points lead and James really built up his momentum over the last few races, so the pressure was just as intense as these guys are going to experience. &quot;The truth is that both Felipe and Lewis are capable of winning this year&apos;s championship, but it will probably come down to which keeps the coolest and holds his nerve over the final few races. I think Lewis showed just how quick the McLaren can be as he came through the field on Sunday, but I guess his tyres were pretty well knocked out by the time he pulled on to Massa&apos;s tail and I suppose that&apos;s why he couldn&apos;t get past. But it&apos;s going to go all the way down to the wire in Brazil, in my opinion.&quot;  While preparing for Singapore on Sunday week, Hamilton will give evidence to the FIA court of appeal in Paris next Monday. There he will have to relive the episode in the Belgian grand prix when he entered the braking zone for the chicane before the pits running wheel-to-wheel with Raikkonen, straight-lined the corner to avoid a collision, permitted the Ferrari driver to repass and then took the lead going into the La Source hairpin.  The stewards judged that Hamilton gained an unfair advantage and dropped him from first to third. The Briton wants his win restored, together with the four points he lost. That alone could decide the world championship.

With Dubai&apos;s ruler intent on purchasing Liverpool, diverting his interest to Newcastle always looked a forlorn hope, and in any case Ashley - who was accompanied by two club directors, Tony Jimenez and Dennis Wise - seems to be going about things in a characteristically unorthodox manner. &quot;People like Mike Ashley just don&apos;t get to see key members of the Al Maktoum family,&quot; explained a financial source well versed in foreign football takeovers. &quot;Trying to do business by just turning up like that will not impress Gulf Arabs. To have any hope of selling the club in the Middle East, Newcastle need to employ an Arabic-speaking intermediary with the right contacts, sit back and wait. Even then it might not be that easy. Selling Newcastle could take time.&quot; If Arab royals or their assorted investment funds indicate an interest in doing a deal with a Premier League club, they tend to contact Amanda Staveley, whose company, PCP, is experienced in negotiating such buyouts and was involved in Manchester City&apos;s recent takeover. It is understood Newcastle have indeed approached Staveley, asking her to find them a purchaser, but it appears she is currently too busy to help. Dubai may yet prove a sensible venue for meeting potential investors from the Far East - Singapore&apos;s Profitable Group may be a contender and a Shanghai property developer is said to be keen - or nearby Qatar but Ashley and his cohorts may find selling Newcastle an uphill task. The billionaire Sports Direct owner aims to recoup at least the \u00a3250m he claims to have invested in the club since purchasing the shares of the previous owners, the Hall family, and the former chairman, Freddy Shepherd, during the summer of 2007. Vinay Bedi, a football analyst with the Tyneside-based stockbrokers Brewin Dolphin, says &quot;overseas investors are definitely interested&quot; but he believes Ashley is unlikely to make a significant profit. Similarly Adam Pearson, Derby County&apos;s chairman of football, said: &quot;Some of the figures being mentioned are ridiculous. A club haemorrhaging \u00a320m a year is definitely not worth \u00a3400m.&quot; Although many of the debts inherited from the previous regime have been paid, at least \u00a327m is still owed to rival clubs in staggered transfer fees, and Bedi said: &quot;I would not say Newcastle United&apos;s value is more than \u00a3250m, maybe \u00a3300m, depending on how the debt is positioned now. And, of course, you really have to be a multibillionaire to buy a Premier League club these days.&quot; Such overweening financial demands possibly make Newcastle too expensive for the successful north-east-based Sage software group to contemplate buying Ashley out. Indeed, the consensus is that investors boasting both the cash and inclination are most likely to be found overseas and with no need to borrow money. The investment-vehicle group Dubai International Capital (DIC) remains virtually immune from the global credit crunch and is now not part of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s attempt to buy Liverpool, but a spokesman yesterday insisted it was not preparing an offer for Newcastle. Other serious international players, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, have explored the possibility of purchasing Newcastle only to be seemingly deterred by some of the &quot;Geordie baggage&quot; surrounding St James&apos; Park. &quot;Of the clubs for sale in the Premier League, it&apos;s one of the harder ones to probably get right,&quot; said the financial source. &quot;The fans are obviously pretty demanding and, if they really are insisting on having Keegan restored as manager, that might put off buyers who want to bring in their own coach. Also the whole club will need restructuring and the team looks like it needs a lot of money spending on it.&quot; Even if a sale is agreed quickly the financial source believes it would take at least six to eight weeks to complete. Ashley&apos;s immediate problem, then, is that a weak squad cannot be allowed to drift rudderless for the next two months - and possibly far longer - while the ownership issue is resolved. If leaving Chris Hughton, the caretaker, in charge represents a substantial risk, attracting a high-calibre new manager will be complicated by a change to the ownership. As things stand the popular Hughton lacks sufficient coaching support and is presiding over a disillusioned squad. A senior Newcastle player described the situation as &quot;a shambles&quot; yesterday. If Ashley does not want to be confronted with selling a Championship club it is one he needs to address, urgently. To buy or not to buy - that is the question Three reasons to buy St James&apos; Park Much of the debt Mike Ashley found so hard to pay off was incurred in enlarging the stadium from 36,834 a decade ago to 52,387.

The Tour de France is better for your retirement", "article": "For all the warm glow created by the success of Britain&apos;s riders in Beijing, bike racing remains a sport in intensive care. The doping scandals of recent years left it in a critical condition, its already fragile health undermined by the departure of sponsors no longer wishing to associate themselves with what they saw as a discredited world. To a greater extent than any other similarly afflicted sport, however, it has shown a desire to take the medicine that might effect a lasting cure. Prominent riders have been banned, their teams have found themselves excluded from major races, and new sponsors have been attracted to teams who have created their own anti-doping programmes. It hasn&apos;t been perfect. A lot of people were not pleased to see the US rider Tyler Hamilton, recently released from a two-year ban for blood doping, entering last week&apos;s Tour of Britain. But, on the whole, you would have to say that the sport of cycling is pedalling hard to reach a state of rehabilitation. Sadly, the prospect of Lance Armstrong&apos;s return can do nothing but muddy the waters once again. In a purely legalistic sense, of course, there can be no objection to last week&apos;s announcement of his intention to resume racing next year in order to attempt to extend his record of Tour de France wins. He has often claimed to have been the most frequently tested athlete in the world, pointing out that he has never given a positive result in a test whose findings could be properly verified (a category that does not include the alleged findings of EPO traces in blood samples he gave during the 1999 Tour, for which no B samples were ever subjected to analysis). Nor can there be an argument with his stated intention to use his return to launch a new cancer appeal. Even his fiercest critics admit that Armstrong&apos;s recovery from a near-fatal illness, and his subsequent success in winning the Tour not once but seven times, has given encouragement to many thousands of cancer sufferers around the world. His return, however, threatens to awaken old rancours.  It will probably come as a surprise to his admirers in the United States to know that many European cycling fans found it difficult to warm to a man whose success brought a new kind of ambience to the Tour de France, the result of an approach that had more to do with corporate America than with the way the great race had traditionally conducted itself. His team&apos;s bus was surrounded by security barriers, its door guarded by a large man with a curly earpiece. The old intimacy of the Tour, and the approachability of its participants, took a severe knock. On the question of doping, I tended always to give him the benefit of the doubt, wanting to share the opinion of a wise German colleague with around 30 Tours under his belt who, when I asked for his opinion of Armstrong, thought for a while and replied, &quot;My admiration is greater than my suspicion.&quot; But it is absurd for Armstrong now to claim that by subjecting himself to a strict blood-testing regime, and making the results public, he will dispel the lingering suspicions. Whatever happens in 2008 has no retrospective bearing on what might have occurred between 1999 and 2005. The future can&apos;t change the past. And now, too, we will once again face the prospect of a leading rider concentrating his efforts on only one race. After he had won the Tour for the first time, Armstrong devoted his attention exclusively to the warm-up events that would help him repeat that achievement again and again. If the Tour already enjoyed a disproportionate amount of attention compared with the rest of the season&apos;s events, the publicity given to his activities accentuated that imbalance. Since his departure in 2005, however, the status of the three &quot;grand tours&quot; has been readjusted; the best riders now tend to ride two out of three each year, just as they used to, making the season a richer experience for everybody.  In the press room at the end of one stage of this year&apos;s Tour I found myself sitting next to the silver-haired Felice Gimondi, the Italian rider who, in the 1960s, became one of only four men to have won all three races. I&apos;m afraid I looked at him with a kind of awe I could never summon up for Armstrong. I don&apos;t want the Tour de France to become just another chapter of the Lance Armstrong story. He can do what he likes, of course. But I want him to reconsider, and to reach the conclusion that there are other ways to work for cancer victims. Don&apos;t saddle Walcott with &apos;new Beckham&apos; banalities  The media&apos;s response to Theo Walcott&apos;s show-stealing performance in Zagreb said everything about a nation hooked on celebrity and the quick fix. The front pages vied to devise the most banal epithet, running the gamut from &quot;The new Beckham&quot; to &quot;The new Posh &apos;n&apos; Becks&quot; - the latter adorning a picture of Walcott and his girlfriend, Melanie Slade, a physiotherapy student who, like her partner, has done absolutely nothing to justify any of the suggestions implicit in such a headline.  Every bit as remarkable as Walcott&apos;s talent is his ability to remain unspoilt by such attention. At the 2006 World Cup he was an eager, polite boy who saw no reason to treat strangers with suspicion and showed no inclination to treat himself as a superstar. Two years later, give or take a diamond ear stud and a single appearance in Hello!, those traits remain intact. That&apos;s a small miracle, and a tribute not only to those around him but, most of all, to the essential nature of the boy himself. Ecclestone sets deadline to make his wish come true So now we learn that Bernie Ecclestone has told the operators of Donington Park that if their revamped circuit facilities are not complete in time for a race in 2010 he will remove the British grand prix from the calendar and replace it with an event in another country. Ecclestone is keen to give a race to a country where a government which has no need to bother with such subtleties as planning permission will subsidise the creation of a circuit and hand over a massive fee for the privilege. Since the annual race schedule is overcrowded, something will have to give. At the moment it looks like being a grand prix that has been held continuously since 1950, in a country where half the cars on the grid are manufactured and which has produced eight world champions. It&apos;s like moving Wimbledon to Shanghai, or the Open to Dubai. Just don&apos;t say you weren&apos;t warned. A relief for Mrs Woods not to have to grin and bear it If there is one person in the world of golf who must be glad to be missing the Ryder Cup, you can bet your life it is Elin Woods, sitting at home in Isleworth, Florida, with her convalescent husband.

As investors continued to reel from yesterday&apos;s high drama and central banks pumped more money into the system, the FTSE 100 index tumbled by 178.6 points to 5025.6. HBOS, owner of Halifax, saw its shares plunge by more than 40% at one stage today, despite the company insisting that it is well capitalised. And shares in Goldman Sachs fell 10% in early trading after it posted a 70% drop in profits. &apos;Confidence has been shattered&apos; With analysts comparing the implosion of Lehman Brothers and the rescue takeover of Merrill Lynch to the crash of 1929, chancellor Alistair Darling said it was vital that the world&apos;s central banks acted together to provide stability. Shortly afterwards, the Bank of England injected another \u00a320bn into the markets to avoid liquidity freezing up again, but despite the move the cost of overnight borrowing leapt to its highest level since 2001. Later the US Federal Reserve offered to lend $50bn (\u00a328bn) to banks, having put $70bn in yesterday. The Dow Jones index plunged 150 points in early trading, before recovering most of its losses by 3.45pm BST. Today&apos;s losses mean more gloom to shareholders following yesterday&apos;s 3.9% plunge, and prompted Britain&apos;s biggest trade union, Unite, to call for urgent action. &quot;This global financial crisis has sent shockwaves across the industry,&quot; said Graham Goddard, Unite deputy general secretary. &quot;It is apparent that the free market system has completely broken down. Confidence in the financial services sector has been shattered.&quot; Earlier today shareholders in Japan and China, where markets were closed yesterday, caught up with the unprecedented upheaval in the financial world. The Nikkei index fell by almost 5% and the Shanghai index lost 4.3%. With most Lehman staff having cleared their desks, attention has turned to AIG, the US insurance giant. Its credit ratings were cut yesterday, adding to fears that it could become the next victim of the financial crisis. UK inflation hit a new high of 4.7% this morning, and the price of US crude oil also fell sharply again to $91.54 a barrel.  Barclays, whose shares dropped by 2.6%, was in the spotlight after it confirmed that it is still talking to Lehman about possibly buying some assets, despite having walked away from last-ditch rescue talks on Sunday evening. Today&apos;s losses came after Wall Street suffered its worst day&apos;s trading since the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled by 504 points yesterday, despite AIG being handed a $20bn lifeline. AIG&apos;s shares fell by 32% today. The collapse of Lehman, allied with the shock takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America and the troubles of AIG, have prompted speculation that the US Federal Reserve could cut American interest rates later today.  Such a cut appeared highly unlikely before the credit crunch entered its latest phase, but traders now believe rates could be cut by as much as 50 basis points to 1.5%. The troubles of the banking sector are likely to make any US recession deeper and more painful. Speaking on BBC radio this morning, Alistair Darling said that global cooperation is needed to fight the crisis. &quot;We need to take action internationally, and yesterday you saw right across the world the American Fed, the ECB, our own Bank of England and Japan all intervening,&quot; he explained, citing the various injections of liquidity announced yesterday by the world&apos;s central banks. Darling also met with Bank of England governor Mervyn King today, sparking a City rumour that the pair had met for &quot;crisis talks&quot;. A spokesman for Gordon Brown, who also attended the meeting, insisted today that the meeting had been pre-arranged and had covered &quot;the main economic and financial issues facing the UK&quot;. Having pumped \u00a35bn into the markets yesterday, the Bank of England today presented another \u00a320bn in fresh liquidity. Banks rushed to take up the offer, which was three-times oversubscribed. This is the Bank&apos;s latest attempt to keep retail banks lending to each other. But the cost of overnight borrowing still spiked today, as banks again held onto their cash - threatening a new credit crunch. The Bank of Japan has also acted, ploughing \u00a52.5 trillion (\u00a313.5bn) into markets today in an attempt to limit the fallout from the Lehman collapse.

However, today&apos;s test results showed that around 10% of liquid milk samples taken from the Mengniu Dairy Group Co and the Yili Industrial Group Co, China&apos;s two largest dairy producers, were found to contained melamine.  Milk from the Shanghai-based Bright Dairy also showed contamination. The results of the tests were reported by China&apos;s general administration of quality supervision, inspection and quarantine.  A statement on the organisation&apos;s website said it would &quot;strictly find out the reason for adding the melamine and severely punish those who are responsible&quot;, adding that all batches of milk to have tested positive for the chemical were being recalled. Grocery chains reacted to the news by withdrawing all liquid milk made by Mengniu from their shelves.  Stores in Hong Kong cleared their stores of the affected products. Yesterday, milk, yogurt, ice cream and other products made by the Yili Industrial Group Co were withdrawn. Meanwhile Starbucks said its 300 cafes in mainland China had withdrawn all milk supplied by Mengniu. Earlier this week, the Mengniu&apos;s chief executive officer, Niu Gensheng, vowed to create a clean dairy product market.

Thousands of worried parents and their children have filled hospitals in China since the scare began. Melamine, a toxic industrial chemical, can cause kidney stones and lead to kidney failure.  Suppliers of some milk products are believe to have tried to cut costs by adding the chemical to watered-down milk. Around 1,300 babies, mostly newborns, remain in hospital because of the contamination, with more than 150 suffering from acute kidney failure.

With the government now fully guaranteeing Fannie&apos;s and Freddie&apos;s debts, American taxpayers will have to pay for everything not covered by their creditors&apos; inadequate capital. Why are these bail-outs happening in the world&apos;s most avowedly capitalist country? Don&apos;t venerable capitalist principles imply that anyone who believed in the real estate bubble and who invested in Fannie and Freddie must accept their losses? Is it fair that innocent taxpayers must now pay for their mistakes? The answers to such questions would be obvious if the moral issues in the current financial crisis were clear-cut. But they are not. Most importantly, it is not clear that the bail-out will actually impose any net costs on US taxpayers, since it may prevent further systemic effects that bring down the financial sector and, with it, the world economy. Just because systemic effects are difficult to quantify does not mean that they are not real. The bonds issued by Fannie and Freddie were widely thought to carry an implicit US government guarantee. Even though there was no official guarantee, the US government&apos;s failure to come to the rescue could destroy confidence in government debt, and, by association, other financial paper as well. The issues go far beyond the US economy. The global economy has been driven in recent years by remarkable speculative asset booms and busts, which bring into the equation questions of confidence and trust, as well as fairness. Similar housing booms in many other countries are now ending, and they may face the pain \u2013 and the moral dilemmas \u2013 that the US economy is now experiencing. Moreover, housing markets are not the only issue. So are stock markets. The Shanghai Composite in China rose by a factor of five in real terms from 2005 to 2007, and then lost two-thirds of its real value. The Sensex in India rose by a factor of five in real terms over 2003 to 2007, and has since lost a third of its value. Similar stock market booms and busts have occurred in many other countries. While they lasted, the booms that preceded these busts caused these economies to overheat. Now that the booms have been reversed, a decline in confidence could engulf the world economy, throwing it into recession. To prevent that, some selective bail-outs will likely be needed, not to support the market but to deal with injustices. There is no accurate science of confidence, no way of knowing how people will react to a failure to help when markets collapse. People&apos;s reactions to these events depend on their emotions and their sense of justice. The booms and busts have caused great redistributions of wealth. People who bought into the stock market or housing market did either well or poorly, depending on their timing. People will judge the fairness of these outcomes in terms of what they were told, and what kinds of implicit promises they inferred. What were people in all these countries told about the markets in which they invested? Was it all really truthful? Unfortunately, there is no way to find out. Policymakers can provide only general responses, not deal with all cases individually. We do know that recent economic growth in many countries has been spectacular. But were investments in their markets oversold? Did cynical salespeople in these and other countries lead people to believe that the boom times would produce wealth for everyone? To be sure, while there may have been much &quot;cheap talk&quot; \u2013 general advice with disclaimers \u2013 most of the losers in this game are not starving. But we cannot blithely conclude that all the losses should be allowed to stand in full force. The gnawing problem is one of &quot;good faith.&quot; Economies prosper only on the perception that &quot;good faith&quot; exists. The current situation, in which speculative booms have driven the world economy \u2013 and, having collapsed, are now driving it into recession \u2013 suggests that there may have been a lot of bad faith by people promoting certain investments. Consider investors in Fannie and Freddie bonds. While the US government never officially promised to bail them out, it did create a special agency, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which was to assess their strength in an annual report. But this agency never even acknowledged that there was a housing bubble. Government leaders gave no warnings. So can we really say that investors must suffer the full consequences of any losses? How can this be fair? The world is discovering capitalism and its power to transform economies. But capitalism relies on good faith. A perception of unfair treatment can be deadly to economic growth, because it means that people will lose trust in businesses, and hence be less willing to offer to them their precious capital and labour. Is that outcome morally superior to a bail-out?

In Hardy&apos;s Wessex, however, as in anyone&apos;s anywhere, anytime, it was enough to have looks, and Gemma Arterton&apos;s Tess had them in more layers than her petticoat; more than enough, certainly, to please her sly mother, who sent her off by virtue of the dubious family connection to work her way into the d&apos;Urberville money. Enter - and my but he did, the bastard - Alec d&apos;Urberville, played with great floppy sneers and just the right amount of ham by Hans Matheson. To save time for those who haven&apos;t read the book, Matheson tells you within five seconds of his preening, lecherous, waistcoated first swagger around Tess, that he is a Bad &apos;Un. To dispel lingering doubts, the randy privileged young cockpocket is then shown being awful to his mum (Anna Massey, acting wonderfully but looking as if she herself had died at around the time of Hotel du Lac, which if true would make it great acting): a proud, forlorn, haunted cobweb of a woman, surrounded uselessly by riches and finches, hating her son. Much of this was wonderful. It lacks, so far, the bubbling, spirited humour of Cranford, but it is also less insipid than so much Austen. There are great dusks, great Wessex dusks; and dances above clifftops where the sun and sea and wind tug you into the screen: and then the light leaches from the picture, the light seems to leach from life itself, and suddenly we are in the shuddering midst of fog-bound rape. Arterton was more than pleasing: terribly subtle often, never more so than with the tiny stiffenings when she knows her shame is itself known, and she is excluded from the rest of the servants. If quibbles there were, it was that, even with allowances for her character&apos;s natural bearing, the camera was terribly kind. There were times, watching Tess, with her teeth and poise and just-so sweep of perfect borrowed gown, among hoi snaggle-toothed polloi, when it was sniggeringly reminiscent of that bit with the mud-farmers in Monty Python&apos;s Grail: &apos;How do you know he&apos;s the King?&apos; &apos;Cos he&apos;s the only one not covered in shit.&apos; But this works, often darkly beautifully; and, most importantly, it tells us that it&apos;s autumn again, with fine ways to save much money and look at many horses on lengthening Sunday nights. Money. Now we&apos;ve all got it, enough of it at least to not whore out our daughters just to buy a new horse and some more mud, but is it making us any happier today than it did poor rich finchy Madam D&apos;Urberville? The Hughes family of Canterbury had it: or at least enough for everyone to have mobile phones, and food (lashings of it, served up by the absurdly biddable father, Simon - he actually offers them all choices of European cuisines, like a menu; do all modern parents do this? In my and I&apos;m sure in Tess&apos;s day the only choice offered was eating indoors or outside, with the pigs) on the table, and to get endless taxis to clubs to annoy the parents. The Family is meant to be Channel 4&apos;s attempt to make up for its reptilian part in the tumescent rise of reality TV by going back to the genre&apos;s allegedly golden, innocent, roots: taking a &apos;normal&apos; family rather than huckstering sex-change lab-rats and filming them for 100 days. It says much for our generalised acceptance of the genre that the Hugheses, a normal enough family, are so easily comfortable with a record number of cameras on them; mainly on Simon and wife Jane and clubbing teen Emily. The results are, intermittently, intriguing. The perfect encapsulation, mainly, of the point-missing of so many parent-child arguments. Beckett, Pinter, Ionesco: no piece of fiction, still, has better caught the stilted waste of the act of repetitive argument than life manages itself, when you can listen. &apos;I&apos;m not trying to screw things up.&apos; &apos;Yes you are. And why are you going out again?&apos; &apos;Because I want to.&apos; &apos;Because you want to.&apos; Mother Jane interrupts daddy Simon - he&apos;s a daddy, not a father - at one point with a raised hand, to make a slightly better point to her recalcitrant daughter, and one of the billion cameras catches him taking the childish huff with her for that. He tries again, but - &apos;I&apos;ve heard mum. I&apos;ve listened, heard it, twice, you don&apos;t need to repeat it.&apos; &apos;Yes I do.&apos; There is much epic point-missing going on. It&apos;s like watching a game of tennis between Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder. Whether it will hold the attention for the full series is the killer. Already, Emily is being portrayed by some parts of the press as some kind of devil-child. She&apos;s not. She&apos;s a teenager, living a little too long at home. There were winning hugs, scenes, dancings, between her and mother Jane, herself part of the problem, wincing with childish pouts over the last steps on the stony track to 40. The series credits two &apos;Hot Head operators&apos;, which we will assume is some new kind of mini-camera but looked for a second as if someone had thought cynically of creating a jobshare just to ratchet up the tantrum count. Oh, we&apos;ll get them, more of them, as this trundles on: but, I suspect, nothing like the showdowns in the more manufactured &apos;reality&apos; shows of the last few years. Whether we have now lowered the bar so low that viewers will switch off without helpings of misogyny, racism, hatred and chemical dysfunction is the question: if so it&apos;ll be a shame, for this is an admirable project in that it does, fairly honestly, as did the original Family in 1974, tell us things about the way we live today, if only that in many households the parents are now younger than the children.  Danny and Shay, the likeable scallies, came into some money in the opener of Massive, and promptly started their own record label. Cue a succession of auditions: the loopy, the hidden diamond, the of course hopeless. It&apos;s a winning device, done in everything from The Commitments to Shallow Grave, which rather begs the question: why do it again, without even the big budget? But the whole thing actually grows on you, and scampers about perfectly for young things waiting on a Saturday night to go out (as we&apos;d learnt from Emily, above, they don&apos;t go out now till 11. When did that start happening?) and there are plenty of I&apos;m sure brilliant musical jokes which it&apos;s probably my fault for not enjoying more by virtue of being a) 83 years old and b) not from Manchester. Most pointless eight hours of the week - the programme may have been shorter than that by a couple of minutes but it didn&apos;t feel like it - was the insultingly so-what Dispatches purporting to shock by telling you What&apos;s In Your Wine. It opened with a later much-featured shot of a razor blade on a blob of earth on a vineyard in Champagne, and the hectoring tones of Jane Moore, who failed quite laughingly to convince us to have something more to be worried about. This pretended that we needed more labelling telling us precisely what mix of grape juice, water, sugar and tannins are in our plonk. Sure, some wines are a touch diddled about with along the way, but it&apos;s nothing compared to the confected outrage which shoutingly underpinned this dreary piece of finger-wagging. It turned out (doubtless to the crew&apos;s disappointment) that the number of people killed every year by additives in wine totals none. Count them: none. Number of people killed by alcohol: oh, quite a lot more than none. It&apos;s the alcohol, that&apos;s the problem with wine, and we&apos;ve always known there are tannins and the like because they give us hangovers. I still don&apos;t know why to be worried about the razor blade. Did it somehow sneak into a grape? Do you think, Jane, that people who drink champagne wouldn&apos;t notice if they were suddenly cutting their tongue open?  Just what we needed this week, something to tell us we were all stupid, couldn&apos;t trust anyone (even to help us drown our sorrows) and were being conned out of our money. Sometimes, of course, the more money we have the more it simply gives us to worry about. Maybe it was all better before we metaphorically left Tess&apos;s hovel, when all we needed for happiness was a horse, a beach, and mud, and dancing, and no sharp noses asking what&apos;s in your mead.  \u00b7 Kathryn Flett is away Meet the new boss: A star is born Main surprise with the just-returned Question Time, other than that someone (the Gothically unforgiving Ian Hislop) could actually make you feel sorry for Harriet Harman*, was the star-is-born moment when you realise you&apos;re watching someone who should be fronting his own programme.

The chancellor made the commitments ahead of his appearance at the Labour party conference this lunchtime. In his keynote speech, he warned that the UK economy faces &quot;very uncertain times&quot;, but insisted that Labour would help stabilise the financial system and stop the crisis escalating. &quot;We are on a difficult road and there will be, I am afraid, bumps along the way,&quot; said Darling. &quot;The first priority is to stabilise the banking system. If we don&apos;t the whole world economy is at risk.&quot; Earlier today, the chancellor admitted that the economic slowdown means the government will probably have to borrow more to balance the books, but promised that he will not raise the basic rate of income tax, which is currently 20p in the pound. &quot;We have a manifesto commitment on the basic rate of tax, and it is one that I intend to stick to,&quot; Darling pledged in an interview on the BBC&apos;s Today programme.

Pay and taxation are likely to be central themes at the Labour party conference this week, with some leftwingers pushing for a new 45% tax band for individuals earning more than \u00a3175,000 a year, which could fund tax cuts for other workers. Tomorrow, the prime minister will attempt to reinvigorate his premiership with his own speech to the conference. He is expected to make financial turmoil a key theme, calling for better regulation at home and abroad to avoid a repeat of the mistakes that led to the credit crunch. The latest opinion polls indicate that the government is heading for a wipeout at the next election, but Darling insisted that the cabinet was still united behind Brown. &quot;All of us know that it is important that Gordon tomorrow sets out his vision of what the Labour government and the Labour party stands for - the difference that having our government as opposed to a Tory government will make to the country,&quot; he told the BBC. &quot;Many people have had their criticisms but Gordon knows where he stands. He is a man of conviction, and also a man of considerable resolution.

The scandal, which began when dozens of babies suffered kidney stones and even kidney failure after drinking a popular brand that contained the chemical melamine, has since spread to more than 20 companies and affected products including fresh milk, yoghurt and ice-cream.  Countries across Asia are checking imported dairy products from China. Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong have already banned or recalled a variety of milk products. Taiwan banned all mainland dairy products on Sunday. In Hong Kong Nestl\u00e9, the world&apos;s largest food company, said it had recalled a UHT pure milk product after a local food watchdog discovered samples containing a tiny amount of the chemical melamine.  Worried Hong Kong parents also took their children for health checks, after the government announced that a three-year-old girl who had drunk a melamine-laced milk product had a kidney stone. She did not show serious symptoms and was discharged without medication or surgery. The Japanese government has asked 90,000 companies to check whether imports have been contaminated with melamine, and the country&apos;s Marudai Food Co has withdrawn buns made with milk supplied by one of the Chinese companies involved, Yili Industrial Group.  In China anxious parents are queueing at hospitals to have their babies examined. The government has promised free treatment, but some families are concerned about costs and long-term complications.  Four infants are believed to have died from the toxic formula and 104 are in serious condition, the health ministry said. It added that 1,500 had already left hospital and nearly 40,000 with milder symptoms had received clinical treatment and advice before going home. The ministry had previously reported that 6,200 children were ill, with 1,300 in hospital. It did not explain the sharp rise in numbers. The head of China&apos;s quality watchdog, Li Changjiang, stepped down with the approval of the cabinet, the state news agency Xinhua reported. His agency is responsible for ensuring that China&apos;s food supply chain is safe.  Premier Wen Jiabao threatened harsh punishment for culprits as he toured hospitals in Beijing. &quot;Although the ordinary people are very understanding, as the government we feel very guilty,&quot; he said, according to Xinhua. &quot;This event is a warning for all food safety.&quot;  The head of Sanlu, the company at the heart of the baby milk scandal, has already been arrested after being sacked. Several farmers have also been held. City officials in Shijiazhuang, where Sanlu is based, were also sacked, with a senior provincial official saying they knew of the problem for over a month without taking action - only telling Beijing once the Olympics were over. Melamine, often used to make plastics, artificially boosts apparent protein levels in tests. That creates an incentive for farmers producing substandard milk to add the substance. China&apos;s food quality watchdog has said it found melamine in nearly 10% of milk and drinking yoghurt samples from three dairy companies, Mengniu, Yili and the Bright group. To date, no illnesses have been reported from melamine in other dairy products. Tests on infant formula from other producers also found that while melamine was present in batches from a fifth of China&apos;s dairy producers, the levels were far lower than in the case of Sanlu.  But fear has spread rapidly among consumers, and the Chinese ministry of agriculture said despairing farmers were dumping milk and killing cattle after companies stopped buying their supplies. It promised subsidies to help struggling cattle farmers. Starbucks in China has started serving soya milk rather than dairy with its coffee. The government promised to tighten its safety regime after a number of product scandals which exposed corruption, bureaucratic inertia and cost-cutting producers.  But China&apos;s dairy producers face a crisis of confidence that will only be cured by strong action, said Lao Bing, manager of a Shanghai-based dairy investment company.  &quot;Consumers will start rebuying in a month or two if they feel sure the government is undertaking a vigorous clean-up,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;Exports will take longer.

HBOS was the biggest faller on the index, tumbling nearly 14% to 180.2p, while Lloyds TSB was down 4.8% at 261.75p, cutting the value of its all-share offer for HBOS. Royal Bank of Scotland lost 5.9% to 203.25p, and shares in the beleaguered buy-to-let lender Bradford &amp; Bingley slumped 12.4% to 24.75p. The steep falls in banking shares came after the latest monthly data from the British Bankers&apos; Association showed mortgage approvals in Britain plunged 64% to a record low, as the housing market ground to a halt. Just 21,086 people took out loans to purchase homes last month. Howard Archer at Global Insight described the figures as a &quot;really dismal set of mortgage data&quot;. The slump in mortgage approvals revived worries that HBOS&apos;s takeover by Lloyds may not solve its funding problems. Lloyds is offering 0.83 of its shares for each HBOS share. Analysts said there was also an outside risk that shareholders would reject the Lloyds offer, which needs 75% approval.  Alex Potter at Collins Stewart said: &quot;If funding markets normalise, this business could look marginally cheap. If they remain frozen well into 2009 &apos;new Lloyds&apos; could react a lot like &apos;old HBOS&apos;.&quot;  Global stocks had rallied on Friday when the rescue plan, drawn up by US treasury secretary Henry Paulson, was announced. But as in Asia overnight, the mood in Europe was negative today as the US dollar weakened and stocks on Wall Street suffered another tailspin yesterday.  The Bush administration&apos;s bail-out package, which would allow the US treasury to buy toxic mortgage debts from crisis-stricken firms, is awaiting congressional approval which could drag into next week. Critics are concerned that the plan will push up the national debt, further weakening the already fragile US economy. &quot;There are still a lot of question marks on the bail-out plan and the longer it takes to be approved, the more doubts the market will have,&quot; said Gerard Rigby, an energy consultant in Sydney. Amid growing uncertainty, the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 3.3% to 11,015.69 last night. It was up 65 points this afternoon as Paulson and Bernanke appeared before the Senate banking committee to discuss their plan. Fears over the bail-out are also weighing on the dollar. Analysts at UBS said the uncertainty &quot;will keep the dollar on the back foot for now&quot;.  Against the yen, the dollar fell to a low of \u00a5105.17 today. The euro hit a high of $1.4826 against the dollar, while the pound bought $1.8527 this morning. Sue Trinh, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Sydney, said: &quot;What&apos;s weighing on the dollar is the question of how it will ultimately be financed.

The Brazilian&apos;s winning prospects here were destroyed by a botched stop on the 18th lap which left him trailing his refuelling hose when he tried to exit the pit too early. Ferrari said last night that they would review their electronic pit-stop light system. &quot;We were not using the electronic system, it was run manually,&quot; said the team director, Stefano Domenicali. &quot;When there are a lot of cars coming into the pit in a safety-car situation it is better to have [the system working manually]. You control the green light, and unfortunately there was a mistake. We will analyse what we did in the other pit stops.&quot;  Domenicali said there was no question of the mechanic responsible for Sunday&apos;s incident being replaced for the remaining three races. &quot;We win together and we lose together. In that respect the philosophy will not change because of one unfortunate mistake.&quot;  Massa said he had spoken to the mechanic and told him there were no hard feelings. &quot;I&apos;m not the kind of guy who goes to the guy and fights with him. So I go to the guy and give him even more motivation because we need him and we need everybody together for the last three races.&quot; The Brazilian&apos;s consolation is that he has to battle only Hamilton and not his own team-mate Raikkonen for the title. &quot;The pressures of trying to win a world championship in a season when it&apos;s pretty obvious that the contest is going all the way to the wire can be really nerve-racking,&quot; said Niki Lauda, who knows about two-horse races - in 1976 he lost the title to James Hunt by a single point and eight years later he won it by the smallest-ever margin of half a point from his McLaren team-mate Alain Prost. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter whether your key rival is a team-mate or not, you just have to concentrate and keep your focus. When I was racing Alain in &apos;84 he arrived at the start of the season and tried to take over what many people saw as my team through the expedient of driving harder, faster and more effectively than me. &quot;In a situation like that it is very difficult to keep your mind on the job, but the way you have to approach it is to maximise your own potential while at the same time exploiting your rival&apos;s weak points. With Alain I could see that he was braver and more committed than I was prepared to be in qualifying, squeezing through gaps in traffic which I wasn&apos;t prepared to risk. So the only way I was going to beat him was through my experience.  &quot;In the case of Lewis and Felipe they are both relatively new to formula one so it will just come down to a test of nerve and consistency between the two of them.&quot; Jody Scheckter, who won the 1979 world championship in a straight fight with his Ferrari team-mate Gilles Villeneuve, stressed the importance of shrugging off the pressure. &quot;Gilles was braver than me and prepared to take more risks,&quot; he said. &quot;But he also made a few mistakes, dropping wheels over kerbs and so on. I knew I could bring more consistency to the job, but it was a question of not letting the pressure get to me. I was always confident I could do it, though.&quot; Two-horse races that went to the wire Mike Hawthorn 1958 The driver from Farnham became Britain&apos;s first world champion after driving his Ferrari to second place in Casablanca behind Stirling Moss, taking the title by a single point.

In a grim trading update, M&amp;S said like-for-like sales in the UK fell by 6.1% in the last three months, piling more pressure on its beleaguered executive chairman, Sir Stuart Rose. The retailer, which has more than 600 British stores and 21 million customers a week, said total UK sales, which includes new store openings, were down 1.6% in the 13 weeks to September 13, with clothing sales falling 3.5%. Group sales edged up 0.4%. &quot;Consumer confidence remains fragile and the retail environment unpredictable,&quot; said Rose. &quot;Consumers are increasingly cautious about their budgets. We have responded by offering our customers better values and more promotions across the business, while at the same time tightly controlling our costs.&quot; UK like-for-like food sales dropped 5.9% while general merchandise - clothing and homewares - fell 6.4%. With a recession looming, M&amp;S has been struggling as consumers are trading down, while Aldi, Lidl, Asda and Morrisons are all doing well. M&amp;S fired its head of food Steven Esom in July, who had joined from Waitrose just over a year earlier. Ian Dyson, the finance director, said Waitrose was also struggling as consumers trade down. &quot;We have suffered to a certain extent from that, as have others like Waitrose. Aldi and Lidl have benefited as a result.&quot; To stem the slide in food sales, M&amp;S has launched a new autumn advertising campaign fronted by the Only Fools and Horses star Sir David Jason, replacing its long-running &quot;This is not just food&quot; commercials. The retailer has also started selling branded food products alongside its M&amp;S own-label ranges and launched a budget line. Some analysts suggest Rose could be forced to leave the company earlier than his scheduled 2011 departure date if he does not improve performance. The company issued a shock profits warning in July, just two months after annual profits topped \u00a31bn for the first time in a decade.  Rose incurred the wrath of major shareholders when he was elevated from chief executive to executive chairman and faced down an investor revolt at the retailer&apos;s annual meeting in mid-July when more than 20% of investors failed to back his promotion.  The only bright spots in today&apos;s trading update were a 34% jump in online sales and a 24.2% rise in international sales. M&amp;S hopes to break China The results coincide with the opening of M&amp;S&apos;s first store in mainland China \u2013 its largest shop in Asia.  &quot;Whatever the situation in the UK \u2013 and I think we are competing very, very strongly \u2013 there is a fantastic opportunity for us to grow internationally,&quot; said Carl Leaver, international strategy director and tipped as a potential successor to Rose. &quot;For us it&apos;s not about the situation in the UK , but in isolation from other things it is a great opportunity to grow internationally that is relatively low risk for investors.&quot; Speaking outside the store in Shanghai , shortly before the release of the figures, he added: &quot;We didn&apos;t start planning this when the domestic market was challenging; it&apos;s part of a long-term plan to grow our international business.  &quot;This means our earnings over a period of time are less affected by any single market.

But he made it clear that it expected returns within a few years and that more outlets would follow, with the company hoping to open in Beijing within two years.

Frozen Yorkshire puddings, on the other hand, have been in short supply in Shanghai. That changed yesterday morning when Marks and Spencer opened the doors of its first store on the Chinese mainland. They closed again minutes later, as customers eager for their first glimpse of a 124-year-old British institution threatened to overwhelm the four-floor emporium on fashionable Nanjing West Road. But with 370 sq metres (4,000 sq ft) of retail space, queuing expatriate and Chinese consumers soon had their chance to stock up on rich tea biscuits and cotton socks. &quot;It&apos;s the moment I&apos;ve been waiting for,&quot; said business consultant Paul McCarthy, grabbing a 49 yuan (\u00a34) fish and chips ready meal and lauding the firm&apos;s rhubarb crumble. While homesick Brits are a boon to the business, the company&apos;s real target is the fast-expanding Chinese middle class.

But clothing is skewed towards smaller sizes and mainland customers at the company&apos;s 10 Hong Kong stores have offered other valuable hints in tailoring the range. For her: confectionery and savoury snacks. For him: cotton polo shirts. Biscuits and pasta proved universally popular yesterday, though clothing scored more highly with older women than fashion-forward shoppers. Clutching a box of cherry liqueur chocolates, Chen Shuhao praised the food range and the company&apos;s heritage. But the 19-year-old student - sporting skinny cardigan, Converse trainers and a diamante-buckle belt - could see little to add to his wardrobe as he gazed through bug-eye glasses. &quot;It&apos;s more for white-collar workers,&quot; he observed. Li Rui, who works in advertising, judged the fashion mediocre. &quot;Menswear is okay but with women&apos;s the sizes are too big and the style too mature for 20-30-year-olds,&quot; he said. Another shopper said that the company&apos;s famed underwear included too few padded bras for Chinese women, who appreciate more support than their European sisters. Richard Sweet, managing director in China, accepted that Shanghai was &quot;awash&quot; with clothing stores and European brands, but he was confident that innovation - from machine-washable cashmere to GM-free snacks - would help the firm stand out. So too should service and quality, maximising the &quot;halo effect&quot; of the brand&apos;s origins. &quot;In China an element of Britishness is being trusted - being seen as honourable people who do what we say,&quot; he added. &quot;British packaged foods have premium quality compared to Chinese foods,&quot; confirmed Zhang Ailing, as she inspected a haddock pie. &quot;I&apos;d like to visit Britain one day and now we have a British store I can get a sliver of British style here. My family has a pretty good income so I prefer to have a premium life style.&quot; Sweet said that Shanghai customers demand good prices as well as quality. Although 30% of the non-food lines are made in China, most have to be re-imported for licensing reasons. The firm is absorbing the ensuing taxes to generate volume and position itself as a mid-market retailer. That sacrifice does not guarantee success. An earlier venture in Taiwan failed and shareholders will be crossing their fingers for growth here as the credit crunch hits Europe. But as Rita Hayworth once observed, you need more than luck in Shanghai. &quot;Today I&apos;m a hero, but it&apos;s ephemeral fame,&quot; acknowledged Sweet. &quot;Let&apos;s see what this store is doing on day 200.&quot;", "tags": ["Marks & Spencer", "Retail industry", "Supermarkets", "China", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-02T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/oct/03/television.biography", "sentences": ["He secretly joined the Campaign for Homosexual Equality - &quot;sweethearts&quot;, says O&apos;Grady now - before flouncing off wearing backcombed dyed red hair and reeking of musk to scandalous parties with sailors in Liverpool&apos;s docks, for which he earned the nickname &quot;Shanghai Lil&quot;, one of many precursors to Lily Savage.", "If I ran a brothel in Shanghai she wouldn&apos;t have minded as long as I had a pension.&quot; What happened next?"], "title": "Patrick Barkham on Paul O'Grady", "article": "Death. Something that has been dug up. A character from The Exorcist. There are several dark and not terribly alive things that Paul O&apos;Grady says he resembles. Last night was the launch party for his autobiography, and the chatshow host and man once better known as Lily Savage is croaky from dancing on tables in the West End until the early hours. &quot;It was only Caf\u00e9 de Paris. It was hardly an opium parlour. It was members of The Bill and EastEnders and 60s Tiller Girls and Immodesty Blaize the stripper and Jilly Cooper. It was just fabulous.&quot; Elegant and sun-repellent in his white trousers and pale striped shirt, O&apos;Grady, who is 53 and has survived two heart attacks, looks less like death warmed up than someone from a Graham Greene novel. &quot;I don&apos;t know about Graham Greene. More like an elderly hooker,&quot; he says. There is a ferocious energy, a desire to entertain and find entertainment, about O&apos;Grady even on a very bright morning after a very late night. The cheesy cover picture and gold lettering of At My Mother&apos;s Knee ... and Other Low Joints makes O&apos;Grady&apos;s book appear just another ghostwritten celebrity yarn, in this case, presumably, about Lily&apos;s late flowering followed by O&apos;Grady&apos;s starry times dining at the Ivy with Cilla and Dale and thrashing Richard &amp; Judy in the teatime chatshow ratings war. O&apos;Grady, however, has tapped out with his own two fingers a vivid and astonishingly detailed tale of growing up in working-class Birkenhead, where he was born, &quot;the last kick of a dying horse&quot;, 11 years after his sister, to Molly, the eldest of the Savage girls, and Patrick, a quiet Irishman who worked at the oil refinery in Ellesmere Port. Uncharacteristically, the young O&apos;Grady barely gets a word in edgeways in the first 100 pages as he depicts a world dominated by Molly and her formidable sister, Aunty Chris, a single mother and Marlene Dietrich lookalike with &quot;a mouth like a bee&apos;s arse&quot; (it stung) who could &quot;kipper a net curtain just by walking past it&quot;. (O&apos;Grady loves smokers and smoking. &quot;It kills me that I had to give up,&quot; he says. &quot;Like darts players, smokers are the nicest people you want to meet.&quot;) In O&apos;Grady&apos;s early 60s childhood, women stood on doorsteps and tapped their feet as they hurled accusations such as &quot;you&apos;ve been titivating yourself&quot; at each other. His mum and Aunty Chris &quot;would go from perfectly nice ladies to harpies&quot;, he says. &quot;I was very much aware that my mother wasn&apos;t the norm. She&apos;d go in a shop and deliberately say, &apos;Is that ham fresh?&apos; to start a bit of verbal. If somebody was swearing at a bus stop she&apos;d go over and say, &apos;Do you mind? There&apos;s a lady present.&apos;&quot; It is not hard to see where O&apos;Grady&apos;s own wit comes from. &quot;Comedy, your funny bone, is formed in childhood,&quot; he says. &quot;Every adult I met was like something from a movie. Everybody from the milkman to the coalman were characters.&quot; It may be a cliche but Merseyside is &quot;not like anywhere else in the country. The women are a completely different breed to women anywhere else in the world.&quot; O&apos;Grady grew up in a small, damp council house where the toilet water froze in winter. The house had two plug sockets, and on his 18th birthday his parents got another fitted on the landing so he could play records in his bedroom. He could have turned this into a sob story, but instead O&apos;Grady creates an unforgiving and unflattering portrait of an attention-seeking and heartlessly good-looking boy who, in the words of one of his Christian Brother teachers, was &quot;born to trouble as the sparks fly upward&quot;. O&apos;Grady had crazes - altar boy, the marines, boxing - but never settled on anything. &quot;I always felt that there was a fabulous party going on somewhere and I wasn&apos;t going to it. I always thought there was something better out there and I didn&apos;t realise at the time the party was going on under my nose at home,&quot; he says. His mother and father saw O&apos;Grady&apos;s sexual confusion as just another phase. &quot;One minute I was drooling over the girl who worked in the hairdressers on Church Road. The next I was eyeing up the window cleaner,&quot; he writes. He had a crush on Tara King from The Avengers and would also have secretive &quot;necking&quot; sessions with an older boy. He saw the film Gypsy on TV - his first taste of burlesque - and discovered Barbra Streisand on the radio. He secretly joined the Campaign for Homosexual Equality - &quot;sweethearts&quot;, says O&apos;Grady now - before flouncing off wearing backcombed dyed red hair and reeking of musk to scandalous parties with sailors in Liverpool&apos;s docks, for which he earned the nickname &quot;Shanghai Lil&quot;, one of many precursors to Lily Savage. As a teenager he tentatively told his mother he was gay. She replied, &quot;Gay me arse&quot; and banned the topic of conversation. Molly died shortly before O&apos;Grady found fame with Lily. Was that teenage moment the closest he ever got to coming out to her? &quot;She did know but she&apos;d turn a blind eye,&quot; he says. &quot;She used to say, &apos;He&apos;s out tomcatting it.&apos; In fairness to her, I never really sat her down and confronted her and said, &apos;Look mother, these are the facts.&apos; So we both skirted round it. The less said, soonest mended was our family code. A lot of taboos were swept under the carpet.&quot; The book ends with the 18-year-old O&apos;Grady being blamed by his mother for his father&apos;s death and facing impending fatherhood himself. He makes light of his Catholic guilt. &quot;It&apos;s not because it&apos;s an old wound I don&apos;t want to expose. That was how my mother was. I&apos;m the same. I look for someone to blame at the time of a crisis. So she would say, &apos;This is you, this.&apos;&quot; He was, he says, &quot;a terrible disappointment&quot; to his mother and father at the time. &quot;Hopefully if they were around now they would be delighted. My mother wouldn&apos;t have cared if you were a white slaver as long as you had a decent wage coming in. If I ran a brothel in Shanghai she wouldn&apos;t have minded as long as I had a pension.&quot; What happened next? O&apos;Grady did actually work in a bar in a Manila brothel and then as a social worker in Camden, living in a council flat until he was 40, when his evening labours playing his alter ego paid off. Lily Savage became the embodiment of gay subculture&apos;s move into mainstream media after stints at the Edinburgh Festival and a slot on Channel 4&apos;s The Big Breakfast. He will tell all this, and sate tabloid appetites for stories about his &quot;secret&quot; daughter (they are now close), and &quot;lesbian marriage&quot; (a marriage of convenience for a good friend), in subsequent volumes. &quot;I see it like Lord of the bloody Rings, some sort of awful, never-ending, long-winded trilogy until people say, &apos;He hasn&apos;t got another sodding book has he? When&apos;s he going to die so we can end this bloody series?&apos;&quot; Four years ago, O&apos;Grady made the unlikely switch from being a foul-mouthed comic in drag playing a middle-aged prostitute to chatshow host. With a backstory worthy of her own volume, Lily was retired to a convent in Brittany. He &quot;couldn&apos;t bear&quot; to kill her off. Would he ever bring her back? &quot;No. No. No. I don&apos;t know. Do you know what it is? It&apos;s the dressing up. I hate it. I absolutely hate it. I was in panto doing the wicked queen and I came out on a chaise longue and I took one look in the mirror and Myra Hindley was staring back at me. My line was, &apos;I&apos;m the most beautiful creature on the planet&apos; and I thought, I can&apos;t do this any more.&quot; For someone so sharp-tongued who talks of his appetite for danger, it seems a paradox that O&apos;Grady has found such success as a housewives&apos; favourite and teatime chatshow host, transferring his winning mix of animals, children and celebrity chat from ITV to Channel 4. The audience love his - relative - unpredictability, he reckons. &quot;They know there&apos;s a dark side,&quot; he says. &quot;They are waiting for you to go off, pop. They expect me to kick off. So I always oblige.&quot; He still &quot;adores&quot; panto - &quot;You do a scene. Blackout. And off you run into the wings and you&apos;re with a man dressed as a cat. And somebody dressed as the huntsman, and there&apos;s seven little men about to come on, and you&apos;ve got a girl of 32 pretending to be 16-year-old Snow White&quot; - but the bureaucracy and risk-averse political correctness of television gets him ranting. O&apos;Grady is contemptuous of TV shows such as Strictly Come Dancing. &quot;I get things like, &apos;Brucie&apos;s going to retire, we want you to take over.&apos; I don&apos;t want to take over. It&apos;s just a gang of people dancing and you say, &apos;There was so-and-so and so-and-so doing the pasodoble, let&apos;s see what our judges think,&apos; and you stand back while they rip them to shreds when really Lily is rising up like bile and you want to lean over and say, &apos;Come on you shower of clattery old ghosts, let&apos;s see you do it.&apos; What is Australia&apos;s export at the moment? Bitchy judges on talent shows?&quot; He barely pauses for breath. Besides, the BBC is &quot;like the Home Office,&quot; he says. &quot;You get in there and it&apos;s like Harry Potter&apos;s Death Eaters have sucked the essence out of you.&quot; Instead, he&apos;s founded his own production company, named after his youngest dog, Olga, which is more like &quot;Mussolini&apos;s Italy&quot; or a sweatshop. He likes to holler, &quot;Come along girls, get back to your machines,&quot; at the trendy TV types behind their computers. O&apos;Grady enjoys the company of his showbiz pals, although those legendary lunches at the Ivy are exaggerated and he hasn&apos;t seen Dale Winton for five years. He is good friends with Cilla Black and Christopher Biggins, and pops round to see Julian Clary, who is a neighbour in Kent and has a house &quot;as serene as Canterbury cathedral&quot;, he says. &quot;I like people who don&apos;t do self-censorship. I like people who aren&apos;t bothered if they are seen in a nightclub, drunk. As long as you&apos;re not doing crack off a premature baby&apos;s skull you&apos;re all right as far as I&apos;m concerned.&quot; Despite this comic outrageousness, O&apos;Grady excels at a subtle kind of self-censorship. All the intricately remembered details of his autobiography conceal just how little he reveals of how he feels. In this interview, he deflects every personal question with amusing quips and anecdotes.  TV is a job, he says, but he flinches when he walks past an advert for his book on a bus stop featuring his grinning face. He doesn&apos;t do awards ceremonies, adverts or interviews at home with Hello! &quot;You&apos;re not going to come in and photograph me and do the cheesy spread - Paul with his grandson and his daughter. I&apos;d die,&quot; he says with real vehemence. &quot;I&apos;d sooner be horsewhipped. Seriously.&quot; Perhaps most strikingly, when Brendan Murphy, his boyfriend of 25 years, who died of cancer in 2005, is introduced in his autobiography, he is referred to only as O&apos;Grady&apos;s &quot;manager&quot;. Why? &quot;He&apos;s in the dressing room. He&apos;s not on stage yet. And when he comes on stage ... I hate the word lover, I&apos;m not French. Partner, life partner, I hate all that. Boyfriend is the word. Me fella. I can&apos;t just write &apos;my fella Murphy&apos; so I&apos;ve given him a name &apos;my manager&apos; until I&apos;m ready to make him a central figure and show what sort of relationship we had.&quot; The armour, he claims, &quot;is starting to crack&quot; the more he writes but he shies away from the writing-as-therapy cliche. &quot;Do you know what my fear is? Being mawkish,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&apos;m about to step out. It&apos;s become so addictive.&quot; Testing this new willingness to open up, I ask if he has a boyfriend now. &quot;He was actually a friend of Brendan&apos;s who helped me look after him. He&apos;d never been to New York so to thank him I said, &apos;I&apos;ll take you on holiday.&apos;&quot; Stupidly, I interrupt to ask about his recent trip to Las Vegas, which invites O&apos;Grady to swerve the personal with another entertaining rant. &quot;I hated Las Vegas. When they said look at the &apos;Eiffel Tower&apos;, it was without a sense of irony or camp. They were proud of this plastic monstrosity. I felt like standing in the middle of the corridor screaming, &apos;Everything&apos;s fake, this is not real plaster, it&apos;s chipboard.&apos;&quot; Then, a surprising thing happens. Unprompted, O&apos;Grady finishes the question about his private life. The holiday to America with the man who became his new boyfriend came &quot;about six months after Murphy died. I worried people because I carried on with business as usual,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s like being in the eye of a tornado. You go through a great force, yet you can&apos;t hear anything and there is all this life and activity around you and yet you are quite numb,&quot; he says. &quot;So the last thing on me mind was a relationship. I had no sexual desire whatsoever. I did the show, smiled, patted the dog, was nice to all the celebs, went home, lived in a cocoon. Then we went to the States and God knows what happened. Next thing you know you&apos;re in the sack together. And he&apos;s a sweet lad, Andre. He&apos;s younger than me, which has never bothered me, because I&apos;ve always had younger friends. I&apos;ve got friends of all ages. And I&apos;m not hopping into bed with somebody of 53 and that&apos;s bloody flat.

The Serb, now up 5-3 in their head-to-head match-ups, lost a hard-fought first set in the tiebreak, but came back to take the second with a single break of serve. In the final set, she beat the American handily, breaking serve on match point to complete the win. Petrova advanced with a 6-4 6-4 victory over Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. Petrova, the 2006 Stuttgart champion, caught Azarenka cold at the start of the match, building a 4-0 lead before her opponent fought back. Azarenka recovered one of those breaks and had Petrova under pressure again in her next service game, only for two huge aces to get the Russian out of trouble. After an exchange of breaks, Petrova took control of the second set when she moved 4-3 up with serve and that advantage proved enough to carry her to victory in 90 minutes.

At 24 yuan (\u00a32) for a small 250ml carton, Feifan - meaning &apos;uncommonly good&apos; - costs several times as much as cow&apos;s milk. &apos;It&apos;s very natural, green, pure and high-quality. That&apos;s our big selling point - we aim at the high-end market,&apos; said Ding Pengcheng of the Treasure of the Plateau Yak Milk Company. Over the next three years, the firm is to spend millions to crack the domestic and international markets, with the help of state investment. Yaks produce fewer than 300 litres of milk a year, while cows yield 35 times as much. The firm pays Tibetan farmers 16 yuan or more per litre; eight times the price of standard milk. The China Nutrition Society, a Ministry of Health-backed research institute, claims the amino acids, calcium, and vitamin A in yak milk are considerably higher than in cow&apos;s milk. Its appeal depends as much on the mystique of its origins as its nutritional qualities. Feifan is undergoing extra safety checks because of China&apos;s recent milk contamination scandal. Yet in the long run such concerns could boost the desire for products that combine modern hygiene with unsullied, back-to-the-land imagery. Tsering Droma is a typical Tibetan herder who can now look forward to tapping the Chinese market. Born into a herding family, she tends 30 yaks on steep slopes near the Karola pass.  The animals are central to Tibetan culture: their butter is melted into tea and fuels the lamps that light monasteries. Dung keeps fires burning; bones are carved into beads. Yaks provide Droma and her family with everything they need. &apos;Female yaks are very important to us: we can get milk, make butter and cheese and get extra money by selling it. For the males, they can be used for transport,&apos; she said. &apos;We can sell the yak skins and the meat and hair. All the parts can be sold. Then we buy things like grain.&apos; But 100 miles away in Lhasa, the Treasure of the Plateau company is transforming this hand-to-mouth livelihood into a serious business. It is marketing the traditional staple as a superfood for aspirational middle-class households across China and beyond. Steam seeps from the pipes of its Tetrapak production line as it heats gallon after gallon of milk to 130C. In 2003, the firm sold just over 2m yuans worth of goods; this year it is on course to bring in up to 90m yuan. Each day the local market consumes between three and six tonnes of its yoghurt. The company&apos;s first batches of milk arrived in bowls, carried on herders&apos; backs, and often with the unwelcome additions of insects and yak hair. Now they come in clean containers, usually delivered by motorbike or car - proof, says the company, that it is raising local incomes. That does not make it immune from controversy surrounding economic development. Its expansion into markets around China would be all but impossible without the Tibet-Qinghai rail line, which critics say has damaged the environment and speeded the erosion of Tibetan culture. Seventy per cent of the firm&apos;s 110 staff are Tibetan, but only a few are in senior posts. &apos;Our company carries out a lot of training for our Tibetan staff, but most of them don&apos;t have higher, college-level education,&apos; Ding said. At the least, the company, and the government money behind it, are supporting long-impoverished herders. The authorities have been heavily criticised for forcibly settling nomads. But this state investment is helping some to increase their incomes without having to abandon their heritage. It is what officials call &apos;development with Tibetan characteristics&apos;. And yaks are as Tibetan as they come.", "tags": ["China", "Food", "Tibet", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-04T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/05/formulaone.motorsports", "sentences": ["The Mount Fuji and Shanghai circuits, both purpose-built, will have an anticlimactic feel after the buzz provided by the landmark event last weekend."], "title": "Formula one: Ferrari president's men play the clowns in Singapore's night circus", "article": "The Marquis Luca Cordero di Montezemolo has never been reluctant to utilise an aristocratic background and his status as president of Fiat and Ferrari. The former lawyer will frequently call upon his multilingual eloquence in the knowledge that the Italian media will be eager to record every syllable. Di Montezemolo&apos;s utterances are worth listening to, if not for their content then for the passionate and captivating style of delivery. His comments usually flow like the uplifting fine wine that accompanies a Ferrari dinner, but his review of last Sunday&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix smacked of sour grapes. Di Montezemolo was alone among team patrons when he heavily criticised a brilliantly executed and novel event. That should be no surprise, because the head of Ferrari failed to witness at first hand Formula One&apos;s inaugural night race within a community bending over backwards to make a brave gamble succeed. &apos;Unfortunately, when we race on tracks where staging a circus or something else would be better, anything can happen, because the spectacle is supplied by the safety car,&apos; Di Montezemolo said. &apos;This is humiliating for F1.&apos; Correction: it was deeply humiliating for Ferrari. It is ironic that Di Montezemolo should refer to a circus when, in fact, his team provided a pit-stop spectacle that would have been classified as slapstick comedy had the implications not been so serious. In the time it took a team member to activate a green light prematurely, Felipe Massa&apos;s chance of winning was lost in chaos as he left the Ferrari pit, dragging the fuel hose that would bowl over three mechanics and spray petrol as it went. By the time he reached the end of the pit lane and waited for his breathless crew to arrive and then struggle to remove the remains of the fuel line, Massa probably did not wish to contemplate the thought that this shambles might cost him the championship when the points are finally added up after the Brazilian Grand Prix on 2 November. Until that moment, Massa had done everything possible to win the 15th round of the championship and overhaul Lewis Hamilton&apos;s one-point lead. The Brazilian&apos;s pole-position lap the previous day had been sublime, the seemingly effortless performance highlighting the Ferrari&apos;s ability to soak up the bumps that troubled many of the drivers. While it was true that he had been carrying less fuel, Massa appeared to have the measure of Hamilton as he pulled out a useful lead. Indeed, rather than attack his championship rival, Hamilton&apos;s attention was focussed on Kimi Raikkonen, as the other Ferrari began to threaten seriously the McLaren driver&apos;s second place. Raikkonen was due to run for an extra couple of laps before stopping, during which time he could have overhauled Hamilton. But an incident was about to turn the race on its head and hand victory to Renault&apos;s Fernando Alonso, who might otherwise have finished an also-ran. Di Montezemolo is correct when he refers to the appearance of the safety car contributing to the spectacle. But he also means that Nelson Piquet&apos;s crash, which triggered the appearance of the official car, effectively robbed Ferrari of a possible one-two finish.  Incidents are inevitable on street circuits with walls and barriers in close attendance. Di Montezemolo&apos;s frustration can be understood, but the Ferrari boss must accept that an insistence on using a system of lights, rather than a man with a &apos;lollipop&apos;, in order to save just a tenth of a second during a pit stop has cost them dear.  It is not the first time that this complex process has caused problems for Ferrari and highlights the fact that this year&apos;s title race is so close that victory will go to the team making the fewest mistakes. This is clearly a philosophy that has been understood by McLaren as Hamilton risked nothing last Sunday and settled for a safe third place to extend his lead to seven points going into next weekend&apos;s Japanese Grand Prix, followed a week later by the penultimate round in China. The Mount Fuji and Shanghai circuits, both purpose-built, will have an anticlimactic feel after the buzz provided by the landmark event last weekend. A race that worked well under floodlights has given F1 increased flexibility by sidestepping the problems created when running in daylight in the Far East while being screened at antisocial hours in Europe. But it would be a mistake to assume that all races in eastern time zones should be run at night. Not only would the novelty value dissipate, but the use of 1,600 floodlights on the Suzuka track would be impractical and fail to demonstrate the taxing terrain of that Japanese circuit when it returns to the calendar next year. In the meantime, Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s gamble on Singapore has paid off in every respect. F1&apos;s guru will have noted that the race&apos;s close proximity to important financial institutions brought F1 to leading commercial players who would not otherwise have come to experience the sport&apos;s value, both on and off the track. Perhaps that very point exacerbated the president of Ferrari&apos;s discomfort even further.

Why is more Chinese literature not being translated and \u2013 perhaps even more importantly \u2013 widely read? After all, Isabel Allende and Umberto Eco are hugely popular in translation. I am a translator, currently in China researching contemporary literature. I have been talking to writers and academics about their favourite works and what, for them, makes good literature. The kind of answers they give me are illuminating, in particular because of the position from which they make these judgments.  In the 1950s and 60s, creative writing in China was obliged to serve politics. Han Dong, in his recent novel Banished!, observes mordantly that this was a &quot;system [which] was tightly meshed together, a seamless whole. A dog that winds up biting its own tail.&quot; Today the debate is still heavily politicised, albeit it in a different way. The &quot;reform and opening-up&quot; of the 1980s has led to &quot;marketisation&quot; in every aspect of Chinese life; books now have to make money. So the Chinese Communist party, which is entirely in favour of marketisation, likes books which shed a positive light on urbanisation and the growth of a consumerist society. At the same time, a nod also has to be made to its own leadership. The forthcoming publication of the &quot;300 Most Influential Books of the 30 years of the Reform and Opening-up of China&quot; was press-released as follows:   These 300 books \u2026 fully reflect the deep changes that Chinese society and the Chinese people have gone through over the past 30 years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist party \u2026 The books will provide healthy guidance to thought and morality, [and] have positive, uplifting content \u2026   (Translated and quoted here).  True, as all my Chinese colleagues tell me, no one takes this stuff seriously, but it shows how writers have to acknowledge the prevailing ideology, whether or not they choose to confront it directly. There are economic pressures too: writers of politically acceptable books can win lucrative prizes. And the need to earn a decent living is real.  Back to the question, how do Chinese writers and critics evaluate creative writing today? Here is a framework of analysis which has been given to me by half a dozen critics/writers: at one end of the spectrum is &quot;officially-approved&quot; literature, (the &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;uplifting&quot; sort); at the other, &quot;good&quot;, end of the spectrum is minjian (people/folk writing). This means writing about the lives and characters of ordinary people, while rejecting any ideological standpoint. (Note that &quot;people&quot; here means something quite different from &quot;the people&quot;, as in the slogan &quot;Serve the People&quot;). If this analysis sounds alien, then how about this contemporary example from the US offered to me by a Chinese woman writer friend? She observed the furore that surrounded the publication of the Da Vinci Code \u2013 and said that denunciations of the book from church pulpits reminded her irresistibly of the mass criticisms of the Cultural Revolution, suggesting that ideological differences notwithstanding, America and China share an ideological &quot;climate&quot;. Another element in the equation is the pressure to write for the mass market. Arguments rage as to whether the market has a baleful influence on creative writing. Most think it does, though they admit that literary giants such as Mo Yan and Jia Pingwa manage to write splendid, influential books which are also best-sellers. Finally, censorship: there is much less of it than is generally believed, but it is still a real preoccupation. Some writers admit to self-censorship, for instance Yan Lianke whose novel, Dream of Ding Village, about the Aids epidemic among peasants who sell their blood, is due out in translation next year. Yan has said that he &quot;attempted to forestall a ban by doing the censors&quot; work for them. Out went the novel&apos;s most ambitious features: the blood pipeline, the global trade angle and direct criticism of national politics. His novel was banned anyway.  However, China being China, the situation is more grey than black-and-white. Ha Jin wrote in the American Scholar in August 2008 that: &quot;Among [recently] banned titles was Zhang [Yihe]&apos;s book Past Stories of Peking Opera Stars, which describes the vicissitudes of eight master opera singers, especially their sufferings and ruination after 1949.&quot; Coincidentally, as I read those words, I was sitting in a house in Shanghai with a copy of that very book which my landlord, a respectable accountant, had just lent me. In other words, banned books are sometimes readily available. A preoccupation with officially-approved or &quot;people&quot;-based literature, censorship and marketisation, makes the Chinese literary world sound introspective, but this is not entirely true. Chinese writers have been much influenced by authors such as Luis Borges and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Milan Kundera and Orhan Pamuk. Unfortunately, the process does not yet seem to work the other way round.  Given the pessimism of some of the above comments, one has to ask if it is possible to bridge the cultural divide and bring more Chinese literature to a British readership. Of course, I believe it is, otherwise I would not be a translator.  But there is also a need for British publishers to understand Chinese fiction better. That boring old label &quot;banned in China&quot; actually means only one thing: that the book ticked one of the censor&apos;s no-no boxes. Sex and violence will not sell a book if it is badly written, as many are. Some publishers say they want a personable, articulate author, preferably one who can speak English. There are only a few writers who provide that winning combination and there are many who write great stuff but are not young, glamorous or English-speaking.  To be fair to publishers, there is a huge language barrier: they are dependent on Chinese-speaking readers and translators if they cannot read the texts themselves. (Though if I hear one more publisher whinge that they &quot;cannot find the translators&quot;, I shall probably scream.) There is now, however, a website providing much-needed information for publishers, translators and Chinese writers: Paper Republic. Of course, some publishers are both brave and imaginative: Penguin was prepared to break the mould with Wolf Totem, a novel about Mongolian herders and their relationship with wolves.  To finish, here are a few of my personal favourites, chosen simply to show a little of the rich variety of reading which is out there.  Banished! by Han Dong, a lyrical, sometimes painful account of a boy growing up during the cultural revolution. Hawaii University Press, 2009.

There are also other volumes of her brilliant short stories and novellas available in translation.  Happy, by Jia Pingwa.

Saatchi&apos;s liking for Ron Mueck has been supplanted by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu&apos;s super-realist sculptures - one of a fallen angel, and another of 13 world leaders careening about in motorised wheelchairs. These are poor gags. Giant fantastical insects, an enormous head manufactured from incense ash, a huge naked girl sitting open-legged on a giant stool, creepy paintings of fey party cadres, and of Mao hanging out with the Queen Mother attempt to outdo one another, in room after room.  Too much here looks secondary, or like a tiresome kind of entertainment. There are few signs of language being stretched and one has the feeling that many works have been manufactured with a market in mind.  On the whole the sculpture is better than the painting. It is almost all figurative, sometimes aiming for abject hilarity, sometimes for mordant gravity.

Production of the vanilla-flavoured candy, which is sold in more than 50 countries, was halted in September when its Shanghai-based manufacturer said the confectionary could have been contaminated by melamine, the industrial chemical that caused the scandal. Chinese officials have accused milk suppliers of adding the chemical, which is high in nitrogen, to certain batches of milk to artificially boost its protein content. Four babies died and more than 54,000 children fell sick from the contamination. As a result, Chinese milk products have been banned by dozens of countries around the world. Senegal was the latest country to impose restrictions, saying yesterday that its ban was a preventative measure. Today&apos;s White Rabbit announcement follows a promise made yesterday by China&apos;s state council to overhaul its &quot;chaotic&quot; dairy industry after acknowledging it suffered from a lack of oversight. The government said it would punish companies and officials who had put profit above people&apos;s lives through their involvement in the contamination. White Rabbit&apos;s manufacturer, Guan Sheng Yuan Food, said its new batches would undergo government quality testing as checks continue to be carried out on milk products in China. The company has not revealed its new powdered milk source, the China Daily newspaper said. Guan Sheng Yuan&apos;s parent company, Bright Foods (Group), had been its main milk supplier for the candy, but tests had shown melamine contamination. The company would not say when White Rabbit candy would go on sale again. The head of China&apos;s food quality agency said it was increasing checks on exports to ensure they conformed to the food safety standards of recipient countries, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

This is strange because it&apos;s the kind of story that used to prompt people to argue how much Chinese youth has changed and modernised. Two teenage girls were standing next to him on a sweaty train; one was wearing a pair of large-frame pink spectacles without lenses, sported dyed blonde pigtails and a short skirt. The other girl was &quot;of the tomboy style&quot;, he said; she was wearing baggy trousers and was obviously upset for some reason. The &quot;cartoon girl&quot;, as my friend called her, proceeded to comfort her friend by kissing her slowly, firstly on the lips and then on her neck and earlobes. My friend, the one from Inverness, standing a few inches away, didn&apos;t know where to look. The rest of the passengers inside the carriage all became rather quiet. Public displays of affection can be awkward. Snogging lesbian teenagers on the Beijing subway may be something one wants to take a photo of and put on a social network site for the world to see. But the reality is you see this kind of thing in any big city in the world. Does the fact that this happened in Beijing make it more shocking, because of the conservatism and strict social control in China? Such a view is what gives Beijing its &quot;gawk factor&quot;, which basically means that a westerner in China, especially the parachute tourists, will take a sight like this and stare more than on the streets of, say, Berlin. But when will Beijing lose its &quot;gawk factor&quot;?  First time visitors from the west, if they decide to attend a rock concert in Beijing, Shanghai or Wuhan, may have a similar reaction, lavishing it with praise such as, &quot;This is wonderful, for China!&quot;, &quot;I thought the communist regime, the autocracy and the repression couldn&apos;t produce rock or punk!&quot; or, &quot;This is amazing and they&apos;re singing about Zhongnanhai!&quot;  Zhongnanhai is the off-limits residence in central Beijing for top government officials. It&apos;s also the brand name of the most popular cigarettes in Beijing. Carsick Cars, some say the most popular rock band in the underground Beijing rock scene, wrote a song called Zhongnanhai. &quot;Life cannot be without Zhongnanhai!&quot; They sing, which can be interpreted as people not being able to live without the government or the cigarettes. Every time they sing the song, which has become something of an anthem in the popular indie scene, Chinese kids toss cigarettes onto the stage. For them it is about displaying their spirit and attitude, not about opposing the system they are living in. The main singer of punk rock band Subs, Kang Mao, is famed for her crazed, electric stage persona. She has been likened to Karen O of New York punk rockers Yeah Yeah Yeahs (&quot;Wow! This is China? But Subs is so punk!&quot;).  But off-stage this punk fiend showed me just how clued-up she is. Neither impulsive, reactional or sensational, she seems to know exactly what she&apos;s doing with her punk rock band Subs, which toured Norway and Finland in 2005 and closed for several thousand at Oslo&apos;s \u00d8ya festival.  The night I met her she was getting ready to perform at 13 Club in Beijing for a vegan cause \u2013 &quot;don&apos;t eat friends&quot;. She is hip and unique. And the way that she radiates energy and intelligence is far removed from the shock when you first see her on stage, rocking out in her sexy outfit and throaty voice. But there is, at the same time, something homogenous in her way of thinking, which is basically that of any rock star. Kang Mao is no different to other rockers: she won&apos;t toe the line. When it comes to modern youth culture, there really is no such thing as &quot;made in China&quot;. Punk music is a direct reaction against Chinese conservatism just as it was against British conservatism before. Chinese rock acts and Chinese young people should be compared to their international counterparts. Their actions should not be deemed outrageous or exotic or refreshing just because they&apos;re Chinese. Maybe just rebellious. If something fails to shock you in the west, why should it shock you in China? Nor does it signal a regime change \u2013 in the same way that it doesn&apos;t in another country. After all, Chinese people have the same desires and urges as people in the west, but perhaps just don&apos;t expect the next gay pride parade to hit Beijing.", "tags": ["China", "Music", "World news", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-07T14:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/09/formulaone.motorsports", "sentences": ["&quot;We have three races left and we&apos;ll do everything we can as a team to come out on top.&quot; If Hamilton wins at Fuji and Massa fails to score, the British driver would be 17 points ahead with 20 points to race for over the last two races and could secure the title at the penultimate race of the year in Shanghai the following weekend."], "title": "Formula one: Lewis Hamilton has switched on a new audience, says Max Mosley", "article": "Max Mosley believes the success of Lewis Hamilton has altered the public&apos;s perception of formula one as a sport and has dismissed suggestions that the FIA, motor sport&apos;s governing body, is biased against the British driver or his McLaren team. &quot;You notice there&apos;s a whole new public who are interested in formula one, both in the UK, but even more so abroad, in all sorts of countries,&quot; said the FIA president. &quot;Because, thanks to Lewis, it&apos;s no longer seen as a white elitist sport. It has that image, inevitably, because it&apos;s so expensive to get into.  &quot;He&apos;s changed all of that. He&apos;s come from a pretty ordinary background, he&apos;s black and he&apos;s very successful. For us [the sport], if he&apos;s successful, it will be excellent, really, really good for formula one. But that doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re going to help him, and it certainly doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re going to hinder him.&quot;  Hamilton finished second in the world drivers&apos; championship last year, his first season in formula one, and heads this year&apos;s standings by seven points going into this weekend&apos;s Japanese grand prix in Fuji after which there are just two races remaining. That lead would be more substantial but for the penalty imposed by the stewards on Hamilton at the Belgian grand prix where he was relegated from first to third place. Mosley conceded that the FIA had been the focal point of much criticism over the incident, but insisted that the rejection of the McLaren appeal in no way reflected any partiality on the part of the governing body. &quot;One&apos;s seen that over and over again,&quot; he said. &quot;What happens is, the bloggers notice if something happens that, say, disadvantages McLaren or Renault. They don&apos;t notice with Ferrari.  &quot;The mechanics on [Kimi] Raikkonen&apos;s car in Monaco this year were a few seconds too long on the grid changing his tyres and he got given a drive-through [penalty]. A drive-through in Monaco, well that&apos;s it normally, and nobody noticed.  &quot;Now if we&apos;d done that to, for example, Lewis Hamilton, there would&apos;ve been absolute uproar in Britain. Not in Italy, but in Britain. This time there was uproar in Italy, but not in Britain. It&apos;s the problem of the referee, you&apos;re never right. It&apos;s just a question of how much you annoy everybody, but you have to live with that.&quot;  Hamilton, meanwhile, is confident of extending his lead over his championship rival Felipe Massa on Sunday. He dominated on the same circuit last year in conditions of torrential rain and poor visibility. &quot;I feel a lot stronger this year than I did this time last year,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;We have three races left and we&apos;ll do everything we can as a team to come out on top.&quot; If Hamilton wins at Fuji and Massa fails to score, the British driver would be 17 points ahead with 20 points to race for over the last two races and could secure the title at the penultimate race of the year in Shanghai the following weekend. For his part, Massa remains determined to make up for his disappointing Singapore grand prix performance when he pulled away from a pit stop with the refuelling hose still attached to the side of his Ferrari, a slip which cost him a possible crucial race victory.  &quot;We are seven points behind but there are 30 points in front of us, so we will fight to the last lap of the last race,&quot; said the Brazilian, who still hopes to join Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna as his country&apos;s fourth world champion by the time the chequered flag falls at his home circuit of Interlagos on November 2, the final race of the year.", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-08T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/executivesalaries-creditcrunch", "sentences": ["&quot;And if London becomes badly paid then there will be an exodus to Mumbai, Shanghai or Dubai.&quot; This year, City pay will be lower."], "title": "Huge bonuses for City high flyers will be hard to rein in", "article": "The government may have no concrete plans about how it will rein in the pay of bank bosses - and curbing the cash paid out to those below the most senior levels will be even more challenging. In all publicly quoted companies, such as Lloyds TSB and Barclays, directors&apos; pay has to be spelled out in an annual report on which shareholders can vote, and in most businesses the best-paid member of staff is the chief executive. But bank bosses and board directors can be surrounded by staff making far more money. Even relatively junior traders, well down the pecking order but still taking big risks, expect six-figure bonus payouts.  At Barclays, chief executive John Varley earned \u00a33m last year. But that package was eclipsed by that of Bob Diamond, who runs the City arm of the bank. His basic pay for 2007 was \u00a3250,000, but his total pay including bonuses and shares was \u00a321m, and in January he got a cheque from another incentive scheme for \u00a314.8m. Diamond&apos;s pay is only known because he recently joined the board, but there are others earning huge rewards who stay hidden - such as Roger Jenkins, who runs Barclays&apos; Middle East operations and is said to have earned at least \u00a340m last year. The pay packets the government now wants to restrict are far from rare. An estimated 4,000 City workers last year got bonuses of \u00a31m or more and total bonuses were more than double that as thousands more banked bumper payouts. The salary structures in investment banks look less like those of other businesses and more like those of Premier League football clubs, where most of the cash coming in goes straight into players&apos; pockets, with the biggest stars getting the largest slice. Around 50% of bank revenues are paid out in salaries and bonuses. If Tesco did the same, its 430,000 staff would each earn more than \u00a3100,000. But it is not just top talent that is paid top dollar. Graduate trainees have been lured to the City by starting salaries of \u00a340,000-\u00a360,000 and promises of bonuses that will double that in their second year. Earlier this year the Bank of England governor Mervyn King said City pay posed two threats: it might encourage bankers to take unacceptable risks - and it was diverting too many talented graduates from industry. A managing director in a mergers and acquisitions department of an investment bank might earn a basic salary of \u00a3150,000, but would expect a bonus of at least \u00a31m. Research by a recruitment firm this year showed the average pay package of a City managing director in the credit and debt markets - and the big banks give that title to hundreds of staff - was more than \u00a3680,000. Twelve months earlier, average pay was \u00a3290,000 higher. Poorly paid In other departments average pay was still \u00a31m a year. Even so, London bankers might consider themselves poorly paid. Those doing the same job in Asia, said the survey, were averaging \u00a31.4m. &quot;If one bank holds down pay, then staff will leave and go to one that doesn&apos;t,&quot; said one fund manager. &quot;And if London becomes badly paid then there will be an exodus to Mumbai, Shanghai or Dubai.&quot; This year, City pay will be lower. Even before the crisis of recent weeks there were estimates predicting payouts would be slashed 40% this year, with up to half of bankers not qualifying for a bonus. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research some 40,000 City workers are now set to lose their jobs, and bonuses will fall nearly 60% to \u00a33.6bn. One institutional investor said the only way to curb risk-taking was to link boardroom pay to risk. &quot;If their pay depended on more caution, they would make sure caution cascades through the organisation to preserve their own payout.&quot;  Others say bonuses should not be paid for three years, so they can be cancelled if deals go wrong. At the moment, bankers can earn a bonus for advising on a deal, and another years later for helping put right the damage when it doesn&apos;t work.", "tags": ["Executive pay and bonuses", "Credit crunch", "Banking", "Market turmoil", "Economics", "Business", "Economic policy", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-09T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/france", "sentences": ["The two museums are also engaged in a battle on the international scene, with the &quot;Louvre of the sands&quot; being built in Abu Dhabi and a Pompidou in Shanghai."], "title": "Pompidou unveils programme for outpost in Metz", "article": "A race by Paris museums for the soul of provincial France kicked off yesterday when the Pompidou unveiled its programme for its outpost in the city of Metz.

Seldon is hosting at conference on opening international branches of private schools at Wellington tomorrow, where he will tell heads of state-funded schools that they should follow suit.  Ray Priest, the head teacher of the City Academy Bristol, which is part of the National Challenge scheme for schools with low results, said opening branded schools overseas would help to establish his academy as a &quot;global educational establishment&quot;.  Priest said there was a possibility the branch schools would charge fees but that they would be &quot;appropriate&quot; to their local area.  &quot;The motive for us would not be profit, as it is for some of the private schools,&quot; he said. &quot;It would create opportunities for staff and pupils to learn a great deal from each other.&quot;  The City Academy Bristol is in the National Challenge scheme, which has threatened to close any school in which fewer than 30 per cent of pupils achieve five good GCSEs, including English and maths. Acknowledging his school&apos;s poor performance, Priest said it would concentrate on hitting the National Challenge threshold before looking to open branches overseas. The situation could &quot;get moving&quot; by 2010, he said. The academy already has links with the Democratic Republic of Congo - one of its football coaches is a relative of the country&apos;s education minister. And it already has a partnership with a school just outside Harare in Zimbabwe. One option under consideration is renaming and rebranding that school and Priest is hoping to visit next year to discuss the plans in more detail.  No public money would be used to establish foreign branches, he stressed. &quot;We are a state school but being an academy we are independent. That means we have the freedom to follow these kinds of opportunities,&quot; he said.  Priest added that City Academy Bristol was a sponsored school and &quot;as long as we can make a case for it, our sponsors will listen&quot;. He said he had discussed his plans with the academy&apos;s sponsors and expected progress to be made within the next two years.  Priest said that successful state schools should follow the example of private schools, which have already opened branches in China, Thailand and Kazakhstan.  Seldon said he was aware that a number of overseas governments were keen to for &quot;prestigious and high-achieving&quot; British schools to start up in their countries.  &quot;I see no reason why that cannot include state schools.

Global financial turmoil has wiped out two years of stock market gains in Latin America&apos;s biggest economy. Brazil&apos;s currency, the real, weakened to 2.3 against the US dollar. VenezuelaPresident Hugo Chavez said his socialist revolution was not immune from the global financial crisis. State bonds on international markets have dropped to their lowest levels in five years and plunging oil prices are expected to squeeze next year&apos;s budget. Consumer spending on cars and other big items has already started to shrivel.  The finance minister, Ali Rodriguez, made an unfamiliar call for austerity in government departments. &quot;Spending on certain types of vehicles, mobile phones and parties will be eliminated,&quot; he said.  Chavez said Venezuela&apos;s state-heavy economy was better positioned to weather the financial storm, a &quot;sinking of neoliberalism&quot; which he blamed on the International Monetary Fund. He hoped the crisis would prompt other Latin American leaders to forge ahead with his cherished plan to create a &quot;Bank of the South&quot; to counter the Washington-dominated World Bank. CubaCuba&apos;s isolation from global financial markets has largely protected it from capitalist contagion, allowing it to watch the turmoil with relative equanimity. &quot;It was expected,&quot; the former president, Fidel Castro, noted in his regular column in the communist party newspaper, Granma.  Other pro-government commentators blamed the crisis on the US and said &quot;associates or tributaries of that empire&quot; were now suffering the consequences. They said the time had come for Latin America to form the pan-regional leftist front which Cuba and Venezuela have espoused. Cuba is facing its own crisis after a series of recent hurricanes devastated agriculture and infrastructure.

Here is the zeitgeist publication of the last reckless decade. &quot;Now may not seem the best time to be taking financial risks, but isn&apos;t gambling exactly what City traders do best?&quot; starts an article on a new equity fund buying racehorses. Turn the page to wander round the wine cellar of Sir Stuart Rose, boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, whose collection is &quot;a thing of beauty&quot;. What tempts the jaded palate this week? How about the first watch designed for spacewalking at \u00a316,000, tailored for a zillionaire who spent \u00a330m to be an amateur astronaut. Your own genuine flight simulator costs \u00a39m. Stuck for an executive gift? Here&apos;s an \u00a38,500 sterling silver golf club. The extraordinarily sensitive ears of the hyper-rich might need a hi-fi costing \u00a3199,999 (not including stands). You thought it was all over? Not a bit of it, nor will it be for supersonic wealth. If, like Michael Spencer of City money broker ICAP, your fortune has fallen from \u00a3895m to \u00a3410m, it may hurt, but it doesn&apos;t change a lifestyle. Marks &amp; Spencer gourmet dishes may lose sales as more shoppers head for Lidl, but Sir Stuart will not be pawning his wine cellar.  The public mood has changed. Expect little tolerance for showy excess from those who made fortunes out of ruining everyone else. As the government shovels money into the banks by the half trillion, suddenly it&apos;s not clear what anything is worth any more. &quot;Whatever it takes&quot; is needed to stop unimaginable economic collapse, but what is a lot now, and what is not a lot? It makes \u00a33bn cheap to halve the number of poor children by 2010. Free school meals or free childcare for all is a mere bagatelle. Freeze frame this strange time, hit by bullets yet still running, waiting for the vital economic organs to fail. Gordon Brown said: &quot;This is not a time for conventional thinking or out-dated dogma, but for fresh and innovative intervention that gets to the heart of the problem.&quot; He did just that, out ahead of the world in bank financing and much praised. He walks and talks like a man who has found his feet, no longer drowning but waving. When he proclaims &quot;The end of the age of irresponsibility&quot;, we have to forget that when it mattered he never once uttered the words he now uses: &quot;The days of big bonuses are over.&quot;  But will he make that a reality? When the banking bill arrives in the Commons, it will get a public drubbing unless it spells out the terms for banks to take this gigantic bundle of taxpayers&apos; cash. Private deals between each bank and the FSA, merely ordering them to put aside more capital if they indulge in risky bonus schemes, would have been good a year ago. Right now, it&apos;s not enough. Expect parliament to be as angry as Congress was: already Clegg and Cameron are out-flanking Labour in anti-bonus rhetoric. Expect MPs to demand that government capital in a bank must not leak out in dividends, golden parachutes or bonuses, at least for a year. Lord Digby Jones tours the studios to warn that top talent will flee to Mumbai, Dubai and Shanghai if denied big bonuses. Wiser observers say let them go, in this new era of solid and sober banking. It is remarkable that those responsible for the worst disasters are still at their desks. If they won&apos;t jump, they need forcible defenestration. That will seem small punishment if governments have to take control of entire banking systems to get them to function again, as one economist suggested in yesterday&apos;s Financial Times.  Brown is proving a good man in a crash. The test will come when the heart-stopping drama is over and the country faces dismal years of high unemployment with both state and citizens painfully short of spending money. The mood risks turning sour, as governments everywhere take the blame. The chancellor&apos;s pre-budget report in November will need to spell out new priorities. Can Brown cast aside conventional thinking sufficiently to craft a vision of a good society in bad times? He has the chance because he has earned back the ears of the electorate: they are willing to listen to him again. Labour needs to send out reassurance that good government can protect everyone from the very worst. This is a middle-Britain message too for homeowners, for middle earners at risk of losing their jobs as much as for the most vulnerable. Homes and heating will be the first tests. Start with fear of repossession: 45,000 mortgage defaults this year, twice as many next. Add another 25% for accelerating numbers of homes lost not through mortgage arrears but from credit card debt, as a new law hits just at the wrong time, making it easier for creditors to repossess. The government now can order the banks to adopt forbearance on repossession: people in trouble need to be allowed to switch to interest-only mortgages. Labour has already agreed to let unemployed homeowners use housing benefit to pay mortgage interest after three months out of work; before they had to wait nine months, by which time most had been repossessed.  But the change doesn&apos;t start until April, and should begin right now, helping mortgage lenders as well as home-owners. To get the housing market going again, the government needs to stand as insurer for new mortgages. Cheap land and a near-idle construction industry needs a massive government programme to insulate old homes and build, build, build to keep people in work, hire apprentices and help the housing market.  This winter&apos;s heating bills will cause an old-and-cold crisis. In the Lords, Dale Campbell-Savours has put down a well-supported amendment to the energy bill that could shift high heating costs from the poorer to the richer at a stroke. Companies would charge a low tariff for the first block of energy, with the price rising sharply the more energy is used: current tariffs, perversely, work the other way round. Average users would pay less, heavy users pay more, with an incentive for all to cut consumption.  On jobs, homes, heating and prices, Brown needs to persuade the country that the state is the people&apos;s best friend in hard times. If fairness is to be his guiding light, a copy of How to Spend It in his pocket would be a salutary reminder.polly.toynbee@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Gordon Brown", "Alistair Darling", "Economic policy", "Economics", "Credit crunch", "Labour", "Global economy", "Business", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-10T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/recession-unemploymentdata", "sentences": ["Unemployed bankers are being advised to seek work in Shanghai or Mumbai amid warnings that the Square Mile will be permanently reshaped by the crisis."], "title": "One million Britons on the dole by Christmas", "article": "More than a million Britons will be out of work and on the dole by next month as the toxic fallout from Black October filters down to ordinary families, economists are warning.  A bleak Christmas lies ahead for many as the City turmoil spreads into the so-called real economy. Companies are now being squeezed on two vital fronts, with shoppers abandoning the high street and bank lending drying up, making it almost impossible for smaller businesses to get credit to stay afloat.  Geoff Hoon, the new Transport Secretary, yesterday warned that there were &apos;potentially serious consequences for small business, for employment&apos; from the current crisis, reflecting private warnings to the Prime Minister&apos;s new economic &apos;war cabinet&apos; that job losses and business collapses later this year are now virtually inevitable.  Official unemployment figures for September, due on Wednesday, are expected to show another increase in job losses - although this will not yet be the sharp upward spike which is expected as the full consequences of last week&apos;s stock-market crash filter through. Some forecasts suggest that unemployment will hit two million by Christmas.  Some government officials warned that those slipping into unemployment could find themselves much more isolated than in the last recession. They pointed out that unemployment benefits had slipped relative to earnings and there were now fewer council houses available.  Senior Tories this weekend called for a freeze on new employment rights, in a shift away from David Cameron&apos;s previous enthusiasm for measures like extra parental leave, arguing that the priority was to save jobs by reducing business red tape. Alan Duncan, the shadow business secretary, will host an emergency summit this week on ways of preventing small businesses from going bust. Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, told The Observer it would become &apos;more difficult&apos; to make the case for flexible working in the darkening economic climate and called for deregulation to take the pressure off employers: &apos;The one thing government must recognise is that it can&apos;t keep piling regulation on small business when that could (determine) the decision whether to keep somebody in a job or not.&apos; Ministers are now under similar pressure to defend jobs, with some Labour MPs reporting a backlash from constituents furious that billions have been spent rescuing bankers while factory workers&apos; jobs go to the wall.  The British Retail Consortium will release figures this week showing another fall in sales on the high street last month, with director general Stephen Robertson warning that sales for non-food retailers such as electrical stores had &apos;fallen off a cliff&apos;. Some retailers are reducing opening hours to save costs.  Shoppers are also cutting back on &apos;big ticket&apos; purchases like cars, with the number of new registrations in September down by a fifth on August, according to the SMMT, the motor vehicle manufacturing body. Car plants have already axed thousands of temporary staff and put others on four-day weeks or halted overtime. &apos;If there is no pick-up in demand for cars, there are bound to be more job losses next year,&apos; said Roger Madison, national automotive officer for the Unite union. Others at risk include the aviation industry - Willie Walsh, the British Airways chief executive, is predicting that up to 30 airlines worldwide will go bust - while further losses are likely in the City. Unemployed bankers are being advised to seek work in Shanghai or Mumbai amid warnings that the Square Mile will be permanently reshaped by the crisis. &apos;City people I speak to are despairing because they may not get another job for a year,&apos; said Shaun Springer, chief executive of the City headhunting firm Napier Scott. &apos;For the first time in 30 years in the City, I&apos;m scared.&apos; With charitable donations falling, even the voluntary sector is also cutting jobs. Oxfam needs to shave its budget by up to 15 per cent because of falling income, while the National Council of Voluntary Organisations expects some smaller charities to go under.  Alan Clarke, economist from the bank BNP Paribas, said the number of those claiming unemployment benefit was due to break the one million mark by the end of next month at the latest, with up to two million looking for work by December: he is forecasting unemployment to hit 7 per cent by the middle of next year and carry on rising until 2010. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said it was difficult to be optimistic: &apos;The sentiment is one of widespread doom and gloom. Businesses are now being affected by the credit squeeze. The economy has shuddered to a halt.&apos;  At the height of the 1980s recession, three million were unemployed. The question now is how far the pain will spread. As one boss told a senior CBI official: &apos;We know there is a tsunami coming, but we do not know if it&apos;s going to knock us over or just wet our feet.&apos;  The speed with which the bubble burst is one of the most striking factors of this crisis, and could help determine what happens next. Consumer confidence is now lower on some indices than in the 1980s slump or even the mid-1970s, according to the pollster Peter Kellner, suggesting that Britons unused to tough times are quicker to panic than in previous slumps - leading to a more sudden fall in sales, and consequently a more severe immediate threat to jobs.  &apos;It may be that paradoxically because it&apos;s been so good for the last 16 years people are not used to the idea (of bad times) whereas in previous times the boom and bust rolled around so regularly that it was less of a shock to the system,&apos; he argues. No wonder Labour MPs&apos; celebrations after last week&apos;s banking bailout package were shortlived. &apos;The big picture is obviously deeply worrying,&apos; said one Cabinet aide. &apos;But at least Gordon is playing a blinder: he looks so comfortable in his own skin for the first time in a long time.&apos; The Prime Minister has indeed been revitalised by the crisis, his confidence visibly soaring: he trounced David Cameron at the dispatch box last week over City bonuses, and is now seeing his stance vindicated as other world leaders rush to copy his banking bailout. Finally, he is in his political element, leading international debate. Nonetheless, Labour&apos;s long-term prospects, with an election in 2010, are unclear. Brown could survive the crash, as John Major did with re-election in 1992, or be forced from office. Brown&apos;s argument today that his banking plan will reduce the pain felt by Britain will be critical. &apos;If there is a slight blip but nothing too serious, and Gordon is seen to have played a major role in pulling Britain through, then I&apos;m not saying Labour will definitely win, but it&apos;s game on,&apos; says Kellner. &apos;Alternatively, if it is a disaster we could have a Conservative landslide.&apos; There are fears across all three parties that the British National Party may profit from rising unemployment. Grayling argues that healthy employment levels among foreign nationals have masked the loss of 250,000 jobs in the last years among British men: around half of new jobs created under Labour have gone to overseas workers. Widespread job losses among unskilled, working-class Britons could provide dangerous ammunition for extremist parties and fuel the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment.  Unions are warning that the government must use its stake in the banks to free up lending, keeping businesses afloat and protecting jobs. Hugo Sellert, head of economic research at the online recruitment firm Monster, which has seen the number of employers recruiting fall dramatically, says the biggest fear is of business lending drying up. &apos;We have yet to see the full impact of the financial crisis and the recent dramatic events spill over into the jobs market,&apos; he said. &apos;The worst is still to come.&apos; Which would mean tough decisions not just for employers but for government. The Treasury&apos;s forecasts of a 4.8 per cent growth in tax receipts - including money raked in from corporate tax and VAT on consumer goods - now looks wildly optimistic, yet revising them would threaten its spending plans for public services. So what happens when the sums no longer add up?  If you are reading this on a Northern Line London Tube train, you may owe your journey to the last great recession. The extension of the Tube north to High Barnet and east into Essex in the 1930s was part of a massive programme of government spending designed to save jobs in construction and stimulate the economy after the Great Depression.  Rather than balancing its books by slashing spending or hiking taxes, could Labour try to spend its way through the recession by unleashing another era of job-creating public works?  Rail and bus operators are usually among the first casualties of rising unemployment, as redundant commuters tear up their season tickets. But Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport, argued the pain could be eased now by pushing ahead with expensive projects such as Crossrail.  &apos;Because of commitments in the transport sector some of the downturn won&apos;t be as bad, because there is a level of spending through the recession,&apos; he said. The last few days have, he argues, seen an outbreak of cross-party Keynesianism with even the Tory Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, warning against halting investment. Similarly, ministers are being lobbied to snap up land at bargain prices as the property market crashes and use it to build social housing, keeping construction workers in jobs. The prospect of a spending spree funded by borrowing worries the Tories, who fear winning the next election only to pick up the bill for what the shadow cabinet minister Michael Gove calls a &apos;party on David Cameron&apos;s credit card&apos;.  This weekend, the shadow chancellor George Osborne published an analysis suggesting that, if government borrowing rises by \u00a340 billion to plug the gap caused by a shrinking economy, government debt will rise to \u00a380 billion by next year. By 2009-10, the government could be spending more on servicing debt than on grants to schools. Whitehall is tightening its belt ahead of a pre-budget report this autumn expected, as one Cabinet minister admits, to be &apos;very tough&apos;. The Treasury has not yet even set a date for its publication, as Alistair Darling rips up plans left outdated by the global crisis. Downing Street has identified health, education and transport as priorities to be ringfenced but the outlook for other departments in the next three-year spending round - due to be settled next summer - appears grim.  Discussions have already begun over the Queen&apos;s Speech, ditching planned legislation that does not address bread-and-butter issues. Ironically, one of the flagship bills was intended to be James Purnell&apos;s welfare reforms, bringing in private sector firms to find work for the jobless, details of which will be published in December.  By then, if the gloomier forecasts are right, two million Britons could be needing the newly privatised Jobcentre services - but if Brown is vindicated, the economy could have stepped back from the brink.  For millions whose homes and livelihoods depend on his economic stewardship, he was right yesterday to say the stakes could not be higher. \u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday October 14 2008.

Yesterday he left the same circuit under a different sort of cloud after finishing 12th and failing to score any points in the Japanese grand prix. It was a small consolation for the Englishman to have Felipe Massa, his main rival in the championship, finish seventh and collect just two points after a similarly troubled race, which was won by the Renault of Fernando Alonso. Hamilton goes into the penultimate round in Shanghai next weekend leading Massa by five points. Hamilton&apos;s problems began when he made a poor start from pole position and was immediately overhauled by Kimi Raikkonen. Attempting to regain the initiative, Hamilton left his braking too late as he dived inside the Ferrari at the first corner, ran straight on and forced several drivers, including Raikkonen and Massa, to take avoiding action. Hamilton rejoined in sixth place, directly behind Massa, only for the two to collide on the second lap as Massa hit the McLaren after misjudging his braking and allowing Hamilton to draw alongside. The stewards gave Hamilton a drive-through penalty for his part in the first-corner incident, Massa receiving the same punishment for causing the second-lap collision. Predictably, neither driver felt he had been in the wrong. &quot;The duel with Hamilton was hard but fair,&quot; said Massa, who had started from fifth on the grid. &quot;The drive-through penalised my race.&quot; In Hamilton&apos;s case, the penalty was academic because the clash with Massa had spun the McLaren and dropped him to the back of the field. Massa was not much better off when he took his drive-through in the pits and dropped to 14th place. &quot;With two wheels on the gravel I could not stop the car and I was there because he [Hamilton] pushed me there,&quot; the Brazilian said. &quot;For me it was a racing incident because he broke late but then I was a little bit wide in the turn. He put the car inside and I was outside, but then he pushed me a little bit on to the gravel and then I put two wheels on the gravel and he closed and we touched.&quot; He added: &quot;I have a good relationship with Lewis and I will not do anything to destroy something on purpose. We are colleagues. We have a good relationship and I admire him as a driver and a person and I am sure he admires me as well.&quot; On lap 50, Massa became involved in another controversial collision, this time with S\u00e9bastien Bourdais as the Toro Rosso driver left the pits. Bourdais and Massa were fighting for seventh place and the Frenchman was judged to be at fault. A 25-second penalty dropped Bourdais to 10th, elevating Massa to seventh and giving him the two crucial championship points. Bourdais was charged with having caused an avoidable collision. The three investigations yesterday, linked with Hamilton&apos;s 25-second penalty in Belgium, have led to accusations that formula one has become over-policed, the stewards stifling the free spirit of racing. The first-corner incident played into the hands of Robert Kubica and Alonso as the BMW and Renault drivers took advantage and moved to the front. Kubica held the lead until the first pit stops, Alonso taking on less fuel in order to rejoin ahead of the Polish driver and open an advantage he would hold until the end of the 67-lap race. &quot;The start was probably the most exciting part of the race,&quot; said Alonso. &quot;I saw people in front going quite aggressive into turn one, so I was able to go down the inside. I was behind Kubica but knew that if I could get some free air, I would be able to pull a nice gap. I asked the team if I could get out ahead of him, so they had to give me less fuel to do that. The car was perfect and I was able to pull away.&quot; This was Alonso&apos;s 21st win and the second in succession following his victory in Singapore. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to believe,&quot; said Alonso. &quot;Singapore was unexpected - there were special circumstances there - but today was straightforward. We won again on a circuit that is not particularly good for our car. We didn&apos;t think we had the pace to win. When I found myself second then I thought maybe a podium [finish], then realised that if I had no mistakes, I was in a position to win. After a difficult start to the season, we have the feeling now that we can do anything. Podiums are possible in the last two races.&quot; That is a complication Hamilton does not need. Another is that second place for Kubica strengthens the BMW driver&apos;s third place in the championship and maintains his position as a possible winner. Kubica is 12 points behind Hamilton and seven behind Massa. Last year, Hamilton was 17 points ahead and lost the title to Raikkonen. &quot;My clutch was slipping at the start,&quot; said Kubica. &quot;I decided to go inside at the first corner, but I braked too late. Luckily, everyone else seemed to go straight on. If someone had taken the apex [the normal line], I would have hit him! I&apos;m still in [the championship] with a fight, so let&apos;s try.&quot; Raikkonen&apos;s third place has ruled out the Ferrari driver&apos;s chance of retaining his title. &quot;I was braking and trying to turn at the first corner when I saw a McLaren coming inside,&quot; said Raikkonen. &quot;I had nowhere to go and lost many places.

The timing could not be worse. Having made such a mess of the start of Sunday&apos;s Japanese grand prix that it seemed he was intent on giving away this year&apos;s world title, he is returning to Shanghai and a circuit where, last year, he slid into a gravel trap at 20mph and suffered the embarrassment of having his championship become bogged down along with his car. To make matters worse, he arrived in China in 2007 with a 17-point advantage and managed to lose the championship whereas last Sunday&apos;s debacle has already reduced his lead to five points with two races to go. Such a negative outlook would have been avoided had he not been at pains to assure everyone that lessons had been learned from 2007, only to display the same impetuosity responsible, by his admission, for undermining his first attempt at winning the drivers&apos; championship. Having done much of the hard work by winning pole position at Fuji, and then enjoying the bonus of seeing his rival, Felipe Massa, struggle on to fifth place on the grid, Hamilton allowed his heart to rule his head when a poor start and the sight of Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s Ferrari snatching the lead prompted the sort of desperate move seen regularly at amateur motor sport meetings. To fail to allow for cold brakes and tyres at such a critical point in the championship was as unforgivable as it was surprising. Until that moment Hamilton and McLaren really did seem to have a handle on dealing with the season&apos;s mounting pressure. But now Ferrari are aware that the presence of Raikkonen, who is no longer in the title reckoning, on or near the front of the grid may be enough to unsettle Hamilton further. It is true that a clumsy effort by Massa to recover from a mistake resulted in the Brazilian knocking Hamilton from fifth place to the back of the field. But it was Hamilton who had put himself in the position to be the victim of Massa&apos;s crude manoeuvre. Although Hamilton, in a private audience organised by McLaren with two British journalists, is alleged to have said Massa&apos;s move was a deliberate attempt to eliminate the McLaren on the spot, he wisely kept that opinion to himself when interviewed briefly by the rest of the media. Massa may have been just as guilty as Hamilton of overreacting after making a simple but costly error but it is unlikely that the Ferrari driver would want to risk damaging his own chances as well as those of his rival. Both drivers were guilty of recklessness that ought not to be in the make-up of any potential world champion.  If Hamilton wins next Sunday and Massa finishes no higher than fifth, then the title will go to the Englishman. But, even allowing for Massa&apos;s sometimes unpredictable form, he is more likely to be in the top three in the knowledge that a showdown is then assured on his home patch. That will have been another thought that must have haunted Hamilton on Sunday night. Attempting to clinch the title in China is one thing; doing it at Interlagos, that passionate theatre of Brazilian motor sport, is quite another. If he felt the pressure in front of a quiet and respectful audience in Japan, then questions have to be asked about his demeanour when it seems that most of Sao Paulo will turn out to assist the crowning of the first Brazilian world champion since Ayrton Senna in 1991. And there is another uncomfortable twist to Hamilton&apos;s failure to score points on Sunday. By finishing second, Robert Kubica moved to within 12 points of the lead. The Pole will be the first to admit that his BMW cannot match the performance of either Ferrari or McLaren-Mercedes but his typically faultless drive in a difficult car means he still has a chance, particularly if the favourites persist with an apparent wish to self-destruct. Even though Hamilton was 17 points ahead this time last year he finished one point behind Raikkonen.  Kubica has nothing to lose. Given the sometimes extraordinary events of this season, it would be foolish to rule him out. Dennis blames Massa Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, said he did not accept Felipe Massa&apos;s explanation why he had crashed into Lewis Hamilton in the Japanese grand prix, which the British driver said was deliberate. Dennis shrugged aside the Brazilian&apos;s assertion that his Ferrari had been forced wide over the gravel before hitting the McLaren. &quot;Everybody saw the same TV images that I saw,&quot; said Dennis. &quot;He was off the road and he drove back on into the side of Lewis. It&apos;s as simple as that and it&apos;s there for everyone to see.&quot;  Earlier Hamilton had run wide after being beaten off the start by Kimi Raikkonen and - like Massa - was penalised with a drive-through penalty. Dennis defended the manoeuvre, saying: &quot;He&apos;s a racing driver. He is going to fight for positions at every opportunity and you&apos;re not going to stop him doing that. Of course it would have been nice if he could have been a bit more prudent in the first corner but that&apos;s the benefit of hindsight.  &quot;Some of the things he does, you&apos;re in awe of him. How long did it take Felipe to get past the Honda? Five laps? Six laps? And Lewis just blasted past him. The simple fact is he is a great driver.

SSE said M&amp;S Energy customers will pay the same price as its existing customers who take both gas and power and who pay by direct debit - \u00a31,196 a year for an average user. A spokeswoman for M&amp;S said the idea was to take the confusion out of buying gas and electric: &quot;As a business we buy a lot of energy ourselves. It is complicated, so we are going to give people a choice they know they can trust. The service will also enable customers to reduce their energy consumption and their bills.&quot;  The new energy offer is part of a push by M&amp;S to start selling a wider range of goods and services and to expand into new areas. The retailer now sells a range of electrical goods and is trialling branded foods in 19 supermarkets in the north-east. It is also expanding its international division, and two weeks ago opened its first store in China - in Shanghai. In the UK, however, M&amp;S is facing increasingly tough trading conditions. Chairman Sir Stuart Rose recently reported a 6% downturn in sales and announced he was slashing planned investment to save cash. City analysts expect the company&apos;s profits to slump from \u00a31bn last year to little more than \u00a3500m next year.  SSE, which ranks second behind British Gas among the big six in the residential energy market and has around 8.5 million customers, aims to use the link with M&amp;S to grow its market share. &quot;It is a new channel to reach additional customers,&quot; an SSE spokesman said. &quot;We want to continue to grow. We expect to continue to grow.&quot; SSE has committed to secure electricity generated by hydro-electric plant to match that used by M&amp;S Energy customers.  The power company already has around 1,400 megawatts of hydro generation and is close to completing a scheme that will add another 100MW. The M&amp;S Energy offer rewards customers with a \u00a315 voucher if they reduce their annual energy usage by 10%. Customers who opt for paperless billing will get another \u00a310 voucher. Dual-fuel customers switching to M&amp;S Energy will also receive a \u00a320 M&amp;S voucher on signing and a further \u00a310 voucher for each year they remain with M&amp;S Energy. The energy deal goes online and into 16 stores on October 27 and will be extended to 62 stores by the end of next month.

Kubica&apos;s second-place finish in the Japanese grand grix last week left the 23-year-old from Kracow third in the championship standings, 12 points behind Hamilton and seven behind Massa. This time last year Kimi Raikkonen was in third place 17 points behind the leader, Hamilton, with two rounds to go and the Finn snatched the drivers&apos; title in the final race at Interlagos by a point. In 13 of the season&apos;s 16 races so far Kubica has finished in the points, including his first win in Canada. Many in the pit lane think that if the BMW Sauber team had focused more on developing the 2008 car than on next year&apos;s model, and fussed over the struggling Nick Heidfeld a bit less, the Pole would be in an even stronger position in Shanghai. Kubica described his second-place finish in Japan as &quot;a real boost for our morale&quot;, adding: &quot;Now we have nothing to lose but everything is possible.&quot; Ultimately it may be a long shot to expect him to pull off such a miracle, but his march to prominence in the sport&apos;s most senior category has been as unexpected as it has been unconventional. From the age of 13 he lived for much of the time in Italy, isolated from family and friends, after the Italian kart manufacturer CRG spotted his potential. The young Pole moved into car racing with formula Renault in 2001 and, after two years contesting the Italian championship, went into formula three in 2003. He finished seventh in the Euroseries in his second season, then won the 2005 World Series by Renault before becoming BMW Sauber&apos;s test driver in 2006. He moved full-time into formula one when Jacques Villeneuve was fired after the 2006 German grand prix. For Mario Theissen, the BMW Motorsport director, promoting Kubica to the seat vacated by Villeneuve seemed a big risk but Kubica showed the wisdom of the decision by finishing third in only his third race, the Italian grand prix at Monza. Kubica has a dry sense of humour which was by no means ruffled even by a 170mph, 40G smash that shredded his car in last year&apos;s Canadian grand prix. Asked later whether he had seen a video of the accident, he paused before responding: &quot;No, I didn&apos;t need to. You see, I was there at the time and I saw it live.&quot; The BMW Sauber technical director, Willy Rampf, has made it clear that the team will make every effort to help Kubica in his quest for the world title. &quot;As long as there is theoretically still a chance to win the world championship, then we will not sleep,&quot; Rampf said. &quot;We&apos;ll try to concentrate on every detail of the preparation for these races. There won&apos;t be any big updates but we can make small changes and we can try to use the potential of the tyres in a more perfect way.&quot; There is no question mark over Kubica&apos;s capability. He may have been a little fortunate to win in Canada this year after Hamilton ran into the back of Raikkonen in the pit lane, but it is through avoiding such banana skins that the Pole has achieved such a formidable position.

But few would have predicted that British director Guy Ritchie would join that eclectic roll call. This coupling was, for a moment, as exciting as it was unexpected. A cult(ish) British director and an American superstar? To a country so fond of self-deprecation, and for so long in the grumbling, intimidated shadow of its bigger and brasher transatlantic neighbour, it was as though the hometown boy had pulled the prom queen.  If there&apos;s one movie this couple should have made, it was Richard Curtis&apos; Notting Hill. Their wedding in a castle in Scotland, attended by George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Donatella Versace, was like a fairytale for all involved: her, him and the British magazine reading public.  It started, as most things by Madonna once did, a trend, with various A-list Americans descending on the capital.  Suddenly, thanks to this recently unknown director, strange species such as Gwyneth Paltrow were stalking the land, getting off with unlikely British men and making foreign noises about &quot;packed macrobiotic lunches&quot; and &quot;in-house Pilates machines&quot;. Yet national doubt soon set in and instead of this partnership elevating the couple in the public&apos;s eyes, it diminished them both.  While British audiences have long found the appeal of Ritchie and his dubious east London accent mystifying, it perhaps explained what brought him and Madonna together: here were two people rivalled only by each other in their capacity for brass-necked make-overs. For Madonna, this constituted swapping a persona based on Pope-baiting provocation with that of spiritually aware exercise obsessive; for Ritchie, it meant jettisoning his childhood as stepson of a baronet in favour of a blizzard of dropped aitches.  Madonna&apos;s adoption of a lady-of-the-manor look when she and Ritchie first married was as cartoonish as her husband&apos;s take on Britain, with his East End gangster movies and weekend shooting trips in plus fours. How could it fail? Two characters from Dick van Dyke&apos;s Guide to Britain - perfect! Logical, perhaps, but the marriage made this once infallible pop culture icon suddenly seem, well, a little silly in British eyes. Could she really not see how clumsy his mockney poses were? How one note his movies are? She became styled by the media as the gullible, image-chasing harridan. He was the henpecked husband. These were images that no amount of adoptions, children or film collaborations could shake off.  It&apos;s easy to mock Ritchie now and his &quot;Alright guv, I&apos;m on t&apos; dog and bone&quot; film genre, but when he and Madonna met he was - and this is an actual quote - &quot;the British Quentin Tarantino&quot;.  He would bring her cinematic credibility, the one thing that has always eluded her, and she would bring him international fame. Well, one of them was right, if perhaps not in the way he imagined. Ritchie, sweetly, forgot that cinematic maxim: never make a movie with Madonna, especially if you&apos;re involved with her. It took Sean Penn years and an acrimonious divorce to get past Shanghai Surprise. Rupert Everett&apos;s friendship with her, and nearly his career, failed to live through The Next Best Thing. But Swept Away was a new low in husband/wife film collaborations and, if only to avoid a repeat of that, it&apos;s hard not to see this divorce as the best possible outcome for both. The divorce has been predicted since pretty much the week they returned from their honeymoon. Already celebrity columnists were opining yesterday that marriage to Madonna is &quot;very tricky&quot; (this was then followed by one particular columnist&apos;s admission &quot;I never met her&quot;.)  It seems unlikely that intimidation of his wife&apos;s success was what did it for Ritchie in the end, seeing as that was hardly a surprise she sprung on him after the ceremony. More likely, it is just another instructive tale that when a couple is brought together by celebrity then ultimately it is celebrity that will bring them down. Maybe he thought there was more to her behind her image, maybe she thought there was less behind his. It&apos;s a tragedy for their children and an end of an era for London.

The incident came in last season&apos;s Chinese grand prix when Hamilton appeared poised to clinch the championship in his rookie year. Leading the standings by 12 points ahead of then McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso going into the race in Shanghai, Hamilton started from pole and comfortably led throughout the opening stages. But with the team unsure whether a damp track would dry out or if the rain would return, Hamilton stayed out on rapidly deteriorating tyres. When he was eventually called in shortly after Kimi Raikkonen had passed the 23-year-old to take the lead, Hamilton slid off the pit lane entry and into the gravel where he beached his car. It proved a critical moment in the championship as Raikkonen went on to win the race and the title-decider in Brazil that followed to beat Hamilton to the crown by a point. Hamilton insists he is not haunted by the incident, but has occasionally viewed it on the internet. &quot;Sometimes I&apos;ve been on YouTube and seen a video clip or a picture of me in the gravel last year and thought, &apos;Damn! That shouldn&apos;t have happened,&quot;&apos; reflected Hamilton. &quot;But it was a learning mistake and I can still move forwards from it because things like that happen for a reason and it taught me a lot. Last year the last couple of races taught me a lot about my personality and my life, and I&apos;m stronger for it.&quot; Mercedes boss Norbert Haug has insisted it is the team, and not Hamilton, who were ultimately to blame for what transpired in Shanghai a year ago. &quot;Last year&apos;s race was indeed one of the worst for all in the team,&quot; reviewed Haug. &quot;Lewis had been dominant in the opening stages, but we made a wrong call bringing him in for a tyre change. It was a race we should have won but didn&apos;t, and that was our mistake, not Lewis&apos;s, but that&apos;s history.&quot; As Haug points out, the title is again Hamilton&apos;s to lose given his five-point cushion over Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa, and the team are determined not to let lightning strike twice. &quot;After a difficult race at Fuji, Lewis is still five points ahead in the championship,&quot; said Haug. &quot;So the team and him have it in their hands to get the job done in the final two races.&quot; Not for the first time this season ahead of a grand prix weekend, rain has been forecast which could play into Hamilton&apos;s hands given his ability in the wet. But Hamilton is unconcerned about what the heavens might bring, just as long as it is not the mixed conditions that played their part in his downfall last year. &quot;I&apos;ve said before that I don&apos;t mind racing in the wet or the dry,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;Of course, it&apos;s safer in the dry and I guess those are the conditions that racing drivers prefer. But having said that, I would just prefer it if the weather wasn&apos;t too changeable during the weekend. When the track starts drying out, or it starts raining during the race, that is when things become a real lottery. At this stage in the season you need things to be as reliable as possible for you.&quot; Raikkonen has accused Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen of costing him victory in Sunday&apos;s Japanese grand prix. Raikkonen believes he could have ended his winless run but for the first corner incident at Fuji that forced him off the track. Starting from second on the grid, Raikkonen comfortably passed pole-sitter Hamilton on the run down to turn one, only for the Brit to attempt an audacious move to reclaim top spot. But Hamilton braked too late, and with Kovalainen also in the mix directly behind him, Raikkonen had to take evasive action. &quot;The start went well, and I was ahead of the rest, just like we had planned,&quot; said Raikkonen. &quot;But when you turn into the first corner in front of everybody else, you should be there when you come out of it. I have no idea what the drivers behind me were thinking. They braked so late it was impossible to avoid the following chaos. It was an inexplicable mistake by the two cars from McLaren who actually expelled me from the fight for victory at the Japanese GP. &quot;If I had managed to get unharmed through the first corner, I could have won. But instead of leading I was again stuck behind slower cars, and although we gave it our best, we didn&apos;t have the possibility to race with a free track.&quot; Raikkonen eventually finished third, ending a run of four successive races without a point. But the Finn, who turns 29 tomorrow, is now 21 points behind Hamilton and out of the world championship picture, leaving Ferrari team-mate Massa and BMW Sauber&apos;s Robert Kubica as the Briton&apos;s main rivals. Although Raikkonen&apos;s season is effectively over, he has already set his sights on a crack at next year&apos;s championship. &quot;It&apos;s true Sunday&apos;s result was a &apos;sayonara&apos; to the drivers&apos; title,&quot; added Raikkonen. &quot;I knew after Spa there wasn&apos;t much hope left. I should have won then, and I could still have decided my own destiny, but after the retirement it was just a question of time. From January I can tell you I have given it my best to win the title again. Now I&apos;ll try it again next year.

Shares in the UK&apos;s leading companies closed down 5.35% at 3861, the FTSE&apos;s lowest point since April 2003, following another wave of selling by investors as travel companies and oil giants were targeted.  A batch of poor manufacturing figures from the US saw the Dow Jones index fall nearly 1% this evening, as the Federal Reserve reported US industrial production in September suffered its biggest drop since 1974.  The Dow Jones had fallen by 43 points to 8532 by 6pm BST, giving up modest early gains but recovering from steeper afternoon losses.  An influential regional factory output survey, from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, compounded the gloom by reporting an 18-year low in factory activity.  &quot;The Philly Fed data provides the first reliable lead into the October numbers and confirms that the meltdown in financial markets is being closely followed by a dramatic slide in real economic activity,&quot; said Alan Ruskin, the chief international strategist at RBS Global Banking.  In Europe, Germany&apos;s DAX closed 4.9% lower and France&apos;s CAC-40 fell 5.9%, while Switzerland&apos;s central bank announced a multi-billion dollar bail-out of banking giant UBS.  Traders said the FTSE and other markets were now gripped by concerns over a global recession, having emerged from a tumultuous fortnight as governments strived to prevent a systemic collapse in the banking industry.  Shares in holiday companies TUI Travel and Thomas Cook fell by more than 20% as investors calculated that, with unemployment  expected to hit 2 million people by Christmas, fewer families will be taking holidays next year.  &quot;The main worry is not the bank bail-out plan but the fears of global recession,&quot; said James Hughes, a dealer at CMC markets.  Heavyweight mining and oil stocks also fell in London, along with firms exposed to the housing market after building supplies firm Travis Perkins warned on profits. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher saw its shares fall more than 9%, while the owner of the Build Center chain, Wolseley, dropped more than 17%.  Royal Dutch Shell was more than 8% lower as oil companies were affected by concerns over the global economy, with rival BP down 4%.  Earlier today, the panic selling that began on Wall Street yesterday evening spread around the globe as investors lost faith that Europe and America&apos;s bank rescue packages would stave off an economic downturn.  In London, the FTSE 100 fell by almost 6% in the first few minutes of trading to just 3840.6, its lowest level during the recent crisis. Although it later bounced back, attempts at a more solid rally faltered after the Dow Jones maintained its downward trajectory this afternoon.  The FTSE&apos;s performance followed an 11% plunge on Japan&apos;s Nikkei, its worst daily fall since 1987.  There was little sign of optimism in the City this morning. Antonio Borges, a former vice-president of Goldman Sachs, warned that investors are panicking, selling shares in favour of cash. &quot;The markets are very, very volatile because we do have a crisis of confidence, so the slightest piece of bad news throws the markets into disarray,&quot; he said.  One analyst warned that shares may have much further to fall. &quot;Unless something remarkable happens, it looks like the FTSE 100 will test the low of 3287 that it hit in March 2003,&quot; warned David Buik of BGC Partners. &quot;Regarding a recession \u2013 we are in it.&quot;  Jaguar Land Rover cut almost 200 jobs, and Corus slashed steel production for the rest of the year by 20%.  This follows a raft of evidence on Wednesday that the wider economy has been damaged by the financial crisis.  Across the Atlantic, yesterday&apos;s 733 point plunge on the Dow Jones index was prompted by a shock drop in retail sales and a grim warning from Ben Bernanke. The Federal Reserve chairman said the frozen credit markets posed a big risk to the wider economy.  &quot;By restricting flows of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the turmoil in financial markets and the funding pressures on financial firms pose a significant threat to economic growth,&quot; Bernanke told the Economic Club of New York.  The price of oil slipped again today, with a barrel of US crude oil falling another $3 to $71.73 on expectations of lower demand.  Markets had rallied on Monday as the world&apos;s governments began taking action to pump capital into their struggling banks. But in Japan, where the Nikkei fell 11.4% to 8458, the prime minister, Taro Aso, said America&apos;s $250bn (\u00a3145bn) injection into the banks did not go far enough.  &quot;It was insufficient, and so the market is falling rapidly again,&quot; Aso said.  Borges agreed that the optimism over the bail-out may have been misplaced. &quot;After the government guarantees, it is fair to expect that the banking sector will go back to a more normal state. The problem is, however, that this may have come a bit too late and, meanwhile, the consequences of the credit crunch are beginning to be felt across the economy,&quot; Borges told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme.

Lewis Hamilton can, of course, win the title this weekend. The McLaren driver is five points clear of Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa, and Sky Bet is offering 5-1 the Englishman does enough in Shanghai to go into the final race of the year with an unassailable lead. Hamilton is 2-5 (general) to win the title after either the Chinese or Brazilian grand prix, with Massa 11-4 (Ladbrokes). Robert Kubica, 12 points behind Hamilton, is trading at 25-1 (Totesport) and there has been interest in the Pole this week with Boylesports and Ladbrokes cutting the BMW driver after significant support. Massa may feel confident that he can overhaul Hamilton. Ferrari, 1-3 (general) to win the constructors&apos; crown, have dominated the Chinese grand prix since it came on to the calendar in 2004, winning three of the four races staged in Shanghai.  The action then moves to S\u00e3o Paulo, Massa&apos;s home city, for the final grand prix of the year, and with Hamilton showing a propensity to let the pressure get to him, punters holding an ante-post voucher with the Brazilian&apos;s name on it should not throw it away just yet. Hamilton, who was in a good position to win the 2007 Chinese grand prix when an error on lap 30 saw him spin out, is 2-1 joint favourite with Massa to win the race this year. Hamilton is a stand-out offer with Betfred, which might not hold the price long as some firms are going as short as 6-4 about the Englishman. But given what has happened in the last two races - when Renault&apos;s Fernando Alonso scored double-figure-odds victories and the top two in the standings made mistakes - taking short prices about either of the market principals may again prove a poor investment. The spectre of team tactics will hang heavy on bettors&apos; minds ahead of the Chinese race, with an added conundrum to consider in the shape of Alonso&apos;s alleged post-Japanese grand prix suggestion that he will help Massa to the title if possible. So it is difficult to get excited about the 7-1 (VC Bet) offered that Ferrari&apos;s Kimi Raikkonen wins on Sunday, likewise the 10-1 (Betfred and Sky Bet) Alonso is quoted or the 18-1 (Betfred and Sportingbet) available on Hamilton&apos;s team-mate at McLaren, Heikki Kovalainen. Throw in the fact that showers are forecast over the weekend in Shanghai and this race looks impossible to predict (Paddy Power offers 11-10 that the safety car is forced to come out again). Raikkonen won the Chinese grand prix last year and while he won&apos;t be retaining the F1 title he won in 2007, there is one market that he has dominated all season. The Finn has posted the fastest lap time in 10 of the 16 grands prix this year and is worth an interest at 11-10 (Paddy Power and Sportingbet) to do so again on Sunday.  A handful of firms have priced up a market which asks punters to predict the winner of the race &quot;without the big six&quot; (the Ferrari, McLaren and BMW-Sauber drivers). Understandably, given he has won the last two races, Alonso is the favourite at 6-5 (Sky Bet).  However, a better option might be Sebastian Vettel of Toro Rosso at 7-1 (Ladbrokes). The German, who won the Italian grand prix, has rewarded each-way backers in this market in three of the past five races, missing out in the other two by a single position. Elsewhere Jarno Trulli, at 11-10 (Extrabet), is an appealing bet to finish in the points. The Toyota driver has done so in nine of the 16 grands prix so far, suggesting the shade of odds-against on offer is a value play.

Various notions have been advanced of how China might splash out, including a huge loan to Washington with IMF-style strings, to establish its status as a responsible superpower which bailed out the US and saved Americans from repeating their sins. However, whether Beijing, under its present consensus-seeking leadership, is ready to move to centre stage in this way must be doubted. While the leadership stresses its willingness to help with global rescue plans, its first priority is domestic. Its system protects it from the kind of financial woes that have hit the west, and the contribution of exports to growth is often overstated. But the Communist party plenum which ended on Sunday warned of &quot;hardships&quot; ahead, and the PRC&apos;s global involvement means it would be significantly affected by a downturn in its main markets in Europe and the US. Even before the present crisis hit, the Shanghai stock exchange had nosedived, small factories were closing down and the government had slowed the appreciation of the currency to help exporters. &quot;Caution and flexibility&quot; were laid down by the plenum as the policy guidelines, along with the focus on protecting growth which has become the watchword since March. The consumption Beijing is concerned with is that of the Chinese, not westerners. If it spends its trillions, it will be at home, not in propping up others.

The 23-year-old has received widespread criticism for his uncompromising driving style since blowing pole position in Fuji last weekend to finally finish 12th, cutting his lead over Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa in the drivers&apos; championship to just five points. Hamilton has responded to his critics at the first available opportunity, however, driving his McLaren to top spot in each of the two 90-minute sessions at the Shanghai International Circuit. It was the first time Hamilton has been out in front in both of Friday&apos;s practice runs since the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim in July where he also recorded his last win. His fastest lap was set late in the first session as he clocked 1min 35.630secs for the 5.451km track, and a time 0.120secs slower in the second session. Hamilton was comfortably quickest on both occasions, beating Massa into second by 0.390secs after the duo had traded fastest laps in the first session, and then Renault&apos;s Fernando Alonso by 0.274secs in the second.

They have the right to their own opinion.

They need solutions to the problems that every city faces within the time frames of elections, and they think that they can doing it by building as much as they can, as quickly as they can. But there are only a limited number of problems that are susceptible to this kind of timescale.  The result is a constant cycle of demolition and reconstruction that is seen as the substitute for thinking about how to address the deeper issues of the city. In Manchester, you can now see areas that were originally built up in the 1880s and demolished in the 1930s, built up and demolished again twice since then.  Understanding a city needs to be subtler than the crowd-pleasing blowing-up of troublesome teenaged tower blocks. Visions for cities tend to be the creation of the boosters rather than the theorists or the policy makers. City builders have always had to be pathological optimists, if not out and out fantasists. They belong to a tradition that connects the map makers who parcel up packages of swamp land to sell to gullible purchasers, and the show apartment builders who sell off plan to investors in Shanghai, who are banking on a rising market, making them a paper profit before they have even had to make good on their deposits. These are visions of cities as machines for making money, if not for turning the poor into the not so poor, which is what attracts the ambitious and the desperate to them in the first place. There are other kinds of vision that start, as so many urban visions have done, with an attempt to deal with the pathology of the city, modernism after all was probably as much about notions of hygiene as anything else.  A city is an a la carte menu, that&apos;s what makes it different from a village, which offers so much less in the way of choice. In the end it is the vision of what it is that gives a city a shared sense of itself.  A positive vision of urbanity has to be based on ensuring that more and more customers can afford to make the choice. And there is perhaps a kind of psychological comfort to be found in the idea that a city can still be the product of vision, rather than of unintended consequences that are the driving force of so many new developments; like London&apos;s famous lurch eastward, triggered by the opportunistic development of Canary Wharf, using planning rules intended to make it a low-rise business park, and triggering the building of the Jubilee Line to serve it. Successful cities keep their options open. They do not create concrete deserts by building too much social housing in high rises, or building their suburbs at such low densities that public transport becomes impossible. In the end, successful cities are the ones that open up possibilities for the future rather than close them down. \u2022 Deyan Sudjic is director of the Design Museum and co-author of The Endless City (Phaidon)", "tags": ["Regeneration", "Communities", "Future of cities", "Society", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-17T10:09:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/oct/17/jg-ballard-memoir-frankfurt", "sentences": ["When JG Ballard wrote his autobiography Miracles of Life: Shanghai to Shepperton, published earlier this year, it was judged to be a &quot;brief, modest and occasionally shattering book&quot;, but was also feared to be his last, after he revealed at the end that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006."], "title": "More to come from JG Ballard", "article": "When JG Ballard wrote his autobiography Miracles of Life: Shanghai to Shepperton, published earlier this year, it was judged to be a &quot;brief, modest and occasionally shattering book&quot;, but was also feared to be his last, after he revealed at the end that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.

Personally, I admire this. It&apos;s what drives him to those impressive comebacks like at Monza, racing from 15th place to seventh, and makes him one of the most exciting men on the grid to watch. The question of whether it leads him to attempt dangerous manoeuvres, an accusation levied at him by pretty much the rest of the field, is a matter already covered by Richard Williams. But you cannot deny that he was content after twice being fastest in practice. Photograph: Luca Bruno/APrefuses to compromise a single lap of a race in the hunt for the greater haul, rather than the modest accumulation of points. Speaking to British colleagues this week, there was a hefty dose of criticism for Hamilton&apos;s performance in the Japanese grand prix, while others questioned the approach of McLaren&apos;s top brass. Why head into the weekend promising a careful strategy of racking up the points and then exit it \u2013 after a hot-headed start \u2013 backing the driver&apos;s seemingly win-at-all-costs approach? It&apos;s almost as if Hamilton has Ron Dennis in his thrall, rather than bowing to his boss&apos; years of experience. Not since Ayrton Senna has McLaren, perhaps the hardest team to race for on the grid, accepted that the best approach is that of a driver it is unable to reign in. It&apos;s not that Hamilton is in any way feral, he&apos;s just instinctively driven to win. In a split second he&apos;ll pull off a move that most wouldn&apos;t have the balls to do. Some won&apos;t even have spotted that a pass was there for the taking. Occasionally it doesn&apos;t pay off, like his start at Fuji, when he couldn&apos;t bear the fact that Kimi Raikkonen had got past and did all he could to regain the lead into the first corner. It was an instant decision, not influenced by the redeeming fact his main title rival was behind him, but I refuse to call it a mistake. Hamilton is revealing himself to be a driver in the mould of Gilles Villeneuve \u2013 to go for the victory is the only option. &quot;In motor racing it&apos;s the winning that counts, not the taking part,&quot; I was recently told and that rings true for Hamilton. In only his second season, he cannot be expected to string together a set of faultless drives, but however good he is at recovering from errors, now is not the time to be making them. Were it not for his Hungary engine failure and a couple of pit stop dramas, Felipe Massa may have been leading the title race now \u2013 instead he is five points adrift and victory is within Hamilton&apos;s grasp at Shanghai this weekend. A debacle from the Brit, however, will swing the momentum in the Brazilian&apos;s favour for his home grand prix at Interlagos - the season&apos;s final round. The outsider \u2013 at 25-1 with some bookies \u2013 is Robert Kubica, whose approach has been the reverse of Hamilton&apos;s (and it&apos;s Kubica who has made accusations of dangerous driving against his contemporary). With a less powerful BMW going for the win hasn&apos;t been an option, his Canadian victory coming courtesy of Hamilton rear-ending Raikkonen in the pit lane. But still, he&apos;s banked enough points to keep him in the hunt, scoring eight in the last race, and he now lies in a better position than Raikkonen did this time last year \u2013 and the Finn went on to take the title. There are some who would love the Pole to win, believing his stealthy season has been superior to his rivals, but I&apos;d rather the big prize went to someone who hadn&apos;t mopped up the points, however talented he is. If Hamilton translates his two fastest Friday practice times into pole position tomorrow and then shoots away at Sunday&apos;s start, that inbuilt desire to win could take him to his first title. But what&apos;s the betting that Ferrari, in a game of psychological one-upmanship, will light-fuel Raikkonen in qualifying to get him on pole to try and stop Hamilton doing just that? Sack the stewards? You&apos;d be taking the Michael The call to rid formula one of part-time stewards and pay former racers to do the job raises a chuckle. It&apos;s because grand prix stars past and present believe that only drivers can truly understand why various incidents happen in the heat of the moment. Fair enough. But given that every driver seems to have a different interpretation of this season&apos;s memorable moves, how on earth would they decide on a driver whose opinion everyone would agree with? There&apos;d be a few furious faces if they drafted in Michael Schumacher ... Last weekend&apos;s action Spanish racer Jaime Alguersuari certainly follows the same rulebook as Kubica. The new British formula three champion came from behind to snatch the crown from odds-on favourite Oliver Turvey at Donington Park on Sunday. It was undeniably a grand shame for the young Briton - if it hadn&apos;t rained during the second qualifying session it could have been a different story - but Alguersuari&apos;s steady assault was certainly classy. During an interview a few months ago, I was surprised by how calm, cool and confident he was. Chasing wins was not what it&apos;s about, he told me, and this mature approach paid off - although he did claim the final two when it mattered. It&apos;s incredible to think he&apos;s the youngest-ever winner of the title, with previous names including world champions Nelson Piquet Sr, Ayrton Senna and Mika Hakkinen. The weekend&apos;s action We&apos;re halfway through the Chase for the Sprint Cup and the Nascar gang head to Martinsville. Car No48, Jimmie Johnson, has a 69-point lead over his closest challenger Jeff Burton and has won three of the last four races at the circuit. Jeff Gordon also runs well here, but he&apos;s having a &apos;mare and is way down the standings in eighth place with an unbridgeable 245-point deficit.

Briatore, for whom Hamilton&apos;s former McLaren team-mate and nemesis Fernando Alonso won the last two races in Singapore and Japan, said that the world championship points leader had learned nothing from his experiences last year and will again allow the title to slip through his fingers. These attacks were calculated to turn up the pressure on Hamilton at the most crucial moment of the season, making it imperative for the young Briton to heed the advice of the triple world champion Sir Jackie Stewart not to try winning the race on the first corner at the Shanghai International Circuit. &quot;Lewis must keep cool,&quot; said Stewart after Hamilton was fastest in practice for tomorrow&apos;s race. &quot;Having said that, I believe he went into the Japanese race intending to stick by those rules which he had set himself. He made a poor start from pole position, after which he over-reacted going into the first corner.&quot; Briatore is unconvinced. &quot;Hamilton will try again to throw away the title,&quot; he told Gazzetta dello Sport. &quot;He and McLaren were good last year: to lose it with a 17-point advantage with two races to go is worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. He can repeat himself with just five points of advantage. [Felipe] Massa will win the title. Hamilton hasn&apos;t learned anything. He should be told he is a formula one driver, not a Martian. He is a youngster who still has to show his worth.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s aggression going into the first corner at Fuji drew adverse remarks from his rivals Robert Kubica, Alonso and Jarno Trulli, with the Red Bull driver Mark Webber going so far as to suggest there was a danger of somebody being killed. Trulli and Webber, both directors of the grand prix drivers&apos; association of which Hamilton chooses not to be a member, backed down from a confrontation with him at yesterday&apos;s driver briefing in Shanghai where they had vowed to raise the issue of their rival&apos;s driving etiquette with the race director, Charlie Whiting. Ironically the driver to spring unexpectedly to Hamilton&apos;s defence was Ferrari&apos;s Massa who goes into tomorrow&apos;s race five points behind his adversary. &quot;That is Lewis,&quot; said Massa who has five victories to Hamilton&apos;s four this season. &quot;That is his personality, to be aggressive and to always be over-confident. Everybody knows he is very strong and these things have given him a lot of points. We have seen that an aggressive style helps, but we have also seen times it does not.&quot; Massa admits that it is flattering to have so much apparent support from his peers who feel ambivalent - or even contemptuous - of what they regard as Hamilton&apos;s cocksure demeanour, although the McLaren driver made it clear that he really could not care less what his colleagues think about him. &quot;That&apos;s fine with me,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;They have the right to their own opinion but my driving is why I&apos;m leading the championship, and I&apos;m not disappointed with the way I drive.&quot;", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-17T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/18/formulaone-lewishamilton", "sentences": ["Triple world champion Sir Jackie Stewart has warned Lewis Hamilton that there must be no repeat of the first-corner incident which might have cost him an easy victory in last Sunday&apos;s Japanese grand prix if he is to have a hope of clinching the world championship in tomorrow&apos;s Chinese race at Shanghai.", "If you look at his record, you might conclude that Lewis has been the more inconsistent of the two.&quot; The issue of the comparative performance potential of Hamilton&apos;s McLaren-Mercedes MP4-23 and the Ferrari F2008 driven by Massa will also play a major part in the outcome of the championship battle, particularly taking into account the possibility of rain during tomorrow&apos;s race at the Shanghai International Circuit."], "title": "Formula one: Jackie Stewart urges Lewis Hamilton to see the bigger picture and keep a cool head", "article": "Triple world champion Sir Jackie Stewart has warned Lewis Hamilton that there must be no repeat of the first-corner incident which might have cost him an easy victory in last Sunday&apos;s Japanese grand prix if he is to have a hope of clinching the world championship in tomorrow&apos;s Chinese race at Shanghai.  &quot;As has been proved time and time again in motor racing, you can&apos;t win a grand prix on the first corner, but you can most certainly lose it,&quot; said Stewart, who won the title in 1969, 1971 and 1973 before retiring with a then-record 27 grand prix wins to his credit. &quot;Lewis now knows that after the first corner at Fuji last weekend, particularly after he spent so much time in the run-up to the race assuring everybody that he would be taking a tactical and strategic approach to the battle for the world championship.&quot; &quot;So Lewis must keep cool in China this weekend. Having said that, I truly believe he went into the Japanese race firmly intending to stick by those rules which he had set himself. Then he made a poor start from pole position and was beaten away by Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s Ferrari, after which all his good intentions went out of the window and he over-reacted going into the first corner.&quot;  Stewart also made the point that Hamilton was in an unusual situation in the sense that he was one of those rare competitors who had the chance of winning the world championship in both the first and second years of their formula one career.  &quot;We all know that Lewis has the capability within himself to win races and world championships, but you would have to say, looking back over the season, that he hasn&apos;t always delivered in the manner we might have expected,&quot; he said. &quot;There have been occasions, as at Silverstone and Hockenheim, where he has dominated the field in a truly impressive manner, but when he gets bogged down in the pack things don&apos;t always go as well.&quot; Stewart added: &quot;You know, Lewis has some seriously strong opposition from Felipe Massa in his battle for the world championship. Last year I occasionally criticised Massa for a streak of inconsistency - he was all peaks and valleys, if you like - but this year he has addressed that and I would have to say that he is probably the most improved driver of the year. If you look at his record, you might conclude that Lewis has been the more inconsistent of the two.&quot; The issue of the comparative performance potential of Hamilton&apos;s McLaren-Mercedes MP4-23 and the Ferrari F2008 driven by Massa will also play a major part in the outcome of the championship battle, particularly taking into account the possibility of rain during tomorrow&apos;s race at the Shanghai International Circuit. &quot;In my opinion the Ferrari is a tad better in the dry conditions,&quot; said Stewart, &quot;but I think we&apos;ve seen that Lewis&apos;s McLaren has the edge on grip in the wet, so this might help him this weekend, and we know that there is nothing wrong with his driving in wet conditions. He&apos;s demonstrated that time and again during his brief formula one career.&quot; At the end of the day Stewart believes that success in formula one is all about managing your expectations and seeing the bigger picture. &quot;I was watching an old video of the start of the 1973 French grand prix,&quot; he said. &quot;I was on pole position in the Tyrrell, but made a poor start, and sat behind the leading bunch waiting to see how things panned out. That day, in the end I only managed to finish fourth. But I finished.

Felipe Massa, Hamilton&apos;s main title rival, will start from third position after setting a best time that was more than half a second slower than Hamilton. Robert Kubica \u2013 the only other driver capable of claiming this year&apos;s crown - suffered handling problems and will start from twelfth position. Hamilton needs to secure six points more than Massa in order to win the title. &quot;The qualifying was one of our best,&quot; said Hamilton, who is thought to be light fuelled. &quot;To be honest I did not have anything hanging over me. It was just a point of going out and doing it. It was tough for sure, everyone was very competitive, but I&apos;m very happy I got the lap done.&quot;  There was some bad luck for Hamilton, however, as his team-mate Heikki Kovalainen could only set the fifth fastest time. He will be unable to play a supporting role at the start of the race, lining up behind Fernando Alonso, the Renault driver having said he will help Massa to the title if possible.  Hamilton dominated the early stages of qualifying, needing just one run to set the fastest time in Q1, while both Ferraris needed further laps to ensure their places through to Q2. The McLaren&apos;s first Q2 run, on hard tyres, was only good for fifth, however, with Massa topping the sheets on the softer rubber in his first flying lap. But Hamilton went out again towards the end of the Q2 session and set the top time again, by two tenths over his Ferrari title rival. In Hamilton&apos;s first run in Q3, his time was just less than sixth tenths slower than the pace-setter Raikkonen, with Massa marginally ahead of the McLaren. But Hamilton&apos;s final flying lap was three tenths up on Raikkonen to secure him the best starting slot from which to attempt to claim the title. &quot;I lost six tenths [in my first Q3 lap],&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;It was all good until turn eight. I had a big oversteer moment, ran wide and was on the marbles and lost six or seven tenths. I had to finish the lap, I could not bail out. I knew where it was and made sure it worked next time.&quot;  In the post-qualifying press conference Massa could not resist mentioning the start of last weekend&apos;s Japanese grand prix, where Hamilton started from pole but was passed by Raikkonen at the start and then received a drive-through penalty for his attempt to get back into the lead at the first corner.  &quot;We were struggling a little bit during the weekend, struggling to make the right lap, it&apos;s quite difficult to put everything together,&quot; said Massa. &quot;It looks like the McLaren guys had an easier car to put a lap together. However, we do not know how it&apos;s going to be in the race \u2013 we had a similar position in the last race. [I will] try to just see if we can improve a little bit, especially in the long stints.&quot;  Kubica, who is the third man in the drivers&apos; title hunt, reported an understeer problem and went out in Q2. His already slim title chances took a major hit and he will line up in 12th place for tomorrow&apos;s race. Renault&apos;s Nelson Piquet and Toyota&apos;s Timo Glock also failed to make it through to Q3, as both Toro Rossos again qualified in the top ten.  Red Bull&apos;s Mark Webber qualified in sixth position, but will receive a 10 place penalty for tomorrow&apos;s starting grid after suffering a spectacular blown engine in Saturday&apos;s morning practice. David Coulthard failed to make it out of the first qualifying session in the penultimate grand prix of his career, the Red Bull driver finding himself blocked by BMW&apos;s Nick Heidfeld during his hot lap. Heidfeld was subsequently demoted three places and will start from ninth position tomorrow, with Coulthard starting 15th in front of Webber. &quot;It was very unsportsmanlike behaviour,&quot; said Coulthard. &quot;All he did was screw up my last flying lap. There wasn&apos;t any intention of him doing a quicker time.&quot;  Force India&apos;s pairing of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella, who the team has confirmed it will retain next season, will line up on the back of the grid.

It&apos;s the only question that matters and the young Briton has put himself in exactly the right position to do it by qualifying on pole position for the Chinese grand prix. It is 50 years to the day since Mike Hawthorn claimed Britain&apos;s first ever drivers&apos; title - for Ferrari - and if Hamilton can do it today he&apos;ll become the ninth Brit to see his name etched on that trophy.  So, what does Hamilton need to do to avenge last year&apos;s disappointment and win that title? Here are some scenarios if all three title contenders finish the race. If the following happens, Hamilton does it...1 Hamilton wins and Felipe Massa finishes the race no higher than fifth2 Hamilton finishes second, Massa finishes no higher than seventh position and Robert Kubica does not win3 Hamilton finishes third, Massa finishes out of the points, and Kubica does not win or finish second  Of course, I could spent hours doodling and plotting different situations - a meteor wipes out the McLaren prat perch; a giant duck plucks Massa from his cockpit - but there&apos;s less than 30 minutes to go until the start of the race, so let&apos;s not bother.

Giancarlo Fisichella, Italy, Force India  Mystic mog: what are your predictions for the race Gem, I can hear you cry from under your duvets. Well, to say the start isn&apos;t going to be easy for Hamilton is to understate the mental challenge of getting over last weekend&apos;s Fuji fluff-up, to ignore the bright-red danger to his side and immediately behind and to banish from memory last year&apos;s Shanghai surprise, when the Briton&apos;s world title chances creepy-crawled into the gravel here. Running mate Kovalainen should be up there in a supporting role, but he&apos;s on the third row having qualified behind Alonso - the man who has said he will help Massa to win the title. Sheesh! I think Hamilton will make a mint start, repel Ferrari&apos;s challenge and drive to a cool victory... but I think Massa will finish in second place and take the showdown to Sao Paulo. We&apos;ve seen a catalogue of mistakes from both the big title challengers this season, but I think this race is too critical to mess up. The again, we probably thought that last year...  For the record, Hamilton has said he will use last weekend&apos;s erroneous start as an experience not to repeat and that he&apos;s driving for points, not the title, today. Here he strides, out to the grid, a quick thumbs up for the camera. What a cool cucumber.  I&apos;ve not mentioned Robert Kubica, have I? Well, given that he&apos;s back down in 12th on the grid, he&apos;s a little difficult to spot. Understeer and poor balance wrecked his qualifying and he&apos;s said that it&apos;s unlikely he&apos;ll win the title now. Personally, I think it should go to Hamilton or Massa anyway - they&apos;ve been the boys to watch - but while there&apos;s a mathematical possibility you never know.  Good morning Gary Naylor, thanks for your email and a blindingly obvious scenario that I overlooked: &apos;Lewis and Massa finish together in a Parisian courtroom and nobody wins?&apos;  The weather looks fine at the moment, warm and dry, but rain is predicted in the closing stages. No sleet forecast, though.  Did I just hear a muffled cackle escaping from Alonso&apos;s helmet?  I wonder how he&apos;s going to help Massa to win the title? Hop into the Ferrari? Lend him his lucky kecks? Get in front of Hamilton and hit the &apos;tacks&apos; and &apos;oil slick&apos; buttons?  The cars are heading around to prepare for the start, Hamilton is on the harder tyre but both Ferraris are on the soft option. BMW have just told Kubica over the intercom that there could be rain fairly soon...  Hamilton&apos;s engineer tells him &apos;brakes are good, brakes are good&apos;. Phew! That&apos;ll make things a bit easier. Official weather forecast: 40 per cent chance of rain.  Start: Here we go... Hamilton makes a good start and retains the lead. Clean into the first corner this weekend... Top three same as at the start but Kovalainen battling Alonso.  Lap one:  Hamilton leads from Raikkonen, Massa, Alonso and Kovalainen. The Finnish McLaren driver had got past the Renault but Alonso reclaimed the position. Behind them it&apos;s Heidfeld, Vettel and Kubica - the Pole up to eighth after a strong first lap.  Lap two: Trulli has pitted for a new nose after a clash at the first corner on the first lap. He must have collided with Bourdais - who has dropped to 18th position.  Lap three: Hamilton&apos;s lead over Raikkonen is 2.5seconds and Massa is 4.1seconds off the man he is fighting for the title with.  Lap four: Trulli pits again, this time to retire, our first non-finisher of the race. Webber is fighting Barrichello for P10. Hamilton just shy of 5seconds ahead of third-placed Massa - the McLaren is flying.  Lap five: Here&apos;s the order - Hamilton, Raikkonen, Massa, Alonso, Kovalainen, Heidfeld, Vettel, Kubica, Piquet, Barrichello, Webber, Glock, Rosberg, Coulthard, Button, Nakajima, Bourdais, Sutil, Fisichella  Lap six:  Ferrari must be concerned about Hamilton&apos;s superior pace. He&apos;s steadily pulling away at the head of the field - now 3.5seconds over Raikkonen and 6.1seconds over Massa. The Brazilian&apos;s pace in particular should be worrying the boys in red. Hamilton has just done a 1min36 (the new fastest lap) and Massa&apos;s almost a second slower.  Lap seven: Webber has taken tenth from Barrichello at the final corner.  Lap eight: Hamilton still the only man to set a 1m36 and there&apos;s not much else to report other than his stonking pace.  Graham Wayne has sent me a riddle. At least, I don&apos;t have a clue what he&apos;s on about. But that could be because I should by rights be tucked up in bed. He says: &apos;Hamilton gets away properly without taking to the countryside. And this despite the little seen interference to his car on the grid when some very confused US Republicans were caught smearing lipstick on his tyres...&apos;  Lap ten: Webber has passed Piquet for ninth at the final corner. Piquet&apos;s engineers kindly tell him not to worry, as the man from Down Under is running light. Aw, that&apos;s nice of them. So much for Briatore&apos;s tough love.  Charlie Whiting has stuck his hand outside the window and now says there&apos;s just a 20 per cent chance of rain.  Lap 11: Raikkonen has set the fastest lap with 1m36.612s and Massa has also dipped below the 1m37 mark as the Ferrari&apos;s get up to Hamilton&apos;s pace.  Lap 13: Webber pits - as insinuated by the Renault engineers. Hamilton had a slide running through turn two but still sets a time four tenths up on Raikkonen. Rosberg has passed Glock.  Lap 14: The Ferrari mechanics are in the pit lane... but McLaren&apos;s boys in bacofoil haven&apos;t jumped up. Massa pits!  Lap 15: Alonso also pitted at the same time. Massa rejoins in eighth behind Kubica and Alonso comes in behind Piquet in tenth. Now the McLaren engineers come out.  Lap 16: Raikkonen pits at same time as Hamilton. The McLaren gets out first - keeping to harder tyres - and they rejoin separated by Vettel, which is more good news for Hamilton. Sutil has retired.  Lap 17: Massa has kept on the softer tyres. Hamilton is 5.6seconds ahead of Raikkonen. And Kovalainen - yet to pit - leads from Heidfeld.  Lap 18: Heidfeld has now pitted. A bit further down the grid, Barrichello is holding his own in tenth. It might not be in the points, but it marks a good afternoon for the Brazilian Honda driver.  Lap 19: Kovalainen now pits, as does Vettel, with both staying on the harder tyre. Hamilton leads again. This is looking good for the Brit.  Lap 20: Hamilton&apos;s lead over Raikkonen is now 6.9seconds. Kubica - who has yet to pit - is in third ahead of Massa. The Brazilian&apos;s deficit to Hamilton is 14.1seconds...  Graham Wayne  - who I hope isn&apos;t the only person reading this LbL - says: &apos;stand by for rain \u2013 it&apos;s my real worry now, that everything will go weird in the wet \u2013 but Hamilton is looking like a champ to me...&apos; I wish he was, Graham, but if Massa finishes in third then he won&apos;t be champ in this race. Graham also adds that his humour is still warming up. Anyone else know any good jokes?  Lap 23: There really isn&apos;t much to report at the moment... Raikkonen&apos;s pace is pretty much matching Hamilton&apos;s. Piquet pits.  Hello Kate Connolly! Nice to hear from you again. &quot;I can&apos;t believe that James Allen just wasted valuable commentary time telling us about Lewis Hamilton&apos;s little brother taking his GCSEs,&quot; you grumble. Me neither. I mean, I know there isn&apos;t too much excitement at the moment, but really. &quot;Who&apos;s your favourite driver? Not necessarily who&apos;s the best driver, but who do you find yourself rooting for? You know how I love Kubica, and I&apos;m also rather partial to poor old Bourdais myself, which means I spend a lot of time being dismayed, and outraged after last race. He was robbed!&quot; I certainly agree that Bourdais was robbed - although my post-race blog picking on the stewards raised a bit of ire. Personally, I&apos;m rooting for Hamilton. He&apos;s been the most exciting driver to watch the season and has the most commitment in races. He may have made mistakes, but he hasn&apos;t put in dismal performances like Massa in Silverstone.  Lap 27: Kubica has not pitted and Raikkonen has now made up time on Hamilton. The Ferrari driver has reduced the gap to 6.4seconds. Massa is 15.4seconds behind Hamilton.  Graham Crawford emails: &apos;Will Alonso now make no attempt to get past Massa, to further his grudge against Hamilton? That would be rather disgraceful, wouldn&apos;t it? (Being paid millions to race and not racing.)&apos; Sooo true Graham. Alonso is 6.4seconds behind Massa but I can&apos;t see him putting his foot down. Half the race is now run - not exactly a thriller, is it?  David Goodrum is stuck at work and following the LbL but has no jokes. Who are you rooting for David? Do you want Hamilton to sock it to Massa?  Lap 29: Coulthard and Fisichella have pitted. Two of the oldest and two of the slowest in this race... cruel but accurate.  Marcus Gearey (fab racing name Gearey) asks how many coffees I&apos;ve downed this morning. None is the answer, as there were no shops open on my way into the office at 6.30sm sadly. &quot;I&apos;ve had 2 pit stops,&quot; says Marcus. &quot;I took on a double espresso at 7AM but had to take on an extra single 15 minutes ago. If it carries on at this stultifyingly dull level of excitement I may need another splash and dash though I figured perhaps with a cheeky dash of chocolate sprinkles for a level of excitement sufficient to drag me to the kitchen in the first place. Can I promote my &quot;hilarious&quot; F1 comedy website pitflaps.com? I had 14 hits last month which I believe may be some sort of internet-indifference record though I&apos;d be grateful if anybody could confirm as I could do with the publicity...any publicity.&quot; Let&apos;s all check it out...  Lap 32: Webber and Nakajima have both pitted. Raikkonen has flicked the bird to Fisichella when he lost a second getting past the Force India. The order is still the same at the front and Hamilton&apos;s lead over Raikkonen is 8seconds.  Bear with me... this is great. Brian Garvey says: &quot;Lewis Hamilton and Philippa Masa walk into a bar. Lewis asks for a pint and Massa asks for... a... hm... hm... ?... hm... - a shandy. Barman asks: why the big paws? Because Massa was dressed a bear!  Lap 35: A right front puncture for Heikki Kovalainen! This isn&apos;t good for McLaren&apos;s constructors&apos; title hopes. He&apos;s crawling round trying to get to the pits...  Good morning Simon Woods! &apos;The TV keeps telling me that Hamilton will want to turn the revs down a bit... but doesn&apos;t he still have his joker engine change to use?&apos; Yes, I believe he does. But perhaps you&apos;re only allowed to use it if you can prove your current unit is bust? Sorry, I don&apos;t have a definitive answer on this one.  Lap 37: Alonso has pitted and the Ferrari mechanics are preparing for a driver... it&apos;s Massa. Martin Whitmarsh is shown timing the rival&apos;s stop.  Ben emails from Sao Paulo: &apos;Spare a thought for me - not only did I have to wake up for a 5am start, but I&apos;m a lone Brit amongst friends and family all rooting for Massa. While Hamilton seems to be handling the pressure ok so far, I wonder how he&apos;d fare if he knew that his eventual victory would mean unashamed mockery on my part of every Brazilian I meet (which is everyone everyday)?&apos;  Lap 39: Hamilton and Raikkonen both pit and change to soft tyres. Again no dramas.  Dave Goodrum emails: &apos;Would love to see Hamilton win it, but would like to see Massa finish high enough for the racing to continue. I always think that the edge goes off if the championship is decided too early. Plus I enjoy the bitching that&apos;s been going on between the drivers, I think its great!&apos; Dave you wag, enjoying all the tit-for-tat. I&apos;m getting a bit fed up of it personally and, although I understand your reasons, I fear that if the title goes down to the finale it&apos;ll be Massa who wins it, not Hamilton. Which wouldn&apos;t be good for Ben from Sao Paulo...  Lap 40: Just two seconds between Raikkonen and Massa... how obvious will he make it when he lets Massa past? Not very.  Lap 42: Vettel has pitted from sixth position, but it&apos;s a bit of a tardy stop. The German is quietly having another good race. Kovalainen has passed Rosberg... for 15th... as he fights his way back from the puncture.  Tim in Spain has just sent an interesting email: &apos;Morning all, presumably Alonso imagines he is already on Ferrari&apos;s payroll? According to the totally biased press over here Ferrari are desperate to get rid of Raikkonen, who is all washed up in their opinion, and replace him with the perpetually whining (my opinion) Alonso. Having said that I am rooting for Massa, so carry on doing nothing Fernando.&apos;  Martin Warren asks: &apos;Why the change to soft tyres when the others seemed to be doing the trick - thanks?&apos; The drivers have to use both specifications of tyres during the race - those are the rules. Massa appeared to be happier with the balance on the softs earlier but now they have no choice but to run him on the harder tyres.  Lap 46: Button has made the second and final stop in a dismal race. Not that it&apos;s his fault...  Katie has emailed to say: &apos;I don&apos;t think you&apos;re allowed to use your &apos;joker&apos; at the last race.&apos; And she&apos;s completely right... here&apos;s the rule:From 2008, a driver will not be penalised the first time he needs a replacement engine during the season, unless it is at the final event of the championship.So Hamilton might ease off somewhat, with his 15second lead and less than 10 laps to go.  Lap 49: Massa has eased past Raikkonen. It&apos;s a team game, so you can&apos;t really criticise them. Hamilton only looks set to extend his lead by two points... unless there&apos;s rain or an earthquake or a stampede of termites in the next few laps.  Lap 50: Our order, then, is: Hamilton, Massa, Raikkonen, Alonso, Heidfeld, Kubica, Glock, Piquet, Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello, Nakajima, Bourdais, Webber, Rosberg, Button, Fisichella. Kovalainen has retired through brake issues.  A handful of laps left then and it looks certain that the drivers&apos; title will go down to wire in Brazil in a fortnight. What&apos;s the betting that Hamilton&apos;s car will appear on the Interlagos grid covered in bubble wrap to protect it from hits from Alonso and Raikkonen? And the Toro Rossos? The McLaren will only need to finish fifth to win the title there if this race finishes with its current order...  Lap 54: Hamilton&apos;s advantage over Massa is just under 16seconds. It doesn&apos;t look like he&apos;s turning down the wick much.  Last lap: Wake up everybody, it&apos;s over! A dull race but a safe one for Hamilton, who takes the flag. He&apos;s done the best he could and now the title will be decided in Brazil in a fortnight. Thanks to Raikkonen, Massa crosses the line in second position.  Here is how they crossed the line:1 Lewis Hamilton2 Felipe Massa3 Kimi Raikkonen4 Fernando Alonso5 Nick Heidfeld6 Robert Kubica7 Timo Glock8 Nelson Piquet9 Sebastian Vettel10 David Coulthard11 Rubens Barrichello12 Kazuki Nakajima13 Sebastian Bourdais14 Mark Webber15 Nico Rosberg16 Jenson Button17 Giancarlo Fisichella  What it means: Hamilton has proved that he has the mental strength to cope with the pressure of this world title fight. With a seven point advantage, he has to finish no higher than fifth in Interlagos - even if Massa wins - to claim the title. McLaren must have both cars finish if they want to keep in the hunt for the constructors&apos; title, as Ferrari&apos;s advantage is now 11 points after Kovalainen failed to finish.

In the 17 months since Higgins became world champion for the second time, his form has slumped. For much of this year he has been promoting the new World Series, in unlikely snooker locations such as Moscow, Warsaw and Tel Aviv. Consequently, practise time has taken a hit. With self-belief boosted by wins over Stephen Hendry and Ding Junhui in his two previous outings, Higgins compiled breaks of 51, 65, 91 and 78 in establishing a 4-1 lead over Trump, a hugely talented, but raw 19-year-old left-hander from Bristol. This would be no cakewalk, though, as Trump, who caused a huge upset by beating Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan 5-4 in the quarter-finals, began to fire. Indeed, at 4-4, the teenager had grabbed the momentum. Yet for Trump, that was as good as it got. He missed a long red in each of the next two frames and Higgins, with breaks of 61 and 83, reached the Grand Prix final for the seventh time.

Going into Brazil will be different compared to last year. We know we have got to do a good job but it will be tough. I hope as a team we can pull through.&quot;  Hamilton&apos;s win never looked in doubt after the McLaren driver made an excellent start from pole position and pulled away from Kimi Raikkonen to immediately build a secure lead. Robert Kubica&apos;s marginal hopes of winning the title disappeared despite the Pole putting in a strong performance to move his BMW from 11th on the grid to sixth at the finish. &quot;The car is really a dream to drive,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;It was quite straight forward. I managed to get everything right on the formation lap and do a great start - probably one of the best we&apos;ve had. I got into turn one quite clear and took it easy the first few corners, then I started to build the gap. From there it was pretty smooth.&quot; In an uneventful grand prix, the only action came when Raikkonen allowed his team-mate Massa through into second position after the final round of pit stops so the Brazilian could score the maximum points available. Raikkonen followed Massa home in third place as Ferrari&apos;s constructors&apos; title hopes were boosted by the retirement of Hamilton&apos;s team-mate Heikki Kovalainen who suffered a puncture and then brake problems to end his race. Ferrari&apos;s lead is now 11 points over McLaren. &quot;We saw Lewis was a lot stronger in the beginning of the race,&quot; said Massa. &quot;We were trying to reduce the gap but it was not possible. At least we managed to finish second and third. For the drivers&apos; championship it was not fantastic, but for the constructors it was very good.&quot; Chinese grand prix results: 1.

Seven days on from a disastrous race in Japan, Hamilton&apos;s dominant performance in Shanghai was the perfect antidote which sees the McLaren driver go to the final race at Interlagos with a seven-point lead over Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa. Even if the Brazilian wins his home race on November 2, Hamilton only needs to finish in the top five to secure his first title. &quot;We know what we have to do,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;We will use a similar approach to this weekend.&quot; Hamilton had to overcome a barrage of criticism following a first-lap incident in Japan. The Englishman was accused of aggressive driving when a poor start led him to run wide at the first corner and take several drivers with him. He was under pressure not to repeat the mistake yesterday when, once again, he started from pole with the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen alongside.  Hamilton made a perfect getaway and began to demoralise the pursuing Ferraris by gradually pulling away. As has become the norm, it took the Ferraris longer to get their tyres up to working temperature but, once fully up to speed, Raikkonen could not reduce the six-second gap. &quot;When my car got better, he [Hamilton] had already pulled away,&quot; said Raikkonen. &quot;OK, I lost time in traffic, but we just didn&apos;t have the speed today. We were missing a few tenths [of a second] and there was nothing I could do.&quot; The McLaren-Mercedes had the measure of the Ferraris from the start of practice on Friday, Hamilton making the most of his advantage with another brilliant lap to take pole position, his seventh of the season. Once he had managed his start and safely negotiated the first sequence of corners, Hamilton then focused on producing a succession of near-perfect laps. &quot;From Friday, we knew we had the pace,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;I was very happy with the balance of the car and I was able to extract the most from the tyres. Both types of tyre were very competitive and consistent. I was able to push when I needed to and it was great to be able to open a gap in the early stages.&quot; Hamilton led by 6.6 seconds at the first of two pit stops, the McLaren driver extending his advantage to more than 10 seconds as Raikkonen turned his attention to his team-mate. Massa had struggled throughout qualifying and his troubles continued in the race.  &quot;Today was very difficult to follow this guy [Hamilton] and fight with him,&quot; said Massa. &quot;Our car works in a different way [from the McLaren]. There was no grip and it was difficult to drive. I had some wheel-spin at the start but I could see that Lewis was stronger. He was able to pull out a couple of tenths [of a second] a lap and that made his race more comfortable. I had to drive on the limit to try and reduce the gap but it just was not possible, Lewis had a better car for the whole weekend. That&apos;s the way it seems to be this season. Our car works well on some circuits but not on others and for this race we&apos;re not really sure why that was.&quot; Although team orders are not allowed, Raikkonen had no hesitation in taking the law into his own hands. With eight laps remaining, the Finn repaid Massa who had given up victory in Brazil last year to allow Raikkonen the result he needed to beat Hamilton to the championship by a single point. By moving into second place yesterday, Massa scored eight points instead of six. &quot;I&apos;m not in a position to challenge for the championship and I know what the team expects from me,&quot; said Raikkonen. &quot;I&apos;m happy to achieve the maximum points for the team. It doesn&apos;t make any difference to me.&quot; When asked for his opinion on Raikkonen&apos;s assistance, Hamilton said he would expect the same should he find himself in a similar position behind his team-mate, Heikki Kovalainen. The Finn, who had never been in a position to help Hamilton, retired with engine trouble for the second race in succession. McLaren previously had not suffered engine problems since 2006. Hamilton is scheduled to use the same engine for the final race. If McLaren decide to change it in Brazil, Hamilton will receive a 10-place grid penalty. By finishing sixth yesterday, Robert Kubica lost an already slim chance of challenging for the championship, the Polish driver having struggled to make his BMW work. Fernando Alonso, the unexpected winner of the previous two races, finished fourth. Coupled with eighth place for Nelson Piquet, Alonso&apos;s recent competitive run has secured fourth place in the constructors&apos; championship for Renault in their battle with Toyota. Timo Glock took seventh place in the sole-surviving Toyota after Jarno Trulli had been eliminated in a first-corner collision with the Toro Rosso of S\u00e9bastien Bourdais, the only incident in a race that was dull for everyone with the exception of the winner.  &quot;All weekend we have had God on our side,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;The team have done a phenomenal job preparing the car and making the steps forward. They made sure the car stayed intact so I could bring it home - and that&apos;s what I did.&quot;", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-19T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/20/formulaone-lewishamilton1", "sentences": ["The 23-year-old is seven points ahead of Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa who finished second here in Shanghai."], "title": "Formula one: Lewis Hamilton has one hand on world title after Chinese victory", "article": "Lewis Hamilton moved a step closer to capturing the world championship by winning the Chinese grand prix yesterday.

I made a good start and was able to lap consistently from the beginning.

That was a great effort by Henman, though nobody really expected him to get to the final, let alone win the tournament. Now, when the TMC begins in Shanghai in just under three weeks&apos; time, there seems a strong possibility that Andy Murray, winner of yesterday&apos;s Madrid Masters with a 6-4, 7-6 victory over Gilles Simon of France, could bring his season to a most glorious winning conclusion. Murray has won the past two Masters series, the other being in Cincinnati, and in between reached his first grand slam final at the US Open where he was beaten by Roger Federer. This rich spell of form has seen him rise to No4 in the world behind Rafa Nadal, Federer and Novak Djokovic, convincing the tennis world, if it needed convincing, that he is now poised to become the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win a major. &quot;It is the one ambition I have left,&quot; said Murray. Certainly of those players threatening Nadal and Federer, Murray has the most variety and talent. He is also a consummate competitor, as he showed throughout last week on the Madrid indoor courts, notably during his semi-final win against Federer on Saturday, the third time he had beaten the Swiss former world No1 in five meetings. Murray beat Federer 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, a performance that partly atoned for last month&apos;s emphatic defeat in the final of the US Open. The British No1 made errors in the first set but admirably his temperament was not affected, an improvement in Murray&apos;s game that Federer acknowledged. Murray&apos;s victory ensured that Nadal, this year&apos;s French Open and Wimbledon champion, would finish the season as the world No1 for the first time. Nadal would dearly have loved to reach the final in front of his home crowd, though on this occasion it was the unsung Simon who prevailed in the second semi-final which lasted well over three hours. In all the 23-year-old Frenchman had played five three set matches before the final, winning four on third set tie-breaks, and saving six match points in total. Small wonder that, like Murray in the US Open final, he was more than a little weary. Simon, who retains a good chance of a surprise Shanghai place, and seems likely to finish the year as the French No1 ahead of the more illustrious Richard Gasquet, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and Ga\u00ebl Monfils, was always dangerous and twice within a point of taking the final into a third set. But Murray saved his very best until last, notably a crushing backhand service-return winner to set up championship point. There was no doubt that entering the final as the favourite tugged at Murray&apos;s nerves: &quot;I had planned to play a little bit better and perhaps put a little bit too much pressure on myself but my serve was awesome and that&apos;s why I won the tournament.&quot; By doing so, Murray became the first British player in the Open era to win four titles in a year, and the first to win two Masters Series, Henman and Greg Rusedski having both won the Paris Indoor Open. This was also Murray&apos;s seventh career title. Simon has a superb temperament and had won his previous five finals, albeit at a much lower level, while like Murray he has also defeated Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic this year. More will be heard of him, though it is Murray who is likely to reach altogether more rarefied heights at slam level. He is beginning to win matches with ease, a trait of Federer, and has a tactical brain that allows him to both develop and change strategy as his matches demand. All but gone are the outbursts and rages, a calmness pervading his game based on the secure knowledge, after hours on the track and in the gym, that his physical fitness now complements and enhances his multiple talents. Assuming he suffers no major injury then there appears no reason why, after more than 70 years, Britain should not have a men&apos;s singles slam champion again in the near future. Make no mistake, Murray is that good.

He shone brightest among those contemporaries who emerged after the establishment of the people&apos;s republic in 1949 and was one of the few directors to continue to make films during and after the cultural revolution. It was not an easy ride. Accused of bourgeois humanism, he was forced to do manual labour in the countryside and spent time under house arrest. Later, he was accused by some of being an opportunistic party hack because he was enlisted to help Mao Zedong&apos;s wife, Jiang Qing, direct the &quot;model opera&quot; films during her time as a member of the Gang of Four.  Born in Shaoxing, Xie grew up during the Japanese invasion of the 1930s and attended the Jiang-an school of dramatic art in Szechuan, where he studied Ibsen, Shakespeare and Chekhov. In 1949, shortly before the end of the Chinese civil war, he got a job as assistant director at the Datong film studio in Shanghai, directing his first film, A Crisis, four years later. Xie, who admitted to being influenced by Soviet cinema, which he said had &quot;a profound moral seriousness and depth&quot;, soon became the most celebrated of the directors who formed what was to be known as the Third Generation.  It was his third film, Woman Basketball Player Number Five (1957), that established his reputation as a &quot;woman&apos;s director&quot;. It depicted the different fortunes of sportsmen and women before and after the birth of the new China. By combining socialist realism with the aesthetics of Hollywood melodramas, Xie created an extremely popular genre. &quot;My childhood memory remains full of oppressed, victimised women,&quot; he explained in an interview with Da Huo&apos;er in Jump Cut. &quot;Under feudal oppression, the suffering of men could not be compared to that of women. To say the least, a man was allowed to keep several wives, while a widow was never permitted to marry again. It would bring too much shame on her family.&quot;  Red Detachment of Women (1961), a classic revolutionary film, follows Qiong Hua from an abused servant of a cruel warlord to her role as heroic leader of a troop of women soldiers, after being rescued by a party representative. It was a dramatic examination of the role of the revolution in reshaping attitudes to gender. The film revealed a vivid sense of colour, composition and inventive camera angles, as did the finely crafted Two Stage Sisters (1965).  This film tells of two girls who become stars of a travelling opera group. One is seduced by materialism, gives up singing, marries and drifts into misery; the other commits herself to the revolution and forms a women&apos;s cooperative opera company. Although probably Xie&apos;s masterpiece, he recalled: &quot;I was forced to change the script. I couldn&apos;t finish it the way I would have liked. If I could redo the second part now, it would improve the entire film.&quot;  Two Stage Sisters was one of the last films made before the cultural revolution, during which only six films were made, all of them crudely propagandistic though visually striking, some being revised ballet versions of previous films, such as The Red Detachment of Women (1970). Xie was released from labour camp to direct three of them, aesthetically and politically at odds with the rest of his work.  After the cultural revolution, film production picked up, much of it highly critical of that period. Xie answered criticism that he had betrayed his conscience by making Legend of Tianyun Mountain (1980), which presented a bleak picture of a young girl pressured by Red Guards to leave her intellectual lover for political reasons. Hibiscus Town (1986), which detailed some of the sins of the 1960s, was a huge hit in China, and although cut by more than 30 minutes in the export version, it remains a powerful study of an era as seen through the eyes of a brave victim. The main strength of the film is its avoidance of rhetoric and stereotypes - even the local activist villains appear all too human - and its ability to move between political and social satire, comedy and realism, within the framework of a sweeping melodrama.  Xie&apos;s films continued to be popular in China throughout the 1980s, though he was pushed aside on the international stage by the Fifth Generation of film-makers - those directors who graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in the late 1970s (the most famous being Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou).  Xie&apos;s social concern and sense of historical context - and the fact that he avoided politically sensitive subjects - meant his films were more acceptable to the regime than some of those by the Fifth Generation, though he avoided blatant nationalism and simplistic messages. For example, The Last Aristocrats (1989), partially shot in the US, deals with the lives of three young middle-class Chinese women studying in America, and the difficulties they face when trying to return to their homeland after 1949. Though certainly unflattering to life under capitalism, it showed sympathy for its victims.  At around $15m, The Opium War (1997), Xie&apos;s penultimate film, was one of the most expensive to be made by a Chinese studio. Pointedly released to coincide with the return of Hong Kong, it tells of the clash between two empires, the British and the Qing dynasty, in the 1840s. Although anti-colonialist, it is balanced in its treatment. While shown worldwide to much acclaim, Woman Soccer Player Number 9 (2001), in which Xie returned to the subject of women&apos;s sports, was meant for home consumption.  Xie was the only Chinese director to be made a member of both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Directors&apos; Guild of America. He leaves his wife; a son predeceased him. \u2022 Xie Jin, film director, born November 21 1923; died October 18 2008", "tags": ["Film", "China", "Culture", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-19T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/20/formulaone-lewishamilton", "sentences": ["By producing a statistically perfect performance in Shanghai yesterday - pole position, fastest lap, race win - Lewis Hamilton ensured that he sped clear of the noxious gases that surrounded him in the build-up to the Chinese grand prix.", "In Shanghai the two Ferrari drivers simply had no answer to the speed of the 23-year-old Englishman and his McLaren-Mercedes.", "In front of a fervent crowd trying to add a few more horsepower to Massa&apos;s Ferrari engine, he and the team will have to decide whether to try to take the result out of the opposition&apos;s hands by going for another Shanghai-type performance, or to play it safe."], "title": "Formula one: Leader Lewis Hamilton uses his head amid the mind games as canny teamwork keeps Massa in the hunt", "article": "For the driver at the front there are no fumes, actual or metaphorical, burning the throat and clogging the nostrils. By producing a statistically perfect performance in Shanghai yesterday - pole position, fastest lap, race win - Lewis Hamilton ensured that he sped clear of the noxious gases that surrounded him in the build-up to the Chinese grand prix. Now there will be two more weeks of renewed outpourings from his enemies, aimed at destabilising a driver whose arrival on the grid last season undermined a lot of comfortable assumptions. Yesterday, however, Hamilton demonstrated his ability to rise above the psychological warfare. In Shanghai the two Ferrari drivers simply had no answer to the speed of the 23-year-old Englishman and his McLaren-Mercedes. It would have been fitting, in a way, for him to have secured his first world championship 50 years to the day since Mike Hawthorn became the first British driver to take the title. Hamilton would have won it entirely on his own merits, as well, whereas Hawthorn required the gift of second place from his Ferrari team-mate, Phil Hill, in Casablanca on October 19, 1958 in order to secure the result that put him one point ahead of his compatriot and great rival Stirling Moss in the final standings. That was the way they did things in those days, and no one complained because grand prix racing has always been a team sport, despite the efforts of a governing body that makes up its rules as it goes along. Six years ago, attempting to appease ignoramuses on the one hand and bookmakers on the other, the FIA outlawed internal co-operation after Rubens Barrichello handed Michael Schumacher a win under orders in Austria. Yesterday Kimi Raikkonen relinquished his second place to Felipe Massa in the closing laps and admirably refused to dissimulate in the post-race press conference. &quot;We work together as a team,&quot; he said, and quite right, too, although Massa, the recipient of his generosity, appeared a great deal less cheerful about the implications of the day&apos;s outcome. Look out for a row about this in the coming days. Ferrari, it will be said in some quarters, may try to cheat Hamilton out of his title by ganging up on him. But the drivers&apos; championship has often been won that way. Even the great Fangio owed one of his five titles to a gesture by his Ferrari team-mate Peter Collins, a Hamilton of his day, in handing over his car during the race at Monza in 1956. The best way to avoid such problems is always to get the lead at the start and stay clear of the pursuers. That was what Hamilton did yesterday, showing a genuinely magisterial presence, and it meant that Ferrari could reduce the damage to Massa&apos;s chances only by manipulating second and third places. Behind the red cars it was interesting to see Fernando Alonso, who has expressed a desire to see Massa become champion at Hamilton&apos;s expense, remain in fourth place behind the Ferraris throughout the race, keeping a safe distance in a car that had been good enough to win the two previous races. If I were Carlos Ghosn, the president of Renault and the man who signs the bills run up by Alonso&apos;s team, I would be wanting to know why the driver did not mount a more aggressive challenge for a place on the podium. No good asking Flavio Briatore, of course. The egregious Italian, who combines the job of supervising the running of the Renault team with that of managing Alonso&apos;s career, stooped to new depths during the week when, in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, he expressed the opinion that Hamilton is &quot;no Muhammad Ali&quot;. Briatore was said to have apologised later, which only confirmed that there had been something to apologise for. Sometimes you don&apos;t have to scratch these people very hard to discover what lies beneath. Alonso, of course, nurses a serious grudge against his former McLaren team-mate. As Hamilton put it last week, in response to the Spaniard&apos;s opinions: &quot;He was a double world champion who came into the team and got beaten by a rookie. That says it all.&quot; No doubt Hamilton is guilty of occasional errors that sometimes damage other people&apos;s chances. Mark Webber and Jarno Trulli are among those critical of his occasional displays of excessive ambition, but the criticism from younger drivers such as Alonso and even Robert Kubica is primarily motivated by a desire to stop their rival becoming world champion. Their fear must be that Hamilton&apos;s first title will be merely the overture to a run of Schumacher-like proportions. Yesterday he drove impeccably from the front, just like Jim Clark used to. It is when others get ahead of him, as Raikkonen did off the starting grid at the Fuji Speedway a week earlier, that his judgment can go awry. Now he needs only a fifth place at Interlagos in a fortnight to be sure of the title. In front of a fervent crowd trying to add a few more horsepower to Massa&apos;s Ferrari engine, he and the team will have to decide whether to try to take the result out of the opposition&apos;s hands by going for another Shanghai-type performance, or to play it safe. Simply sitting behind the Ferraris, however, would put him at risk of mixing it with Alonso, Kubica and others, introducing an element of unpredictability.  Many well-wishers, including former champions, will counsel caution. But Hamilton is a racing driver. Best, probably, to go with the instincts and just try to win the thing.  What they need Lewis Hamilton  The Briton will secure the world title if he finishes fifth or higher at the Brazilian grand prix in Interlagos on November 2. Should he finish sixth or seventh, he will still take the title if Massa fails to win the race. If Hamilton comes eighth he will need Massa to finish outside the top two places. Any lower, and he would need Massa to finish third or worse Felipe Massa The Brazilian needs to be first or second in his home grand prix to have a chance of snatching the title. He will be champion if he wins and Hamilton is sixth or lower (sixth place for the Briton would bring them level on points but Massa will have won one more race). Massa can also win it if he finishes second and Hamilton is eighth or lower. Were they to finish level on 95 points, Massa&apos;s greater number of second places would count in his favour", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-19T23:40:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/17/bernadine-evaristo-short-story-china", "sentences": ["The Misty Mountain Heritage Complex was a three-hour drive out of the smoggy city of Shanghai.", "It still rang out on the hour every hour, its mighty bell resounding over the mountain and reaching, some imagined, as far as Shanghai."], "title": "Short story: A Matter of Timing by Bernardine Evaristo", "article": "The Misty Mountain Heritage Complex was a three-hour drive out of the smoggy city of Shanghai. A vertiginous, winding road coiled breathlessly around miles of bamboo forest until arriving at the great stone walls of the fortified complex. Heavy electronic gates guarded the entrance, Kalashnikov-wielding soldiers stood high on the wall, and a long, patient queue of visitors snaked down the grey stone pathways, their tour buses parked along the side of the road. April clouds descended from the skies bathing the whole vista in a light drizzle before slipping off down the slopes to hover as thick mist.  The heritage complex opened soon after The Great Expansion resulted in a new curiosity about the countries which had been grasped by the colonial tentacles of the Republic. Several nations of the world were represented inside its walls through exhibitions which were assemblies of plundered historical relics, monuments and human zoos. Britain, a country about which so little had been known during the period of The Long Isolation, soon emerged as the foremost object of interest for the millions of visitors who came up the mountain every year. The citizens of the Republic were fascinated by the unfathomable British obsession with all things past and ancient. The Republic&apos;s own royal historical lineage had long remained in its rightful place \u2013 in museums, as evidence of a decidedly decadent and non-egalitarian past. Why, they wondered, walk with one foot chained to history when it made the long march forwards so slow? Why favour the old over the new, when the new was always better? Why choose to live in a draughty old house with so-called &apos;character&apos;, when one could live in a sleek, minimalist home? Once they had paid to get inside and had their bags searched for weapons of minor destruction, they headed for the Exhibition of Britain, inescapably positioned to the right of the entrance and protected behind another high wall, this one plastered with pebble dash. Here they encountered &quot;Exhibit No 1&quot;, Charles. Formerly known as His Royal Highness, King Charles III, he could be seen pottering around the cage that had been his home for several years. His only furniture was his country&apos;s state throne, its once-bright crimson seat worn grey and threadbare, the wood of its golden frame scuffed and chipped. Charles was forced to wear, at all times, a heavy ermine cape and a rather tacky papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 crown, painted yellow and studded with plastic diamonds and rubies. The perimeter of his cage was fringed with rows of organic pot plants which Charles spent a lot of time cultivating. Like every other specimen in the human zoo, Charles had been allowed to take one book into his cage. He had chosen The Lost World of the Kalahari, the most famous work of his long-deceased mentor, Laurens van der Post. Charles had fond memories of evenings spent in his rooms at Kensington Palace listening to Laurens&apos;s expert ruminations on the noble savage.  Most of the time he was oblivious to the visitors who jostled each other for a better view, the bolder ones trying to prod and poke him with pointed umbrellas through the bars. When Charles did look up at his audience, the wavy lines indented in his forehead, the perpetual frown of his bushy grey eyebrows, the transparent anguish in his eyes, his pale, ghostly face resembled those of a nineteenth-century tragedian. The sign outside Charles&apos;s cage read: &quot;Once chief of class system, worshipped by his all subjects.&quot; Next to Charles&apos;s cage was that of Mr Thistlewaite (Exhibit No 2), formerly one of the legendary Beefeaters at the Tower of London. Mr Thistlewaite was in his late fifties, balding, pink-faced, stout. He was ex-army (Sergeant), and had always considered himself a decent, upstanding chap. Most importantly (prior to capture), he thought of himself as normal: steak and chips, wife, kids, golf, Tory. He also had a fondness for poetry. John Betjeman&apos;s Collected Poems provided him with stimulating company while incarcerated. As a Beefeater he had been part of the security detail around HRH on state occasions, and it was to his utmost frustration that he could not throttle those voyeuristic bastards who tried to assault his dearly beloved monarch. He spent his days slumped in a corner of his cage, scowling. He wore a ruffled white collar, gabardine jacket embroidered with a gold geometric design, puffed sleeves, matching belt, red gabardine knickerbockers, long white stockings and slip-on shoes with big, gold buckles. The sign outside Mr Thistlewaite&apos;s cage read: &quot;Typical, everyday Englishman.&quot; And so it went on.  Plundered artefacts on display under bomb-proof glass cases, and the vigilant eyes of armed guards, included the entire British Crown Jewels, with the skull-crushing Imperial State Crown as its centrepiece, laden with 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and 5 rubies (Nos 33-84). The visitors oohed, aahed and sighed, but could not touch.  Among the many artefacts there was also the Domesday Book in its own glass cabinet (No 125), the original King James Bible in another (No 126), and the mace from the House of Commons (No 134). Set on a pair of plinths and cordoned off by red rope, were the statue of Eros from Piccadilly Circus (No 167) and the Prince Albert Memorial from Hyde Park (No 168). The visitors also encountered three monuments that had been dismantled, transported thousands of miles, and reassembled. There was &quot;a typical English pub&quot; called Ye Olde Alehouse (No 275), which had thousand-year-old beams hanging low from its ceiling, and paintings of rolling green hills, buxom milkmaids, thatched cottages and grazing cows spread all over its walls. The gargantuan stones of Stonehenge had been carted off and relocated onto the site (No 276), and there was the world&apos;s largest clock, Big Ben (No 277). At nearly 100 metres high this was an edifice so imposing that the visitors gasped and craned their necks to try and see it in its entirety. It still rang out on the hour every hour, its mighty bell resounding over the mountain and reaching, some imagined, as far as Shanghai. Lesser objects included a display of bowler hats, walking sticks and judge&apos;s wigs and gowns. Video screens installed alongside the best-known works of the painter Turner showed extracts from period dramas starring the actresses Helena Bonham-Carter, Kate Winslet and Keira Knightly, as well as the television series Last of the Summer Wine and Brideshead Revisited (Nos 179-255). Eventually the visitors came to a white, concrete, bunker-like building which blocked their route through the complex. They had no choice but to enter the ominous steel door of The British Surveillance Experience (No 362-662). Once inside they were made to walk through a long, narrow, dark, dank tunnel, every inch of its walls and ceiling crammed with sinister infra-red CCTV cameras which performed a silent, robotic ballet of spinning, swerving and dipping. Everyone fell silent and felt a chill as they hurried through the tunnel of unblinking, bloodshot eyes. Audio guides explained that at the time of The Great Expansion, the British had less public privacy than any almost any other country in the world, with over 4 million cameras. People could be recorded on up to 300 of them every day in towns and cities, or on the roads. Everywhere you went electronic eyes were upon you. Outside again in the crisp April air, they walked towards a marble slab (No 663), which resembled a war memorial. Engraved onto it were the names of over 50 countries which had once been subsumed into the British Empire and stripped of their right to self-rule, beginning with Hong Kong. The sign underneath read: &quot;Human right, no joke.&quot; The final display of the Exhibition of Britain (No 666) presented a man formerly known as Anthony Blair, the ex-prime minister of Britain, now simply called Tony. He was having another one of his temper tantrums, jumping up and down on the pantomime head of the decidedly unattractive bulldog outfit he was forced to wear - the bulldog being the national animal of his country, rather as the giant panda was the national animal of the Republic. Security personnel would soon arrive and tell him to put it back on and start barking again, if he wanted any supper that night. His book of choice was How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. The sign outside Tony&apos;s cage read: &quot;War criminal against humanity and all round liar.&quot; Upon exiting the pebble-dash walls of The Exhibition of Britain, most of the visitors felt that their knowledge of this alien country had been enriched and deepened, although few claimed to truly understand the strange ways of the Britishers. Their curiosity satiated, however, they were now ready to find out about the other nations exhibited in the heritage complex in what was, in essence, an economical and condensed mini world tour. For many visitors the next stop would be The Exhibition of America, where George, formerly known as President George Bush II, was made to dress up in a panda costume and chew on bamboo all day long. At the time of his capture he had requested the book The Holy Bible by Jesus Christ, only to be told that it did not exist. Beyond the labyrinth of zoos, cages, museums, monuments and monoliths, was a cage hidden away at the back of the complex that was rarely visited. There was little curiosity, or indeed patience, for the inhabitant of this small, iron-barred abode. Inside the cage resided Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, spiritual and political leader of the country of Tibet. He was a man of advanced years, with little hair. He had pair of eye spectacles, burnt orange robes and the most radiant smile. Left alone these days, the Dalai Lama had a lot of time to think about how humankind could benefit from compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, contentment and self-discipline. Deprived of writing materials he composed books in his head these days. All human beings are the same, he believed. &quot;We all want happiness and do not want suffering. We have to learn to live in harmony and peace with each other and with nature. It is not a dream, but a necessity. We are dependent on each other in so many ways, that we can no longer live in isolated communities and ignore what is happening outside those communities.&quot; He thought of his people and their desire for freedom. Ah, what did he know? He was a simple monk. The sign outside his cage read: &quot;Enemy of the Republic.&quot; \u00b7 The chinese novelist Yan Lianke, who came to Britain earlier this year, picks up the baton next month with the last of our exchange of stories \u00b7 The China Reflected series is published with the generous support of Arts Council England", "tags": ["Chinese literature", "Books", "Culture", "Fiction", "Original writing", "Hari Kunzru"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-20T11:01:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/20/mclaren-ferrari-hamilton-massa", "sentences": ["&quot;Lewis was in another league,&quot; said Domenicali of the event in Shanghai."], "title": "Formula one: Ferrari boss says they'll fight to the end to defeat Hamilton", "article": "Ferrari team director Stefano Domenicali has admitted Lewis Hamilton&apos;s performance in yesterday&apos;s Chinese grand prix was &quot;in another league&quot;, but said his team will fight to the end as Felipe Massa bids to steal the world title from the British driver.

I know just how this sport works sometimes, so you&apos;d be foolish to go to Brazil feeling overconfident.&quot;  Stefano Domenicali, Ferrari&apos;s sporting director, added his praise for the efforts of Hamilton and McLaren, making it clear that his own team did not yet fully understand why their cars had not been not as competitive as usual in the China race.  &quot;I think, to be honest, that this weekend our main competitors were faster than us,&quot; he said.  &quot;Honestly, Lewis was in another league. He was driving perfectly, fast, consistent, and we couldn&apos;t even think of attacking him. What we said in our briefing was try to attack Lewis, above all at the beginning, to see how the situation was, but we really couldn&apos;t do it because he was too fast.&quot;  Massa will be going to Interlagos motivated by the challenge of becoming Brazil&apos;s fourth world champion driver and the first to win it in front of his home crowd, something Ayrton Senna, Nelson Piquet and Emerson Fittipaldi did not do.  Domenicali does not believe the pressure will be too great for Massa. &quot;I&apos;m not concerned about the pressure he might come under. I think Sunday was a more tense race for Felipe because he knew there was a possibility Lewis could be champion. &quot;Considering he was not competitive enough to beat Lewis, and you never know about reliability, you have to say OK, we did what we could to the maximum. So I am expecting Felipe to be more - I don&apos;t think it&apos;s correct to say relaxed - but more tranquil in Brazil rather than in China. I&apos;m pretty sure he will handle the pressure in a positive way.&quot; Top five? A 76% hit rate Hamilton needs a top-five finish in Brazil to make sure of the title.

In total, top-five finishes account for 76% of Hamilton&apos;s races Sixth to eighth 2 races If he finishes sixth or seventh Massa needs to win to snatch the title; if eighth, second will do for the Brazilian because they are level in their tally of wins and Massa will then have one more second place No points 6 races If Hamilton is pointless, Massa can take the title with a top-two finish", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport", "McLaren", "Ferrari"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-20T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/22/television-china", "sentences": ["&quot;DAB [digital audio broadcasting radio] is in an experimental phase in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai and high definition and standard definition digital television has been formally deployed in big cities."], "title": "China to switch to digital TV by 2015", "article": "China is planning to turn off its analogue television signal by 2015 as part of a 20-year plan to expand and modernise its communications sector. Speaking today at the MediaGuardian Create in China conference in London, Professor Huang Yong, the deputy editor-in-chief of China&apos;s State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, said the Chinese government was revolutionising its media industry, creating a self-sustained market that necessitated structural change. &quot;The radio and television industry in China is at a crucial stage of transformation, one aspect is technological transformation, from analogue to digital \u2026 if we see year 2000 as the starting point this transformation will need roughly 20 years to develop. That is to say it will be complete by 2020,&quot; Huang added. He said that the media sector in China was a \u00a5112.9bn (\u00a310.09bn) a year industry and there was a drive towards new technology and a digital shift in broadcast to match the rapid development in digital production. &quot;An advanced radio and television transmission and coverage system is now in place, with the combination of cable transmission, wireless transmission and satellite transmission,&quot; Huang added. Digital switchover is moving on and it is planned that by 2015 analogue television will be switched off. &quot;Programme production is also turning from analogue to digital,&quot; Yong said. &quot;In more that 50 large and medium-sized cities digitisation of cable TV has been accomplished. Digital TV reaches almost 40 million families,&quot; he added. &quot;DAB [digital audio broadcasting radio] is in an experimental phase in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai and high definition and standard definition digital television has been formally deployed in big cities. Satellite has been fully digitised.&quot; Huang said the Chinese government, through several different projects costing in excess of \u00a525bn, had given more than 100 million people access to broadcast TV in the past 10 years.  Despite almost all provincial and national TV networks and radio offering digital services, he added, the communications network in rural regions needed to be improved.  Transformation of the radio and television industries in China required the mingling of traditional and new media to create cross-media initiatives, regulatory reform and a greater scrutiny given to the requirements of the market when weighed against the public service requirements of the state, Huang said. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

The sixth-ranked Russian sustained the injury on Tuesday and said he was unlikely to play in Paris next week. &quot;Even if the inflammation and pain pass, I will have no time for preparation,&quot; Davydenko said. If there was no pain by the end of the next week he would have two weeks to prepare for the season-ending Shanghai Masters. Jamie Murray, meanwhile, is out of the Lyon grand prix after he and his Swedish partner, Robert Lindstedt, lost their quarter-final 7-6, 6-3 to the French pair Thierry Ascione and Marc Gicquel. Murray has had little success since splitting with Max Mirnyi last month and Tuesday&apos;s first-round victory was his first on the ATP Tour for three months. The junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson suffered her second WTA Tour defeat in as many days at the Fortis Championships in Luxembourg. The 14-year-old became the youngest British player to compete on the main tour when she fell to a three-set defeat by Iveta Benesova in the first round of the singles on Tuesday.

Yesterday he reached the quarter-finals of the St Petersburg Open with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over the Latvian Ernests Gulbis. This took his win-loss record in the US Open, the last three Masters Series and this event to 21-2. The victory was also his 50th of the year. Murray plays Janko Tipsarevic today, the Serb who took Roger Federer to 10-8 in the fifth set of the Australian Open third round this year. He holds a 2-1 career advantage over Murray, although such a statistic is of little consequence given the way Murray is playing, a level of tennis that he has never achieved before. But Tipsarevic will be dangerous. This time last year, when Murray won this title, he was making a late run for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup and fell short. This year his place in Shanghai was assured after he reached his first grand slam final at Flushing Meadows and since then he has underlined his position as the fourth best player in the world behind Rafael Nadal, Federer and Tipsarevic&apos;s fellow countryman, Novak Djokovic. Murray cannot catch Djokovic this year but could make large inroads in January&apos;s Australian Open where last year Murray lost in the first round, while Djokovic won his first major. It will be fascinating to see how they shape up to each other in China. On his current form Murray will head to Shanghai with the belief that he should at least reach the semi-finals and may be able to challenge for the title. Gulbis, like Argentina&apos;s Juan Martin del Potro and Marin Cilic of Croatia, is one of the players younger than Murray who is being tipped for stardom next year.  Yet here was another example of the mature Murray stamping his authority on these upstarts, none of whom has yet beaten him.

It featured 16 men, mostly suited, posing on the patio of a grand house. At first glance it might be a reunion, 40 years since graduation, of a prep school class, although some of the faces are too perma-tanned to have hailed from an English backwater. One of the figures, arms crossed and shades on, is grinning broadly ... it&apos;s Flavio Briatore. And there&apos;s Ross Brawn and Mario Thiessen and Frank Williams and Nick Fry and so on. Yes, it&apos;s the new covenant within the paddock club, within the exclusive travelling circus that is grand prix racing: Fota (Formula One Teams Association). And last month they all looked rather pleased with themselves, having laid down their daggers, and shared a Campari and soda. Now comes the news, following a post-Chinese grand prix meeting in Geneva, that they&apos;ve brought about an unusual development: an alliance has been formed between the rival teams and the governing body. Alright, so this was hardly the Yalta conference (but I&apos;ll give you the pleasure of picking out who&apos;d be your Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill), but formula one is not a sport often caught casting a self-appraising glance in the mirror. Yet in the era of the global economic tsunami recession hell \u2014 that&apos;s the official term, isn&apos;t it? \u2014 the sport&apos;s feet have thudded on to the asphalt and they&apos;ve agreed a raft of measures, starting in 2009, that could include standard engines (although some think this is a step too far). The details are hazy and there is more discussion to come after the Brazilian grand prix, but the lack of politicking and mind games, coupled with the impetus to save some money beginning next season, is unheard of. The words landmark and historic have been bandied about. And, although we might be tempted to change our minds once the finer details are aired, we should for now hail the fact that the sport has come together. It&apos;s a bit like F1 in Need, minus Pudsey Bear (although Brawn does look slightly cuddly). What a difference a year makes. Several of the sport&apos;s facets have been inverted, and it&apos;s easy to forget it&apos;s only 12 months since the great dramas of 2007. Gone is the bitch-fight between Ferrari and McLaren; Ferrari team director Stefano Domenicali even complimented Lewis Hamilton&apos;s crushing Shanghai win. The row over customer cars has softened into an apparent extension of the deal for manufacturers to supply several teams with engines. Kimi Raikkonen has somehow lost the ability to successfully pilot a car that won him the title last year. And Hamilton, who fluffed what should have been a title-winning season in 2007, has kept his charge on course this time around, albeit having shed his golden-boy image. So, all change then. The only constant factor is that Fernando Alonso is still capable of the achingly adept drives that convince you he is the best racer on the grid, meanwhile appearing to possess the most unlikeable personality. After all those monotonous years of the late 1990s and early 2000s, formula one has found some impetus to adapt, the 2008 season revealing a new topography. It&apos;s just baffling that this has been accompanied by a softening of relations, a meeting of boffin-like minds. How long until normal service is resumed? Last weekend&apos;s action Only one man has won three Nascar titles in a row, but this year Jimmie Johnson looks destined to match Cale Yarborough&apos;s record. Victory at Martinsville last weekend \u2014 marking the Californian&apos;s 39th visit to the winner&apos;s circle \u2014 has put him 149 points clear of Greg Biffle with four Sprint Cup races left. Most telling was the manner in which he did it, with second place Dale Earnhardt Jr conceding he couldn&apos;t get close enough for a pass. If Johnson keeps his form up the crown is his, but were Biffle to finish 39 positions higher \u2014 in other words, if Johnson stuffs it and Biffle finishes at the front \u2014 then he&apos;ll catch him in one fell swoop. This weekend&apos;s action I&apos;ve already mentioned Scottish driver Paul di Resta&apos;s emergence as a contender for this year&apos;s DTM title, although I hadn&apos;t got round to bringing up the matter of his tests in the McLaren formula one car. As a Mercedes driver, it wasn&apos;t a huge surprise. Rumour has it that some of the German bigwigs had spotted Sebastian Vettel&apos;s success and asked why the man who beat him to the 2006 F3 Euro Series crown, di Resta, hadn&apos;t been given a chance. And now he has, of sorts. Let&apos;s just hope that this week&apos;s testing days don&apos;t disrupt his feel for the Merc C-Classe. He needs to score three more points than Audi rival Timo Scheider at the N\u00fcrburgring this weekend to become DTM champion. Then he can ponder whether (despite the apparent re-signing of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella) he&apos;ll be driving a Mercedes-engined Force India next season.", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Nascar", "Touring cars", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-24T13:19:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/25/tennis", "sentences": ["Today he will play Del Potro after the 20-year-old continued his strong run towards the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over the Russian Igor Andreev."], "title": "Tennis: David Nalbandian raises game in a bid to keep Davis Cup singles place", "article": "David Nalbandian&apos;s mind seems to have been more fixed on the Davis Cup than any personal ambition this year, with the former Wimbledon runner-up intent on leading Argentina to their first victory in the top men&apos;s team competition when they play at home against Spain in the final later this year. Nalbandian finished last season strongly, winning the final two Masters Series events in Madrid and Paris, but this year he has made little impact in the major tournaments, failing to get past the last 32 in all four grand slam championships. With Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro fast emerging as Argentina&apos;s best player, it had been suggested that Nalbandian might not get a singles place against Spain.

Welcome to the London home of Roland Emmerich, director of epic blockbusters, including Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. It&apos;s an overtly political home: glass coffee tables dot the house, containing 3D architectural models of politically significant places, including Abu Ghraib prison, Tiananmen Square, the Dallas road where JFK was assassinated, and - a nice Hollywood touch - the LA neighbourhood where Hugh Grant had his infamous encounter with a prostitute. There&apos;s even a giant White House-shaped birdcage in the top-floor hallway, with stuffed white doves.  &quot;So far no one has been offended,&quot; says British interior designer and former social worker John Teall, who, after making a few structural changes such as moving the kitchen upstairs and adding huge skylights and a glass atrium, was given free rein. &quot;Nothing is spared, from government and gender to race and religion - but there&apos;s no manifesto. The idea was to provoke thought, amuse and maybe shock a little.&quot;  When Emmerich, who lives in Stuttgart, bought the five-storey home in Knightsbridge he was new to London. &quot;I&apos;d been in a Soho editing suite for months working on 10,000 BC,&quot; he says. Friends told him he&apos;d bought into one of London&apos;s poshest neighbourhoods - from the outside, the 1830s listed house looks as demure as its neighbours - so he instructed Teall to ensure the interior was &quot;as non-frumpy as possible. If the neighbours peeked in, they&apos;d probably call the police,&quot; Emmerich says. Teall&apos;s starting point was a suitcase full of Mao statues that Emmerich picked up in Shanghai. He then approached film set designers and artists to realise his own designs, employing scenic artist Jim Gemmill to draw the murals that pepper the house, and a posse of prop and model makers to fabricate everything from the life-size papal waxwork to the coffee table dioramas. &quot;The joy of working with film people is their can-do attitude,&quot; Teall says. &quot;I had approached high-end furniture makers who gave me outrageous estimates and didn&apos;t grasp the humour in the pieces. An architectural model-making firm refused to build the Iraq prison camp.&quot; Teall spent a lot of time negotiating for hard-to-find items: after two years of trying, he is still waiting for Cuban officials to send him a pair of Fidel Castro busts (he hadn&apos;t realised they were illegal exports); and he spent months trying to persuade the ministry of internal affairs in Moscow to sell him an eight-foot door to one of its offices. Finally, Teall&apos;s patience wore thin - he took photos and replicated it instead. It&apos;s now the entrance to the downstairs bathroom, the inside of which features more than 100 covers of Otohek, the 30s communist magazine. He unearthed the door to the wine cellar, an original cell door from Clerkenwell Prison, on eBay. Emmerich is currently in Vancouver filming, but family and friends visit regularly, sleeping in the guest suites. &quot;It&apos;s a choice of English camp or American butch,&quot; says Teall, who designed the former with Princess Diana paraphernalia: hand-painted rose wallpaper, a gold bedspread with velvet maroon crown canopy from Harrison Gill in Chelsea (&quot;It was so hideous, but it totally worked&quot;); Charles and Di wedding dolls found on eBay that now languish in the fireplace, and Alison Jackson&apos;s photographs of a fake royal family in various compromising situations. The American room is kitted out with army-issue gear, including a bed throw neatly sewn from 70 pairs of vintage army underwear bought from a bemused army surplus store owner. The headboard is adapted from a second world war aeroplane wing. Resting on a bedside table is a photograph of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, wearing an open dressing gown revealing a hairy six-pack, Photoshopped from a gay website.  In fact, the military is a strong theme throughout. The panelled study features a table shaped like a missile, while the &quot;blackboard room&quot; features a military dentist&apos;s chair and a desk made from a fighter plane wing - this latter room is so called because of its floor-to-ceiling chalkboards featuring architectural drawings and mathematical equations, inspired, Teall says, by a scene in the film A Beautiful Mind. The shelving is a reclaimed fire escape ladder. Taxidermy abounds, from full-sized and miniature animals sourced from the Parisian master of the craft, Deyrolle, to zebra-hoofed lamps from Dover Street Market. Only the library, with its listed wood panelling and lime green, silk upholstered walls, feels like a room your mother might feel comfortable in. But look closely, and there&apos;s a phallus on the mantlepiece. &quot;John has a wicked sense of humour,&quot; says Emmerich, who added into the mix his own considerable collection of skulls, African masks and phalluses. &quot;When friends with kids come, they ask me to put those away. I say, what&apos;s so shocking about a penis? But mostly people are engaged by the house.

Out of my savings I&apos;ve invested \u00a31,000 on legal and accountancy advice and my website.

Diaz-Mengivar, 49, has worked at the Lehman Brothers building on Canary Wharf for five years but only begins his day&apos;s work in the evening. From Monday to Friday, 9pm to 6am, Diaz-Mengivar and a colleague empty bins and pick up litter on 12 of the building&apos;s 31 floors. &quot;It&apos;s a lot of back bending,&quot; concedes Diaz-Mengivar. &quot;And we are worried, because we do not know what is happening with our jobs. I have spoken with the security guards and they do not know what is happening either.&quot; The collapse of Lehman&apos;s on Wall Street and at this gunmetal-grey building on Bank Street was the trigger for an &quot;extraordinary, almost unimaginable, sequence of events&quot;, the governor of the Bank of England said this week.  As Diaz-Mengivar leaves work for his second job - a 6.30am to 11.30am shift cleaning a Leicester Square theatre - he is still met by a crush of commuters. But he says he now sees worry in those faces, each wondering if their job will be next. The fundraiser dressed as a chicken at the tube station is finding it tougher to fill his bucket for orphans. Winter has come early to Canary Wharf.  Nomura, the Japanese bank that has taken on some of the 1m sq ft rented here by Lehman Brothers, will employ 2,500 of the American bank&apos;s 4,500 employees. But Diaz-Mengivar and his 30 colleagues have yet to learn of their fate. They are employed by Lancaster Cleaning Company, which is owned by business services giant Rentokil Initial and provides daily cleaning and maintenance services to Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston and Swiss Re, among others. &quot;I like my job,&quot; says Diaz-Mengivar. &quot;And I am too old to start a new job.&quot; It&apos;s said that, typically, the Lehman Brothers&apos; basic salary was about \u00a360,000 before bonuses. Diaz-Mengivar earns \u00a37.20 an hour. How did he feel watching, on TV at home, the bank&apos;s sacked employees leave for the last time? He shrugs his shoulders. &quot;I felt very sad for them. We all need to work.&quot; He says he does not know when he will receive his 25p an hour bonus. Lancaster is a &quot;living wage employer&quot;, but has yet to start paying workers the new \u00a37.45 living wage set by London mayor Boris Johnson. &quot;I make only enough money to pay rent and buy food,&quot; says Diaz-Mengivar. &quot;I need the second job so I can send money to my mother in Madrid.&quot; Canary Wharf cleaners were among the first to benefit from the living wage campaign. Next week campaigners will target Whitehall. &quot;If the government can find \u00a350bn to bail out bankers, they can find \u00a35m to pay their own cleaners and security guards a living wage,&quot; says Neil Jameson of London Citizens. The private banker Adam Honey, 42, was a private banker at Merrill Lynch looking after client relationships with wealthy individuals and their investment portfolios. Just as the dotcom bubble was bursting and stock markets were tumbling, Honey met the firm&apos;s New York senior management to be told he was the future of the company.  &quot;I flew back on the Sunday night and on the Monday morning walked into our London office to hear that I&apos;d been made redundant,&quot; he recalls. &quot;By 10.10am I was literally out on the street. It&apos;s a numbers game, nothing personal.&quot; Honey says that he was offered a couple of banking jobs &quot;in the 50 to 100 grand bracket&quot; and was in a fifth interview for a job in Geneva when the bank chairman interviewing him took a phone call. &quot;He said, &apos;I&apos;m sorry but we can&apos;t now offer you a position.&apos; When I asked him why, he told me to go back to my hotel and switch on the television.&quot; The date was September 11, 2001.  Deciding that &quot;I wanted my fate to be in my own hands&quot;, Honey set up Mountain Leap Events to look after businesses entertaining clients on ski weekends. &quot;I&apos;ve always been mad about mountain sports, so I was following my passion as well as my contacts.&quot; He sold his London flat and started out with a second-hand computer in a rented apartment in Chamonix. &quot;Now we&apos;re launching a short residential Alpine retreat for people facing exceptional changes of circumstances - redundancy, health issues, family, whatever. I was fortunate that Merrill Lynch was just a job for me. I live much more modestly than I did nine years ago, but much more happily.&quot; The vice-president For eight years Jonathan Hesford, now 43, designed, installed and supported real-time IT trading systems for Merrill Lynch in New York, rising through the ranks to become a vice-president on a nice salary that bought his family a comfortable lifestyle. &quot;We lived just 500 metres from the World Trade Centre and on September 11 I saw both planes hit and had to run from our apartment with our one-year-old,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Merrill Lynch lost so much money in the disaster I was made redundant; my visa was tied to my job so we returned to England, and decided that what had happened was a good catalyst for making a change.&quot; Confessing to being a &quot;bit of a wine ponce&quot;, Hesford and his wife dreamed of owning their own vineyard and winery. Hesford studied winemaking in New Zealand, taking a postgraduate diploma in viticulture and oenology, then worked as an assistant winemaker at Neudorf. &quot;We bought undervalued vineyard land in Roussillon in France, where you can buy old vines, small properties and character vineries - the skeleton of something up-and-running you can renovate. The work is varied with physical activity, outdoors working, the science and the art of it, and running your own business, creating labels and talking to customers. From banking I understand financing; and having been a project manager, I understand planning. Starting with pruning the vines and ending with selling the wine, it&apos;s a project cycle.&quot; At Domaine Treloar, Hesford grows Syrah, Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre and Muscat grape varieties and produces 40,000 bottles a year which are sold locally, in the UK and in Germany. &quot;We&apos;re making a small profit, and that&apos;s all I&apos;m looking for. We&apos;re building something permanent that can&apos;t be taken away - unlike the people in the City right now who are losing their jobs, bonuses, options and lifestyle all in one go.  &quot;Though I miss the cut and thrust of banking, what I do now pays off twice as much as a lifestyle.&quot; The graduates Golden hellos worth thousands, fat bonuses every year, overseas travel, rapid promotion, all expenses paid ... plenty of reasons to consider a career in the City. Well, at least there used to be. With Lehman Brothers gone and job cuts at Citigroup, HSBC and Goldman Sachs, many recent graduates working in the financial services sector are beginning to wonder if they have made the right career choice. Graduate trainees were among those to lose their jobs when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. &quot;Some of them had only been there a couple of months before they were laid off,&quot; says Shuvo Loha, managing director of City headhunting firm Janikin Rooke. &quot;The atmosphere at work is not positive,&quot; admits one recent graduate who asked that he and his employer remain anonymous, because &quot;I don&apos;t want to imply that the company is screwed&quot;.  Although he still has a job in capital markets at one of the banks in Canary Wharf, he has seen many of his colleagues laid off and is worried about his own future. &quot;My department has taken a battering, and it&apos;s hard to see your colleagues disappear - you spend 14-hours a day with these guys and then they lose their jobs. And it could happen to me. The current crisis has shown me that anyone is dispensable. You stay loyal to your team, but when the shit hits the fan it counts for nothing - if they need to cut back, they&apos;ll get rid of you.&quot; University of Liverpool graduate Faheem (who does not want his surname to be revealed) was made redundant in the summer from an accounting role at a City bank, but he is trying to remain sanguine about the experience. &quot;It was difficult, but I&apos;m seeing it as a chance to refocus on what I want to do. The job agencies told me that opportunities were drying up, so I thought I&apos;d cut my losses, rent out my London flat and go back to live with my parents while studying for my next set of accountancy exams,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m confident that the market will pick up. At the end of the day, it&apos;s just a boom-and-bust cycle. That&apos;s just how the industry works.&quot; Many students who were considering a job in banking and finance will be having second thoughts about their plans, yet universities are still promoting City careers on campuses. &quot;Yes, we are still encouraging students to apply for the banking and finance sector,&quot; says Gill Frigerio, acting director of careers at the University of Warwick, &quot;but also to consider a wide range of other options such as consultancy or investment management.&quot;", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Credit crunch", "Business", "Pay"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-24T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/25/tennis-andymurray", "sentences": ["He revealed he had achieved his goals for the year: &quot;I wanted to try and get into Shanghai this year and finish in the top 10."], "title": "Tennis: Andy Murray survives Tipsarevic test to reach St Petersburg semi-finals", "article": "Andy Murray added resilience to his recent run of outstanding form when he reached today&apos;s semi-finals of the St Petersburg Open with a 7-6, 7-5 victory over Serbia&apos;s Janko Tipsarevic after a match lasting more than two hours. Murray, the top seed, is defending the title and now meets Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco, whom he beat in last year&apos;s final. Murray has won all their three previous meetings but he will be more than a little tired, although he insisted on Thursday that he was feeling perfectly fresh. &quot;It was a tough win, but I tried to keep myself concentrated, played every ball up to the end and it worked,&quot; he said after yesterday&apos;s match. The first set against Tipsarevic lasted longer than his previous win over Latvia&apos;s Ernests Gulbis. The Scot accelerated into a 4-1 lead but the Serb, ranked No48, levelled at 4-4. Murray has an excellent tie-break record this season and although Tipsarevic once again dug in, pulling back a 3-0 deficit to 5-5, Murray&apos;s resolve never wavered. It seemed he finally had the Serb on the ropes when he broke him for a 2-1 second-set lead, only for Tipsarevic to hit back immediately. Under increasing pressure Murray held his serve to save the set at 5-5 and then struck the killer blow, winning the last two games. He revealed he had achieved his goals for the year: &quot;I wanted to try and get into Shanghai this year and finish in the top 10. Last year I missed three months with a wrist injury and I was one win away from getting into the Masters Cup. I lost to Richard Gasquet in Paris so it was quite tough for me but this year I qualified with quite a few tournaments to go and I&apos;m guaranteed to finish fourth in the world, so it&apos;s been a very good year.&quot; The Scot believes his improved physical conditioning is a key factor behind his success. However, he knows he has much to do if he is to catch Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, who occupy the three places ahead of him in the rankings. &quot;As the No4 I&apos;m still quite far ahead of the guys in fifth, sixth and seventh but I&apos;m quite far behind Djokovic in third so I need to keep this form up. I need to try and finish the year well and start 2009 well. &quot;The only goal I have left for myself is to win a grand slam.&quot;", "tags": ["Tennis", "Andy Murray", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-24T23:26:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/26/sports-calendar-november", "sentences": ["9th  With his ranking buoyed by that US Open charge, Andy Murray plays at the season-ending Shanghai Masters Cup for the first time - and the last."], "title": "The calendar: November 2008", "article": "2nd  Last year&apos;s female runners contested the New York City Marathon wearing first names only, inviting spectators to personalise their roars of encouragement.

Mizens Farm has long since made way for the McLaren Technology Centre (MTC), the only similarity between such widely divergent trades being a finished product that can be affected by the weather. The chances of high temperatures influencing the outcome of next Sunday&apos;s Brazilian Grand Prix will have been programmed into detailed preparations that included Hamilton lapping the Interlagos circuit while sitting in a simulator 6,000 miles away. Yet, while assisting with the mechanical and aerodynamic set-up of the McLaren-Mercedes for the tricky Interlagos circuit, no amount of time spent in the artificial cockpit can forecast the relationship between the tyres and track on the day. Neither can it allow for the driver&apos;s reaction when, as happened to Hamilton last year, he makes a mistake or a mysterious electronics glitch in the gearbox selects neutral and sends him to the back of the field and out of the championship. And neither can a computer programme read the mind of a rival intent on upsetting McLaren&apos;s best-laid plans.  Hamilton and McLaren do not need reminding that they went into the final race last year with an identical advantage of seven points and came away with nothing. There are, however, significant differences between the two campaigns.  In 2007, McLaren arrived in Brazil with the look of a whipped dog after the onslaught created by the Ferrari spy scandal and a relentless campaign by the FIA that saw motor sport&apos;s governing body appear to pursue the British team, occasionally with good reason, at every turn. Even within the team itself there was tension as Hamilton and Fernando Alonso remained in contention for the title, only four points behind his team-mate. If the Spaniard won the race, then Hamilton had to finish second to claim the title. Hamilton was not only up against the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen but also his team-mate&apos;s healthy persecution complex, with Alonso believing that McLaren favoured Hamilton.  The negative effect of such internal discord became apparent at the first corner when Hamilton, cleverly boxed in by the two Ferraris, suffered the additional frustration of being overtaken by Alonso and then tried to make amends at the next corner. It was an over-optimistic move, similar to the one that saw Hamilton run wide at the first corner in Japan two weeks ago.  If any good is to come from Hamilton&apos;s disastrous race at Fuji then it is the realisation that he must temper his engaging enthusiasm for winning everything in sight with the thought that merely finishing in the top five on Sunday will be sufficient, even if Felipe Massa wins the race. Last Sunday&apos;s dominant victory in Shanghai at least allowed Hamilton to prove that he can deal with the self-inflicted pressure created by the mistake in Japan.  There could be no complaint about Hamilton&apos;s driving in China - simply because no one could get near him, a painful situation for the struggling Ferrari drivers but one that also highlights a possible dilemma for McLaren next weekend. Gaining the handful of points he needs may be the sensible option for Hamilton but it goes against his instinct - and that could land him in trouble. Should the Englishman qualify behind the front row of the grid, there are one or two drivers who might be willing to assist him into the scenery rather than towards his first world title. An improvement in form by Renault brought Alonso unexpected and well earned wins in Singapore and Japan, but beneath the Spaniard&apos;s carefree demeanour lies a seething resentment over perceived ill-treatment by McLaren and the damage to his reputation brought about by some of Hamilton&apos;s performances on the track. Alonso is arguably the best driver of the season given the equipment at his disposal but he would not be averse to subtly throwing away a decent result next weekend, particularly if it compromised Hamilton in the process. That is a measure of how deep the enmity runs and the size of Hamilton&apos;s problem if he finds himself in close company with his former team-mate. Alonso has made it clear he would prefer Massa to won the championship.  &apos;I&apos;m not surprised he said that,&apos; Hamilton said. &apos;It makes no difference to me. He has a right to his own opinion. All I can say is that Fernando is a phenomenal driver and I can never ever take that away from him or argue the fact. I admire him so much and I worked next to him and I saw the things he can do, and I learnt a lot from him. I never took that for granted but I worked as hard as I could to beat him - which I did. &apos;I don&apos;t think this has influenced our relationship. When we see each other he smiles... unless, of course, his appearance is not actually what he thinks, which is very possible.&apos;  Hamilton is actually more comfortable in Massa&apos;s presence and fully understands the mixed blessing the Brazilian will experience racing at home. The raw passion behind the need to welcome the first Brazilian world champion since Ayrton Senna in 1991 will thrust huge expectation on Massa&apos;s slim shoulders. Hamilton experienced a similar surge of anticipation at Silverstone this year and knows that not even the most sophisticated software can simulate that pressure.", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-25T23:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/27/tennis-andymurray", "sentences": ["He is due to play in the Paris Indoor Masters this week and will then fly to Shanghai for the lucrative end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup, a tournament restricted to the world&apos;s top eight players which will shift its roots to London next year."], "title": "Tennis: Hamburgers and slam dreams all round as hot Andy Murray cruises to a cool million", "article": "It was as easy as walking in the Russian forests and picking mushrooms. Andy Murray claimed his second ATP title within eight days by defeating Andrey Golubev, a Kazakhstani qualifier, 6-1, 6-1 inside an hour in the St Petersburg Open final yesterday for his fifth tournament win of the year and eighth in total. The last British player to win back-to-back titles at tour level was Mark Cox in 1975 and at this rate Murray will quickly overhaul Tim Henman&apos;s 11 career titles and Greg Rusedski&apos;s 15. He marked the occasion by taking Team Murray out for hamburgers. &quot;I&apos;ve had the best year of my life - I don&apos;t feel unbeatable but I do feel very motivated and confident,&quot; he said. &quot;My preparations have been right, I&apos;ve got the right people around me and I can relax off the court and focus when I am on it.&quot;  Having just collected slightly over $1m for a week&apos;s work, Murray revealed he has splashed out on a new Range Rover Sport - though his long-standing girlfriend Kim Sears is in the driving seat, as he has yet to pass his driving test.  The 21-year-old Scot is finishing the year with a quite extraordinary flourish, winning the Masters Series events in Cincinnati and Madrid, and finishing runner-up to Roger Federer in the US Open. He is due to play in the Paris Indoor Masters this week and will then fly to Shanghai for the lucrative end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup, a tournament restricted to the world&apos;s top eight players which will shift its roots to London next year. Henman and Rusedski both played in the TMC, Henman reaching the semi-finals a decade ago in Hannover. If his current form holds up it is entirely possible Murray might win it. He now has a career-best 53-14 win-loss match record this year (15-1 indoors), and excluding his early defeat in the Olympic Games has won 26 of his last 28 matches, including two in the Davis Cup, since he lost to Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.  This is the same Murray whose stamina was regularly called into question as recently as early this year. He has answered his critics in the best way, achieving recent victories over the three players currently ahead of him in the rankings - Nadal, Federer and Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic.  Murray won the St Petersburg title last year but this time, coming on the back of his Madrid Masters victory the Sunday before, there seemed a real danger that the British world No4 might come up short because of tiredness. This was to underestimate the mental fortitude of the Scot, as well as the punishing, muscle-burning training he has incorporated into his regime this year, always pushing himself that extra yard. His one tough match here in Russia came in Friday&apos;s quarter-final against Serbia&apos;s Janko Tipsarevic which Murray, the top seed, won 7-6, 7-5 in two hours. In Saturday&apos;s semi-final he defeated Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco 6-0, 6-3, and yesterday Golubev was similarly brushed aside, only managing to hold his serve twice as Murray claimed the first prize, a somewhat more lucrative amount than last year given the recent dive of the pound against the dollar. Golubev, the same age as Murray but ranked No150, had reached his first ATP final with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over the Romanian Victor Hanescu. The 21-year-old Golubev, who is based in Italy, changed his nationality in June from Russian to Kazakhstani so that he could compete in the Davis Cup for his new country. This was his sixth career ATP tournament and he has had to qualify each time. Murray hardly needs to be reminded that the last Briton to win a grand slam title was Fred Perry in 1936, but he has his plans. &quot;The whole reason I took five weeks off after the US Open was so that I could rest and recover and get myself in shape for these tournaments at the end of the year,&quot; he explained yesterday. &quot;I don&apos;t take anything for granted and although I hope I am getting closer to a grand slam win it does take a bit of luck. It&apos;s the hardest thing in the world to do in tennis. Better players than me have gone through their whole careers without ever winning one.&quot; These remain early days for Murray, though. In Basel yesterday Federer defeated Argentina&apos;s David Nalbandian 6-3, 6-4 for his 57th career title, including 13 slams. Records in his sights Andy Murray&apos;s fifth ATP title of the year and eighth overall sees him, at 21 years and five months old, rapidly closing in on the career records of Britain&apos;s best men in the Open era Greg Rusedski 15 career titles from 27 finals First title (age 19): 1993 Newport Titles at 21 years and 5 months: 1 Last title (age 31): 2005 Newport Best win: 1999 Grand Slam Cup Best world ranking: No4 Grand slam finals: 1 Tim Henman 11 career titles from 28 finals First title (age 22): 1997 Sydney Titles at 21 and 5 months: 0 Last title (age 29): 2003 Paris Masters Best win: 2003 Paris Masters Best world ranking: No4 Grand slam finals: 0 Andy Murray 8 career titles from 13 finals First title (age 19): 2006 San Jose Titles at 21 years and 5 months: 8 Best wins: 2008 Cincinnati and Madrid Masters World ranking: No4 Grand slam finals: 1", "tags": ["Tennis", "Andy Murray", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-27T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/27/marketturmoil-creditcrunch", "sentences": ["And the Chinese stockmarket tumbled over 6%, bringing more pain to small investors who have watched the Shanghai Composite index fall 70% from last year&apos;s peak."], "title": "Asian stockmarkets crash again", "article": "Stockmarkets around the world crashed again today as the prospect of a deep worldwide recession continued to haunt investors.

Far from sitting back and being happy with the specification of their MP4-23 vehicle as used by Hamilton to dominate the Chinese grand prix at Shanghai, the McLaren technical department has been working on a new rear wing and a raft of other aerodynamic tweaks for Sunday&apos;s gruelling event at the circuit in the suburbs of Sao Paulo.

McLaren F1&apos;s chief executive, Martin Whitmarsh, said the team has been working hard on the elements that have now been given the green light for use in the race. &quot;We have put the effort into primarily an aerodynamic package to enhance the efficiency of the car,&quot; he said.

The cities speed by like stops on the underground as the men&apos;s season rushes towards its conclusion at the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, beginning a week on Sunday. Some players can hardly set one foot in front of another as winter beckons. For others, like Britain&apos;s Andy Murray, opponents continue to fall like autumn leaves and the air is charged with excitement. The Scot is on a quite extraordinary run of success, winning the last two Masters Series events, in Cincinnati and Madrid, and last week&apos;s tournament in Russia. He also reached his first grand slam final, at Flushing Meadows in September. He has no intention of allowing himself a little slack this week. Nobody has ever won three successive Masters titles - not Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andre Agassi or Pete Sampras. Murray&apos;s eyes sparkle at the thought of a unique treble. &quot;The last few months have been good,&quot; he said here yesterday, with characteristic understatement. &quot;It&apos;s not that often that you get the chance to be on a streak like this so I&apos;ll try and keep it going.&quot; At this time of year mental fatigue creeps up on the players like the first frosts of winter. Murray has no such problems. Adrenaline is surging through a body wired by success. &quot;I think a lot of the guys feel mentally tired but I don&apos;t because of the breaks I&apos;ve had this season. I don&apos;t feel tired at all.&quot;  Yesterday Nadal, who knocked Federer off the top of the world rankings this year, called Murray a &quot;complete&quot; player, and the Spaniard believes the 21-year-old from Dunblane is here to stay. Asked which player had impressed him most in 2008, Nadal shot back: &quot;Murray&quot;. &quot;He has just proved in these last few months that he can win the big tournaments, whoever is in his way,&quot; Nadal said. &quot;He is a massive talent, with a complete game and both an aggressive shot and a containing shot. He makes it all look so easy.&quot; Today, Murray faces Sam Querrey. He has beaten the Californian in their two previous meetings, including this year at Cincinnati on the way to his first Masters Series win. He has not yet received that trophy. &quot;The one from Madrid is next to my television,&quot; he said.  Last year Murray made a late charge towards qualification for the Tennis Masters Cup, before losing here to France&apos;s Richard Gasquet. This year Murray sealed his place in Shanghai when he was runner-up to Federer in the US Open.  &quot;Last year was tough. There was obviously a lot of pressure on me to qualify for Shanghai although it would have been an unbelievable effort after missing three or four months because of the wrist,&quot; he said. &quot;And I wanted to change some things off the court. I had seven or eight weeks last year to get myself in better shape, get the right people around me, decide where I wanted to train - so there was a lot of stuff going through my mind. This year it&apos;s not very complicated. I know what I&apos;m going to do in November-December time and I know who is going to be with me. It&apos;s just much, much easier to go on court because I don&apos;t have a lot else to think of. &quot;I haven&apos;t really thought that much about Shanghai, or anything else. I just think about the next match each time. I&apos;m sure at the end of the year I&apos;ll look back on the last few months and really enjoy it and then use it as motivation for next year, though I&apos;m sure once I get to China it will be great and I&apos;ll really enjoy it. It will be such a good test to see exactly where my game is at, playing against the top guys three or four days in a row. And seeing what I need to improve on for next year.&quot; Some might suppose that Murray, now No4 in the world, does not need to improve an awful lot, but as a keen fan of formula one he recognises the similarities between himself and Lewis Hamilton. &quot;He&apos;s at the top of the sport and probably will be for the next 10 years,&quot; Murray said. &quot;Hopefully I can do the same thing.&quot;  The likelihood is growing all the time.

The Ferrari driver, who goes to his home Brazilian grand prix with an outside chance of winning his first title, added that Jordan has had &quot;nothing to do with F1&quot; since he left the sport. Massa, who lies seven points behind McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton going into the final race of the season, said: &quot;Playing dirty has never been part of my game. I don&apos;t want anything to do with it. The only thing on my mind is winning the race. The rest does not depend on me. If I&apos;m champion, it will be a dream come true. If not, that&apos;s OK. I will try again next year. Since he sold his team, Eddie Jordan has had nothing to do with F1 except for what he says in the press.&quot; He was responding to comments by Jordan, boss of the formula one team which bore his name from 1991-2005, suggesting that Lewis Hamilton would have to be ready for any attempt to take him out of the race. &quot;If Massa tries to take him out as he did in Japan in order to steal the title, then Lewis has to be ready for it,&quot; said Jordan this week. &quot;If he tries that on then Lewis has to turn his wheel into Massa to ensure he does not finish the race either - he has to take his wheel off.&quot; Massa is attempting to become the first Brazilian to win the formula one title since Ayrton Senna in 1991. He is keen to divert the pressure of competing in front of his expectant home fans to the championship leader. &quot;Lewis will try and put pressure on me, but I have zero pressure because I have nothing to lose,&quot; he insisted. &quot;I have my people behind me, and all the pressure will be on him, especially when you think of what happened at this race last year. I now can&apos;t wait for this final Sunday of the season.&quot; Hamilton himself has attracted his share of criticism following a number of incidents over the course of an eventful season, but he believes results such as his faultless win in Shanghai are the best way to counter the detractors. &quot;You do your talking on the track, and the result definitely spoke for itself,&quot; he said. &quot;We will continue to maintain this approach, and hopefully we will win better opinions in the future.&quot; Hamilton is vying to become the youngest champion in formula one history, and the first Briton to claim the crown since Damon Hill 12 years ago. His clear lead in the championship makes him a firm favourite to take the title, but he enjoyed a similar position last year, when he let slip a 17-point lead - seven before the final race - to Kimi Raikkonen. &quot;Last year, without the experience, I was a bit lost,&quot; admitted Hamilton. &quot;But this year we go in with a much better approach, a much better package, and I think as a team we can do a much better job. Looking back on the race in China it was a good recovery after all that happened in Japan. It&apos;s always a pleasure to be able to repay your team for all the hard work they do. But despite that, I don&apos;t believe it gives us any reason to get ahead of ourselves. We need to keep our feet on the ground and head into the race with the approach we had in China.&quot; Hamilton needs only to finish in the top five to clinch the title, irrespective of Massa&apos;s placing. But he will have the added concern of Massa&apos;s team-mate, defending world champion Kimi Raikkonen, who has vowed to do all he can to help the Brazilian win the title. Massa must win the race, with Hamilton finishing in seventh place or lower, to win the title. If Massa finishes second, he will only win the title if Hamilton is relegated to eighth place or worse. &quot;I gained the best possible result in China considering we couldn&apos;t fight for the win,&quot; said Raikkonen. &quot;Once you don&apos;t fight for the title any more, then for me it does not make a difference if I finish second or third, as long as the points for Ferrari remain the same. With the team fighting in both championships, I&apos;ll be glad if I can do something for Felipe so he can win the title, and with Ferrari again constructors&apos; champions.&quot;", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Sport", "Motor sport", "Felipe Massa"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-29T16:42:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/30/tennis-rafaelnadal", "sentences": ["From being outside the top 50 he rushed into the top 10 and is now poised to capture one of the three remaining places at the Masters Cup in Shanghai, starting on Sunday week, although Nalbandian could yet thwart him.", "This year has been much more of struggle for the Spaniard and after yesterday&apos;s 6-3, 6-2 defeat by Germany&apos;s Philipp Kohlschreiber, Ferrer lost his last chance of returning to Shanghai."], "title": "Tennis: Nadal finds extra spring in his step as world No1", "article": "It is difficult to imagine Andy Murray spending three hours in the company of journalists. Yet that is what Rafael Nadal, the world No1, did on Sunday, visiting the offices of L&apos;Equipe, France&apos;s sports paper, to give an interview, sign autographs and watch his beloved Real Madrid play Athletic Bilbao on a large television screen. The Parisians have thrilled to the sight of Nadal winning the French Open for the past four years on the clay of Roland Garros but this is the first time they have welcomed him to the autumnal Paris Masters as world No1, the young Spaniard taking over from Roger Federer in mid-August and securing the ranking for the rest of the year during the recent Madrid Masters. There is no doubt Nadal is loving every moment, hence his visit to L&apos;Equipe. Yesterday he was at court-side early to watch David Nalbandian, who beat him in last year&apos;s final. The two could meet in Saturday&apos;s semi-final, though more pertinently their paths will cross next month in the Davis Cup final. &quot;Rafa world No1&quot; read a banner in the Palais Omnisports, and he grinned and waved in response. Later he returned to the same court to win his opening match 6-2, 6-4 against France&apos;s Florent Serra, a qualifier. Unlike the springtime crowds at Roland Garros, the French fans here have rarely seen the best of Nadal. He is normally struggling with fatigue, bordering on exhaustion. Although his serve is greatly improved, winning him more cheap points, the Spaniard&apos;s game continues to place a high premium on physical exertion. Yesterday was his 91st singles match of the year, of which he has won 81. For the third tournament in succession Nalbandian will play fellow Argentinian Juan Martin del Potro today, with both due to team up for the Davis Cup final in Mar del Plata. The 20-year-old, 6ft 5in Del Potro, nicknamed the toothpick, was clearly a major talent in the making when he burst on to the scene as a teenager, though like Murray his real progress was made this year. Prior to the US Open he won four successive tournaments and, when he met Murray in the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows, he had stretched his unbeaten run to 23 matches. From being outside the top 50 he rushed into the top 10 and is now poised to capture one of the three remaining places at the Masters Cup in Shanghai, starting on Sunday week, although Nalbandian could yet thwart him. &quot;That&apos;s sport,&quot; said the former Wimbledon runner-up and winner of the Masters Cup three years ago when he came from two sets down in the final to beat Federer. Spain&apos;s David Ferrer rose almost unnoticed into the top 10 last year and then reached the final of the Masters Cup where he ran into Federer. This year has been much more of struggle for the Spaniard and after yesterday&apos;s 6-3, 6-2 defeat by Germany&apos;s Philipp Kohlschreiber, Ferrer lost his last chance of returning to Shanghai. Jamie Murray, temporarily teamed up with Pavel Vizner of the Czech Republic, having split from Max Mirnyi of Belarus, won his opening doubles match 6-2, 6-7, 10-8, an encounter given added spice by the fact that it was against Mirnyi, partnered by Croatia&apos;s Marin Cilic.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Rafael Nadal", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-30T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/30/tennis-andymurray", "sentences": ["There were straight-sets wins, too, for Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer while Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro and Gilles Simon of France stayed on course to claim one of the three places still open for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, Murray having secured his place at the US Open."], "title": "Tennis: Andy Murray wows the crowd as winning streak continues", "article": "Sam Querrey sounds like a name out of a Raymond Chandler thriller, the sort that might creep up in a darkened alley and do considerable damage with a blackjack. And for two games Andy Murray might have been inclined to think he was indeed in for a rough night against the Californian. The Scot stretched his jaw and flicked his eyebrows like a boxer caught off-guard by a haymaker in the first round, then reeled off six games in succession with the sort of sustained brilliance that has seen Murray win back-to-back tournaments in the Madrid Masters and St Petersburg. Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski both won the Paris Masters and in trying to emulate them Murray is also attempting to become the first player ever to win three Masters Series events in succession, having also won in Cincinnati before he reached the final of the US Open against Roger Federer. This 6-2, 6-4 second-round win over Querrey - Murray received a bye in the opening round - was an encouraging start and this afternoon he plays the Spaniard Fernando Verdasco whom he beat 6-0, 6-3 in the semi-finals at St Petersburg last weekend. He had beaten Querrey twice before with some ease, so the opening was a bit of a shock. The 21-year-old from Thousand Oaks possesses a formidable serve and a clumping forehand but not a huge amount else. Murray began to make him run and, once stretched, the American began to creak and crack like a piece of dry wood, finally splitting in two. It was only a temporary lapse of concentration towards the end of the second set, Murray losing his serve when 4-3 ahead, that allowed Querrey a brief respite from the torture. The French crowd loved it, and most particularly an extraordinary shot by Murray in the second game of the second set. Querrey might have been feeling pleased with himself to have executed a volleyed lob after drawing Murray to the net with a drop shot. The Scot scampered back and seemed to be settling himself for a studied reply when he suddenly flicked the most outrageously improvised backhand winner as Querrey stood and gawped - and the American does a good line in gawping. &quot;It&apos;s not like you can practise a shot like that,&quot; said Murray. &quot;It just kind of happened. I don&apos;t know how to describe it. I watched it on the big screen afterwards and it looked pretty good.&quot; This is what makes Murray special, this ability to improvise to such devastating effect in the heat of battle. Querrey, ranked No 41, is a decent enough player but Murray simply took him apart, at times reducing him to a stumblebum. &quot;I neutralised his biggest strengths early on and just lost my concentration a little bit towards the end,&quot; added Murray. &quot;I wanted to finish the match and rushed it a little bit and it didn&apos;t really work.&quot; Not that the Parisians minded. They would gladly have watched a little more of Monsieur Murray and they will get another chance today when he switches to the second court in the Palais Omnisports, an altogether more cramped arena: &quot;I played a lot of football tennis there on the first day I arrived. It&apos;s maybe a little lower bouncing and has a much lower ceiling but it shouldn&apos;t be too much of a problem.&quot; Murray has almost forgotten what problems are. Including his two Davis Cup victories over Austria at Wimbledon, this was his 13th consecutive win and the last three have been extremely quick. &quot;It helps,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m a little bit tired because I have played a lot of matches, although it&apos;s not like they have been taking a lot out of me. It&apos;s not so much the matches as the travel.&quot; Having been steamrollered in the opening set, after winning the first two games, Querrey set about a damage limitation exercise in the second only to hand the advantage to Murray with three double faults. Then came that short Murray stutter as he pressed on the accelerator a little too hard, allowing his opponent to level at 4-4. It was merely delaying the inevitable. There were straight-sets wins, too, for Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer while Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro and Gilles Simon of France stayed on course to claim one of the three places still open for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, Murray having secured his place at the US Open. His brother Jamie Murray, temporarily teamed up with Pavel Vizner of the Czech Republic having split from Max Mirnyi of Belarus, won his opening doubles match 6-2, 6-7, 10-8, an encounter given added spice by the fact that it was against Mirnyi, partnered by Croatia&apos;s Marin Cilic.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Andy Murray", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-30T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/31/formulaone-lewishamilton", "sentences": ["&quot;He has gained hugely from his experience in 2007 and is very forthright and specific about what he wants from his car.&quot; Whitmarsh cites Hamilton&apos;s victory in the season&apos;s penultimate race, in Shanghai, which followed the disappointment of an incident-filled and controversial 12th place in Japan, as proof of his driver&apos;s extra maturity."], "title": "Formula one: mature Hamilton will not try to play the hero, says Whitmarsh", "article": "Lewis Hamilton goes into Sunday&apos;s formula one world championship decider here in Brazil a more rounded competitor than 12 months ago when he missed out on the title by a single point in his debut season, according to Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren&apos;s chief executive. Whitmarsh was one of the key people in shaping the emergent career of Hamilton as the Hertfordshire lad climbed the racing ladder from karting to his domination in 2006 of the GP2 championship, the feeder series in which future formula one stars hone their ability. &quot;I think it is fair to say that Lewis came into formula one at a pretty high standard in the first place,&quot; he said. &quot;People talk in terms of &apos;What has he done to declutter his mind?&apos; after losing the championship right at the end of last year, but while there is always scope for improvement, no matter how experienced you are, I think you would have to say that Lewis has been pretty much on target right from the start of his career with McLaren.&quot; Nevertheless Whitmarsh, who is poised to take over the role of McLaren team principal when Ron Dennis chooses to stand aside, believes that most of Hamilton&apos;s improvement as a driver this year comes from his capacity to concentrate on and interpret every facet and behavioural quirk in his car&apos;s performance.  &quot;I think Lewis has a great capacity to focus on what is most important in terms of the detailed setup and operation of a formula one car,&quot; he said. &quot;He has gained hugely from his experience in 2007 and is very forthright and specific about what he wants from his car.&quot; Whitmarsh cites Hamilton&apos;s victory in the season&apos;s penultimate race, in Shanghai, which followed the disappointment of an incident-filled and controversial 12th place in Japan, as proof of his driver&apos;s extra maturity.  &quot;Looking back to the Chinese grand prix, I think Lewis produced a truly great drive, successfully pushing the disappointment of the previous weekend&apos;s race out of his mind. It was a performance which demonstrated that he had successfully come back from not only the Fuji race but also the aftereffects of the penalty which deprived him of victory in Belgium, which was obviously one of the biggest disappointments of the year, not just for Lewis but for the entire team.&quot;  Whitmarsh also feels that Hamilton is more than capable of striking the right balance of competitive intensity and tactical restraint which will be needed in Sunday&apos;s Brazilian grand prix at the Interlagos circuit, where he needs only to finish in the top five to take the championship, even if Felipe Massa wins the race for Ferrari in front of his home crowd. &quot;For all of us at McLaren this weekend is simply a continuation of the way in which we have handled every race so far this year. There is huge pressure from the Brazilian situation and the fact that Lewis is ranged against a hometown hero, but I believe we can all successfully insulate ourselves from that, get our heads down and do our own thing.&quot; In Whitmarsh&apos;s view Hamilton&apos;s title challenge will be helped by the fact that this year&apos;s McLaren is easier on its tyres than last year&apos;s car and that the weather at Interlagos this weekend may be slightly cooler than usual. &quot;It would be nice if Lewis could produce a performance like that truly great race he drove in China,&quot; he said, &quot;but at the same time there must be no heroics, no big risks taken. But there is no doubt that Lewis knows what he needs to do.

Fleetwood Mac meets Chic? It&apos;s become a sort of Holy Grail. Empire of the Sun come closer than any we&apos;ve heard to date. A Steely Dan or Air of a studio duo, they combine rhythmic elegance with the hi-tech sheen of 80s pop. And it&apos;s not just a theory that fails to work in practice: their songs, We Are the People, Standing on the Shore and the single and title track from their forthcoming album Walking on a Dream, are as sublimely crafted as anything we&apos;ve heard all year. If Lindsey Buckingham joined forces with Daft Punk they might produce music as polished and perfect - for the bedroom, for the dancefloor - as this. Their songs acknowledge the past without becoming retro exercises in pastiche. Of course they don&apos;t; they are contemporary productions with elements that evoke an era that never existed - because until recently the idea of a Balearic Fleetwood Mac didn&apos;t occur. Empire of the Sun make it all sound so effortless, their music moving with the insistent mid-tempo grace of the Mac in their Tango in the Night pomp, while the singers tweak their voices in the studio to get those pristine Christine McVie harmonies just right.  Despite the intelligence of the operation, however, it doesn&apos;t feel cold or sterile. On the contrary, the chord sequences and vocal melodies seem to have been designed for maximum emotional impact. As for the lead singer, the phrase &quot;controlled under-emoting&quot; occurs; he holds back in a series of restrained performances that give the impression he&apos;s hiding his pain over a relationship turned sour behind layers of sumptuous sonics. Because he knows that the song is greater than the sum of the parts. But hold on - we recognise that voice. And no wonder: it belongs to Luke Steele, the brilliant but underrated singer and songwriter with Australia&apos;s The Sleepy Jackson, whose two albums (2003&apos;s Lovers and 2006&apos;s Personality: One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird) earned them critical respect but not the widespread attention they deserved. He made a further attempt to widen his appeal last year when he teamed up with Nick Littlemore (formerly one half of Teenager with Ladyhawke&apos;s Pip Brown and more recently one half of popular Australian electro duo Pnau) for a fantastic techno tune called With You Forever. It served as a prototype for the fiction romances Steele and Littlemore have produced as Empire of the Sun, having bonded over a mutual love of Alejandro Jodorowsky&apos;s avant-garde 1973 masterpiece, The Holy Mountain, in which a Christ-like character &quot;withdraws from society with a flock of disciples to quest for eternal life&quot;.  Not for nothing have they never referred to Steele and Littlemore as the Noel and Liam of Aussietronic pop. If there&apos;s any remaining doubt about this duo&apos;s arty credentials, they shot the video for Walking on a Dream in Shanghai in lavish Technicolor, like a dazzlingly gaudy miniclip from the Spielberg extravaganza from which they take their name. We hear from a good source that Empire of the Sun&apos;s album will include future-funk workouts to shame Prince and symphonic ballads to make Brian Wilson weep. We always suspected that Steele was a major, if eccentric, talent - just wait till you see what these boys consider normal daywear. Now, finally, with Empire of the Sun, he has found the ideal vehicle for his twisted disco pop, his divine madness. The buzz: &quot;It&apos;s the sound of two professionals geeking out on writing perfect pop songs.&quot; The truth: If it&apos;s as good as the tracks we&apos;ve heard, then ladies and gentlemen we already have a contender for 2009 album of the year.

Nalbandian is one of the few players on the tour capable of emulating Murray&apos;s unusual blend of baseline guile and tactical nous, and his virtuoso display earned the grudging admiration of the Scot. &quot;I&apos;m obviously disappointed to lose, but I&apos;m glad that I played against a guy as good as him and that it took him playing a great match to beat me,&quot; said Murray. &quot;He probably returned better than me and created a few more chances, but I thought both of us hit the ball well.&quot; That they did, to the point where the two men at times seemed a mirror image of one another, each subtle change of pace and trajectory finding its perfect counterpart on the other side of the net. Ultimately, however, it was Nalbandian&apos;s ripostes that proved more telling. Murray battled back gamely from an early break of serve, but rarely touched the heights that propelled him to victory in the Masters Series events in Cincinnati and Madrid, and at St Petersburg last week. Nalbandian sealed the opening set on a tiebreak, opening up a 4-1 lead before slamming home a forehand pass on set point. Murray recovered an early break in the second with an exquisite lunging forehand that belonged more to the squash court than the tennis court, but Nalbandian was not to be denied. Outwitting and outmanoeuvring his younger opponent, the Argentine quickly rattled off a double break and, although Murray defiantly responded with a break of his own at 5-2 down, a deft angled volley from Nalbandian on match point left Murray flailing on his backside. &quot;Since Wimbledon, I&apos;ve played the best tennis of my life and hopefully I can keep it going,&quot; added Murray, who reached the first grand slam final of his career at the US Open last month. &quot;I don&apos;t think there are many guys that could have won three events in a row. To have done that would have been an unbelievable achievement.&quot; For all Murray&apos;s recent success, Nalbandian will doubtless feel that he is the real master of the late-season flourish. In 2005, the Argentine claimed the most notable tournament win of his career to date by beating Roger Federer to claim the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. After failing to progress beyond the fourth round at any of the majors, Nalbandian ended last year in similarly spectacular style, beating Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Federer in successive rounds to win the Madrid Masters before again defeating Federer and Nadal en route to victory at the Palais Omnisports. Nalbandian&apos;s hopes of retaining his Paris title - not to mention Murray&apos;s sense of an opportunity missed - will be buoyed by the absence of the world&apos;s top two, Nadal and Federer. Nadal, clearly struggling with a knee injury, retired from his quarter-final against Nikolay Davydenko after losing the opening set 6-1. His departure will have come as a bitter blow to the tournament&apos;s organising committee, who were still reeling from Federer&apos;s earlier decision to withdraw due to a stiff back. Nalbandian will play Davydenko in the last four, while James Blake, who was scheduled to play Federer, will await the outcome of tonight&apos;s quarter-final between Andy Roddick and Jo Wilfried Tsonga.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Andy Murray", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-10-31T15:24:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/china-marketturmoil", "sentences": ["Yesterday the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index slid again on further fears about the economic outlook."], "title": "Financial crisis wipes billions off wealth of China's super-rich", "article": "Who wants to be a billionaire?

They are hardly identical twins in temperament or looks but in terms of shot-making they have so much in common, most especially a two-handed backhand of sumptuous and exquisite timing and control. On this occasion Nalbandian was always just a shade better than Murray, beating him 7-6, 6-3, although it was a Paris Masters quarter-final of the highest quality on a day which saw the world&apos;s two leading players, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, pull out. Murray acknowledged the similarity with Nalbandian: &quot;When we are on the ball we look like we have more time than we do. We prepare for our shots pretty early, although there are a few differences - I use slice a little bit more, he likes to change the direction of the ball more than me.&quot; It was both the similarity, and those small differences, which had a packed Palais Omnisports purring with Gallic delight. And so Murray&apos;s run of 14 consecutive victories came to an end, wins that have encompassed tournament triumphs in the Madrid Masters and St Petersburg. He was attempting to become the first player to win three consecutive Masters series, having won in Cincinnati in August, but when Nalbandian strikes this sort of form, as he did when winning here last year, beating Federer and Nadal in the process, he is almost in a class of his own. That Murray pushed him so hard, notably in an opening set of electrifying tennis, spoke volumes for his fast-accelerating improvement. The Argentinian, whose one slam final came somewhat incongruously at Wimbledon in 2002 when he was beaten by Australia&apos;s Lleyton Hewitt, is the only top-10 player whom Murray has yet to beat, their one previous meeting being three years ago at Wimbledon when, having established a two-set lead, Murray&apos;s teenage body and brain rebelled against the intensity of the situation in his first appearance on Centre Court. That was man against boy. Yesterday they were competing on equal terms and it was riveting. Nalbandian has struggled in all the slams this year, failing to get beyond the third round, which for a player of his ability is wretched. However, he has rediscovered his form indoors, winning a recent tournament in Stockholm, and it was Murray&apos;s misfortune to play him at the top of his game. &quot;I was disappointed to lose but it took him playing a great match to beat me,&quot; the Scot said. It was certainly that. Nalbandian broke for a 3-1 lead only for Murray to snap back immediately. &quot;I didn&apos;t serve particularly well in the tie-break and that was probably the one thing that cost me the first set,&quot; he said. His level had only to drop a fraction in the second set for Nalbandian to force home the advantage, breaking the Murray serve four times. &quot;Since Wimbledon I&apos;ve played the best tennis of my life,&quot; he added, &quot;and hopefully I can keep it going.&quot; Federer pulled out of his quarter-final against James Blake of the United States with a sore back, a precautionary withdrawal in view of the end-of-season tennis Masters Cup which begins in Shanghai next Sunday. And there was further disappointment for the crowd when Nadal, with an injured knee, called it a day after losing the opening set 6-1 against Russia&apos;s Nikolay Davydenko.

Even though Andy Murray turned 21 in May, he was still, during the French Open, struggling with the angst of delayed adolescence. Not any more. The gangly string bean has turned into a tall, muscular athlete; the on-court tantrums have become no more than normal expressions of annoyance when a shot goes wrong; and he now moves around the circuit with a poise and confidence that was absent earlier in the year. In a phrase, he has grown up and, in doing so, has presented the game with a very different champion - a player, as they say around here, &apos;pas comme les autres&apos;. The change, since he overcame a mental blockage with a defeat of his boyhood rival Novak Djokovic in Toronto in July, has been so startling that Sam Querrey, an early-round opponent here at Bercy, was moved to suggest that Murray &apos;is arguably the best player in the world right now&apos;. That assessment must go on hold until he has pitted himself against the other top seven at the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai later this month, but it offered a glimpse of just how Murray is viewed by his peers in the locker room. To get a more detached view, I spoke to Patrice Dominguez, the former French No 1 and now head of men&apos;s tennis at the French Federation, who is one of the most astute assessors of a player&apos;s worth in the game. &apos;Since Roland Garros, Murray has simplified his game,&apos; Dominguez said. &apos;He can still surprise opponents, but he has been concentrating on his basic strengths: his movement, anticipation, big serves and great returns. We see less of the wrong choice of shot now. And he has put on weight, making him physically stronger.&apos; During Roland Garros, Dominguez had a chat with Alex Corretja, the Spaniard who was working with Murray during the clay court season. At the time, Dominguez felt Murray must be a nightmare for a coach because the young Scot never played two points the same way and was too keen to air his vast range of skills at every opportunity. &apos;I think Alex got him to focus more on his strengths and the results have been impressive,&apos; Dominguez said. &apos;I thought he was really strong against Gilles Simon in the final of Madrid, showing no sign of a mental let-down after his great win over Roger Federer in the semis. That&apos;s a sure sign of maturity.&apos; That maturity has been showing itself off court as well. Pete Holtermann, who has been an ATP media manager for the past five years, also sings Murray&apos;s praises. &apos;Andy is one of the players I like working with best,&apos; Holtermann said. &apos;He has become very aware of his media responsibilities and just gets on with it.&apos; Such a statement would have stretched credibility 18 months ago, when Murray was still having a tense and tetchy relationship with the demands of the media. But the fire, thankfully, is still in the belly, as a French photographer discovered when he let off his motor drive at courtside at the precise moment Murray dropped serve - and lost the match - against David Nalbandian on Friday. The man got an earful - hardly surprising, as it coincided with the end of a 14-match winning streak for a player who was just beginning to show signs of mental and physical fatigue. But Murray will be fine for Shanghai, where, as a measure of his advance, Rafael Nadal and Federer will be hoping that he is not in their round-robin group. He is not the best player in the world yet - but the idea is gaining traction. Meanwhile, Nalbandian reached his second successive Paris Masters final with a 6-1 5-7 6-4 defeat of Nikolay Davydenko, the man he replaced as champion here last year. The win increased his chances of reaching Shanghai, although he will have to beat local favourite Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who defeated James Blake 6-3 6-4 in the second semi-final.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Andy Murray", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-02T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/02/kate-winslet-leonardo-di-caprio", "sentences": ["(&apos;Somewhere there must have been a spark,&apos; Bacall said in 2007, &apos;because we were fooling and joking and that always leads to trouble.&apos;) And when ex-lovers Woody Allen and Diane Keaton traded wisecracks again after a long hiatus in 1993&apos;s Manhattan Murder Mystery, their rumpled comic joyfulness was as evident, and as exciting, as it had been in Seventies work such as Sleeper and Annie Hall Even genuine intimacy doesn&apos;t necessarily translate to the screen, as demonstrated by Madonna&apos;s inability to generate sparks with any of her male co-stars, even those with whom she happened to be sharing a bed at the time (Sean Penn in Shanghai Surprise, Warren Beatty in Dick Tracy)."], "title": "It's a kind of magic", "article": "How peculiar that the name we have given to one of cinema&apos;s most intangible appeals for our approval is &apos;chemistry&apos;, when there is nothing in the least bit scientific about it. Sure, every now and then someone will claim to have nailed the essence of what makes a memorable or compelling screen couple. In 2004, for example, scientists at London&apos;s King&apos;s College announced they had arrived at a formula for engineering romantic chemistry between two movie stars. They gave the relationship between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray in Lost in Translation nine points out of a possible 10 for its &apos;subtlety&apos;, and declared that the moment in When Harry Met Sally... in which Billy Crystal confesses his love for Meg Ryan resulted in that esoteric scientific sensation known as &apos;a slight butterfly in [the] tummy&apos;. In other words, they didn&apos;t have the foggiest idea how screen chemistry comes about either.  But the success and failure of a movie can rest on this amorphous connection between two performers. A screen romance can be engineered by camera placement, manipulated in the editing suite and bolstered by an emphatic composer, but if there&apos;s nothing between the supposed lovers other than a yearning to hear the word &apos;Cut&apos; and get back to the craft service table, it is comforting to think that we will be able to tell from our vantage point in the stalls. The next few months will see studios and distributors going into overdrive as they launch the movies on which they are pinning their Oscar hopes, and a good deal of these will stand or fall on whether or not audiences warm to the partnerships at the centre of them. So much of our response to a film is dictated by whether we believe in it or not, and the most fundamental element of that belief is our relationship with the actors, and their relationship with each other. Thanks to Titanic, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio will be joined for ever. But that could count for nought in the context of the upcoming Revolutionary Road, in which they play a bickering couple whose marriage is unravelling - not at all the same thing as being carefree lovers jigging in the third-class cabin and having clammy sex in a steamed-up jalopy. Then there is Australia, in which Nicole Kidman was originally paired with her close friend Russell Crowe until he queried the number of zeroes on his cheque and was replaced by the more even-tempered and considerably less picky Hugh Jackman. And while Gus van Sant&apos;s Oscar-tipped Milk concentrates on the political life of openly gay Seventies politician Harvey Milk, played by Sean Penn, it&apos;ll be interesting to see whether Penn and his on-screen lover James Franco will make a plausible couple, irrespective of their much-discussed but as-yet-unseen lip-locking. It&apos;s not just romantic partnerships that must ignite our interest. Frost/Nixon depends for its kick on the frisson between Michael Sheen as David Frost and Frank Langella as his quarry, Richard Nixon; the screenplay is suffused with boxing metaphors, but the film will be on the ropes if viewers don&apos;t consider the leads to be evenly matched. The Soloist stars Robert Downey Jr as a journalist who bonds with a homeless musician, played by Jamie Foxx, but Universal, which is releasing the film, will be hoping for a harmonious duet between these two credible awards contenders. Recent thriller Righteous Kill teamed Robert De Niro with Al Pacino for only the second time (excluding The Godfather Part II, in which they occupied separate plot-lines) but overplayed the tantalising rapport that the actors had generated in just a few scenes of Heat. &apos;Leave &apos;em wanting more&apos; and &apos;Quit while you&apos;re ahead&apos; were just two of the thoughts that came to mind as Righteous Kill killed our desire to see another De Niro/Pacino pas de deux in this lifetime. Like the most durable relationships in life, the on-screen couple can benefit from enjoying their own space, as those actors did for the majority of Heat. The word &apos;daring&apos; may have no business being mentioned in the same paragraph as Sleepless in Seattle, but even the stoniest viewer would have to concede that there was something playfully adventurous in the determination to keep the film&apos;s stars, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, apart until the final moments. Sometimes it pays off, as it did here and in daffy 1959 comedy Pillow Talk, where Doris Day and Rock Hudson played many of their scenes on the phone. Sometimes not - one of the common complaints about Anthony Minghella&apos;s Cold Mountain was that the bond between its stars, Nicole Kidman and Jude Law, was too slender to give their protracted on-screen estrangement any weight, or their reunion much sense of triumph. At their most fruitful, on-screen couples can lend a sense of conspiratorial intimacy and continuity to audiences&apos; cinema-going habits. Most commercial film-making is geared toward giving consumers what they already know they want, with the odd tweak here and there for the sake of freshness; an ongoing partnership advertises in advance the pleasures on offer. From Myrna Loy and William Powell in the series of detective films that began with The Thin Man in 1934, to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in the Road to... comedies, the successful partnership has been as reassuringly defined as any genre. The pairing of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, for example, over the course of nine films - Adam&apos;s Rib (1949) and Pat and Mike (1952) being the niftiest - provided viewers with a chance to witness an ongoing and often thrillingly sparky courtship in which zingers were thwacked back and forth in the manner of a Wimbledon rally.  Film and reality isn&apos;t always strictly demarcated, and a real-life couple like Hepburn and Tracy must have brought before the camera some of the crackle of their off-screen relationship, just as Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall did in their films together, most notably the electrifying To Have and Have Not, on which they first met in 1944. (&apos;Somewhere there must have been a spark,&apos; Bacall said in 2007, &apos;because we were fooling and joking and that always leads to trouble.&apos;) And when ex-lovers Woody Allen and Diane Keaton traded wisecracks again after a long hiatus in 1993&apos;s Manhattan Murder Mystery, their rumpled comic joyfulness was as evident, and as exciting, as it had been in Seventies work such as Sleeper and Annie Hall Even genuine intimacy doesn&apos;t necessarily translate to the screen, as demonstrated by Madonna&apos;s inability to generate sparks with any of her male co-stars, even those with whom she happened to be sharing a bed at the time (Sean Penn in Shanghai Surprise, Warren Beatty in Dick Tracy). It seems almost taboo to mention Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck in Gigli, like saying the word &apos;Macbeth&apos; in a theatre dressing room, but it remains vital that we learn lessons from that experience, now that our laughter at the film has abated. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise struck some intriguingly discordant notes in Eyes Wide Shut, but it wasn&apos;t their fault that their strong work was underappreciated; audiences titillated by the suggestion of biology as well as chemistry in that film&apos;s trailer reacted badly to what they perceived as a broken promise. Which couple now provides that same depth and breadth? It is so unusual in modern cinema for a couple to be paired across more than one film that when it does occur, it feels like a PR stunt or a freaky coincidence. Hanks and Ryan teamed up again in You&apos;ve Got Mail, but there seemed nothing much left for them to build on, and Hanks arguably found a more charismatic sparring partner when he shared the screen with a volleyball named Wilson in Cast Away. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts were one of the most adored screen couples of the early Nineties, fully charming enough to make audiences forget that (a) their hit film together, Pretty Woman, implicitly advocated prostitution as a way of snagging Mr Right and that (b) until this point, Gere had seemed unable to express convincingly amorous feelings toward anyone but himself. But how deflated they both seemed in their reunion, 10 years later, in Runaway Bride. The same experiment failed a second time recently for Gere, as the millions of people who cherished his screen work with Diane Lane in Unfaithful failed conspicuously to display any fidelity toward their rematch in Nights in Rodanthe There are director-star teams who attract audiences in the way acting duos once did - think of Scorsese and De Niro, or Scorsese and DiCaprio - while comic chemistry has been strongly represented by the Frat Pack and its various spin-offs. But where is the sizzling romantic partnership that draws on the same magic as Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford in The Way We Were, or Streisand and Ryan O&apos;Neal in What&apos;s Up, Doc?, let alone Tracy/Hepburn or Bogart/Bacall? I propose there is only one in recent cinema to even come close: Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in Richard Linklater&apos;s brace of eloquent, freewheeling love stories, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset In those films, this delightful couple strolls first through Vienna, then Paris, shooting the breeze about whatever occurs to them. It is the aura of weightlessness in their interaction, as well as its warmth and inclusivity, that epitomises what any truly great screen couple should aspire to. Screen chemistry is predicated on two elements. First, the audience must believe wholeheartedly that the relationship on screen is organic, and not just something cooked up in the offices of CAA, or spliced together by a wily editor. Second, we should feel that we are being magically incorporated into that relationship, not as gooseberries or voyeurs, but as sympathetic advocates. The reason audiences reacted so badly to, say, Lopez and Affleck was arguably because their whole partnership had the ring of some sneering, postmodern in-joke on the absurdities of celebrity; we were outside, looking in, like spectators along the route of a garish parade. Conversely, Delpy and Hawke, like all the most magnetic screen couples, make us feel exactly the way we want to feel in the real-life relationships we engender - in a word, wanted. Five electric scenes that lit up the screen Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) Bogart was 44 years old, Bacall 19. In their spiciest scene together, she practically had him - and us - dangling on the end of a string like a yo-yo. &apos;You know how to whistle, don&apos;t you, Steve? You just put your lips together and ... blow.&apos; They married the following year. Well, wouldn&apos;t you? Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in Pat and Mike (1952) &apos;An upper-cruster like you and my kinda type that can&apos;t even speak left-handed English,&apos; observes Tracy, as the sports promoter who takes a shine, professionally and personally, to the athletic Hepburn. &apos;The whole gizmo is hard to believe.&apos; But audiences gladly did so, falling hook, line and sinker for Hepburn/Tracy over nine films.  Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in Annie Hall (1977) &apos;Love is too weak a word for what I feel - I luuurve you, you know, I loave you, I luff you, two Fs.&apos; This autobiographical comedy (Allen and Keaton were ex-lovers) brims with bittersweet moments, such as the lobster-boiling scene, improvised for the camera, in which Allen cracks up uncontrollably. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic (1997) Kate and Leo clicked in a major way, no more so than in the famous &apos;sketch&apos; scene in which she turns the tables on him, insisting that he draw her with a diamond necklace on, and nothing else. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in Before Sunset (2004) Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) meet in Paris nine years after their one night together in Vienna. Now he has to fly home to his family. &apos;Baby, you are gonna miss that plane,&apos; she purrs. &apos;I know,&apos; he replies. Fade out.

I&apos;ve heard various people hazard the view that Hamilton made his fair share of mistakes along the way. I don&apos;t agree and in any case, his wins this season at Melbourne, Monaco, Silverstone, Hockenheim and Shanghai more than balance out any low points he may have encountered.  Additionally, when making observations like that you have to take account of the fact that he became the youngest ever world champion at 23 years, nine months and 26 days, and also just how much pressure you are having to handle.  In your first season you are given the benefit of the doubt but, as Hamilton has discovered, in your second the pressure steps up and you have to deliver on that initial promise.  Becoming world champion involves a huge deal of emotional stress and I really don&apos;t think that fact has been widely appreciated, and I think Hamilton went through quite a lot of soul searching. It&apos;s a rite of passage, in a sense, dealing with the inevitable pressure from the media. It&apos;s a bit like a cat with a mouse, isn&apos;t it? I&apos;m not saying that the cat wants to kill the mouse but it&apos;s a test they put you through. It starts with the fulsome praise but just a few wrong steps and before you know it you&apos;ve suddenly changed into a national embarrassment. I was talking to a tabloid journalist about this and he said: &quot;But Damon, you never went through what Lewis has suffered&quot; and I replied: &quot;I was the one who was referred to as prat right round the front of The Sun&quot;. It was a quote from my team boss Frank Williams and, I can tell you, that sort of thing hurts. The real competitor motivates himself. All I wanted to do was to achieve the results and you just need to ride out what the media is saying about you. That&apos;s what Lewis has to do. You just have to keep a sense of humour about it, although I must admit that I had a sense of humour failure on many occasions. I always felt, as Lewis clearly does, that it is important to surround yourself with people you trust. I was lucky enough to have a posse of friends who supported me and also believed that I had the talent to get the job done. From what I can see Hamilton is pretty much the same, but when you&apos;ve made a mistake, ultimately the only person that you have to square your conscience with is yourself. And in that way Hamilton is very strong, very strong indeed.  Ultimately, of course, what Hamilton has proved this year more than anything else is that he has huge mental strength. He has suffered his setbacks, sure enough, but he has addressed them in a logical fashion and never allowed them to get on top of him.  Winning a world championship is a huge achievement, we all know that, but Hamilton&apos;s rise to prominence has been truly impressive over his first couple of years in formula one. I am sure he has plenty more winning to do.", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-03T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/nov/03/formulaone-lewishamilton", "sentences": ["Seven days later, however, he dominated the field in Shanghai, taking pole position, the race win and the fastest lap."], "title": "Formula one: With this layer of authority Lewis Hamilton can now become a great", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday November 5 2008 Lewis Hamilton was not the first Briton to win the Monaco grand prix since Jackie Stewart in 1969. Graham Hill won the race that year; Stewart and David Coulthard have won more recently. As a season strewn with errors and inconsistences from all the leading protagonists reached a pulsating climax yesterday, Lewis Hamilton did exactly what he needed to do. In difficult conditions he kept a cool head, stayed out of trouble, and got himself into position to grab the points he needed to ensure that those close to him would not be subjected to another season of acute hypertension. Now he has won his first title, and there is no reason why he cannot add several more to join the great figures of the sport&apos;s post-war history. It is certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility that he will overtake Sir Jackie Stewart to become the first of Britain&apos;s nine world champions to take the title more than three times. By winning it 12 months after virtually throwing it away in a display of callowness, he will have added a layer of authority to his already remarkable confidence.  Most of all, his rivals will be praying that he does not prove to be the figure capable of filling the shoes vacated two years ago by Michael Schumacher, who established a greater hold over formula one than any man since Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1950s. A Hamilton hegemony is a prospect dreaded by those who finished ahead of him on the track yesterday but trailed in the final standings. The effect of Schumacher&apos;s departure is the most plausible explanation for the wholesale errors that have made the 2008 season such an enthralling switchback ride, its outcome in doubt until the closing seconds. In the German&apos;s absence a group of drivers have vied for supremacy, without the benefit of the performance yardstick that the seven-times champion provided for so long. The opportunity to establish themselves as his successor induced many outbreaks of injudiciousness and overambition, and none of the current crop has yet learnt how to focus the efforts of a team in the way Schumacher did. Felipe Massa, who ran Hamilton so close, began the season by spinning out of the Australian and Malaysian grands prix. At that stage the Italian press was virtually unanimous in calling on the Ferrari management to replace him. But Massa would end the season with six victories, one more than Hamilton. &quot;Not bad for a wanker, eh?&quot; he said to a friend on Saturday after setting the time that gave him pole position in yesterday&apos;s race. After that terrible start he had thoroughly outshone his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, the defending world champion, whose own errors restricted him to a pair of wins.  Hamilton began the season as though all the lessons of his debut campaign had been learnt, the good and bad experiences absorbed. In Melbourne, where both Ferraris went out with engine problems, he controlled the race brilliantly, unflustered by three safety-car periods. The next two races, however, were severely disappointing. Fifth in Malaysia was followed by 13th in Bahrain, where he clumsily ran into the back of Fernando Alonso&apos;s Renault on the second lap. This was by some distance his worst display since arriving in formula one, and questions were being asked. Even worse, the Ferraris had regained their mechanical reliability.  Three consecutive podium appearances for the McLaren team leader temporarily silenced the sceptics. Third behind the Ferraris in Barcelona and second behind Massa in Istanbul, Hamilton swept to victory in Monaco. On streets made treacherous by rain, all the zest and concentration appeared to have returned to his driving. He also made the most of a piece of luck when a brush with a barrier in the opening stages prompted an early pit stop to change a damaged rear wheel, which turned out to give him an unexpected strategic advantage. He became the first British driver to claim victory in the principality since Stewart in 1969.  To receive the trophy on a track where his idol, Ayrton Senna, had won six times provoked an emotional response. &quot;This was the race I wanted to win more than any other in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;When I was a kid I looked at the tunnel, the swimming pool, it just looked spectacular so automatically it became my favourite race.&quot; In Montreal he blotted his copybook by driving into the back of the stationary Raikkonen while the Ferrari driver was waiting for the light to go green at the end of the pit lane. A 10-place grid penalty at the next race, in France, was compounded by a drive-through penalty for cutting a chicane, relegating him to 10th. Once again, however, he came back fighting. At Silverstone he silenced a crescendo of criticism and overcame intermittent showers to win a grand prix in front of his home supporters for the first time. Starting from a disappointing fourth place on the grid, he unfurled an almost flawless drive which eventually gave him a margin of more than a minute over his nearest pursuer. &quot;By far the best victory I&apos;ve had,&quot; he said, explaining that at times he had needed to keeping flipping up his visor in order to clear the fogging that was obscuring his vision. And as the first half of the season came to an end, Hamilton and the two Ferrari drivers had 48 points apiece. The momentum was maintained in Germany, where he overcame the team&apos;s strategic error during a safety-car period to beat Massa to the flag. A puncture in Hungary dropped him to fifth and neck spasms at the dull new Valencia track prevented him from challenging Massa for first place, but a rousing win in difficult conditions at Spa was controversially converted into a third place when the stewards docked him 25 seconds for cutting a chicane late in the race, even though he had complied with the law by immediately handing back the place he had taken from Raikkonen. A poor choice of tyres during the wet qualifying session at Monza left him in 15th place on the grid, and a charge up to second place was spoiled by a late stop that dropped him to seventh. In Singapore an awful race under the floodlights for Ferrari - Massa setting off from the pits with the fuel hose still attached, Raikkonen hitting the wall - allowed Hamilton to pick up the points for a circumpect third place. The races in Japan and China, a week apart, summed up his inconsistency. At Fuji, in mayhem that recalled the heyday of the feuding Senna and Alain Prost, he overcompensated for a poor start, lost places and was hit by Massa on the second lap. Given a drive-through penalty for the incident at the first corner, he could finish only 12th. Seven days later, however, he dominated the field in Shanghai, taking pole position, the race win and the fastest lap. &quot;All weekend we had God on our side,&quot; he said after his lead had widened once again to that fateful seven points. The year after Mike Hawthorn&apos;s triumph, Jack Brabham got out of the cockpit and pushed his stricken Cooper the last half-mile to win the title at Sebring. Had that been asked of Lewis Hamilton yesterday, he would almost certainly have been equal to the challenge.", "tags": ["Formula One 2008", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-03T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/03/westfield-shopping-centre", "sentences": ["They look like a cross between a giant 1980s airport terminal and, well, a big, brash and shiny shopping mall of the sort you might expect to find anywhere today from Des Moines to Dubai via Shanghai and Sydney."], "title": "Westfield mega mall: the death of city architecture", "article": "The Great Exhibition held in the Crystal Palace in London&apos;s Hyde Park in 1851 was, so the late Clive Wainwright, a much missed curator at the Victoria and Albert museum, told me, a &quot;great opportunity to go shopping&quot; for millions of British people who could never have seen, let alone imagined, anything like a modern mall such as Westfield, the \u00a31.7bn Australian-owned retail complex that opened to a deafening fanfare in west London this week. Wainwright&apos;s idea made me sit up and think. I&apos;d always thought, a little unthinkingly, of the Great Exhibition as a stirring, if sometimes kitsch, celebration of all that was meant to be best in British and British imperial design in the middle of the 19th century. But, Wainwright was right. The Crystal Palace was indeed a progenitor of today&apos;s colossal shopping malls. Some of the malls and other big shops built in Britain in the 1980s even borrowed more or less directly from the design of Joseph Paxton&apos;s revolutionary iron and glass exhibition hall. Significantly, the vast Westfield mall occupies the site of what, long ago, had been the legendary White City, a fairytale gathering of exhibition halls in the guise of exotic palaces designed by the Hungarian engineer and showman Imre Kiralfy. For a number of years, the White City, first opened for the 1908 Franco-British exhibition, was a playground for Londoners. It stood empty for several decades before the last surviving of its buildings, long shorn of fancy decoration, were demolished in the 1990s. I remember walking through these lofty halls when the biggest were nothing more than giant aviaries for distinctly messy feral pigeons and the haunt of scuttling rats. So, Westfield has opened in the right place. White City is the spiritual home of the contemporary shopping mall, which is as much a place to buy things as it is a place to seek entertainment and amusement and, indirectly, to make an exhibition of ourselves. The big ambition of Westfield is very much a reflection of who we have become in Britain over the past 150 years, a nation of shopkeepers and avid shoppers crazy for ever more bangles and beads as long as they are &quot;branded&quot; made by sweated labour in developing countries and implausibly expensive. The huge new buildings, designed largely in-house by Westfield architects are far, far less interesting from a design point of view than either Kiralfy&apos;s White City or Paxton&apos;s Crystal Palace. They look like a cross between a giant 1980s airport terminal and, well, a big, brash and shiny shopping mall of the sort you might expect to find anywhere today from Des Moines to Dubai via Shanghai and Sydney.  Originally, this mega mall with its chain stores, interspersed with unlikely branches of Neal&apos;s Yard, the independent Covent Garden cheese shop, and Rigby &amp; Peller, purveyors of undergarments to HM Queen Elizabeth II, multi-screen cinema, chain cafes and bling&apos;n&apos;branded luxury good outlets, for celebrities, footballers and credit card junkies, was to have been designed in an adventurous, tented way by the London architect Ian Ritchie. But, who wants innovation when there is so much more to buy and sell than Paxton&apos;s Crystal Palace could ever have offered?  Perhaps there are people in London who have never walked through a shiny, mega mall like Westfield before and who might well be impressed by its bright lights, sheer scale and the daunting range of costly gewgaws on sale inside. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, is certainly impressed. Good luck to him, the Westfield company and anyone else who feels the need for yet another giant mall. My own preference for traditional city streets, a mix of architecture historic and new, covered markets, street markets, independent shops and a sense of normal, everyday life - birdsong, dogs, passing traffic, sun, showers, frost and snow - will mean very little to the millions who will come here to mill around, gawp, spend and lark about as the crowds once did in the long forgotten halls of White City and the burned down naves and aisles of the Crystal Palace. If you&apos;ve seen the Disney film Wall-E, you&apos;ll certainly recognise Westfield and malls like it. In the film, humans who long ago abandoned the Earth they messed up through greed, live a supremely sedentary life shopping and eating. They are very tubby and have lost the use of their legs. Is this how we&apos;ll end up? Or will we plunge into the depths of some mammoth recession or some fearful age of global warming, or cooling, and end up with nothing and nowhere to spend? My feeling, though, is that in the short to medium term, Westfield is just a tiny step towards our collective desire to undermine the life and culture of the traditional city, along with its architecture, and to shop and shop some more.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Retail industry", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-03T13:03:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/03/tennis-rafaelnadal", "sentences": ["World No1 Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the forthcoming Masters Cup tournament in Shanghai.", "That is also another reason for not coming to Shanghai.&quot;"], "title": "Tennis: exhausted Nadal pulls out of Masters Cup", "article": "World No1 Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the forthcoming Masters Cup tournament in Shanghai.

Analysts insist M&amp;S will have to cut its dividend either this year or next, given the marked deterioration in profitability. But M&amp;S&apos;s finance and operations director, Ian Dyson, insisted: &quot;There is no change in the dividend policy and no plans to change it.&quot; Dyson&apos;s reassurances came as the retailer reported profits of \u00a3297.8m in the six months to September 27, down from \u00a3451.8m a year ago. The performance beat analyst estimates of around \u00a3290m.  The retailer confirmed it would pay an interim dividend of 8.3p, providing relief for its legions of small shareholders who have seen the value of their shares halve this year. M&amp;S executive chairman, Sir Stuart Rose, blamed the wider economy for the profit slump: &quot;The UK economy is having a very difficult time and we can&apos;t defy gravity. If I believed we had a bad business plan I would change it.&quot; He said the economic environment had changed dramatically in the past year and it was encountering the &quot;most difficult retail conditions since the early 90s. M&amp;S is a very strong business in a very weak economy.&quot;  M&amp;S said trade over the last month had been &quot;volatile&quot; as consumer confidence was rocked by the financial crisis that has seen high street banks topple. To counteract the downturn the retailer plans to cut costs but promised &quot;no major redundancies&quot; were planned. Rose said erratic trading patterns made Christmas difficult to call. Analysts are anticipating the worst trading conditions for a generation as consumers juggle rising living costs with nervousness surrounding the economic outlook. &quot;Interest rates should come down so hopefully we will see some blue sky towards the end of 2009,&quot; he added. M&amp;S will try to attract shoppers to its stores with a Christmas advertising campaign featuring boyband Take That and TV actor Robson Green as well as regular M&amp;S faces Twiggy and Erin O&apos;Connor.  The retailer said it had benefited from a tight rein on costs and lower prices which boosted the top line - total sales were up 1% at \u00a34.2bn. However underlying sales - a key measure of a retailer&apos;s health - were down 5.7% over the half. Analysts expect M&amp;S to make profits of \u00a3667m in the current year, compared with \u00a31bn. Rose said its womenswear and menswear businesses were &quot;stable&quot; after recent market share data suggested they had lost ground to rivals over the summer. The retailer made market share gains in lingerie and childrenswear. Underlying sales at the clothing and homewares division were down 6.2%. Of more concern is the recent performance of the retailer&apos;s food business where profits and market share are falling as rising food prices encouraged customers to trade down to cheaper stores as well as discounters such as Aldi.  To improve its value credentials the retailer has cut the price of over 500 food products and introduced promotions such as &apos;Dine in for \u00a310&apos;. Rose said John Dixon, who took over as head of food earlier this year, was getting to grips with empty shelves and was confident customers would seek out its Christmas fare. M&amp;S said food inflation in its stores was below 3%. Last month M&amp;S dramatically scaled back its spending plans for this year and next, a decision that has put the brakes on a costly store refurbishment programme and curtailed UK expansion plans.  However it is pressing on in international markets with plans to open 15 stores in India over the next two years. It recently made its market debut in China, opening its first store in Shanghai in October. Rose believes the international arm has the potential to account for a fifth of sales.

At the start of his career a lot of people had serious doubts about whether he could handle the pressure, and about his temperament on court. There has been a 100% improvement in his game this year. Andy has all the shots, and great hands. He is a huge talent.&quot; With Rafa Nadal having pulled out of the TMC last week, Murray was a little unlucky to be drawn in the same round-robin group as Roger Federer, who has won the tournament four times including last year.

If Murray were to play Federer a second time, and he holds a 3-2 lead over the 13-times slam champion, then it would be in the final a week on Sunday.

He played unbelievably well at Wimbledon in that match against Richard Gasquet before meeting Nadal, and if he finds himself in the same situation against Rafa next year than I think he knows he can beat him. &quot;You know, Andy can play on all surfaces and in a variety of ways. He can hit the ball soft and he can hit it hard; he can play from the baselines and he can also move to the net when it suits him. He makes it very difficult for his opponents and they find it confusing to play him. &quot;It is a shame Nadal will not be in Shanghai but he deserves to be the No1 this year. Federer has had a good year though maybe if you talk to Roger he will say it has been a bad one. I believe he will come back and take the No1 spot, though obviously Nadal will still be the player for everybody to beat on clay.

The answer is a small yes and a larger no. Obama is likely to enjoy a honeymoon as never before. By being black, he is different. By not being Bush, he is different. Wherever he travels in the world, people will line the streets, queuing for a view for almost as long as Americans queued to vote. Although expectations are extraordinarily high, Obama&apos;s people have tried to manage them as best they could.

From the moment he stole the election in 2000, George W Bush undermined faith in everything from the electoral process to advocacy of civil liberties and the observance of international law.

They told a press conference they shot and killed the man at the wheel of his vehicle to prevent him causing further deaths. Police said Luo, a migrant worker from Hubei province, was &quot;introverted and intolerant&quot; and had become embittered by work and marital problems. When traffic officers confiscated his driving licence and motorbike last month, because the vehicle had fake licence plates, he wrote a letter to his wife and parents saying he did not want to live any more. On Wednesday the traffic police told Luo they would give him a 1000 yuan (\u00a390) fine, award him penalty points and make him pass a test before returning his licence. As he angrily left their office he told a friend he wanted to drive to a local school and knock people over. His friend reported him to police but they were unable to capture Luobefore he drove to Chengdong Middle School in the Doumen area, where students were leaving at the end of the school day. He ploughed into two pupils just outside the grounds, throwing off a man who tried to climb on to his truck to stop him as he burst through the back gate of the school. Inside, he hit more pupils and parents - killing four teenagers and oneparent, leaving two more in a critical condition - before exiting throughthe front of the grounds. Police said they fired twice to kill Luo as he drove through theneighbourhood at high speed, ignoring warnings to stop. The education authorities have sent special counselling teams to provide support to children in the area. China has seen numerous cases of frustrations boiling over into violence in recent months. Earlier this week, a man was sentenced to death for injuring 18 people when he blew up a government office in retaliation for the destruction of his illegally-built home. In perhaps the most notorious case, 28-year-old Yang Jia killed sixofficers in a raid on a police station in Shanghai in July, in revenge forhis earlier detention over a bicycle, which they said he had stolen.  Police denied mistreating him, but the case has prompted widespread sympathy, with many seeing it as emblematic of official brutality and the impossibility of ordinary citizens achieving redress. Thousands of internet users have attacked Yang&apos;s death sentence.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-06T17:23:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/07/golf", "sentences": ["Phil Mickelson underlined his determination to remain No2 in the world by matching his rival, Sergio Garc\u00eda, on six-under-par 66 in the opening round of the HSBC Champions event in Shanghai."], "title": "Golf: Garc\u00eda has Mickelson in his sights", "article": "Phil Mickelson underlined his determination to remain No2 in the world by matching his rival, Sergio Garc\u00eda, on six-under-par 66 in the opening round of the HSBC Champions event in Shanghai.  Garc\u00eda won the Players Championship and October&apos;s Castell\u00f3 Masters and a victory in China would take him past Mickelson and behind only the runaway No1, Tiger Woods. Even a top-three finish for the Spaniard, who finished fourth in last week&apos;s 2008 season-ending Volvo Masters, might be enough should Mickelson fall back in the next three rounds.  However, there was no sign of the three-times major winner struggling yesterday. The American and Garc\u00eda are level with the world No8, Anthony Kim, also of the US, and the Australian Adam Scott, one shot behind the leader, Henrik Stenson. The Swede kicked off the 2009 European Tour season and Race to Dubai in wet conditions at Sheshan International with an impressive 65. But much of the focus was on the battle taking place just behind the Ryder Cup player.  &quot;A win last week would have put me to world No2. I think the important thing is that I&apos;m moving in the right direction,&quot; said the 28-year-old Garc\u00eda. &quot;It would be nice to finish the year as world No2 but if I don&apos;t I&apos;ve just got to come out next year, come out strong and try and keep playing well and it will come.&quot; Whereas Garc\u00eda has one eye on moving in behind the inactive Woods, Mickelson insists he does not even understand the world ranking system. The 38-year-old left-hander began the defence of the first title he has won outside his homeland since 1993 with an opening round which, like Stenson&apos;s and Kim&apos;s, included an eagle three at the 550-yard 2nd. &quot;Certainly Sergio has played some great golf this year,&quot; Mickelson said. &quot;He played wonderful in the FedEx Cup series and he is a tremendous talent, but I haven&apos;t thought about losing the rankings yet. My thought throughout the year is more about trying to win major championships. It&apos;s more about trying to play well in the FedEx Cup events at the end of the year and overall improvement.&quot;", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-07T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/08/andymurray-tennis", "sentences": ["Andy Murray is desperate to end his remarkable year on a winning note, even if the Masters Cup, starting in Shanghai tomorrow, is a tournament too far in the Scot&apos;s gruelling 11-month season."], "title": "Tennis: Jaded Murray calls for a break from the grind", "article": "Andy Murray is desperate to end his remarkable year on a winning note, even if the Masters Cup, starting in Shanghai tomorrow, is a tournament too far in the Scot&apos;s gruelling 11-month season. &quot;The tennis season is so long that there are arguments for stopping the season after the US Open, and finishing with a tournament like one of the grand slams perhaps makes sense,&quot; Murray said. &quot;For the players it [the Masters Cup] is huge but I don&apos;t think people outside tennis really know too much about it, which is a shame. But at the same time I can understand that, with such a long season, it&apos;s tough to sort of follow what&apos;s going on.&quot; The 21-year-old&apos;s chance of claiming his sixth title of the year at the last competition of the season received a boost on Monday when the world No1, Rafael Nadal, pulled out to give a knee injury time to heal in advance of the Davis Cup final on November 21 against Argentina. But Murray does not want to see the tournament, which pits the season&apos;s top eight players against each other in round-robin format, cheapened by too many withdrawals.  &quot;If one guy pulls out, it&apos;s not too disappointing,&quot; he said. &quot;But if there&apos;s three, four guys that miss out, then that would be not so good.&quot; The Madrid Masters and Cincinnati Masters champion has been drawn against the world No2, Roger Federer, as well as Nadal&apos;s replacement, Gilles Simon, and Andy Roddick in the Red Group. The Gold Group is composed of Novak Djokovic, Nikolay Davydenko, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro. Murray, who faces Roddick in what will be his first Masters Cup match on Monday, does not rank the tournament as highly as a grand slam championship but recognises that, &quot;if you are in the top eight you know that you&apos;ve had a great year&quot;. The world No4 has had a superb second-half to 2008 and identifies his form since being eliminated by Nadal at the quarter-final stage of Wimbledon in June as the most satisfying aspect of his season. &quot;In the last three or four months the guys that I&apos;ve lost to since Wimbledon - Nadal, Federer, Nalbandian - have been top-class,&quot; he said. &quot;I played one bad game - against Lu [Yen-Hsu] at the Olympics - but I&apos;ve lost only four or five matches since; that&apos;s what&apos;s been most pleasing. &quot;I&apos;ve been able to play at a level where the ranking points I&apos;ve picked up in the last few months have been more than anyone else on the tour,&quot; he added. &quot;It&apos;s not just been one-off tournaments, it&apos;s been that kind of consistency. I need to try and keep that up until this time next year if I want to move up the rankings and, hopefully, win a grand slam.&quot; Such a good run of form has left Britain&apos;s No1 feeling jaded but he is confident he will be &quot;pretty fresh&quot; come tournament time. However, his ambition to go one step further than he did at this year&apos;s US Open and win a grand slam title will not allow him to rest for more than a week. He plans to take six to seven days off after the Masters before heading to Miami where training for next season will commence, taking a break only to return to the UK for Christmas. Despite this season&apos;s improvement Murray, who took part in a Highland Spring Wii tournament earlier this week, is realistic about his prospects, aware that there is still a gap between the top two players in the world and the rest.  &quot;I think Nadal and Federer are much, much better on other surfaces than I am,&quot; conceded Murray. &quot;I know I need to improve my clay-court game and my grass-court game next year. I think on hard [surfaces] I&apos;m not that far behind them but I know on the other surfaces I&apos;ve got a lot of work to do. &quot;I want to try and win a grand slam and, if I can do that, then I&apos;ll go after the No1 ranking.

It sounds awkward because I have been up there for so long. It is a challenge to get back where I was, and next year will be a good chance. I&apos;m going to try and do everything, starting here.&quot; Federer has won the TMC four times, and a fifth would place him on a par with Pete Sampras and Ivan Llendl. &quot;I&apos;m here to win, not just to participate,&quot; stressed the Swiss, who by winning this year&apos;s US Open stretched his number of grand slam titles to 13, one short of equalling Sampras&apos;s record. &quot;I have not been thinking about that record too much. I was just thrilled winning the US Open and getting No13. Not just saving my season but finally playing well on hard courts. I had been really struggling on them this year, and losing matches I should have won. So getting to the final was big. It proved to me that all the hard work had paid off. I will start thinking about Pete&apos;s record more when I go on vacation and begin preparing for next year.&quot; Federer, in the same round robin group as France&apos;s Gilles Simon, Andy Murray, and Andy Roddick, all of whom have beaten him this year, nevertheless remains the undoubted favourite for his fifth TMC title, and is clearly in the mood to re-establish his authority. &quot;It is disappointing Rafa is not here. I hope he gets fit again soon because I never like to see my rivals injured. This tournament has always meant the world to me, and winning it is a goal I have always set myself at the beginning of the season.&quot; Having lost Nadal, the world No1, through a knee injury, the Chinese have been on edge that Federer&apos;s bad back, which forced him to withdraw at the quarter-final stage of the Paris Indoor Masters last week, would not flare up again. &quot;I&apos;ve been practising without pain but I haven&apos;t been pushing it to the very limit. I want to give it the maximum time of recuperation, and then we will see on Monday what is going to happen. Hopefully things are going to be fine.&quot; Whereas the Swiss can take pain killers for his back, the hurt of losing his No1 spot to Nadal and, even more hurtful, the loss of his Wimbledon crown after five successive titles, is not so easily assuaged: &quot;It was a huge disappointment and I was very sad. But I knew the Wimbledon final was great for tennis, and I can now relate more to those players who have lost the final. It increased my love of the tournament and I can&apos;t wait to get the title back.&quot; Federer is keenly aware that the younger generation are snapping at his heels, notably the four players here who are making their TMC debuts - Murray, the Frenchmen Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Simon, and Argentina&apos;s Juan Martin del Potro, who won four consecutive tournament earlier this year. &quot;It is something that is very hard to do - I have never managed it - and he is an excellent player. Murray definitely made his move to the very top this year, while Simon has had his breakthrough, though not at slam level. Tsonga had that great start in Australia, and then got injured, but came back very strong and is so exciting to watch. All four have made their move and now they have to prove themselves next year. This is what will be interesting. But it&apos;s great to have new young players, all with different personalities, both on and off the court. Times are good for men&apos;s tennis.&quot; Federer will not be drawn into which of these players will ultimately prove to be the best, though he clearly sees a lot of himself in Murray, the Scot having beaten him in three of their five meetings. &quot;I like playing Andy and he has everything a good player needs.

The more discerning among you may well have noticed that Robert Karlsson celebrated winning the 2008 European Tour Order of Merit title last Sunday by clambering on to a plane and heading for the start of the 2009 campaign at the HSBC Champions event in Shanghai. No rest for the wickedly good it seems.  This merging of one 12-month-long season straight into another is daft and will change next year when the present season ends late in November and the new one opens in January 2010.  In between, the European Tour&apos;s 2009 season will cover a calendar-defying 53 weeks and reach a big-bucks climax when the Race to Dubai ends at the Dubai World Championship, when $20m (\u00a312.8m) will be on offer, half as prize-money and half as a bonus pool to be shared out among the 15 top-ranked players from this new season. If the winner of the tournament also tops the ranking list, then he pockets $3.6m.  This is a lot of bucks and the old thought - pay pro golfers and they will come - appears to be working. Among the players schlepping their way around Shanghai are Phil Mickelson, Anthony Kim, Camilo Villegas and Adam Scott. Kim, Villegas and Scott are now fully paid-up members of the European Tour, though they remain on the United States Tour as well, and other America-based stars are reportedly on their way to the new gravy train. Mickelson is procrastinating for now while Tiger Woods&apos; wallet-watchers are keeping their eyes on the situation. They are wise to do so as the US circuit is largely funded by financial institutions and car manufacturers and we all know how battered these guys are at present. As George O&apos;Grady, the European Tour&apos;s chief executive and architect of this new-look circuit, says: &apos;People want to see the first year and how it goes. We said before that we will make it as attractive as we can. I don&apos;t think there is much for us to apologise for and there are other things down the line which are going to make us even more attractive in the coming months.&apos;  Golfers are among the most pampered sportsmen in the world and somebody will find something to whinge about before too long. Usually this turns out to be the courtesy limo service. One&apos;s heart bleeds for them.  The serious point here, though, is that suddenly the European circuit is beginning not only to move out from under the US Tour&apos;s long shadow, but to rather irritate the world&apos;s biggest, most profitable golf arena. While nobody yet knows how excited anyone gets about the Race to Dubai&apos;s millions - and there is always the possibility that a world mostly in recession may not take kindly to all this extravagance - there is no doubt that there is a big chance of a shift in golf&apos;s tectonic plate.  O&apos;Grady&apos;s oppo in the States is Tim Finchem, a sharp-faced lawyer type. He invented the Fedex Cup a few years ago to blow some publicity up the rear end of the American season when traditionally everybody forgot about even Tiger and got hooked on gridiron and basketball instead. The Fedex, however, has turned out to be more fed-up than was hoped. The idea was for a big-money climax, but last year&apos;s opener stuttered its way to a conclusion and an inevitable Woods win, while this year&apos;s was even worse, Vijay Singh taking the main prize before the final event was staged. At least the Race to Dubai will have a finishing line and someone bursting through it at the end. O&apos;Grady and his team, clearly, have watched and learned from the US Tour&apos;s discomfiture. What this Fedex Cup also meant was that Finchem effectively conceded the last two or three months of each year to whoever had the nous and ambition to grab it. This the Europeans have now done. In effect we have in place what Greg Norman tried hard to set up 15 years ago, a World Tour. Norman&apos;s idea was a series of exclusive tournaments with huge prize funds, restricted to the elite players with no halfway cut nonsense. It would have worked, too, but for a panicking US Tour&apos;s decision to squash it and to set up the present three World Championship events.  While Norman&apos;s circuit would have straddled the globe, the Americans, after an initial nod in the direction of a world outside the US, have pulled back these events inside their borders. Publicly, Norman has remained fairly quiet about this, but privately he is derisive. This protectionism, however, is now backfiring on the US Tour. The original raison d&apos;\u00eatre for this village mentality was that as it was America that provided the sponsors then the events should rightly be staged there. This did not take into account the fact that major American companies do most of their business outside the US.  Mickelson, who became world No2 despite an original reluctance to work abroad, is currently in China and will increasingly be seen in other parts of the world. He says he wants his family to experience different cultures and, while this may well be true, the other reason for his sudden lust to smell and taste new stuff is that his major sponsors conduct business in 159 countries. Significant though the US is, it is only one of them. &apos;I&apos;m keen to take advantage of all the global opportunities,&apos; Mickelson says. He adds that his four main sponsors &apos;have a global footprint. Their biggest areas of growth are not in the United States, they&apos;re international. It seems as though wealth is being created on an international basis.&apos; OK, Phil may be a slow learner but, be fair, he has learned. A bit, anyway.  The major growth areas and financial clout available to golf are in the Middle and Far East and the reason the Scramble for Loot climaxes in Dubai is because it is the sheikhs there who are putting up the money. The other fact is that they love golf, not as a game, but as a marketing tool and, specifically, a lure to tourists and potential purchasers of property, of which there is a lot in Dubai. The front company for Dubai&apos;s ambition is called Leisurecorp and it is with them that the European Tour has signed a deal that will bring in many millions of dollars over the next five, possibly 10, years.  Leisurecorp in turn is fronted by David Spencer, an amiably dynamic Aussie whose taste in vividly floral shirts is matched only by his enthusiasm for golf as a business tool. When the Dash for Loot was launched formally in Scotland recently - at Turnberry, next year&apos;s Open course and a facility Leisurecorp purchased earlier this year - there was much talk of a new beginning for European golf, of fresh formats and innovation, of floodlit golf and lots of sudden-death events. If any of this comes about it will be because Spencer and the other money men want it.  For now the old 72-hole strokeplay set-up remains firmly in place as the greatest reward for the greatest number. But while this will stay at the core of the game as far as the most significant tournaments, and especially the majors, are concerned, an increasing number of golf fans are keen to watch flashier, and quicker, elite events. It may take a while yet, but these will come so that the rich will get richer while the average tournament pro is going to have to find something else to do.  Meanwhile, the Europeans have the Americans rattled, which is no bad thing.  What happens over the next couple of years may well define professional golf for at least a couple of lifetimes. One final thought: the Race to Dubai World Championship will be staged next year on the new Earth course, one of four courses being built by Leisurecorp at Jumeirah Estates. It is described by Spencer as the largest urban residential golf development in the world.  The designer of this Earth course is Greg Norman. The old boy will be chuckling massively when he lands his jet and officially opens it before this US Tour-crunching tournament gets under way. He who laughs last really does laugh longest. Late surge boosts Garc\u00eda Sergio Garc\u00eda picked up four shots over the last five holes to claim a share of a one-stroke second-round lead with Swede Henrik Stenson at the rain-disrupted HSBC Champions in Shanghai, which is now due to be completed tomorrow. Garc\u00eda, who could overhaul Phil Mickelson as world No2 with a win at Asia&apos;s joint richest tournament, carded a four-under 68 to go 10-under for the tournament, but first-round leader Stenson also birdied the last for a 69 to share the lead.

America, I heard over and over again, wasn&apos;t ready to elect a black man as President. What was unusual about these sentiments was that they weren&apos;t mostly from Americans - although there were plenty of sceptics here, too. Instead, the most pessimistic were my friends around the world. Despite some notable advances for black Americans over the years - Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice as successive Secretaries of State, for example - a prevailing global narrative about the US has persisted; that this is an indelibly racist country and that black Americans remain an oppressed and entrenched underclass. It was a view I heard repeatedly, not only in this election season, but during my nearly 20 years as a foreign correspondent. If I mentioned the growth of the black middle class, or the number of black American CEOs running companies such as American Express, Time Warner and Kmart, or the increasing number of blacks with PhDs, I was usually met with stares of incredulity or slapped down by undeniable statistics. &apos;So why are so many black men in prison?&apos;, a French friend asked me once. Another, in Hong Kong, asked: &apos;So why are black people in your country all living in ghettos?&apos; Of course, if I persisted there was always the trump card; yes, but a black person can never be elected President in your country. Now along comes Barack Obama, and much of the world, with its fixed image of America - an image that is often as outdated as it is accurate - doesn&apos;t know quite how to deal with his astonishing success. Consider the June front-page editorial in the Chinese Communist party newspaper, the People&apos;s Daily, which often sets the tone for the line officials are expected to take. &apos;Obama&apos;s skin colour is the biggest focal point of this year&apos;s US election,&apos; it began. &apos;He is a symbol of assimilation rather than a representative of the different races coming together. Obama did not break the superiority complex of white people. On the contrary, his appearance strengthened the superiority complex of white people.&apos; Then there was the quote from a senior Japanese official - later denied - in the Shukan Bunshun weekly. &apos;It will likely be McCain who will win the race in the end,&apos; the official told reporters, according to the paper. &apos;Obama&apos;s black and Hillary [Clinton] is a woman. I guess it could be difficult for them.&apos; The official added: &apos;No matter what it looks like, the United States is a very conservative country.&apos; (For the record, when the official denied the remarks he said he had many &apos;black friends&apos;). If the reaction to Obama from Asia was scepticism, it was because it challenged some long-held views from a part of the world that too often sees a racial hierarchy based on skin colour and complexion, with lighter skin being at the top of the pecking order and black at the bottom. When I lived in the Philippines, one of the common insults Filipinos made about each other centred on whether they were &apos;too dark&apos;. Around the region, light skin is prized. Perhaps that explains the gap-jawed, almost humorous reaction to the Obama win in some of the press. &apos;Will Chinese benefit with a black man in charge?&apos; asked the Xiamen Business Daily. &apos;Dark horse enters White House&apos; was the headline in the Information Times in Shanghai. My favourite was the front-page headline in the Philippine Daily Inquirer: &apos;Black in the White House.&apos; But it&apos;s not just Asia. Europe has been in the grip of Obamania since he burst on to the world scene. But Obama&apos;s ascent to the White House will also challenge deeply held European assumptions about America and American blacks. In France, where I was based for five years, I was constantly asked about racism in the US - to a point where I found many French took our problems as affirmation of their own perfection of \u00e9galit\u00e9 The view of America as irretrievably racist has given others with their own racial problems a sense of superiority. It also robs the US of the moral high ground when it issues criticisms of the human rights violations of others. The US State Department issues an annual report on human rights around the world. In response China has begun issuing its own report on human rights in the US. This year, in the section on racial discrimination, it claimed: &apos;Racial discrimination is a deep-rooted social illness in the United States.&apos; The statistics quoted are mostly accurate but selective, chosen to highlight lingering problems while ignoring all the evidence of blacks and minorities entering the American economic mainstream. Then there is the view from Africa. When challenged on human rights, African autocrats have become deft at deflecting criticism from Europe and the US; Europeans are routinely reminded of their colonial past and Americans are chided for slavery and our sorry history of race relations. When I was covering Africa as a correspondent, I never found a good answer to that retort. We try to own up to our own problems, I would say. Or, we&apos;re not a perfect country, but that&apos;s no excuse for gross rights violations elsewhere. But I knew that America&apos;s ability to criticise was always going to be measured against the history of racism in America. Obama&apos;s election, of course, does not mean America has suddenly become a beacon of racial justice and harmony. Indeed, it&apos;s one step - though, symbolically, as powerful a step as can be. As Howard Wolpe, director of the Africa programme at the Wilson Centre in Washington, so aptly put it in an interview: &apos;The fact that someone of African ancestry can be the President of the United States is going to substantially increase our moral stature and enable us, I believe, to have much greater sway in our relationships with African states.&apos; Or, in the words of Ugandan journalist and commentator Charles Onyango-Obbo, in a column written before the election: &apos;If Obama is elected President, thousands of public intellectuals, radical professors and social activists and nationalist politicians and journalists will be plunged into crisis.

Along with Ogilvy and Mickelson he has a birdie putt awaiting him on the third green when play resumes on Monday morning. The Englishman revealed he was happy to get the initial holes of the final round underway before the weather interrupted. &quot;It didn&apos;t do any harm playing the few holes, it was nice and steady,&quot; he said. &quot;I hit one bad shot at the second which cost me a birdie, but I have a birdie chance at three from 10-12 feet.

In the initial stages of the season there was a debilitating struggle with glandular fever, culminating in the loss of his Australian Open crown. Spring brought faltering form and the indignity of uncharacteristic losses to the likes of Mardy Fish and Radek Stepanek. Then, of course, there was Rafael Nadal, the man who - having humiliated Federer in Paris before relieving him of his Wimbledon title and No1 ranking - emerged as the biggest pain of all. So when a knee injury forced Nadal&apos;s withdrawal from the Tennis Masters Cup, Federer must have hoped that a season of suffering might end on a high note. A 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 defeat to the Frenchman Gilles Simon in his opening match will have done little to encourage the Swiss in that ambition. Federer arrived in Shanghai still nursing the back injury that recently forced his withdrawal from the Paris Masters, and his confidence that a course of painkillers would help him successfully negotiate a path past Simon proved misplaced. He made a confident start, breaking in the fifth game to claim the first set in 41 minutes, but thereafter the swagger that underpinned his resurgent run to the US Open title two months ago was conspicuous by its absence. As the quest to find his customary fluid efficiency proved fruitless, Federer was swept away on a tide of errors. It is not the first time that the ninth-ranked Simon has left the Swiss smarting; he won their only previous encounter, again in three sets, at the Canadian Masters in July.  Another win for Federer at an event where he is the defending champion would provide further evidence that the obituary writers were premature in their predictable penning of the &apos;Roger and out&apos; headlines this summer.

The Spaniard vaulted the longstanding No2, Phil Mickelson, after his play-off win over a Ryder Cup colleague, Oliver Wilson, at the HSBC Champions event at Sheshan International in Shanghai, becoming the first European to hold the No2 spot since Colin Montgomerie 12 years ago. &quot;Right after winning the Players&apos; Championship [in May] I thought that I could get to No3 - I felt No2 was still difficult,&quot; Garc\u00eda said after securing the 19th win of his career, and the \u00a3530,700 that went with it. &quot;Being No2 is awesome. I have never achieved it before. It is something extra for the year. I am now looking forward to working hard and getting better.&quot; Awesome, perhaps, but like everyone else Garc\u00eda is well aware the history books have very short chapters on the life and times of world No2s. What matters is winning majors and in that department he, like Montgomerie, remains bereft.  Garc\u00eda is, though, in pole position in the inaugural Race to Dubai, the season-long competition which has replaced the European Tour&apos;s order of merit and which comes with a $10m bonus fund. This is nice money if you can get it but at this stage of his career Garc\u00eda, who already has it, is more concerned with trophies. &quot;I have been trying for a while, but winning a major is the next goal,&quot; said the Spaniard, who came second in the 1999 US PGA to Woods and has been edged out twice by Padraig Harrington in two years, the 2007 Open at Carnoustie and in this year&apos;s US PGA at Oakland Hills.  These were crushing defeats but it is to Garc\u00eda&apos;s credit that they do not appear to have crushed his spirit, nor his desire.

But the official went on to add his own twist, &quot;Nearly 30 years have passed, and we are not that lamb anymore, and maybe the US is not the same wolf it once was.&quot; His point was that Iran no longer feels the deep inequality with the US that it did in the past, and that it may be time to try engagement.  Over the past three decades, five American presidents have struggled to figure out what to do about Iran. All five failed. As US president-elect Barack Obama and his advisers assess their foreign-policy priorities, they will encounter the immediate challenge of addressing Iran&apos;s nuclear program and the country&apos;s growing strategic importance in the Middle East and south Asia.  They will need quickly to face up to the reality that in order to pursue US interests in the region, including stabilising Iraq and Afghanistan, the current standoff with Iran cannot continue, and that a greater degree of cooperation is unavoidable. If they do not want to repeat the failures of past administrations, they will be well advised to do what none of Obama&apos;s predecessors have tried.  They should make a strategic decision to engage Iran \u2013 without any pre-conditions \u2013 in discussions on a broad range of issues of significance to both sides. During his candidacy, Obama said of Iran that, &quot;For us not to be in a conversation with them doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot; Now, he has the opportunity to follow through.  Such an approach does not mean having Obama sit down with Iran&apos;s supreme leader Ali Khamenei or president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad anytime soon. A great deal of preparatory work will be required first. This can be carried out by a small team, which would hammer out the details of a mutually acceptable framework for a wide-ranging and unconditional dialogue that enables both governments to produce some modest initial successes, and gradually build the confidence and trust required to imagine solutions to larger problems. The process could include appointing a US envoy to Iran. Ultimately, direct dialogue at the highest levels should be a key objective.  This will not be easy. At the heart of the American-Iranian conflict is a deep mistrust about each nation&apos;s readiness to tolerate the presence of the other on the world stage. Each nation feels that it has been humiliated and demonised by the other. What is needed is a process that rebuilds trust and communication so that the give-and-take of negotiation is perceived as serving mutual interests rather than serving up insults to national dignity or identity.  Although it is far from an exact precedent, the historic 1972 Shanghai Communique signed by China and the US, which allowed both governments to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; on many issues while committing themselves to dialogue at the highest levels, offers a promising model. This far-sighted framework&apos;s effectiveness has been well proven over time.  Dialogue with Iran will inevitably be frustrating and difficult, but it offers the only way to lay out possible grounds for constructive engagement and to devise a strategy for heading off a potentially disastrous confrontation. Dialogue focused on Iran&apos;s nuclear program or on Iraq alone will not work. Instead, the full range of issues that are significant to US-Iran relationship must be on the table.  Such an approach will require that each side exercise broad restraint and live with the ambiguity of working with a strong adversary to manage profound differences. Distrust will continue, signals will be confused, setbacks will be frequent, but the results could well lead over time to greater mutual understanding and a learned capacity to work on some of the most pressing problems, just as the US learned to do with the Soviet Union and China.  Direct diplomatic and strategic engagement between the US and Iran at the highest levels is a proposition yet to be tested. By pursuing this route after he takes office, Obama will force Iran to make a choice: does it want to be a state that is fully integrated into the global economy, or does it want to be an &quot;ideology&quot; with rogue status? It is time that the world found out.

Among the recommendations is a proposal to teach reading and writing using the phonics method, which helps children to identify letter-sound combinations. &quot;The explicit teaching of (phonics) and of other aspects of written and spoken English should be regarded as an important aspect of the English curriculum and therefore as routine,&quot; says the draft curriculum. The publication of the draft coincides with growing concern about poor literacy standards in schools and in the workplace. A recent national literacy and numeracy test of more than a million students in primary and secondary schools found that one in five did no better than the minimum national standard for reading and writing. But while consultations on the draft curriculum are due to last until February, Monash University in Melbourne is taking matters into its own hands by developing a new course in English grammar and punctuation for first-year students after it found that the majority couldn&apos;t identify a noun. The course will aim to cover material that should have been taught in secondary school, said Baden Eunson, who is developing the programme.  &quot;It&apos;s very obvious when students submit handwritten essays they don&apos;t know how to use apostrophes and other punctuation,&quot; Eunson told the Reuters news agency.

This is a rhetorical question, I should make clear, because I happen to have the answer here before me in a little booklet conveniently produced by the car&apos;s makers. It turns out the MG is for &quot;people whose glass is always half full&quot;. You hear a lot about such people, possibly too much, but what I wonder about them is what happens when they&apos;re handed a glass filled to the brim? Pedantic? OK, what about when the petrol gauge reads almost empty: do they think they&apos;ve still got half a tank? You see, such half-wit attitudes do have motoring implications. However, it appears allowing your decision-making to be influenced by mundane reality is not the mark of the ideal MG customer. For I learn from my MG booklet that the car is for those whose inclination is to &quot;reach for the sun&quot; (presumably unaware of its surface temperature), &quot;who don&apos;t stick a toe in the water; they jump right in,&quot; and &quot;who leap straight out of bed... First thing they put on is a smile&quot;. I feel confident, having absorbed this information, that I am not in the market for an MG. My bed-leaping days are long past, and my smiling days may as well be. The thought of doing both together is enough to make me want to lie down. And yet, like a toddler running in the park, an MG parping along the street can&apos;t help but bring a smile to faces crushed by gravity and that ceaseless existential crisis we politely refer to as life. It looked for a while that the MG sports car had gone the way of my leaping out of bed when MG Rover went into administration in 2005. Even before that the car had enjoyed only intermittent production, most notably with the release in 1995 of the MG F, which coincided very profitably with the high-water mark of Cool Britannia and groovy patriotic consumerism. Thanks to the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, which now owns the badge, the new MG TF LE500 is once again assembled at the car&apos;s old home plant of Longbridge - albeit with parts shipped from China. Best of British, and what have you, but I do wish they&apos;d assembled the pedals in slightly closer relation to the human foot, so that they might interact with the ball rather than the arch. Then again, the MG has never really been about a comfortable drive. Start the engine and it sounds as if you&apos;ve entered Le Mans. It&apos;s too noisy to amble along but not really powerful enough to live up to the sound, so you fumble around town trying to work out whether to speed up or slow down, while attempting to make the arch of your foot respond accordingly. If nothing else, it&apos;s a challenge to the maintenance of cool. So what? It looks a treat, a British style classic, that could do with a touch more Chinese content. On a sunny day with the top down, you can&apos;t go wrong. My eight-year-old daughter loved it when I took her out for a Sunday drive to a cemetery.

The point of kittens? Other people? Cake? Economy class travel? Pants? I could go on. I don&apos;t understand people who moan about spending time in hotels. You know the ones: &apos;Oh, poor me; I feel like I&apos;m living out of a suitcase, it&apos;s just a blur of room-service meals and minibars and frankly I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m coming or going...&apos; Because, I cannot imagine anything better than a life lived in hotels. I love hotels... You love posh hotels, you mean. Three-and-a-half star or above, yes. I love them because their bathrooms are dreamy, and because there&apos;s a deft and flawless efficiency about them that you don&apos;t get round my actual, you know, flat. But the thing I love most about hotels, is hotel bars. The beauty of hotel bars is threefold. First: they are swanky by definition. It&apos;s the law. Second: I love the practice of &apos;putting drinks on one&apos;s room&apos;. It&apos;s so feckless! Third: if you&apos;re drinking in a hotel bar, you know you&apos;re never more than a lift-ride away from bed. And that is total luxury.  I imagine this is going somewhere? Yes. I&apos;ve got a new fave. It&apos;s the Salon de Ning, the rooftop bar on the Peninsula Hotel in midtown Manhattan, and it is well fancy. It&apos;s got an excellent address (55 and 5; it&apos;s on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th street, see?), it&apos;s got its own private lift from the hotel&apos;s lobby, and it&apos;s got views of New York that make you wonder why you ever bother going anywhere else. It&apos;s kind of Shanghai styled (dark wood and bonsais and fancy silk cushions), and it&apos;s got an outside and an inside bit, which is just as well, because the first time I went, it was tipping down with rain. Disaster. I know! Happily, it transpired that the Salon de Ning serves a fine cocktail, which was more than enough to distract me from the iffy weather and the fact that I couldn&apos;t venture outside because my blow-dry would go soggy. And thus it came to pass that after a lifetime of struggling with it, the Cocktail Girl (me) finally got the point of the ostensibly pointless cucumber. It is: the Salon de Ning&apos;s cucumber Martini! Exquisite! Indeed. I went back the following night, when it was ridiculously hot. I nabbed a table next to the edge of the building, and I ordered myself up a drink. Now, I know what you think. You think my life in bars is one giddy, gilded, celebrity-addled whirl; but guess what? Sometimes, I like to sit in quiet contemplation of a place, considering the urban moment without engaging with it, watching the pretty people get squiffy without having ridiculous conversations with them about varying quality in vodkas and whether or not snogging counts as infidelity. Salon de Ning is perfect for this sort of gentle reflection. It is more civilised and glam, and less hard-core hip than downtown equivalents, like the rooftop bar of Sixty Thompson; it is less austere and intimidating and grand than the lobby bar at the Mandarin Oriental. The staff are accomplished rather than mindlessly and pointlessly beautiful, the clientele is gently moneyed, gently Botoxed, very well dressed, but not over- groomed.  Well then, that&apos;s... good? Very good. Also - I had a revelation there. As I was about to call it a night, my waiter asked me if I&apos;d like anything else. And it struck me in a flash that the only sensible thing to do when drinking alone in a hotel bar, is to not be sensible at all - so I ordered another Martini, and hoorah for the wisdom of Cocktail Girl!  \u2022 Salon de Ning at The Peninsula, 5th Ave at 55th St, New York, 212 956 3097", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Hotels", "Travel", "New York"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-16T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/16/andy-murray-tennis-awesome", "sentences": ["Andy Murray described the best year of career to date as &quot;awesome&quot; as his season came to an end following defeat to Nikolay Davydenko in the semi-final of the Masters Cup in Shanghai."], "title": "Tennis: Andy Murray describes his season as 'awesome'", "article": "Andy Murray described the best year of career to date as &quot;awesome&quot; as his season came to an end following defeat to Nikolay Davydenko in the semi-final of the Masters Cup in Shanghai.

The Scot won five titles in 2008, including two Masters Series triumphs, and appeared in his first grand slam final, losing to Roger Federer at the US Open, but managed to beat the Swiss World No2 three times over the course of the calender year, and also recorded impressive victories over Rafael Nadal and Serbian World No3 Novak Djokovic. &quot;The year as a whole has been awesome, Murray said. &quot;At the end of last year, if someone would have told me I was going to be No4 in the world, won the matches I have done, reach my first slam final and beat Federer three times, I would have taken that.

While Beijing and Shanghai have reached the development level of countries such as Cyprus and Portugal, provinces such as south-western Guizhou are comparable to Namibia or Botswana. The Human Development Report argues that pressing ahead in providing basic healthcare, education and welfare to all Chinese citizens will boost the country&apos;s economy in the face of the global slowdown. Chi Fulin, one of its authors, told reporters: &quot;Equalisation of basic public services is an important condition for expanding domestic demand and maintaining steady and rapid economic growth.&quot; China&apos;s president, Hu Jintao, told the G20 summit in Washington this weekend that his nation&apos;s continued fast growth was its &quot;important contribution&quot; to steadying the global economy.

Khalid Malik, UN resident coordinator and UN Development Programme resident representative in China, praised the government&apos;s commitment to increasing services. &quot;These timely actions can make people feel more secure to consume and, in turn, help realise China&apos;s urgent goal of keeping a high economic growth rate,&quot; he said. &quot;China now has the resources to make equitable provision of key public services to all China&apos;s people a reality.&quot; The report, by authors from the China Institute for Reform and Development and other thinktanks, describes the nation&apos;s progress over the past 30 years of reform as &quot;a miracle in the history of poverty reduction&quot;. Economic growth has benefited even the poorest groups in society. But it warns that reforming public services is necessary too. Urban residents enjoy far higher levels of government funding than those in the countryside. According to the UN human development index - which measures health, knowledge and income - China has made dramatic gains for its citizens, climbing from 101st to 81st in the global rankings between 1990 and 2005. But life expectancy in Guizhou is a decade shorter than in Beijing; child mortality in Qinghai is seven times as high as in the capital; and illiteracy in Gansu five times more common.

He has been so gloriously truculent in his interviews from the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai on Sky Sports that I have great hopes of him. My fear is that, now he is approaching the pinnacle of his sport, somebody is going to send Andy to a charm school to smooth off his spiky edges, or on one of those courses where TV personalities top up their pension funds by teaching people in the public eye how to sit nicely and smile for the camera. You can see the percentage in that. This tennis lark is all very well, but it is never too early to prepare for a future in celebrity dancing or competitive cookery. For now, though, let us revel in the most media unfriendly personality since those Native American tribesmen who reputedly thought the camera was about to steal their souls. If Sky&apos;s cameras had designs on Andy&apos;s, they would have had to move pretty quickly. After his successes against Gilles Simon and Roger Federer, the British No1 dutifully slapped on a pair of headphones for discourse with Sky&apos;s Marcus Buckland, but gave the impression of a man determined to linger not a second longer than was absolutely contractually necessary. He mumbled something about keeping focused - as if that aspect of his game were ever in doubt - while wearing an expression that tended to confirm PG Wodehouse&apos;s gag about there never being any difficulty spotting the difference between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine. And these were matches that Murray had won, rather magnificently. &quot;He doesn&apos;t look all that thrilled,&quot; Buckland commented after quizzing Murray on the Federer triumph. &quot;That doesn&apos;t matter. We&apos;re thrilled for him,&quot; said the studio guests, the former British No1 Greg Rusedski and Peter Fleming, once John McEnroe&apos;s doubles partner. It is never easy to tell, however, exactly how pleased Greg is, as his dazzling smile remains constant in all circumstances, occupying that awkward ground between genuine inner peace and harmony, and being a little bit &quot;special&quot;. Or maybe he has overdosed on that breakfast cereal that gives you the post-nuclear glow, or something. Who knows? Mind you, I was wearing a bit of a silly grin myself after the Murray-Federer match, which was full of the kind of sublime tennis that made me congratulate myself on not having a proper job and so being part of the available audience on a Friday morning. Murray did not have to win the match, having already qualified for the semi-final but, being something of a poster boy for steely determination, went ahead and won it anyway. Sky&apos;s commentator Mark Petchey had it spot on: &quot;It has been a game that has underlined the greatness of these two players,&quot; he said, &quot;You can stick it straight in the hall of fame.&quot; Frankly, I cannot begin to imagine how players keep their focus in such a match. It is like a penalty shoot-out going on for a couple of hours. I am having difficulty concentrating during this sentence, which reminds me, why are they always playing Maroon 5 in Subway? Has someone done some research indicating the music of the middle-of-the-road Californian popsters makes customers more likely to go for the foot-long? And another thing, what exactly is Martina Navratilova doing on I&apos;m A Celebrity? The mad-woman role so expertly taken by Janice Dickinson, Carol Thatcher and Vanessa Feltz in previous reality shows, is presumably reserved for Esther Rantzen, so why has Martina been booked? I should have liked to have been in that meeting: &quot;Well, we can&apos;t get Simon Bates or Petula Clark, but I think I might be able to swing Martina Navratilova.&quot; Murray, of course, has a mind free of these puzzling dilemmas that make the times we are living through so strange and troubling. He can concentrate on his tennis and take his lead from Admiral of the Fleet, the First Baron Fisher, who said: &quot;Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Never contradict. Never explain. Never apologise.&quot; Sooner or later Murray will learn to play the media game - wait 25 years and he will be joshing with Baroness Amy Winehouse on reality TV - so the campaign starts here.

It seems almost unbelievable now. If I learned something, it was that anything can happen. We&apos;re doing well today, but this is partly because so many of our projects are in places like Dubai, which seem immune from recession. But you never know.&quot; You certainly don&apos;t. Last week, Frank Gehry&apos;s first major project in Britain was ditched, making it the first big victim, architecturally, of the credit crunch. Plans for a dramatic development of 750 flats facing the sea at Brighton were dropped when the developer, Karis, failed to find fresh funds, three months after Dutch bank ING pulled out. If Gehry - creator of the famous &quot;Bilbao effect&quot;, by which thrilling architecture triggers urban regeneration - can be tossed aside by recession-wary banks, what about less celebrated architects? &quot;Housebuilders are in such a hurry to drop projects,&quot; says Amanda Baillieu, editor of Building Design magazine, &quot;they&apos;re text-messaging architects to tell them to stop work. At the same time, banks are foreclosing on loans made to small architectural practices set up over the past few years, in the hope of cashing in on the housing boom. The prediction is that one in five will go bust.&quot; Some 40% of architects lost their jobs in the last recession, says Sunand Prasad, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. &quot;It was very hard for young architects in the early 1990s. Luckily, architecture encourages broad thinking. Many found new careers in law, academia, catering and so on. But, when the good times came again in the lead-up to the millennium, it seemed an entire generation had gone missing. It took some time to find them again.&quot; Older architects are no strangers to recession. The current slump, though, is likely to be very tough indeed. Why? Because in the past, the public sector - whether in Britain, continental Europe or the US - was able to step in when housebuilders and developers pulled in their horns. Take President Roosevelt&apos;s Tennessee Valley Authority. Between 1933 and 1944, some 16 magnificent dams with hydro-electric power stations were built along the river, giving thousands of jobs to architects, engineers and contractors, not to mention bringing irrigation, power and economic growth to the poor farming communities of seven southern states.  Today, not only is the TVA the biggest energy producer in the US, its mighty structures remain tourist attractions. Closer to home, the superb architectural and engineering work accomplished by the London Passenger Transport Board, a public corporation established in 1933, proved what could be achieved when the going was tough: extensions to the tube, new stations and rolling stock. Such work was inspiring; it also created many jobs. Today, though, the public sector in Britain has increasingly been privatised. Schemes such as PFI and PPP - private finance initiative and public-private partnerships, which fund new public buildings, especially hospitals and schools, and the renovation of the London underground - have turned out to be as ill-conceived as critics said they would be a decade ago. With banks and markets floundering, public projects are feeling the squeeze, and there is certainly nothing around the corner as grand and bold as Roosevelt&apos;s awe-inspiring TVA. &quot;About three-quarters of our work is in the public sector,&quot; says John Pringle of Pringle Richards Sharratt, architects of the Millennium Galleries, Sheffield. &quot;But, as we can&apos;t be sure what will happen to PFI and PPP, we can&apos;t rest easy. I feel for the many young practices that were hoping to design intelligent new housing. Aside from the sudden fall-off in work, they&apos;re up against new layers of bureaucracy.&quot; Pringle is referring to increasingly complex building contracts and the rocketing numbers of quangos and regeneration agencies poking their noses into the business of architecture. The simple client-architect relationship of yore - there&apos;s a building I need and I&apos;d like you to design it - has been buried beneath jargon-laced red tape.  &quot;The bureaucracy is bloody awful,&quot; says Will Alsop. &quot;To get jobs beyond house extensions, young architectural practices have to show satisfactory accounts for the past three or four years to prove they&apos;re a safe pair of hands. How the hell are they going to be able to do that during a recession? There wasn&apos;t any work at home when I set up in the late 1970s. We went to Germany and got some good work without anyone asking us about our finances - zilch! - or even our track record. What the Germans wanted was imaginative new architecture.&quot; In times of recession, architects may well need to follow commissions around the world. &quot;If I tell you we&apos;ve got work in 22 countries,&quot; says Norman Foster, &quot;it&apos;s not to brag, but to underline how you can only really beat a slump - unless you&apos;re a one-man band with minimal overheads - if you have commissions spread internationally. Foster and Partners is not 100% recession-proof, but we&apos;ve always been prepared to go where the work is. Today, we&apos;re also known as urban planners and product designers, so we&apos;re not hostage to sudden drops in the building market. We were lucky to win the commission to design the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters in 1979, when there was little work at home. In fact, this was about the only job in the office. So we gave it our all.&quot;  This building, one of Foster&apos;s finest, opened in 1986, when the British economy was beginning to pick up. It stood Foster and his team in good stead, setting a new standard for corporate HQ. Foster has never looked back. In a curious way, the recession served him well. Yet, as Nigel Coates, professor of architecture at the Royal College of Art, tells his students: &quot;You don&apos;t choose architecture for the money. You should only do it if you love the idea of being an architect. But I&apos;ve also been saying that recession isn&apos;t altogether a bad thing. Of course, I don&apos;t want people to lose their jobs, but there&apos;s been a lot of boring and plain bad new building during the boom years - frumpitecture, I call it. Young architects are unlikely to find an interesting job, or any job, in the coming months, so it&apos;s a good time for them to study, think and dream of what a next generation of architecture might be.&quot; What might post-recession architecture be like? Alison Brooks, an architect whose practice shared the 2008 Stirling prize for the design of the much-feted Accordia housing development in Cambridge, says: &quot;So much housing raced up in recent years has been mean and transitory. No one wants to lay down roots in homes that are pokey, fast-buck products. What&apos;s the point of building houses no one really wants just because they&apos;re low cost and meet official targets?&quot; A new housing scheme Brooks designed at Newhall, Essex, shows what might be done. It is a fine balance of modesty and ambition, modernity and tradition. Timber-framed family houses, with generous rooms, offer a fresh take on traditional local styles. They use every square inch: roof spaces are family dens, while courtyard gardens are like outside rooms. As for energy conservation, they meet current guidelines, or even exceed them.  Indeed, what we may see is a swing towards a less showy architecture, with invention squeezed into pint pots. Some of Christopher Wren&apos;s most inspired buildings, after all, were the gem-like City of London churches he built around St Paul&apos;s. Clamber up the steps of St Stephen Walbrook and, behind modest ragstone walls, you find yourself beneath a magnificent dome that might belong to one of the great baroque churches of Venice. Or visit Le Corbusier&apos;s Petit Cabanon and see how a tiny building can be highly charged. &quot;I have a chateau on the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur,&quot; he wrote to a friend. &quot;It&apos;s for my wife. It&apos;s extravagant in comfort and gentleness.&quot; It is less than four metres square.  The years following the Wall Street Crash saw in &quot;Depression deco&quot;, a sort of late-flowering art deco. While we might not see anything as distinct as that, we could yet discover a likable new modesty: offices gathered around courtyards with rooftop gardens, rather than look-at-me skyscrapers; supermarkets dug underground rather than swaggering over historic towns; schools doubling as performing arts centres. And, if the Olympic Delivery Authority cares to take up the offer of a low-cost, take-apart sports building, as suggested by Dipesh Patel, a director of Arup Associates, we may yet see the 2012 Games proving that swanky buildings are not the only way of going for gold. Still, if you happen to be an architect hooked on wildly adventurous design and are willing to travel (and work competitively), then Dubai, Abu Dhabi, India, Russia and South America beckon. In Britain, meanwhile, the recession, while painful, might spark fresh debate and instill new ideas, readying us for the next building boom when the money flows again.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Culture", "UK news", "Recession"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-17T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/worldwise/youngsters", "sentences": ["Those picked were given preparatory training before being flown to Sao Paolo, Shanghai or Delhi in the summer."], "title": "Gifted youngsters get chance of a lifetime", "article": "Luke Pollard, 19, knows how to take the initiative.

Then I looked at the market and saw there was a big gap and started teaching around Britain,&quot; he says. It is young people in England with this sort of track record as self-starters in enterprise or voluntary work who are being hand-picked by the Prime Minister&apos;s Global Fellowship scheme to go on six-week visits to the fast-growing economies of Brazil, China or India. &quot;The idea is to send young people to get first-hand experience of life, work and learning in some of the big countries changing the world,&quot; says Lucy Parker, chair of the Talent and Enterprise Taskforce, which runs the programme with the British Council and the Joint International Unit (the government&apos;s advice unit on education&apos;s international dimension). The 100 fellows spend two weeks soaking up language and culture, two weeks living with a family and carrying out a research project while working as a school assistant, and two weeks with one of 14 multinationals, including KPMG, Shell and Tesco. Shortlisted applicants, who must be 18 before the date of travel, are chosen via a one-day interview that includes team activities. They must demonstrate initiative, openness to other cultures and an ability to communicate. &quot;The interview day was about analysing how you respond in situations, interact with other people, and how you decipher things when you haven&apos;t got a full understanding of a situation,&quot; says Pollard. Those picked were given preparatory training before being flown to Sao Paolo, Shanghai or Delhi in the summer. &quot;I wanted to go to India because it has such a diverse culture - the opposite of Cornwall - with so many religions that co-exist,&quot; says Pollard. In his first fortnight in Delhi and Chennai, on the east coast, he studied Hindi and Tamil, attended lectures by Pune University academics on India&apos;s history, geography and economy, and visited markets and tourist sites including the Taj Mahal. In Chennai he also spent two weeks living with the family of a quantity surveyor in a modest flat and worked at the local private school. &quot;It was humongous. There were over 10,000 students,&quot; he says. His research project involved asking hundreds of pupils why they want to further their education. The first thing nearly all of them said was: &quot;We want to make India great.&quot; The second was: &quot;We want to help our family,&quot; and the third was, &quot;We want to improve ourselves.&quot; &quot;Here it is the opposite,&quot; Pollard says. &quot;Britain is far more geared to the individual receiving things first. That is the biggest lesson I learned.&quot; After Chennai he spent another fortnight in Delhi with Group 4 Securicor learning about its different operations, how departments interact, how employees are treated and how corporate social responsibility schemes are implemented. Group 4 is helping to bring roads, water supply and electricity into a village not far from its headquarters, and helping heads of households to switch from informal into formal employment. Pollard was struck by the way Group 4 staff from directors right down to guards get involved. Lucy Parker says the fellowships initiative is different from other global exchange schemes because it focuses on areas of dynamic growth in emerging economies, rather than solely problems of poverty, and because sharing the fellows&apos; findings and experience with other young people is structured into the scheme. &quot;It is as much a communications exercise as it is sending a few young people on the trip of a lifetime,&quot; she says. &apos;Unbreakable bonds&apos; The cost-effectiveness of the \u00a31.17m scheme, funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, may depend on how well and widely the students disseminate what they have learned.

They will also visit Downing Street to share their experience with the prime minister and representatives of the firms who hosted them. Pollard has decided to give talks at 15 local schools and colleges but also at WI meetings in rural villages. Now studying geography and geographical systems at Manchester Metropolitan University, he says the fellowship experience has been &quot;too valuable to put into words&quot;. &quot;For me and others who don&apos;t live in multicultural cities, it is vital to understand different religions, beliefs, and ethnic groups. But also we made bonds you could never break.&quot; Pune University academics have asked him to study in their geography department for two months next year, and he plans to revisit his Chennai family by 2012.

Just witness the phenomenal sales opportunities on eBay Category 1654 (Internet Games) - just one of the marketplaces for this new economic world order. A few years back, the US federal government looked closely at the issue of taxables on non-existent (take that with a pinch of salt, pedants) content based in universes fabricated by games people. That seems to have fallen by the wayside there. It was never even seriously brought up in the UK.

So I delved into my address book and spoke to some of the great talents out there to see what they advise, and the response was huge; especially from those baker / writers in the US who for years have encouraged people to tackle challenging recipes rather than hide from any complexity and just passively consume. So here are their top baking tips from around the world just for you. United States 1. From the US I turned to Shirley O Corriher, the scientist turned kitchen sleuth I most admire, and her new book Bakewise is honestly the only one I&apos;ve waited patiently for. For Corriher, getting cakes and cookies to last that bit longer helps when you have to stretch the budget, and she told me how science helps. &quot;Just substitute an equal measure of vegetable oil for a third of the butter in your cake or muffin recipe and this helps to keep them moist. The reason: oil greases the flour proteins better than butter and prevents gluten forming, so leaving more water in the batter.&quot; Brilliant, and it saves money on butter too. 2. It&apos;s cool to be accurate. Though baking appears all bish-bash-bosh, the key to achieving those extraordinary loaves is all in the detail. Jim Lahey, the king of New York bakers at the Sullivan Street Bakery, says: &quot;Measure precisely. This will avoid unnecessary mistakes and bad food. Don&apos;t open your oven door while you&apos;re goods are cooking. If you have leftover ends of bread, try to convert them into another dish. In these new lean times it&apos;s better that we waste nothing.&quot; 3. Rose Levy Beranbaum at realbakingwithrose.com, the top baking author in the US with The Cake Bible and blog advice pioneer suggested making life easier for others is the kindest thing to offer. &quot;When you give home baked cakes include the baking tin and recipe. Ideally, cakes should be long-keeping ones, especially ones with a liqueur or lemon syrup. Cool the cake completely. Wash and dry the pan in which it was baked and coat the interior lightly with sunflower oil or non-stick spray. Return the cake to the pan, wrap it tightly with clear plastic film then finally cover it with beautiful gift paper.&quot; 4. The \u00fcber chic Dorie Greenspan, author of Baking: From My Home to Yours goes for boldness at Christmas. &quot;Bake big, it saves both time and money. My best go-to sweet is what we call a Bundt cake, a kind butter cake. It&apos;s quick to make and beautiful as the shape of the pan does all the decorating for you; and if it&apos;s cut in thin slices \u2013 what most people want \u2013 you can stretch a Bundt to serve 16 or more.&quot; 5. Before you launch into baking breads or cakes after googling for a recipe, it&apos;s essential to check if it&apos;s from a good reliable source. This doesn&apos;t mean they have to be famous, but check for site reviews, comments and helpful pictures. Sarah Phillips at baking911.com, home to some of the best baking know-how on the net says, &quot;Be really careful with some of the recipes online from unnamed sources simply because most of them do not work. Rely on experts, it will save you money.&quot; 6. Like exquisite couture, the most impressive baking usually has good taste and simplicity at its heart. David Lebovitz, the savvy American in Paris who writes about chocolate, ice-cream and life&apos;s other essentials, reminded me of that one important piece of advice. &quot;Keep it simple. Not only will you use fewer ingredients, but it&apos;ll be less work. A great spice cake with a scoop of ice cream is just as appealing as a multi-layered extravaganza. To jazz it up, add a drizzle of caramel sauce.&quot; Just keep it simple. 7. Sometimes you can spend to save, especially if you have room in your cupboards to store ingredients. Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito from Baked NYC in Brooklyn, authors of Baked: New Frontiers in Baking and the handsomest purveyors of sweet love in New York told me, &quot;Buy a good quality chocolate in bulk form, rather than expensive 100g bars, and just break it up yourself. Also, avoid recipes that need expensive ingredients and make more use of caramel: an easy combo of sugar, water and cream.&quot; 8. &quot;My advice would be much more about charity at in this difficult time,&quot; says Jeffrey Hamelman, who&apos;s book Bread: A Baker&apos;s Book of Techniques and Recipes really is the bible for serious breadheads worldwide. &quot;Rather than bake less this Christmas season, bake just a little more than you think you need. Surely a neighbour or local food charity would be delighted with the unexpected gift.&quot; 9. Bread can be a beautiful gift too. I asked Peter Reinhart, the best-selling bread expert and author of Whole Grain Breads: New Techniques, Extraordinary Flavour. &quot;Sweet fruit breads like German stollen or the Greek Christosomos make wonderful, relatively inexpensive gifts. And, most importantly, they are always appreciated as a gift from the heart, and symbolize the nativity of Christ and the gifts of the Magi.&quot; Certainly, it shows more thought than a plastic something. England 10. For Yotam Ottolenghi, a little creativity with flavours can make the most of the most unlikely ingredients. &quot;Take plum pudding, you can crumble it into a simple biscotti mixture instead of using dried fruit and it gives a very rich, gently spiced accent to the biscuit. Same with leftover fruit mince, fold it though vanilla or yoghurt ice-cream and the combination works really well.&quot; 11. &quot;I&apos;ll be making lots of mini cheese scones for the freezer, so handy at Christmas&quot;, said Gerhard Jenne, the baker patron from Konditor and Cook. &quot;Then if you have people calling by you can rustle up snacks with a little smoked salmon, or if you make herb ones you can serve them with small cups of hot soup. Even if you don&apos;t make your own soup it&apos;s nice to add you own little touch.&quot; 12. For John Rolfe, the founder of Jamie Oliver&apos;s Flour Station bakery and now baking bread at the home of the best sourdough pizza in London, Franco Manca the secret is to soft moist crumb is simple. &quot;Put some cooked mashed potato in your bread dough, it&apos;s the quickest way to add moistness and softness to the crumb and it&apos;s literally as cheap as chips. Or if you have leftover chestnut puree that works really well too. Surprisingly, it wont turn you bread heavy and you can still get a great crisp crust.&quot; Scotland 13. Flour holds the spirit of the bread you bake, but it&apos;s odd how we then expect miracles from the cheapest we can find. Robert Winters at the Tapa Bakery in Glasgow, the home of great sourdough in Scotland, says the best tip starts with the flour you use. &quot;Don&apos;t worry about saving money of the flour you buy, because even at it&apos;s most expensive its still good value. Find a stoneground flour, preferably wholemeal wheat or rye, and add that to your dough. You&apos;ll gain so much flavour that way.&quot; 14. For the respected Scots food historian Catherine Brown, now is the time to stir up a few forgotten traditions and reawaken the practice of simple hard biscuits like oatcakes. &quot;If they&apos;re made well and given a good firing, oatcakes taste perfect on their own. I go a bit mad and make maybe a 100 at a time - cut into big triangles - as this makes best use of the oven. This way you&apos;ve got them all winter, and you can have them with soup or crowdie.&quot; Ireland 15. Keep a look out during the year for interesting decorative boxes to pack gifts into, and then squirrel them away in a cupboard. Rachel Allen, the new star of Market Kitchen and author of Bake told me that a little planning is all that&apos;s needed to turn a simple recipe into a beautiful gift. &quot;Keep a look out when you travel, then make a recipe that suits the style of the container. I picked up some beautiful decorative tins from a shop in Paris, and I&apos;m going to make some delicate butter biscuits to go inside them. This is the just the kind of present I&apos;d love to receive at Christmas.&quot; France 16. When it comes to good bread, don&apos;t think quick; instead encourage a slow undisturbed rise for the dough - forget about airing cupboards and hot water bottles. Arguably the finest artisan baker in the world, Eric Kayser told me that there really is one piece of advice any aspiring baker must to repeat to themselves over and over. &quot;Time and rest are all that the dough needs to rise and become good bread. Keep the yeast to a minimum and do other things while the flavour and texture mature.&quot; 17. &quot;As we say in French: en cuisine on ne jette rien (in the kitchen, we don&apos;t throw anything away),&quot; says Pascale Weeks, author of Cadeaux Gourmands, and the blogger at scally.typepad.com who suggests making the best use of your freezer. &quot;When I make pastry, I always line tartlets cases with the leftovers, which I then freeze. When I&apos;m alone for lunch I can then bake a small quiche for myself. When I use yolks for petits pots de cr\u00e8me au chocolat for example, I freeze the whites. I can use them after to make financiers, petits moelleux aux chocolat or amaretti.&quot; 18. Most cookie dough can be chilled in logs and kept in the fridge, which means that you can simply slice and bake what you need. Clotilde Dusoulier from chocolateandzucchini.com says that tradition doesn&apos;t have to be sacrificed to make life a little easier this way. &quot;When I was little, we would make cut-out Christmas cookies, but when I&apos;m pressed for time I use the same recipe and use the slice-and-bake method. I roll the edges in unrefined cane sugar for a festive effect, and nobody&apos;s ever complained.&quot; 19. For Fanny Zanotti in the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur, the talent behind the beautiful idea-packed foodbeam.com the stark realties of baking needn&apos;t stop you if you&apos;re careful. &quot;Baking can turn into an expensive hobby, especially if you&apos;re anything like me: super-conscious about the ingredients&apos; quality. To keep costs on the lower side, my best advice is to stay seasonal. Autumn and winter can seem a little sparse when it comes to harvests but \u2026 consider it a challenge and make your best to tingle your imagination.&quot; Think apples, pears, quinces, and dress them up with jams and a little brandy. 20. Getting more done with less seems daunting, but sometimes a little planning helps. &quot;One ingredient, one oven, two recipes&quot;, says baking blogger Sandra Avital. &quot;Try making a couple of different kinds of cookies: one using only egg yolks, the second using only whites then bake both the same day, in the same hour, even at the same time to make the best use of the oven.&quot; This cuts fuel costs and probably saves time too. Australia and New Zealand 21. Donna Hay advises every harassed cooks to go-easy after the Christmas dinner, lighter on the stomach and more likely to leave everyone with a sweet memory. &quot;My version of a bread and butter pudding has a festive spin but it&apos;s easier to cook than Christmas cake or pudding, uses less ingredients and takes less time to put together, saving you effort, money and time.&quot; says Donna. &quot;Just use good-quality brioche soaked in brandy-spiked custard, sprinkle it with brandy-soaked muscatels and top it with demerara sugar to form a crunchy crust. It&apos;s a winner in my house!&quot; 22. The great daddy of artisan baking in Australia is John Downes, the guy who started the sourdough movement down-under during the 70s. His Natural Tucker Bread Book (1983) was the prescient handbook for hardcore bakers and is still relevant today. John tells me &quot;if you&apos;ve been saying all year, &apos;gee, I&apos;d love to try making a sourdough but I don&apos;t have the time&apos; then Christmas is perfect,&quot; says John, &quot;because you&apos;re in the house, warm but not too hot, around to nurture it through those delicate first steps. 23. For Dean Brettschnieder, the NZ artisan baker and author of The Global Baker, the best advice is more of an idea for life rather than a baking tip. &quot;This year I&apos;m in Shanghai for Christmas. What I&apos;m going to do is make a batch of butter shortbread flavoured with dried cranberries and orange zest, and plan to wrap these as beautifully as I can and give them to the people in my life here who might otherwise have been incidental but, if I&apos;m really honest, have helped me enormously through the last year.&quot; Canada 24. The best way to give your creativity the support it needs is to get organised. Rather than restricting your style, it will give you the freedom to express yourself. Elizabeth Baird, author of The Complete Canadian Living Baking Book and food editor of the magazine reminded me that, however obvious it sounds, we all forget sometimes. &quot;It&apos;s those simple things. Plan ahead so you have all the ingredients fresh and ready to bake. Read the recipe first so you don&apos;t forget an all-important ingredient. Then enjoy the whole process - the great aromas, the first taste and the fun of sharing something you&apos;ve made.&quot; 25. I first tasted the sourdough breads of artisan baker Cliff Leir, made with the rare Red Fife wheat, at the Slow Food Terra Madre in 2006, and remember being struck with their extraordinary flavour. I spoke with him as he was setting up Fol Epi, his new bakery on Vancouver Island&apos;s Dockside Green, and asked what his tip was for getting some of that flavour at home. &quot;Try making your bread dough the day with just a tiny amount of yeast and let it ferment slowly overnight. Actually, as the nights are cold you can just put the dough in a covered bowl on the back porch rather than using the fridge. It&apos;s really sweet that way as you work with the elements.&quot; 26. &quot;The economy may be harsh and cold on either side of the pond&quot;, says Marcy Goldman, editor of betterbaking.com &quot;but home baking helps us feel warm and reassured. It&apos;s no wonder we bake as we do at holiday times and with a Scrooge-like market, all the more reason. The first thing I do is sleuth out butter on sale and squirrel away many blocks of unsalted (sweet) butter as I can. Butter is the basenote, as it were, in baking and having lots on hand is inspiring - but its best to find at a great price. I also refresh my spices. It&apos;s funny how people dive into baking for the holidays, without thinking twice about using ages-old cinnamon or cloves. Fresh spices and fresh baking powder is the key.&quot; Norway 27. Gunn Borrowman, my favourite Norwegian making utterly perfect cakes up in the Cairngorms at Inshriach Nursery, gave this advice, &quot;Add a small amount of ground almonds to your cakes if you want them to stay moist. I sometimes replace all of the flour in cake recipes with ground almonds, and customers are so surprised you can get something gluten free and so good. &quot; Sweden 28. Johan S\u00f6rberg, the award-winning artisan baker at Riddarbageriet in Stockholm told me that very simple rye breads, not much more that rye flour, salt and water mixed to a firm dough and rolled ultra thinly, are almost a Christmas tradition in Sweden. &quot;You can&apos;t get easier than that,&quot; says Johan, &quot;and flavoured with anise, black pepper or caraway, cut into &quot;gingerbread&quot; men, and baked till crisp they can be hung from the tree, and then eaten with the meal with soft cheese.&quot; 29. From baking maestro Jan Hedh, the skill behind Peter&apos;s Yard in Edinburgh, and the authority on Swedish baking: don&apos;t overlook the breadth of flavour your can get from a little yeast and good flour. &quot;If you&apos;re stuck for time, stirring a pinch of yeast into an equal quantity of flour and water and leave it somewhere cool for a week; then use it in place of the same quantities of flour and water in the recipe. This will act as a powerful flavour enhancer and ferment. It&apos;s not sourdough, but it&apos;s the next best thing.&quot; Denmark 30. Camilla Plum is to Denmark what Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is to Britain, one of the few celebrities willing to stand up to the supermarkets and challenge consumers without worrying about being loveable. The key difference is that Camilla is an exceptional baker as well. Her advice is wise. &quot;If you don&apos;t buy any kind of ready-made food, just for a week, but actually cook yourself \u2026 you&apos;ll save a lot of money. And this you can use for real butter, lots of currants and raisins, lovely fresh vanilla pods and cardamom. Then you can do some really wonderful Christmas baking!&quot;", "tags": ["Life and style", "Baking", "Food & drink"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-20T09:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/nov/20/daviscup-tennis-argentina-spain", "sentences": ["Del Potro was in Shanghai last week making his debut in the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup, having reached the top 10 for the first time this year, and replacing Nalbandian as his country&apos;s No1 player."], "title": "Tennis: Steve Bierley - Argentina hope to ride home advantage all the way to Davis Cup glory", "article": "The moment that Rafael Nadal, the world&apos;s leading player, pulled out of the Davis Cup final in the coastal city of Mar del Plata - and the rumours coming out of Spain are that the right knee problem, despite assurances to the contrary, may be much more serious than tendinitis - the chances of Argentina winning the trophy for the first time increased hugely. Only 12 nations have ever won the Davis Cup, and good fortune has deemed that the South Americans have played all their ties at home this year, the significance being that they have not lost in Argentina for a decade. This competition, played annually, comes under perennial criticism for crowding an already over-crowded season, yet it survives because, essentially, the players love it. Some may opt out from time to time but inevitably they are drawn back by the prospect of playing as a team in front of crowds who are able to release the shackles of tennis convention and support their country with partisan glee. Such support can get out of hand. Opponents&apos; double faults and missed shots are cheered, while mirrors have occasionally been employed to dazzle the opposition. However the International Tennis Federation, the sport&apos;s governing body, has adopted powers to punish the overly enthusiastic fans by docking points, games, sets or even the tie itself. Without doubt the 11,000 spectators in the Islas Malvinas stadium will match anything the Argentine football crowds routinely manage, and peace and quiet is something the Spaniards will not experience this weekend, unless they still the baying hordes by dominating this final, and that seems unlikely with Nadal absent. The Argentines play the majority of their home ties on clay, though on this occasion, mindful that Nadal is the four-times French Open champion and having to decide the venue prior to his injury, they selected an indoor hard court. It now looks more of a risk although in David Nalbandian they have one of the finest indoor players in the world. Initially at least the Argentine team were none to happy at having to play outside the capital Buenos Aires. Both countries are among the powerhouses of modern men&apos;s tennis, with Spain currently having 14 players in the top 100, and Argentina nine. It was only a matter of time before the Spanish won their first Davis Cup final in 2000, in Barcelona against Australia, a victory repeated four years later in Seville when Nadal, then only 18, made his singles debut, beating Andy Roddick. Now, after losing the final against Russia on Moscow two years ago, Argentina feel their moment has arrived. If there are doubts then they centre on the inexperience of 20-year-old Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, and the occasional contrariness of Nalbandian. Del Potro was in Shanghai last week making his debut in the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup, having reached the top 10 for the first time this year, and replacing Nalbandian as his country&apos;s No1 player. At least he has not had to make the transition from indoor to clay, though he may still be feeling a little travel weary. As for Nalbandian he is capable of beating any of the world&apos;s leading players, while at other times being inexplicably vulnerable. He has had a poor year in the slams, though his form and focus improved sharply towards the end of the season. It appears he has partly sacrificed his own ambitions in order to lead his country to victory this weekend. Spain without Nadal remain strong, though lacking the obvious thrust and charisma. Much, as so often is the case, may depend on the doubles. In the singles Spain opted for the left-handed Feliciano L\u00f3pez, who is a natural serve and volleyer, and David Ferrer, badly out of form, in Friday&apos;s opening singles. The Argentine doubles team looks set to be Agustin Calleri and Jose Acasuso, who have both been working hard on their service returns with the prospect of facing the two Spanish left-handers in Lopez and Fernando Verdasco, who play regularly in ATP tournaments.

Thereafter Argentina, the clear pre-match favourites, and in front of their raucous home supporters, lost their way leaving Verdasco to seal Spain&apos;s third victory in the competition with a nerve-wracking 6-3, 6-7 (3), 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 win, lasting nearly four hours, over Acasuso in the first of Sunday&apos;s reverse singles. So Spain won the Davis Cup for the third time, and thereby denied Argentina their chance finally to get their hands on a trophy that has been won by only 12 nations since its inception in 1900. Eight years ago Spain were successful for the first time, beating Australia in Barcelona. Four years later, in another Olympic year, they defeated the US in Seville and now, in the year that Rafael Nadal claimed the Olympic singles gold medal in Beijing, they won again \u2014 a victory made all the more remarkable by the absence of Nadal with a right knee injury. The final hinged on Saturday&apos;s doubles coupled with an unfortunate opening day injury to Argentina&apos;s No1 Juan Martin del Potro, who had been instrumental in the South Americans&apos; semi-final victory over Russia. A third factor was the indoor court in Mar del Plata. This had originally been selected to negate Nadal&apos;s obvious prowess on clay. In hindsight it was the wrong choice, if for no other reason than the Argentine players made it clear they would have been far happier playing in Buenos Aires. Del Potro&apos;s injury was obviously the cruellest blow as Argentina, who have played all four of their ties at home this year beginning with a 4-1 victory over Britain, strove to win the trophy for the first time after two previous defeats in the final, most recently two years ago in Moscow. The 20-year-old world No9, the only top 10 player in the tie, had seemingly recovered from the foot problem that he played with during the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai, only to pull a muscle in his right thigh while losing his opening match against Feliciano Lopez, who turned out to be an inspired choice by the Spanish captain. Lopez teamed up in the doubles with Verdasco and, in a rubber of swooping fluctuations, defeated Nalbandian and Agustin Calleri 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5), 6-3 \u2014 an immensely nervy, tension-packed match that swung Spain&apos;s way on a missed backhand volley in the third set tie-break by the home team&apos;s talisman Nalbandian. Acasuso, ranked No48 in the world, did his best to give Nalbandian the chance to win the tie. Verdasco&apos;s temperament has often been suspect, but after losing the second and third sets he managed to pull himself together sufficiently, much helped by numerous Acasuso errors, to strike a final winning forehand. For much of this final it had seemed that the atmosphere in the River Plate stadium when Argentina won the football World Cup in 1978 had been transferred to the indoor arena in Mar del Plata.

Last year it stood at 11.9%.  &quot;China is going to face a difficult coming six months,&quot; said Louis Kuijs, the bank&apos;s senior economist in Beijing, predicting that the impact of the global crisis would intensify. He told reporters that heavy industries, such as steel and cement, had already slowed remarkably. The bank expects a big boost from the four trillion yuan (\u00a3386bn) stimulus package which Beijing unveiled two weeks ago, predicting that government-influenced spending will account for more than half of next year&apos;s growth. But it estimated that exports, which grew at 11% this year, will grow at just 3.5% in real terms next year. Other analysts have predicted they could actually fall.  With imports expected to increase more rapidly, that will mean net external trade will cut one percentage point off GDP growth - the first time for years that it will have reduced growth.  It is widely believed that China needs to grow by 8% a year to absorb new entrants to the labour market. David Dollar, the bank&apos;s country director for China, insisted that figure had no scientific basis, attempting to dispel the spectre of mass unemployment. Dollar also said the bank had opened talks with China about how it could contribute additional financing to help developing countries, stressing that discussions were at an early stage. Despite the bank&apos;s confidence that the stimulus package will boost China&apos;s economy, its details are still hazy more than two weeks after its announcement. Private investment and local government will provide much of the 4trn yuan and at least some of the projects included are already under way.  &quot;The government hasn&apos;t defined clearly what it means and where the money comes from,&quot; said Wang Yijiang, professor of economics at Beijing&apos;s Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, &quot;Up to this point, the signalling effect and confidence boosting effect is more important than the actual extra money put into the economy ... [It] gives the green light to all levels of government to spend as much as they wish to and can.&quot; He added that increased spending on social welfare and more help for small and medium sized enterprises was needed. The existing package appears to be concentrated on large infrastructure projects, although some Chinese media are predicting a further injection of funds for public services.  The president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said yesterday that kickstarting the ailing real estate sector would be key to the country&apos;s recovery. Presenting the chamber&apos;s annual survey on business confidence, Joerg Wuttke also warned: &quot;Recession normally breeds protectionism. So the pressure on politicians to close borders is certainly rising. &quot;At the same time, the slowdown in China comes with a backdrop of major overcapacity in some industries ... If Chinese companies are trying to export more to save themselves here, this will lead to a major problem in trade relations between Europe and China.&quot; But he said that given the overall downturn, the Chinese market might actually rise in importance for European businesses.", "tags": ["Global economy", "World Bank", "Global recession", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-25T11:51:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/26/china-execution", "sentences": ["&quot;Everyone is extremely concerned...

Campaigners say it is hard to think of a comparable case that has attracted such international concern. Wo Weihan was convicted last year and relatives have been told to see him as soon as possible, usually an indication that an execution is imminent.  His daughter, Chen Ran, said the supreme people&apos;s court had approved the death sentence. She said her father was convicted on a flimsy prosecution case and mainly on the basis of a confession that he later recanted. Chen, an Austrian citizen living in the US and married to an American citizen, will meet Wo tomorrow for the first time since 2004. She fears the execution could follow within hours. She told the Associated Press news agency that she had only &quot;a really, really small hope&quot; of clemency, but said: &quot;I want to appeal as a daughter to spare my father because this would destroy a life and destroy a family.&quot; Wo, who ran a medical equipment company in Beijing, was detained in January 2005 but was not permitted to see a lawyer for almost a year. He has been held in a prison hospital since March 2005, shortly after suffering a brain haemorrhage while in detention. He was sentenced to death by a Beijing court in a closed trial. According to a copy of the conviction, the 59-year-old&apos;s offences include revealing the health status of an unnamed high-ranking Chinese official \u2013 information considered a state secret by the authorities.  He was also convicted of passing on data about missile control systems, which Chen said had been published in a magazine and was only later classified as secret. Wo was accused of passing the information to a group linked to Taiwanese intelligence agencies via a middle man.  The court that sentenced Wo said today it did not have information on his case and the supreme court did not respond to queries.  The US embassy issued a statement saying it was &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; by reports that Wo&apos;s execution had been approved. &quot;We have expressed repeatedly and at high levels our serious concern about the lack of transparency and due process regarding Mr. Wo&apos;s case,&quot; it said.  Joshua Rosenzweig, research manager for the US-based Dui Hua Foundation, said there was &quot;no justification&quot; for the death penalty in Wo&apos;s case. He said he could not recall another capital case in China that had attracted so much international attention.  The number of executions in China is a state secret, but foreign groups believe several thousand are carried out each year. Even going by reported cases, the country executes more people annually than the rest of the world combined. The supreme court gained the right to overturn capital sentences in 2006 and earlier this year independent analysts suggested the resulting fall in executions could be as great as 30% year-on-year.  Nicholas Bequelin, of Human Rights Watch, warned: &quot;A decrease is not in itself a measure of the success of review. What is a measure of success is whether it stops miscarriages of justice, depoliticises cases and allows the defence to really represent the suspect. &quot;There&apos;s disenchantment with reform of the death penalty... It&apos;s really a paper review without significant input from lawyers or any real possibility of challenging the evidence. Also, in cases that are seen as political, the outcome is decided beforehand.&quot; He said senior judges and justice ministers appeared to be taking a harsher line than predecessors who stepped down last year. &quot;Everyone is extremely concerned... It&apos;s really a departure from the course of reform over the last ten years.&quot; The official media reported yesterday that a Chinese man who became notorious after killing six policemen had been executed in Shanghai.

So, on my first trip to China, I wanted to get a sense of this by visiting Shanghai and Chongqing, a massive city of 27 million people, where this image was taken. I was in a dirty part of town. There was this little toxic stream flowing past a steel plant into the Yangtze. It was literally popping with chemicals - it actually looked like it was raining. And right next to it was this picnic area. For most of the people of Chongqing, it is a picturesque place to go and visit; some were even swimming and fishing. The sight made me uncomfortable, then I realised they were all just having a wonderful time - proving that relationships and family are what really matters.  So I approached this group and set the camera down. I made it look like I was photographing to the left, then I turned it to the right, paused, and took their picture. Had I asked permission, they would have turned towards me and it would all have been different. I did check with them afterwards, to make sure it was OK. I was already excited. I knew the image would work. I became interested in the whole migrant aspect of life in China, where around 150 million people move around, constantly working, hardly seeing their families, sometimes from year to year. So I started photographing individuals in one place and then transferring them into other pictures, in a sort of &quot;photographic migration&quot;. The blurred person at the head of this table was actually shot on a building site in Shanghai. I put him in over the man who was there originally.

The Leopold&apos;s is over a century old, but of late it has become symbolic of Mumbai&apos;s edgy, fashionable image, after featuring in the pages of bestsellers and guidebooks. It found a new popularity among creative types, expatriate workers and many an investment banker wanting an atmospheric after-work beer alongside the Lonely Planet set. It&apos;s unclear who exactly perpetrated yesterday&apos;s atrocities. But whether al-Qaida or the Deccan Mujahideen, these men knew that their targets had a deep symbolic resonance: as hangouts for the legion of adventurous foreigners and the new Indian elite. In recent years, they&apos;ve flocked to Mumbai as never before, attracted by the project to re-make India&apos;s commercial capital as a global hub to rival Shanghai, New York or London. Mumbai&apos;s remarkable urban transformations, its mocha cafes and converted warehouse nightclubs, have not happened by chance. Five years ago, the port city once known as Bombay paid the management consultants McKinsey and Co to produce &quot;Vision Mumbai&quot; \u2013 a blueprint to become a world-class city by 2013. I got my first taste of just how audacious the project is exactly a year ago, while strolling around the narrow lanes of Dharavi, reputedly Asia&apos;s largest slum, on the first of many visits to produce BBC radio documentaries. The dense lanes of shanties and shacks are home to up to a million souls, a multiethnic patchwork of untouchables and Muslims at the bottom rungs of the city&apos;s social ladder.  Now, the entire slum is set for demolition by private companies. The aim is to free up land for the commercial development of multinationals and retail. Many locals are unhappy because, despite getting free flats in tower blocks on site, they fear being pushed out by gentrification. &quot;In this Mumbai, they don&apos;t want the poor man,&quot; I was told by Raju Korde, a local political activist.  The slum itself has suffered the fallout of terrorist attacks in the past. In fact, the grief and horror of yesterday are a sadly familiar tale to many Mumbaikars \u2013 including the 60% who live in slums or informal housing. Earlier episodes like the train bombings of 2006, and the coordinated attacks of 1993, each claimed even more lives than Wednesday&apos;s atrocities. The prelude to the 1993 bombs was rioting by ethnic Maharashtran Hindu nationalists, and the slum began to polarise between Hindus and Muslims, who separated into different areas.  But that domestic faultline was not the target on Wednesday. Instead, it&apos;s precisely the elite infrastructure of the &quot;global city&quot; that the terrorists attacked. In other words, what&apos;s different about Wednesday is that it seems to be Mumbai&apos;s connection to globalisation \u2013 its connection to us \u2013 that made it a target. Indeed, Britons and Americans, as well as a Jewish centre, were, it appears, deliberately sought out. Undermining Mumbai&apos;s attractiveness as a global destination and financial centre, at a time of a worldwide credit crunch and vulnerability, was perhaps the point of the attacks. Mumbai&apos;s choice to go &quot;global&quot; was made at least partly under the west&apos;s tutelage. As Mumbai suffers, the world must acknowledge how much the city has worked to become part of a global economy.

The award, worth \u20ac125,000 (\u00a3104,000), was announced yesterday by Spain&apos;s culture minister Cesar Antonio Molina in Barcelona. Mars\u00e9, 75, was honoured for works including \u00daltimas tardes con Teresa (Last Evenings with Teresa), about the ill-fated love story between a working class man and a rich woman, Si te dicen que ca\u00ed (If They Tell You I Fell), in which a rag and bone merchant falls in love with a prostitute during the early years of Franco&apos;s reign, and Rabos de lagartija (Lizard Tails), which is narrated by the unborn brother of the hero David as he grows up in post civil war Barcelona. &quot;The density and intensity of his writing, and the imaginative process, are what mark him out as a novelist,&quot; said the author&apos;s English translator Nick Caistor. &quot;He has created worlds of the imagination set against the often horrible realities of Spain after the civil war. His characters always escape to the world of fiction, when the world outside is grey and depressing, and he&apos;s particularly good at seizing the imaginative world of children.&quot; But Caistor said that Mars\u00e9 was under-read in English. &quot;He was fashionable in the 70s when he was translated quite a bit \u2026 but then he fell out of favour in translation,&quot; he said. But Caistor discerns encouraging signs, pointing to a renewed interest at the beginning of this century when English translations of Rabos de lagartija and El embrujo de Shanghai (Shanghai Nights) - the story of a 14-year-old boy who looking after a retired sea captain - were published. &quot;In the UK and US, because he writes so infrequently, he has not built up a head of steam,&quot; Caistor said. &quot;He writes very, very slowly, only one novel every 10 years, and you can see he rewrites everything over and over again. He starts from reality, then as he rewrites his imagination takes over more and more, and in the process his language becomes more and more powerful \u2013 layer upon layer of imagery.&quot; Mars\u00e9&apos;s English editor James Gurbutt, at Harvill Secker, said he hoped the win would herald new interest in Mars\u00e9&apos;s writing. &quot;He is a fantastic writer \u2013 if ever you want to read a novel about post-civil war Spain he&apos;s your man,&quot; he added. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to find an audience for him over here, but he is one of the greats \u2026 Literature in translation is very tough, and at times like this it&apos;s even tougher.&quot; Last year&apos;s Cervantes prize winner was Argentinian poet Juan Gelman, with previous winners including Mexico&apos;s Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges of Argentina and Peruvian-born Mario Vargas Llosa.

But we Russians have always got money hidden away somewhere, often in the refrigerator,&quot; Aivazov said, strolling off to look at designer skis. Nearby was a stand selling Gulfstream private jets; around the corner a property company was offering a private island. Other items on sale included an 18-metre yacht at \u00a31m. Welcome to Moscow&apos;s millionaire fair - a luxury goods and entertainment event in a giant exhibition hall on the edge of the capital. The fair is a sort of one-stop supermarket for the super-rich, where you can simultaneously purchase a beachside villa and a helicopter to take you there. The problem this year is that Russia&apos;s \u00fcber-wealthy have fallen on hard times. Since the summer, the country&apos;s economy has been badly hit by the global economic crisis. The rouble has taken a battering, while the Russian stock market has fallen by more than 70%.  Suddenly the country that redefined the word oligarch is feeling the pinch. This month Russia&apos;s richest man, Oleg Deripaska, was forced to borrow $4.5bn from the state to pay his debts. Other capitalist frontrunners are rumoured to be down to their last $100m. And instead of buying a new Aston Martin (on sale here for 11,637,795 roubles, or \u00a3260,000), Aivazov yesterday bought himself a lawnmower - albeit an expensive one. &quot;It cost $4,000,&quot; he said.  Like most male visitors to the show, Aivazov was wearing a tuxedo. Nearby, young women were pouring Laurent Perrier champagne while hanging upside down from a hoop. Being a millionaire - there are at least 103,000 of them across Russia - gets you a free invitation. Non-millionaires can visit if they stump up $64 for a ticket, and put on a suitable frock.  Many of those who turned up to Thursday&apos;s opening gala were young, attractive, female, and wearing cocktail dresses. Though not millionaires themselves, it appeared they were quite keen to meet some. &quot;I&apos;m not looking for a rich husband. I&apos;m looking for someone with a big personality,&quot; said Irina, 26, photographing her friend Olga in an Aston Martin. After a few seconds of reflection she conceded: &quot;Obviously if he was an oligarch with a big personality that would be OK.&quot; More than 200 brands are represented at the fair, ranging from a German dental clinic to a sculptor selling bronze female nudes. For \u20ac12m you could buy a helicopter with a Versace interior. Other items include Iranian silk carpets and a diamond-encrusted laptop. A Dutch entrepreneur, Yves Gijrath, founded the event, which is now in its fourth year in Moscow and also takes place in Amsterdam and Shanghai. According to Gijrath, Russians have a more prodigal attitude to money than many Europeans.  &quot;Russian customers like to buy, like to live and like to spend,&quot; he said. The Russian economy was &quot;stronger than ever&quot;, he insisted. Over the past eight years Russians have experienced unprecedented economic growth under former president Vladimir Putin. While most have seen only a modest increase in their prosperity, a few have become dazzlingly rich. This spring Russia had 110 billionaires, more than any other country apart from the US. Since then, however, the price of Russia&apos;s main export, oil, has collapsed. There is now a growing fear that the country could be lurching towards a repeat of the 1998 crash, which saw the rouble devalued and the savings of millions of ordinary Russians wiped out overnight. At the yacht display, Yevgeny Kochman was taking potential customers on a tour of a sleek white Princess yacht. The boat, made in Plymouth, looked like a dinky penthouse, complete with plasma TVs, comfy double beds and a kitchenette. The only thing missing was a British politician. Given the dreadful state of relations between London and the Kremlin, though, wouldn&apos;t Russians be wary of buying anything British? &quot;The politics is bad, yes,&quot; said Kochman. &quot;But among normal people it&apos;s fine. We buy your yachts and you buy our gas.&quot; Roman Abramovich had bought a boat from the British firm Nordmarine, he pointed out - although &quot;that was a long time ago.

I also relished Philip Roth&apos;s short novel Indignation (Cape), the posthumous tirade against America, narrated by the intellectually gifted son of a kosher butcher who attended a Christian college in Ohio and was killed in the Korean war in 1952, his death condemning him to an afterlife of inescapable memory. Roth draws a teasing likeness between the worlds of Harry S Truman and George W Bush, and writes, with his trademark drive and fluency, on the knife-blade between rage and laughter.  Although it was first published in 1995, Barack Obama&apos;s Dreams From My Father (Canongate) has been one of the most widely read books of 2008 - an autobiography so eloquent, imaginative, thoughtful and writerly that I find myself perversely looking forward to the end of the Obama administration even before it&apos;s begun, just for the sake of the extraordinary presidential memoir that will surely follow his time in office.  Craig Raine A long poem about the Mau Mau and psychic contagion, The Broken Word by Adam Foulds, was difficult to put down. When did you last think that about a poem? An outstanding debut. Zbigniew Herbert&apos;s Collected Poems (Atlantic) are wryly humorous, lyrical, anti-lyrical, absorbing. The humour is ironic - grinning, but grinning with those east European false teeth made out of steel. Conversations with Elizabeth Bishop edited by George Monteiro (University Press of Mississippi) has been around since 1996, but I&apos;ve just come across it. Full of marvellous things - including a rueful, affectionate and heart-breaking account of her poetry class at Harvard by Dana Gioia. The students weren&apos;t interested. Except for Gioia. Alex Ross James Wood is a critic eerily attuned to the music of language, and his short book How Fiction Works (Cape) sings as artfully as much of the canonical work quoted in its pages. David Moody&apos;s Ezra Pound: Poet, Volume 1 (OUP) recaptures the jolting energy of Pound&apos;s early work, stopping just as the darkness was creeping in.  Richard Taruskin&apos;s The Danger of Music (University of California Press), a collection of essays by the fearsomely intelligent Berkeley-based musicologist, rips apart the comfortable myths that classical music listeners have woven around their favourite repertory, substituting a passionately engaged perspective that measures music in both political and moral terms.  Fareed Zakaria&apos;s The Post-American World (Allen Lane) is a hopeful, pragmatic vision of America at peace with the world; when I read it, early in the year, its ideas seemed remotely utopian, but with the election of Barack Obama they may have inched closer to reality. Salman Rushdie The book that most impressed me is Dave Eggers&apos;s What is the What (Penguin), written with the Sudanese refugee Valentino Achak Deng, whose astonishing story Eggers transmutes into a &quot;faction&quot; of immense power, emotion and even, in the midst of horror, beauty. And the Sudanese creation myth at the heart of the book is wonderful. God asks Man, whom he has just created, to choose between two gifts, the Cow or the What. The Cow is known, practical, useful, valuable; the What is unknown and undefined, a mystery. Man chooses the Cow, and God seems pleased by the choice. But as a result, from that day to this, Man has not known the answer to the question, &quot;what is the What?&quot; We are pragmatic beings, and we do not know the nature of the Mystery. Not that the Mystery is necessarily wonderful. In one terrible scene, two young boys are hiding in long grass, watching the utter devastation of their village at the height of the violent insanity of the Sudanese civil war, and one boy says to the other, &quot;Do you think that is the What?&quot; Simon Schama The best fiction I read all year came in at under 150 pages. Why aren&apos;t the praises of Julia Leigh, one of the greatest living writers, sung often and everywhere? Because she&apos;s Australian? Because she writes glinting slivers of the imagination rather than door-stoppers? Because she takes her time? It&apos;s been nine years since the appearance of her jagged little masterpiece The Hunter (Faber), but her new book, Disquiet (Faber), was worth waiting for. Woman with children arrives back home at French chateau, but this is no picnic in the Dordogne. And if you want to change your life - for the better - and have never read the Colombian novelist Alvaro Mutis, you owe it to yourself to get acquainted with The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll (New York Review of Books). A collection of seven novellas that can be read at a run or singly, it features the greatest rainbow-chaser since Quixote, but a lot sexier and ravenous for both learning and love, not to mention fantastical, doomed schemes to make a pile of loot.  For non-fiction, there was one stupendous starburst of wild brilliance: Clive James&apos;s Cultural Amnesia (Picador). It crackles with epigrammatic mischief and reminded me of Charles Dantzig&apos;s great Dictionnaire \u00e9go\u00efste de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise, a book that features a devastating skewering of Sartre and a spirited defence of the adjective, plus essays on ignorance, clich\u00e9s, therapy (against it), digressions (for) and lettres. Will someone please get this fabulous box of tricks translated?  Ahdaf Soueif My book for this year has to be Raja Shehadeh&apos;s Palestinian Walks: Notes on a Vanishing Landscape (Profile), an account of the author&apos;s favourite walks in the hills and countryside surrounding his hometown of Ramallah. It places itself in the context of travel literature on the Holy Land, but is like no other book on Palestine that I have read. Shehadeh&apos;s love and knowledge of the countryside bring it vividly to life on every page. As his landscape becomes more truncated - by the Israeli army and Israeli settlements - Shehadeh, an eminent lawyer, documents his legal struggle to safeguard his walks. The book is matter-of-fact, quiet, romantic, sensuous - and heartbreaking. It deservedly won the George Orwell prize earlier this year. Kate Summerscale I loved Me Cheeta, the story of Hollywood told by a chimpanzee. It&apos;s venomous, lyrical and very, very funny. And another great animal book: Uncle Cleans Up, about a millionaire elephant who wears a purple dressing gown and reluctantly engages in violent spats with his neighbours. Written in 1965 by JP Martin, a Yorkshire vicar, and illustrated by Quentin Blake, it has been reissued this year by New York Review Children&apos;s Collection in a lovely, clothbound edition.  Paul Theroux For purely selfish reasons (quite good reasons for anyone to enjoy a book) my favourite book this year was The World Is What It Is, Patrick French&apos;s biography of VS Naipaul. This model of scrupulous research and independent thinking, depicting Naipaul as an excellent writer, a damaged soul and, in his personal relations, an utter monster, vindicates me in my much-criticised portrait of the man in Sir Vidia&apos;s Shadow. Adam Thirlwell Alex Ross&apos;s The Rest is Noise combines scrupulous and inventive analyses of the 20th century&apos;s music with lavish care over that music&apos;s improvised history: such as Anton Webern being killed accidentally by the allies, or Richard Strauss in the same war being asked by a passing fan, an American intelligence operative who had played oboe in the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, if he had ever thought to write an oboe concerto. No, said Strauss, curtly. Several months later, he had. Another modernist master was lovingly restored in Michael Almereyda&apos;s selection of writings by and about Mayakovsky: Night Wraps the Sky (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) - a book which is wonderful both for Mayakovsky&apos;s poems, with their crazy persuasive metaphors, and the eyewitness accounts of Mayakovsky&apos;s standup readings, where he took on his hecklers: &quot;&apos;My comrades and I read your poems and didn&apos;t understand anything.&apos; &apos;You must choose more clever comrades.&apos;&quot;  Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn The Ingmar Bergman Archives (Taschen), edited by Paul Durcan and Bengt Wanselius, weighs a ton and is filled with facts and photographs and interviews with the great man himself. It comes with a DVD that includes home movie footage. It makes me wish for a long, dark northern winter so I can do justice to it.  In fiction, the best book I read was Nadeem Aslam&apos;s The Wasted Vigil, a novel of acute psychological and political insight and sympathy. He has emerged as one of the most exciting and serious British novelists writing now.  In poetry, Mick Imlah&apos;s The Lost Leader displays a well-stocked poetic imagination on the loose with history and its discontents - Scotlands of the mind - with a poetic diction of astonishing energy and wit, and an almost total disrespect for his elders.  Claire Tomalin Richard Holmes&apos;s The Age of Wonder tracks the scientists of the Romantic age - Banks, botanising and anthropologising in Tahiti; the Herschels, brother and sister, polishing their giant telescopes in Datchet; Humphrey Davy, proclaiming that, through science, man can connect his hopes with his ideas, and shape his own future - and more. Rich, solid and sparkling, this is a wonderful book. Mark Bostridge&apos;s engrossing Florence Nightingale: The Woman and her Legend (Viking) is another triumph, carrying the reader through that long and famous life with the lively intelligence it deserves and making a new and authoritative portrait. For something shorter, try David Ellis&apos;s experiment in biography, Death and the Author (OUP), which takes a look at DH Lawrence&apos;s approach to his own illness and death. If the subject is sombre, the account of Lawrence himself - great, complex, exasperating, brave - and the responses of his wife and various friends, are told with such verve and wit that I found myself laughing as I read. Rose Tremain I was awed by JG Ballard&apos;s autobiography, Miracles of Life, which vividly portrays an existence marked for ever by his childhood in Shanghai and his wartime imprisonment in Lunghua camp in China. This &quot;bright but bloody&quot; material, though subliminally present in Ballard&apos;s dystopian early fictions, wasn&apos;t used directly until 40 years later in the greatest of his novels, Empire of the Sun, and the autobiography helps to explain why.  Anne Tyler Three novels: Preeta Samarasan&apos;s debut, Evening Is the Whole Day (Fourth Estate); Lush Life by Richard Price; and The Flying Troutmans (Counterpoint) by the Canadian novelist Miriam Toews. Jeanette Winterson Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love by Sheila Rowbotham (Verso) is a powerful and entertaining biography of the &quot;sexy sage of Sheffield&quot;. Carpenter gave up his life at Cambridge to live out his socialist principles - advocating simplicity and education for all. He seems to have influenced everyone, including EM Forster, who found his famous dictum &quot;only connect&quot; while visiting Carpenter. This absorbing book opens the whole period of early socialism in Britain. And it reads beautifully. The Brain that Changes Itself by Norman Doidge (Penguin) shows us that at last neuroscience has caught up with what mystics and meditation have taught for centuries - the brain is infinitely changeable. Forget mechanics: the brain is not a machine, nor is it a computer made of meat. This book is a wonderful and engaging way of re-imagining what kind of creatures we are. \u2022 Season&apos;s readings (previous): recommendations from Hari Kunzru to Philip Pullman Your books of the year What have you enjoyed reading over the past 12 months?

I have always admired Barry&apos;s work, both on stage and off it, but I feel this is the finest thing he has done. The book has two narratives, one being the story of a very old woman indeed, possibly over a hundred, and the other the doctor who has to assess her when the mental asylum where she lives is being shut down. Dr Grene&apos;s life is woven in to hers in a way the reader does not foresee (and should not), but the real narrative is that of Ireland in the 20th century, a romantic Ireland indeed, but a cruel one to its outcasts - thankfully or hopefully it&apos;s dead and gone. Esther Freud The books that I&apos;ve loved most this year have all been collections of short stories. Jhumpa Lahiri&apos;s Unaccustomed Earth (Bloomsbury) was subtle and moving, accumulating in suspense, until the tour de force of the last three linked stories had me hanging, heartbroken but still hopeful, on her every word. Very different in tone, but no less wonderful, were Francis Wyndham&apos;s collected stories, reissued in a volume with his prizewinning novel The Other Garden(Picador). The earliest stories were written in the 1940s when Wyndham was invalided out of the war, and give us an odd, sideways but utterly convincing glimpse into a lost world. Tobias Wolff&apos;s collection, Our Story Begins (Bloomsbury), also spans his life as a writer - the earliest work was written more than 30 years ago - and the stories here are so dazzling, anarchic and beautifully crafted that they assure Wolff&apos;s long-held place as a master of his art. John Gray The Silver Swan (Picador) is the second in a series of thrillers featuring a dishevelled pathologist in 1950s Dublin that John Banville is writing under the pseudonym of Benjamin Black. Black shows human lives unravelling and revealing themselves, in all their extremity and strangeness, under the pressure of events. The Silver Swan is a book in something like a new genre, a novel of suspense that alters the way we see ourselves. The divergence between actual life and the conventions of literary realism is a recurring theme of Will Self&apos;s writing. Liver (Viking) consists of four forays into territory Self has made his own - the experience of being a restless consciousness in an inescapable body, finding itself in a world that is at once dreamlike and intractably material.  Tessa Hadley I&apos;m almost at the end of Amitav Ghosh&apos;s Sea of Poppies (John Murray), not wanting it to finish, hungry for more (it&apos;s the first book in a planned trilogy). Set in West Bengal in the 1830s, it&apos;s as rich with stories as a Dickens novel. The book&apos;s English is an adventure in itself, Hindustani and Bhojpuri mingling on the page with port argots and Lascar sailors&apos; pidgin: the voyage of the Ibis stands in eloquently for all our intermingled histories.  At the opposite end of the fictional scale, I discovered Scottish writer Agnes Owens in her Collected Stories (Polygon), delicate and deadly, funny and bleak, tiny slips from the daily lives of the men and women who don&apos;t often find their way into fiction, struggling on the poverty line. Owens&apos;s writing, like Ghosh&apos;s, follows the genius of the spoken language. &quot;I tried tae get ye somethin&apos; for yer Christmas believe it or no,&quot; says Mac to his mother, &quot;but everything wis shut, so here&apos;s two pounds. Buy yersel a present.&quot; And then there was JG Ballard&apos;s autobiography Miracles of Life. Did his childhood experiences in the Shanghai internment camp help form his lovely generous intelligence? Everything he thinks - about Cambridge, about Francis Bacon, about his children - is original and thrilling, yet his thoughts fall into an expression as easy and delicious as clear water (or whisky and soda, his favourite). David Hare The Believers by Zo\u00eb Heller (Fig Tree) is the sort of perplexing, stimulating mess that only a first-rate writer can conceive. Mostly an unforgiving requiem for the intransigence of the old left in New York, it achieves huge power portraying two sisters heading in opposite directions - one towards orthodox Judaism, the other towards a new life with an apolitical Arab. Heller has become one of only two British novelists whose every book you wouldn&apos;t want to miss. Seamus Heaney Words in Air: The Complete Correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell (Faber) runs to more than 800 pages yet never lags. Every page is electric with intelligence and the correspondents&apos; need to keep themselves writing fit, to entertain with gossip or report on poetry - their own and their contemporaries&apos; - or simply trampoline off their different ups and downs. They were lifelines and matches for each other. The level of engagement varies from the slapsticky comical (Bishop on Randall Jarrell: &quot;I can&apos;t get used to the beard and keep expecting him to take it off in one hand&quot;) to the beautifully earnest (Lowell on Theodore Roethke: &quot;What a tightrope he had to walk of comedy and grandeur, a delicacy to be true to, a bigness to live up to.&quot;) Here, too, there is comedy, grandeur, delicacy and a bigness lived up to.  Bishop shows her mettle early on when she provides a detailed &quot;workshopping&quot; of a first draft of Lowell&apos;s &quot;Falling Asleep over the Aeneid&quot;, so were they alive today they would surely have taken note of a new translation of the epic by Sarah Ruden (Yale). Unlikely that anybody will fall asleep over this one, a faithful treatment by a poet who keeps to the Latin line for line, makes it somewhat pacier, yet stays in tune. Zo\u00eb Heller The Ministry of Special Cases by Nathan Englander (Faber), which came out in paperback this year, is a desperately sad and darkly funny portrait of life in Argentina during that country&apos;s &quot;dirty war&quot;: I am envious of Englander&apos;s exquisite prose style. I also deeply admired Richard Price&apos;s Lush Life for its wit, its pathos and its flawless dialogue.  Charlie Higson There was a small and slightly silly outcry when Child 44 by Tom Rob Smith (Simon &amp; Schuster) was longlisted for the Booker. A thriller! What is the world coming to? The fact is, it&apos;s an enormously well written book with a fantastic premise: in the 1950s, the Soviet government has decreed that crime is a thing of the past. In a perfect communist state everyone has everything they need. The central character is a police chief who gets drawn into a nightmare Alice Through the Looking Glass world, in which, by investigating crimes, he becomes a wanted man himself. Alan Hollinghurst Mick Imlah is one of the finest poets now writing, and his second collection, The Lost Leader (Faber), two decades in the making, is to me the most brilliant, original and preoccupying book of the year. For all its dazzling allusiveness there is nothing like it. The technique is breathtaking, the wit dark and complex, the emotional effects keen, subtle and disconcerting. To say that &quot;The Lost Leader&quot; itself, spoken by an abandoned follower of Bonnie Prince Charlie, is a great poem is not to slight the other 60 masterpieces in this unmissable book. Richard Holmes Xinran&apos;s China Witness: Voices from a Silent Generation (Chatto &amp; Windus) is based on her extraordinary in-depth interviews with a dozen unlikely survivors of the cultural revolution (the Policeman, the Acrobat, the Lantern Maker . . .). This brilliant work of oral history - by a sort of Chinese Studs Terkel - gives a completely riveting glimpse of everyday life behind Mao&apos;s bamboo curtain, and subtly reflects on the politics of memory and what may be yet to come.  Roger Deakin&apos;s Notes from Walnut Tree Farm (Hamish Hamilton) completes the legendary naturalist&apos;s triptych of journals and essays that began with Waterlog and Wildwood. This is the most intimate of the three, selected from diaries he kept up to the year he died, with all his exquisite, tender powers of observation (the adventures of a single ant voyaging across his writing desk) more than ever alive.  Finally, a standing ovation for Michael Holroyd&apos;s A Strange Eventful History: The Dramatic Lives of Ellen Terry, Henry Irving, and their Remarkable Families (Chatto &amp; Windus), his triumphant return to the big, flamboyant canvas. Michael Holroyd The boldest biographical enterprise of recent times must be Patrick French&apos;s courageous and courageously authorised life of VS Naipaul, The World is What It Is (Picador).  The Age of Wonder by Richard Holmes (Harper Press) is itself a wonder - a masterpiece of skilful and imaginative storytelling which explores the life and work of scientists in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, enabling us to know them intimately and understand how the individual creative genius fits into our society.  Love in Exile by the Egyptian writer Bahaa Taher, translated by Farouk Abdel Wahab (Arcadia), is a wonderfully elegant disquisitory novel in which the characters&apos; past lives, their politics and loves, are recalled and reinterpreted, bringing dramatic changes to the present. Boris Johnson My book of the year would have to be Boswell&apos;s Life of Johnson (Penguin Classics) and not simply because it is about a namesake of mine. Of course, I&apos;m drawn to Samuel Johnson&apos;s early career as a journalist, working his way up from the fetid delights of Grub Street to leave an indelible imprint on history. But this year, Boswell&apos;s mighty tome provided much-needed diversion and plenty of food for thought when I had the unenviable task of having to fly economy - twice - to and from Beijing. More than 200 years old, it remains one of the greatest biographies. Jackie Kay I imagine Gerard Donovan&apos;s Julius Winsome (Faber) will become one of those word-of-mouth bestsellers, judging from my own experience: everyone I know who has read the book loved it; everyone was desperate for someone else to read it so a discussion could be had. Julius Winsome is one of the most haunting characters I&apos;ve come across for a long time. This is a book that makes you puzzle with issues of love and loss long after you have finished reading it. For a brilliant mix of the poetic and the comic, I loved Karen McLeod&apos;s In Search of the Missing Eyelash (Vintage), a quirky novel that also explores how we can become undone through love.  My favourite poetry book of the year was Maura Dooley&apos;s Life Under Water (Bloodaxe), a moving collection of poems that made me think differently about memory and loss, what is submerged, what can be recovered. \u2022 Season&apos;s readings (previous): recommendations from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie to Richard Ford\u2022 Season&apos;s readings (next): recommendations from Hari Kunzru to Philip Pullman", "tags": ["Best books of the year", "Best books", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Jackie Kay"], "publicationDate": "2008-11-29T00:02:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/03/the-fiver", "sentences": ["And two Shanghai Shenhua footballers have been slung in the jug for attacking a man in a restaurant after their team failed to win the Chinese Super League."], "title": "The Michael Shields Case, and Eamon Dunphy", "article": "JUSTICE FOR NORRIS Now the Fiver is simple folk - we can&apos;t even spell M Night Showaddywaddy, never mind understand his films - but after a wasted life of rifling through Spot The Difference puzzle books, there is one thing we&apos;re good at. And after hours of staring REALLY HARD at our ZX81 screen, we&apos;ve spotted the difference between the cases of David Norris and Liverpool FC. Norris was fined \u00a35,000 for a gesture in support of a man convicted of causing death by dangerous driving. Liverpool FC today went unpunished for their collective gesture in support of a man convicted of attempted murder. The Michael Shields case is one of the most sensitive and emotive in this country&apos;s history, and a judicial review will begin tomorrow. We have no idea if he is guilty or not: we&apos;re simply not in a position to comment with even a smidgen of authority (so what&apos;s new etc). But surely we are entering extremely uncomfortable territory if we allow public perceptions of a miscarriage of justice to supplant that which has been established in a court of law. A lot of people think Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol is a good film; it doesn&apos;t mean it is. (Actually it&apos;s a belter, the pick of a blisteringly funny series, but you get the point.) Besides, are the players really so familiar with the minutiae of the case that they can wear such T-shirts with a clear conscience? Does Alvaro Arbeloa, say, have a theory as to why a number of witnesses came forward to say they saw Shields batter Martin Georgiev over the head with a seven-pound paving slab, fracturing his skull? And given what happened to Norris, are we to assume it&apos;s one rule for 27-year-old midfielders called David who play in East Anglia and one rule for the rest? &quot;We understand that Michael Shields&apos;s case is one that many Liverpool players and fans feel strongly about,&quot; said an FA spokesman, as the Kenny Dalglish pin-badge he had just hidden down his pants accidentally pierced his swingers, splashing blood all over the journalists&apos; buffet, not that they&apos;d mind. &quot;Having heard the club&apos;s explanation we will not be taking any formal action, and we are satisfied that they understand the sensitivities around football matches being used as a platform for political messages.&quot; If that was the case we wouldn&apos;t be writing this, would we? ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;The vision and quality of the Azizi brand was what inspired me to be a part of this new upcoming development&quot; - $tevie Mbe puts cynics who think he allowed  an exclusive Dubai development to name a tower-block after him in exchange for a free \u00a31m luxury apartment firmly back in their box. **************** ET TU, EAMON? Look at them, the miserable wretches. How much time, money and ingenuity would it take to drag Doncaster Rovers from the bottom of the Championship to within 11 points of Big Cup? About as long as it would take to transform rock into gold? Or would two years and net expenditure of around \u00a375m do the trick? It might if Roy Keane were manager. After all, that&apos;s what he&apos;s done with Sunderland. No wonder Keane&apos;s ghost writer, Eamon Dunphy, once insisted: &quot;He&apos;s a gentleman. He&apos;s a rebel. He&apos;s a class act ... and he&apos;s right about everything.&quot; But hold on, what&apos;s this? It seems Mr Dunphy, who has been famously banned for drink-driving and driving without insurance, has spotted a bandwagon on which to hitch a ride. &quot;He is rambling about all sorts of things and it&apos;s really ridiculous,&quot; said Dunphy of Keane. Which makes a pleasant change from everyone else saying the exact same thing of Dunphy. &quot;He is pontificating on everything,&quot; continued Dunphy, who once admitted to landing Keane in trouble by taking &quot;poetic licence&quot; when writing &quot;their&quot; book. &quot;He hasn&apos;t had a settled side and I think he is in a fog at the moment. Everyone gets there at some point in your life, when things get too much for you. You don&apos;t know where the levers for control are,&quot; confessed Dunphy, who summed the problem up as follows: &quot;He is in danger of being relegated but I think Roy Keane is starting to believe the Roy Keane mythology.&quot; Now who was it that made a huge pile of cash helping to create that mythology? It couldn&apos;t possible be the guy who insisted Keane was &quot;right about everything&quot;, could it? ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will waste the \u00a311m he&apos;s patiently saved all season on Salomon Kalou in January. Unless he gets a fancy tower in Sefton Park named after him, or at least his wages doubled, Daniel Agger will hotfoot it from Liverpool to Meeelan. Nerves are jangling at the Pope&apos;s O&apos;Rangers, where six players will be dumped by Walter Smith so that he can sign Portuguese midfielder Tonel. And Inter want Him. ********************* NEWS IN BRIEF Manchester City executive chairman Garry Cook has revealed that a list of possible targets for the January transfer window has been drawn up, but hasn&apos;t told us who&apos;s on it, which makes him a bit of a tease. The Sky Sports website has described the news that Ali Al Habsi will miss an FA Cup and two league matches in January if he competes for Oman in the Gulf Cup as &quot;a blow&quot; for Bolton. Number of matches in all domestic competitions played by Bolton&apos;s goalkeeper so far this season: 0. Paul Scholes, 67, will be able to bend his knacked knee enough to sit comfortably on the bench for Manchester United&apos;s Rumbelwoods Cup match against Blackeye Rovers. And two Shanghai Shenhua footballers have been slung in the jug for attacking a man in a restaurant after their team failed to win the Chinese Super League. China striker Mao Jianqing will have seven days to think about what he&apos;s done, while team-mate Liu Yintao will be out in five. ********************* STILL WANT MORE?

It would be ours too", "article": "In Chinese reactions to the troubles of the rest of the world, from the terrorist attacks in Mumbai to the recession in the US and Europe, I hear a hint of complacency and a touch of arrogance. &quot;If that&apos;s what you get with democracy, perhaps we&apos;re better off without it,&quot; is how one official thinker summarises his reaction to the atrocities in India. And if the west wants China to bail it out of this self-inflicted financial mess, it must give Beijing more power in international institutions. The refrain of &quot;China&apos;s back&quot; mingles with &quot;that wouldn&apos;t happen here&quot;. They may be speaking too soon. If they are, it will be our problem as well as theirs. Gobsmacking is the word to describe China&apos;s economic development over the 30 years since Deng Xiaoping initiated what has come to be known as the period of reform. In these three decades, growth has averaged more than 9% a year. As I write, I look out at the garishly neon-lit skyscrapers of downtown Shanghai, which make the business districts of all but the largest American cities seem low-rise and sober by comparison. Across the river, the Superbrand Mall is a buzzing hive of conspicuous consumption, with young Chinese stopping off for a coffee at Starbucks, weighed down with shopping bags from the most fashionable western brands. Yes, cities like Shanghai are islands of urban prosperity in a sea of rural backwardness, but this growth has also lifted perhaps 300 million people out of extreme poverty. If it goes on like this, the Chinese economy will, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, be roughly the same size as those of the United States and the European Union by 2020. If. The well-known free marketeer Zhang Weiying, dean of an impressive new management school at Peking University, argues that after 30 years the economic reform is essentially complete. Yes, the commanding heights of the economy are still occupied by giant state-controlled enterprises, but as they come to be quoted on stock exchanges across the world, gain minority private shareholders and face market pressures, so they increasingly behave like value-maximising companies. They have a long way to go, but the direction of travel is clear.  What&apos;s needed for the next 30 years, he suggests, is a complementary political reform, starting with the rule of law. This is an argument I have heard many times over the past fortnight, and in quite surprising places. For instance, in the austere offices of the Chinese Communist party&apos;s Central Compilation and Translation Bureau, an institution whose primary task is to collect and translate official writings and declarations, from Marx through Mao to Hu Jintao. Its deputy director, Yu Keping, a prominent political scientist and party reformer, argues that China is moving from the rule of man towards the rule of law. For the first time in several thousand years of Chinese statehood, he suggests, ordinary people are being offered legal recourse against political authority. Even the top party and state leaders should be subject to the law. The country also needs more transparent, less corrupt government; a civil service answering more efficiently to the needs of its citizens (&quot;one-stop service!&quot; he cries enthusiastically); and more democracy, both in local government and inside the Communist party. Comrade Lenin would be turning in his grave. Practice lags far behind this theory. Any Chinese lawyer can tell you how far away the country is from having an independent judiciary. And its ruling authorities, though no longer communist in anything but name, are in one vital sense still Leninist: that is, uncompromisingly defending their monopoly of political power. Nonetheless, in political reforms too, the direction of travel is encouraging.  If we in the rest of the world have any sense, we will encourage it with every means at our disposal - starting from the aims set by Chinese reformers themselves. Rather than saying, &quot;No, this can&apos;t work, what you need is western-style multi-party democracy&quot;, we should say, &quot;Right, for strengthening the rule of law, here&apos;s this detailed body of experience; for a more professional civil service, we have this useful method&quot;. We will achieve more by offering a complex toolkit for good governance and the rule of law, including human and civil rights, rather than a single template for democracy. Thirty years ago we would have said that Leninist capitalism was a contradiction in terms, like fried snowballs. Well, here it is, right in front of our eyes. After another 30 years of Chinese-style incremental reform, &quot;crossing the river by feeling the stones&quot; as Deng Xiaoping put it, who knows what new political riverbank they will have reached? But the Chinese system is wrestling with many tensions. Public protests are a regular occurrence, and some turn violent: demonstrators recently stormed Communist party offices in Gansu province. And this is before the economic downturn has begun to bite. The test of any political system is how it withstands hard times. The Chinese system, as it has emerged over the past 30 years, has not yet stood that test. What&apos;s the alternative to further open-ended, incremental reform? The most likely scenario is one that we have seen elsewhere in the post-communist world. Faced with growing discontent, as rising expectations clash with lowered economic performance, post-communist rulers turn to nationalism to preserve their own power. There&apos;s every reason to believe this could be popular in China. Even among Chinese people critical of the current system, one seldom finds much sympathy for the Tibetans or for the Muslim population in the northern province of Xinjiang. If a few despairing members of those small minorities turned to violence in one of China&apos;s big cities, the majority reaction would probably be degrees fiercer than in India. Nationalist netizens in China&apos;s hyperactive blogosphere are more luridly anti-western than China&apos;s current rulers. If, in the coming years, the existing system were to fail to meet rising expectations - due to a combination of global recession, American and European resistance to Chinese exports, local corruption, mismanagement and lack of democratic controls - the temptation would grow to salvage legitimacy by turning to a more aggressive nationalism.  Even with the wisest leadership in Beijing and Washington, the global rebalancing of power over the next decades will be hard to manage without conflict. Introducing his national security team on Monday, Barack Obama observed that &quot;newly assertive powers have put strains on the international system&quot;. A former US commander in the Pacific, Admiral William Fallon, recently revealed that there were people in the Pentagon under George W Bush &quot;who warned me that you&apos;d better get ready for the shoot &apos;em up here, because sooner or later we&apos;re going to be at war with China&quot;. Susan Shirk, who was one of the senior US officials responsible for China policy in the Clinton administration, argues in her book, China: Fragile Superpower, that American policy should give priority to China&apos;s external behaviour, precisely to avert the long-term danger of war. But China&apos;s external behaviour can&apos;t be separated from its internal dynamics. We cannot afford not to be interested in the progress of its uncharted, incremental economic and political reforms, and we must want them to succeed. Otherwise we&apos;ll all be Shanghaied. timothygartonash.com", "tags": ["China", "Global economy", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-12-04T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/04/china-usa", "sentences": ["That was always a forlorn hope given the worldwide interconnections spawned by globalisation, not to mention such awkward facts as the 60% plunge in the Shanghai index before the crisis assumed its full dimensions."], "title": "Jonathan Fenby: It is more vital than ever for economies and world leaders to come together", "article": "When the global financial crisis was still in its infancy \u2013 but threatening enough to stir thoughts about how to ward it off \u2013 the theory of &quot;decoupling&quot; emerged as a potential comfort blanket. The idea was that the big, emerging economies led by China.  were on different trajectories from the west, and so would be able to balance a downturn in developed nations with continuing robust growth and perky stock markets to offset falls in Wall Street and London.  That was always a forlorn hope given the worldwide interconnections spawned by globalisation, not to mention such awkward facts as the 60% plunge in the Shanghai index before the crisis assumed its full dimensions. What is now apparent is that, finding itself plunged into what its prime minister describes as one of the toughest years the country has faced, the biggest developing economy is itself facing a major question about its global involvement as the old international financial order crumbles. The leadership in Beijing has made it plain that its first priority is to stimulate China&apos;s domestic economy to prevent the growth from which the regime draws a big slice of its legitimacy slumping below 7% next year. That, says President Hu Jintao, is the best contribution the People&apos;s Republic can make to global recovery, and the government has shown its seriousness by announcing a 4tn yuan ($580bn) stimulus package focused on infrastructure, accompanied by a wide range of monetary-easing measures and steps to boost rural incomes.  But, with the leadership committed to the market-led, opening-up economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping 30 years ago, China cannot be an island. Its foreign exchange reserves now total almost $2tn and, while headlines about its trade surplus lead to an exaggeration of the role exports play in growth, it needs world trade to keep the post-1978 economic machine rolling along. Though it retains capital controls, its currency has become the centre of movements of speculative &quot;hot money&quot; \u2013 when the yuan was appreciating earlier in the year, waves of dollars found their way to the mainland; now that there is talk of yuan devaluation, the currency market has seized up.  The leadership&apos;s attempt to stay above the global fray while it spends trillions on railways, roads, cheap housing and the power grid and hopes for a rise in consumption, runs into another reality. The recent round of international financial meetings has shown two things. The G7-G8 apparatus inherited from the Roosevelt-Truman administration belongs to the past; how can any organisation that does not include China or the oil-producing states claim be representative of global finance in today&apos;s world? On the other hand, the broader G20 is just that \u2013 too broad. It includes countries on the margins of the global system and is bound to go for compromise, consensus and platitudes rather than coherent leadership.  The need for a new organisation that recognises the way the world has changes in the last couple of decades is as evident as it will be difficult to achieve. But some factors need to be taken into account. The United States will continue to be a major actor, if no longer such a dominant force. Declinists who see the current plunge in the American economy as heralding the end of US world influence are simply mistaken. Equally, for all its difficulties in getting its act together, the European Union will remain a huge global player. Japan will stay stuck in its own timidity, but is still the world&apos;s second-biggest national economy.  So, if we take these three entities as essential members of a new system, the job would be to graft on to them just enough other countries to provide a proper mirror of world finance, but not so many that it becomes mired in endless debate. How about a G6 of the US, EU and Japan plus China, Russia and Saudi Arabia to represent the oil producers. Cue in immediate cries of woe from India and Brazil. A single EU voice would run into the very real problem of Britain&apos;s absence from the euro, and get the Europhobes in the UK foaming at the mouth while, across the Channel, Germany and France would each have to agree to relinquish sovereignty. Italy would sulk and Canada might find it hard to maintain its poise if it no longer sat at the top table. In other words, the whole edifice would probably prove impossible to construct in a world where national interests continue to take precedence over the global concerns that politicians keep telling us are so vital. So, if we admit that the limited multilateral escape route is too difficult to pursue, we will be left with a world buffeted by the forces of deflation, nascent protectionism, imbalances and, perhaps most important right now, a huge loss of confidence and the all-encompassing fear that further decline is inevitable. In confronting that context China should play a pivotal role, given the importance of its economy, its remaining growth potential and its need to move up the value-added chain, not to mention its reserves. As Hu Jintao recognised at the weekend, the crisis is a major political challenging for the regime, testing the Communist party&apos;s ability to govern, as he admitted to the Politburo. The scale of the policy response so far, with more to come in the months ahead, shows how concerned he and his colleagues are with the outlook for the economy and social stability. But Beijing should be encouraged to look beyond its own immediate concerns. Establishing an economic dialogue that gets away from the Bush administration&apos;s ritual calls for yuan appreciation should be high on the agenda for Barack Obama after his inauguration, and should be a much higher priority for the EU. China is not going to bail out the world. Even if it wanted to take on such a role, it could not do so while simultaneously pumping new life into its own economy after a year of shocks that have seen it confronted by the big freeze of January-February, Tibet, the Sichuan earthquake, floods and now the drooping economic data. The increasingly consensual leadership in Beijing has survived all that, and gained reflected glory from the Olympics, but the external crisis faces it with a fresh string of problems, particularly overmodernising industry and maintaining employment and stability, to add to the laundry list of faultlines bred over the past 30 years \u2013 not to mention the basic question of what the Communist party now stands for. Hu and Obama could hardly be more different \u2013 one a careful bureaucrat who has risen through the enclosed Communist party machine and who has to balance factions in the Politburo, the other a charismatic popular politician who has ploughed his own path to the top. There is no shortage of Chinese obstacles which clash with the idealistic streak in Obama&apos;s message \u2013 human rights, freedom of expression, Tibet and Xinjiang, lack of the rule of law, corruption, safety standards to name a few. But the need is patent for Sino-US relations to move above the housekeeping issues that dominate their regular meetings (the latest of which is now taking place in Beijing with the currency squabble back on the table).  Hu Jintao may not strike one as a man of vision but the challenge the regime faces is such that even he might raise his game if approached with a chance to establish his historic position by bringing China out of the crisis in stronger shape.  China and the US already rely on one another to a degree rarely seen, with Beijing having no alternative but to amass dollars if it wants to maintain its trading surplus and Washington looking to China to finance its rescue packages with cheap credit. If the new president really does wish to embrace change, he should go beyond domestic issues and try to forge a new international financial and economic order.  The most promising route does not lie through interminable G7, G8, G20 and IMF meetings, but in closer connected bilateral to quadrilateral diplomacy among the biggest players to confront the world with a new system born from mutual need. That process should start after the inauguration between the odd couple in the White House and Beijing.", "tags": ["China", "US news", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economic policy", "US economic growth and recession", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-12-04T19:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/05/dubai-recession-developers-jumeirah-gardens", "sentences": ["In six years of an oil-fuelled property boom, Dubai - the second largest member of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - has earned the distinction of having 25% of all the cranes on earth and more buildings under construction than Shanghai."], "title": "Downturn hits Dubai's building bonanza", "article": "Dubai&apos;s multibillion-dollar building boom is grinding to a halt, with some of the Gulf emirate&apos;s most ambitious construction projects put under review as the global economic crisis hits home. Meraas, a government-owned developer, confirmed yesterday that it was looking again at the pace of its flagship $95bn (\u00a364bn) Jumeirah Gardens project in the light of the worldwide downturn.  The massive Dubailand hotel and leisure project, costed at $88bn, is also being reassessed, Khalid al-Malik, the chief executive of developer Tatweer, told the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi. Analysts say falling oil prices and the rising cost of financing construction has forced Gulf developers to take stock, with Dubai forming a high-level government committee to prioritise projects. Dubai was brazenly defying the credit crunch and plunging stock markets when the 12-year Jumeirah Gardens project was launched in October. The plans involved razing an entire district to make way for office and residential towers, a green area half the size of New York&apos;s Central Park and a canal system linked to the Arabian gulf. Meraas&apos;s original announcement of the project came hot on the heels of a plan by fellow state-owned developer Nakheel to build the world&apos;s tallest tower - more than 1km (3,280ft) high. In six years of an oil-fuelled property boom, Dubai - the second largest member of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - has earned the distinction of having 25% of all the cranes on earth and more buildings under construction than Shanghai. But Dubai&apos;s stock market has lost close to 70% of its value since the summer. Two of the UAE&apos;s largest mortgage firms, Amlak Finance and Tamweel, were nationalised last week. &quot;The bubble hasn&apos;t yet burst,&quot; said Christopher Davidson, a Gulf expert at Durham University. &quot;Dubai&apos;s free zones, real estate and tourism are all highly susceptible to a global downturn. Real estate is the flagship and if confidence has been knocked, which it clearly has been, it&apos;s in trouble. Now the confidence has gone, credit worthiness has taken a knock.&quot; Nakheel, the developer of man-made palm tree-shaped islands on which celebrities such as David Beckham have bought homes, announced earlier this week that it had cut 500 jobs -15% of its workforce - and was scaling back projects.  Though thousands of expatriate professionals are expected to lose their jobs, Dubai&apos;s optimism may not be entirely misplaced.

In conversations with co-workers, editors, photographers and sources, at meetings, on the phone, during interviews and in everyday conversation, I used the name Bombay. This didn&apos;t require any great mental dexterity on my part: it was the way things were and, as with so many other binaries that are a part of this staggering metropolis, I dealt with it and got on with life. My editor strove for accurate listings and reportage. Mumbai is the official name. Mumbai is the name we used. Emotions be damned.  But unlike Bombay, Mumbai meant nothing to any of us. This great city by the sea was built by the British and its original Portuguese name, Bom Bahia, or &quot;good bay&quot;, was bastardised, like so many other Indian names, for the sake of linguistic convenience. Bombay, even to those who have not studied its history, means a number of things. To the world, it meant a great oriental city, an exotic metropolis teeming with humanity and bazaars and spices and wonder. To Indians, Bombay meant a land of plenty and of equality, where anyone with determination could make it, where class and caste differences ceased to matter, or at least so goes the fairy tale. To residents of the city itself, Bombay was at once the best and worst that India had to offer and of, among many other things, the Taj and Oberoi hotels.  Bombay was &quot;discovered&quot; by the Portuguese in the early 16th century, ceded in dowry to the English in 1661, and transformed into a thriving metropolis over the next 300 years by the East India Company, the Crown, Parsi, Gujarati and Jewish businessmen, mills, movies and money. Mumbai always existed alongside Bombay in the language of the native Gujarati traders and Marathi fisherfolk. As did Bambai in the national language of India, Hindi. The three co-existed peacefully until 1995, when Bombay was abolished by the Shiv Sena, a right-wing Hindu nationalist party. The renaming was ostensibly to shed a colonial identity and embrace one that was wholly Indian. Except that it wasn&apos;t.  The Shiv Sena, and Mumbai, stand for Marathi pride and a denial of the diversity that is India. Mumbai is the capital of the state of Maharashtra, which, along with Gujarat, came into existence when Bombay state was divided along linguistic lines in 1960. A bloody business, the protests that led to the birth of two new states killed 105 people who are now commemorated at Hutatma Chowk, or Martyrs&apos; Square, but which is still known to locals as Flora Fountain, for the ornate showpiece erected there in 1864. As with the name, so with the city: dozens of neighbourhoods and streets across Bombay have two names. There are the names on maps, and those used by locals.  Bombay, the word itself, the sound of it, the sight of it, held a certain resonance for anyone who was fortunate enough to encounter it. &quot;Mumbai&quot;, which was foisted on to a reluctant public a little over a decade ago, holds no such appeal. For better or worse, Bombay was like Cairo, Calcutta, Manila, Shanghai, Peking, Esfahan, Casablanca, Beirut (before the war), Baghdad (before Saddam), Tehran (before 1979), Kandahar (before December 1999), Peshawar (before 2001), Basra (before 2003), or Rangoon (before the junta). It was a word that, regardless of whether you knew a single thing about it, ignited the imagination, provoked visions of exoticism, sounded like the sort of place that, perhaps because you knew nothing about it, would be romantic, colourful, outlandish. These cities need not even mean the same things to different people: as with music, the interpretation of these sounds \u2013 Kabul, Lahore \u2013 is up to the individual. But they share a common root in the language of adventure.  Mumbai, to its residents, is still Bombay. To Indians, it is emblematic of nativist chauvinism, a word that opened the floodgates to other such words: Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru. To the world, it was, at best, a symbol of the rise of a New India (words which signify an apathetic, consumerist middle class as much as a rising economy) or at worst, nothing at all. Until last week. Now, like Beirut, Mumbai is a word with global resonance. One that will for ever be linked with suffering and loss, with danger and anarchy, with government failure and state ineptitude. You don&apos;t need to know anything about the Lebanese civil war to know that Beirut bespeaks great tragedy. Soon, memories will fade and the exact events of the last days of November 2008 will be forgotten in the collective consciousness.

The Rocket has described the tournament that starts in Telford tomorrow as &quot;one of the events I target at the start of the season&quot;. And yet, in this week&apos;s BBC programme Inside Sport, the 33-year-old declared he has not &quot;got the drive&quot; to dominate the sport as Stephen Hendry once did. Deciphering O&apos;Sullivan has been the bane of snooker punters&apos; lives since he won the UK title in 1993 at the age of 17. Bookmakers know they will take a steady stream of bets - at any price - on the current world champion, bolstered by the knowledge that he might throw in the towel at any moment as he did in 2006 at this tournament, when he walked out of a quarter-final at 4-1 down. Should the demons stay away, you might not find a better 11-4 shot (Stan James) throughout the whole of next year. Extrabet offer just 9-4 after taking a \u00a33,000 bet. The longer format - best-of-17-frames until the final which is best-of-19 - tends to favour O&apos;Sullivan, who will be looking for a fifth UK crown.  His success last season was his first ranking event win for three years and he subsequently landed the world championship at the Crucible in May and the Northern Ireland Trophy. Still, surprise defeats to Ricky Walden in the Shanghai Masters and Judd Trump in the Royal London Watches Grand Prix have removed any suggestion of an aura of invincibility. O&apos;Sullivan is, however, the most likely winner, and he looks to have a decent draw in the first quarter. Sky Bet offers 10-11 that he wins this quarter but there are better outright bets on offer. The world No1 is also the 7-2 (Paddy Power and Sky Bet) market leader to record the highest break of the tournament, as he did last year.  Mark Selby is the 7-1 (Ladbrokes and Sky Bet) second favourite. Denied by O&apos;Sullivan in the semi-final last year after giving the eventual winner his toughest match of the week in losing 9-8, Selby also lost to him in the final of the Premier League last weekend. However, that is no real barometer of form as the 25-seconds-per-shot rule is unique to that. The fact that Selby, who won last season&apos;s Masters and Welsh Open, rattled in three consecutive century breaks against Hendry in the semi-final bodes well for backers. Selby is 17-10 to win the second quarter with Extrabet, which is fair, but a potentially more profitable punt might be to buy him at 17 on Sporting Index&apos;s outright index which awards 60 points to the tournament winner, 40 to the runner-up, 20 to the losing semi-finalists, 10 to the losing quarter-finalists and five to the second-round losers. Selby is 4-9 (Sky Bet) to defeat Mark Williams in the first round. Should he win, a meeting with either the out-of-form Ken Doherty or Graeme Dott awaits. Then it is likely to be Ali Carter or Peter Ebdon, against both of whom he will be odds-on to beat. Buyers at 17 will be in profit as long as he makes the semi-final and, should O&apos;Sullivan be knocked out early, Selby will by then be favourite to take the title.  Shaun Murphy is the favourite to win the third quarter at 10-3 (Sportingbet and Victor Chandler), but he is easily dismissed given his awful form and personal problems. Trump, though, looks terrific value at 5-1 (Sky Bet) to win this section.  The teenager&apos;s win over O&apos;Sullivan in Glasgow proves he is coming of age, as does his recent Masters qualifying tournament success. Trump has already proved popular with IG Sport, which has reported a \u00a3300 buyer at 14 on its win index.  Stephen Maguire, Ding Junhui and John Higgins, who are third (9-1, general), fourth (12-1, general) and fifth (14-1, general) favourites respectively in the outright market all feature in the competitive bottom quarter of the draw. Also in that section is the recent Bahrain Championship winner, Neil Robertson, who looks a fair bet at 6-5 (Blue Square) to win his first-round match against Michael Holt giving away 2.5 frames on the handicap. Selections Neil Robertson to defeat Michael Holt giving away a 2.5 frame start at 6-5 (Blue Square); Judd Trump to win the third quarter at 5-1 (Sky Bet) Money watch Three of the four English clubs may have already qualified for the knockout stage of the Champions League, but that did not stop punters getting involved in the midweek European action. One Sky Bet punter gambled \u00a321,000 at 1-14 (to win \u00a31,500) on Manchester United to beat Aalborg after they had taken an early lead against the Danish team. However, Aalborg duly scuppered the punt by holding the English champions. Paddy Power also saw bets of \u00a37,500 and two \u00a35,000 punts on United. After Ars\u00e8ne Wenger named a weakened team for Arsenal&apos;s match at Porto there was a flurry of bets for the Portuguese champions. These included one at \u00a35,000 and a number of \u00a32,000 wagers with William Hill, plus several \u00a32,000 punts with Extrabet and Paddy Power. IG Sport saw a \u00a35,000 buyer of Porto&apos;s supremacy at 0.5, which won him \u00a37,500. Chelsea came through for bettors, with Paddy Power standing bets of \u00a330,000, \u00a312,000 and \u00a39,000 at 1-6 to win, while Luiz Felipe Scolari&apos;s team were the subject of a \u00a35,000 double with Roma to beat Bordeaux with Sky Bet.", "tags": ["Snooker", "Ronnie O'Sullivan", "Sport", "Sport betting", "Mark Selby"], "publicationDate": "2008-12-12T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/dec/12/coldplay-digitalmedia", "sentences": ["4 Shanghai Lady Drives Off With Tow TruckIf you liked the traffic warden scene in Lock Stock, you&apos;ll love this."], "title": "Guardian Viral Video Chart", "article": "Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has been forced to defend his &quot;self-penned&quot; song Viva La Vida as he comes under fire from guitarist Joe Satriani - who accused the singer of lifting the instrumentals from his 2004 hit If I Could Fly.

Not content with sending a tidal wave crashing over Manhattan in The Day After Tomorrow or allowing aliens to destroy the White House in Independence Day, Emmerich, in his new film 2012, is gearing up to unleash volcanic eruptions, huge cracks in the surface of the earth, enormous typhoons \u2013 and more floods. If you can&apos;t wait for that, today sees the release of a remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, in which alien spheres suddenly turn up all over the world \u2013 including one in Central Park \u2013 heralding an attack on the planet that only Keanu Reeves can prevent. Any of this sound at all familiar? Allow me to refresh your memory with this 10-point guide to the perfect disaster movie. 1. Pick a good disaster A lot of the best disasters \u2013 asteroids, aliens, earthquakes, tsunamis \u2013 have already been taken, sometimes twice, as in the embarrassing simultaneous releases of Armageddon/Deep Impact and Volcano/Dante&apos;s Peak. So you&apos;ll have to be a bit creative. Pick something unusual: what if gravity started going sideways instead of straight down, say?  Your opening scene should show life seemingly going on as normal \u2013 think of Will Smith going out to get a paper at the start of Independence Day. Your lead character should get up one morning, rumpling his hair and yawning, and head for the bathroom to clean his teeth. He turns on the tap, oblivious to the first signs of disaster about to strike. Gradually the stream of water begins to veer towards him. The soapdish suddenly tips off the shelf and crashes to the floor, and he starts to lose his balance. He falls flat against the bathroom wall, water streaming over him from the tap. Shaking his head, he pulls a small bottle of whiskey out of his dressing gown pocket and looks at it disapprovingly. 2. You need a scientist A scientist or professor of some kind \u2013 middle-aged, handsome \u2013 is crucial to a good disaster movie. We should first see him hard at work in the lab or out on a mission (perhaps briefly wearing glasses), as he starts to get the first inkling of what&apos;s going wrong. Perhaps some animals in a zoo have been spooked by unusual weather, or a car has been blown down a motorway upside down for no apparent reason. Baffled, he takes his findings to an older mentor, who adds a fact of his own: enormous wasps three times their usual size have been appearing all over the Arctic, say. It&apos;s the missing piece of the puzzle. &quot;You&apos;ve got to take this to the president,&quot; the mentor tells him. 3. You need a hero This is not the scientist. The hero has to be a bit more down to earth, a bit of a rough diamond. Flawed but noble \u2013 like Bruce Willis in Armageddon. A guilt-ridden cat burglar with an adopted, terminally ill orphan son would be perfect. 4. Send your scientist to the White House A quick meeting with the president of the United States seems to be the first stop for all worried scientists in disaster movies. But don&apos;t make it too easy. A sceptical and slightly sinister vice-president or secretary of state should stop him at the door to the Oval Office. He doesn&apos;t want to listen to any of this mumbo-jumbo about sideways gravity. &quot;But this might be our only chance to save the world!&quot; the scientist tells him. &quot;Listen, Professor, you go back to your theories,&quot; sneers the veep, &quot;and leave saving the world to us.&quot; 5. Mayhem across the globe Now it&apos;s time for you to up the stakes and sacrifice a couple of foreign cities \u2013 or even a minor American one like Chicago (you&apos;re keeping New York and LA back for later, of course). London or Rome would be perfect. Shanghai or Tokyo are great, too. In his lab, the scientist turns on the TV news (preferably a branded channel affiliated with the film studio) to see foreign buildings crashing down into the streets. Reporters jabber to camera and slide helplessly down the middle of the road. &quot;It&apos;s started,&quot; murmurs the scientist. 6. Mayhem in New York As the scientist tries to alert an unbelieving public, things should really get serious: it&apos;s time to hit New York. In a flurry of special effects, the city should spectacularly fall over to one side as the effects of the disaster take hold, with various New York archetypes such as hip students and phlegmatic waitresses thrown across the streets while yellow cabs flip over and roll into the sides of skyscrapers and water towers fly off roofs and burst against fire escapes. It is crucial at this point to destroy an iconic building in a breathtaking scene you can feature in the trailer. A lot of New York&apos;s most famous buildings have been used before, however \u2013 some more than once \u2013 but how about the Guggenheim museum? You could have it flip on to its side and roll all the way down Fifth Avenue like a wagon wheel. 7. Back to the White House All this is enough to convince the president that the scientist is right, so he calls him back for a top-secret briefing in the White House situation room attended by dozens of worried-looking army chiefs. The scientist explains what is happening with a mixture of junior-school astronomy and outrageous psuedo-science, using whatever items are to hand, perhaps a ping-pong ball to represent the earth and a basketball to represent the sun. At this point it&apos;s the scientist&apos;s role to set out the plot in full. &quot;You&apos;re aware of gravity, right? If you drop something, it lands on the floor, instead of floating in the air. Like this.&quot; He drops an apple on the ground. &quot;Now, this meteor that hit the sun was powerful enough to switch earth&apos;s gravity in a different direction. In England, in Tokyo, and now in New York City, gravity&apos;s stopped going downwards \u2013 and started going sideways.&quot; As the vice-president protests, the scientist continues: &quot;As that meteor continues its journey into the heart of the sun, the whole of the earth will switch to horizontal gravity.&quot;  8. The scientist puts together his team In a cave underneath Mount Rushmore, the president should introduce the scientist to a crack team dedicated to fixing the problem \u2013 which should turn out to include his attractive ex-wife as well as a droll Englishman. The three of them should come up with a plan to stop the disaster \u2013 the more unrealistic the better. A good one in this case would be to have someone jump off the Empire State Building like a diving board in order to activate a nuclear weapon that would destroy the moon and thus reset earth&apos;s gravity; anything like that, really. Watching a cable news channel as they discuss who could carry out this dangerous mission, the team sees a report from the devastated New York, where the cat burglar is leaping across sideways skyscrapers to save an old grandmother&apos;s life. &quot;By Jove,&quot; says the Englishman, &quot;I think we&apos;ve found our man!&quot; The celebratory mood should be punctured by a brief phone call to the scientist from the head of the army with the upsetting news that &quot;we lost Canada&quot;. 9. Last-minute setback By now more and more parts of the world should have succumbed to the threat, and, after recalculating his figures for some reason, the scientist should report that there is a much smaller window of time than he thought to stop the sideways gravity before it destroys the whole globe. But while building the nuclear weapon to destroy the moon, something goes wrong, killing the hapless Englishman and damaging the weapon so that whoever sets it off will die with it. This should cause a huge row, with the cat burglar refusing to go through with the plan. A sentimental speech from either the scientist or his ex-wife will be enough to convince him, however, and he manfully agrees to sacrifice himself. Just before he sets off for New York, his little orphan son taps him on the shoulder, and whispers: &quot;Mommy would want you to do this, Dad.&quot; The cat burglar puts his hand on the boy&apos;s head, and says: &quot;I know, son.&quot; 10. Set-piece ending All that remains now is to put the plan into action. The cat burglar clambers precariously along the Empire State Building, almost falling at least twice, and prepares for the dive of his life from the tip of the spire. The scientist and his ex-wife share a meaningful glance. A group of minor characters toast the end of civilisation with one last drink. Crowds gather in Times Square and other locations around the world to watch what&apos;s about to happen. In the Oval Office, a sombre president murmurs: &quot;May God help us all.&quot; The cat burglar dives. The scene cuts to outer space as the moon is destroyed. The sun tilts back on its axis, and back on earth gravity swings gradually back to its normal direction. Buildings right themselves and stand up straight again. Foreigners in turbans or Eskimo furs cheer and hug in far-off locations. The scientist reaches out for the hand of his ex-wife. And the little orphan boy runs up to his cat burglar dad for a dramatic hug, the Empire State Building back to normal behind them. He didn&apos;t die after all!", "tags": ["Science fiction and fantasy", "Film", "Culture", "Roland Emmerich", "The Day the Earth Stood Still"], "publicationDate": "2008-12-12T11:14:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/12/human-rights-liu-xiaobo", "sentences": ["A couple of days ago, police in Shanghai detained Liu Xiaobo, an intellectual and human rights activist, who had been in and out of prison in the last two decades because of his activism."], "title": "Ran Yunfei: China must free Liu Xiaobo, an author of the historic '08 Charter for constitutional reform", "article": "The 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights witnesses more human rights violations in China. A couple of days ago, police in Shanghai detained Liu Xiaobo, an intellectual and human rights activist, who had been in and out of prison in the last two decades because of his activism. The reason this time is the &apos;08 Charter, a document calling for constitutional reform in China, initiated by Liu Xiaobo and his colleagues, and signed by more than 300 people, including me. Hearing the news, I felt not only angry, but also pity towards the authorities whose fierce reaction can&apos;t disguise the fear underneath. One will always claim and protect one&apos;s rights. No authority can stop that. As ordinary people, we just want to live a normal and peaceful life. But we want to live it with dignity. The coming economic crisis has made many people more alert to their rights, or lack of them. In China, the current crisis is not only the consequence of a global economic crisis, but also the result of a corrupt and authoritarian one-party system. Many people live a hard life not because of the downturn of the world economy, but because their rights have been taken away by the authorities. I know many intellectuals like Liu Xiabo who champion a peaceful and non-violence approach to achieve political reform. However, others may not be so patient. There have already been numerous instances of social unrest in China recently. To make things worse, the authorities seem to know only one response: to suppress any incident, which inevitably worsens the crisis. This critical social situation is the circumstance under which Liu Xiaobo and his colleagues produced the &apos;08 Charter. It is moderate, reasonable, pragmatic, dedicated to reaching reconciliation after revealing the truth. People&apos;s rights and society&apos;s interests are at its heart. It is not perfect. But among all the documents I have ever signed, it is the most important one.  For the last century, Chinese people have sacrificed life and blood in the hope of achieving a constitutional republic. What we eventually got was more brutal rule. We can&apos;t blame it all on tradition or culture. It also has something to do with the shortsightedness of many people, who ignored the bottom line to chase immediate gains, and sacrificed the future for short-term compromises. We understand that we have to compromise, which is part of democracy, but we must insist upon certain principles, such as respect for human beings and protection of basic rights. The &apos;08 Charter is a non-partisan document. Efforts were made to reach a compromise. Our aim is to save, not to destroy, the society we are in \u2013 a society that is highly volatile, increasingly divided and threatened by deepening economic crisis. But the authorities, who are so used to controlling society using inflexible and violent means, won&apos;t even tolerate the existence of a document that calls for sensible, moderate, pragmatic approaches. Arresting Liu Xiaobo and interrogating many other signatories shows that the authorities are now descending to the threat of violence. Such a threat will only ignite more resistance.  I am calling on the Chinese authorities to recognise the will of the people, to gradually implement political reforms, to give hope back to the people. We know hope will give people extraordinary motivation to live their life and to change their behavior. A community with no hope will only release destructive energy. People within the establishment can&apos;t detach themselves if the communities around them collapse. In other words, if the authorities fail to protect people&apos;s rights, they won&apos;t be able to protect themselves later on. Some may believe money and power can save them. They can&apos;t. Chinese people still don&apos;t have the human rights they deserve. For 60 years, people of this land have been waiting for the day of freedom and democracy. In the last 20 years, people like Liu Xiaobo have fought for human rights on our behalf. Today in China, when we enjoy some freedom and rights, we shouldn&apos;t forget what people like him have done for us. I urge the authorities to release Liu Xiaobo as soon as possible. I also call on the government to start to reform the political system so that it can effectively protect people&apos;s rights.

While O&apos;Sullivan will never be a human automaton in the mould of Steve Davis, circa the 1980s, he has rarely exhibited greater self-control than of late and, in winning the opening six frames, his disciplined approach could not be faulted.

Poor figures from BNP Paribas - partly due to its exposure to New York financier Bernard Madoff&apos;s alleged $50bn fraud - and higher than expected quarterly losses from Morgan Stanley reminded investors that the scars of the credit crunch are nowhere near being healed.

Miners moved higher after the US rate cut, with Lonmin up 46p to 728.5p and BHP Billiton 65p better at \u00a312.98. Anglo American added 85p to \u00a316.50 even though it announced a halving of capital expenditure next year to $4.5bn. Rio Tinto rose 57p to \u00a315.58 despite the company deciding not to invest in a $20bn Saudi project. UK banks were among the major losers, with HSBC down 43p at 672p on continuing cash call worries. Lloyds TSB lost 2.8p to 125.2p as analysts at Deutsche Bank reduced their recommendation from hold to sell and their target price from 180p to 110p, ahead of the completion of the takeover of HBOS, down 4.1p at 67.8p.

UBS said:  &quot;We are downgrading Admiral from buy to neutral given the strong relative performance (up 30% versus the FTSE All share).

Rival Barratt Developments climbed 4.25p to 66.5p as it sold another \u00a346m of industrial land and buildings from its Wilson Bowden Developments business. Rentokil Initial, the ratcatcher, parcels and tropical plant hire group which last month reported a 72% fall in third quarter profits, rose 1.5p to 40p after a positive note from Merrill Lynch. After a meeting on Tuesday night with the company&apos;s chief executive Alan Brown, Merrill said:  &quot;This remains a slow burn restructuring, where cost reduction and service improvements in parcels should drive some recovery in earnings per share in 2009, and there is longer term potential to improve returns, which are around 50% below potential. We think that the shares could more than double from here. &quot;Management appeared very relaxed on the balance sheet - &apos;no contemplation of a rights issue ... debt to fall from here.&apos; The indication of \u00a3200m capital expenditure for 2009 suggests that there is no pressure to take further aggressive action to improve cash flow.

Some reactions I&apos;ve had to columns I recently wrote from China indicate a large potential for misunderstanding, especially among Chinese readers, so let me make the argument plain. Start at a possible bad end. When great powers rise and fall, there&apos;s an increased danger of war - not today or tomorrow, but in a timescale of decades. That proposition does not imply any judgment on Chinese culture or national character. It merely reflects a recurrent pattern of history, seen across thousands of years in many different regions and cultures. The war may not be started by the ascendant power. It may be started by the declining power, with defensive aggression. It may even be against someone else. (The hegemonic transfer from Britain to the US came as both were fighting Nazi Germany.) There is nothing remotely original or offensive in this line of thought. The very notion of &quot;peaceful rise&quot;, launched by a leading Communist party thinker a few years ago, was predicated on the same insight: that, historically, nations&apos; rises have often not been peaceful. (The preferred official term may now be &quot;peaceful development&quot;, but &quot;peaceful rise&quot; is analytically much sharper.) So that&apos;s the long-term risk: war. But the long-term opportunity is equally large: imagine one-fifth of humankind organised in a single modern, prosperous state, playing a constructive part in a co-operative international system and tackling trans- national challenges, such as global warming, which threaten us all. So the stakes are huge, either way. Now let&apos;s be clear on one thing. What China does, whether it goes on rising and if so, how, is mainly up to the Chinese: legally, since theirs is a sovereign state; morally, since peoples have a right to shape their own destinies; but also practically, since the capacity of anyone else to influence the evolution of such a large, self-referential country is limited. Limited, but far from nil. This is not the 17th century. The prospects for the Chinese economy in 2009 depend directly on what happens in the American and European markets for Chinese exports. So we who are not Chinese have not just a stake, but also a hand in this story.  I have therefore come up with this shortlist of four keys to China&apos;s peaceful rise, attaching to each point a rough guesstimate of the division of responsibility (DoR) between us. In the confines of a column, my list is necessarily selective and of telegraphic brevity. I offer it with the health warning that on this subject I depend heavily on the expertise of others, and on Chinese voices interpreted or self-translated into English. Since, however, those experts and Chinese voices profoundly disagree among themselves, we outsiders still have to make up our own minds. Anyway, to stir debate, here are my four keys to China&apos;s peaceful rise. I welcome all responses, however critical, from those who are experts on China or, better still, are Chinese themselves. 1. Domestic Evolution (DoR: China, 90%; Rest of World, 10%) Surely the biggest single key. What&apos;s so interesting about talking to Chinese scholars, journalists and officials is their shared sense that the Chinese system is on a long, exciting journey to an unknown destination. After 30 years of incremental economic reform, they look forward to 30 years of incremental political reform. The rule of law, improved governance and elements of democracy (though not full-dress western-style liberal democracy) are all mentioned as part of the mix. The diversity of provinces and cities - as well as Hong Kong and, indirectly, even Taiwan - gives the chance for experimentation. Unlike in the United States or Britain, the expectation is that in 30 years&apos; time the political system will be qualitatively different from what it is today. Nobody knows what it will be.  I suggest that those of us in the rest of the world who believe in the virtues of liberal democracy should respond roughly thus: &quot;We wish you all good fortune on this journey. If you feel you can take something useful from our experience - the technology transfer of governance, so to speak - we will be delighted. We think you will find in the end that liberal democracy is the best way to run a country, but we welcome this ideological competition. If you can come up with a different system that durably satisfies the aspirations of your people, we shall greet it with fascination and respect. If not, we too will suffer the negative consequences.&quot; 2. The US-China Special Relationship  (DoR: US, 65%; China, 35%) In recent months, I argued in both China and the United States that the EU-China relationship should be strengthened to match the US-China one. In both countries I came away with a flea in my ear. Both sides clearly believe their relationship is unique. Very well then: over to you guys.  The larger responsibility must lie with the currently more powerful state. The Obama administration should make an offer of strategic partnership to Beijing, starting with issues such as climate change and nuclear proliferation. For its part, China needs to step beyond its current paradigm, which is (I parody slightly): &quot;What matters to us in the world is what&apos;s good for our domestic development, and what&apos;s good for our domestic development will be good for the world.&quot; 3. From G8 to G14  (DoR: the west, 70%; China, 30%) Tempting though it may be to some Chinese - &quot;How about G2?&quot; one scholar teased me in Shanghai - it&apos;s obvious that Sino-American dyarchy can&apos;t work on its own. The decision to go from G8 to G14 (or thereabouts) should be made already by the G8 summit in Italy in 2009. But &quot;G8 to G14&quot; is also shorthand for other ways in which China has to be given a larger role in the structures of global governance, including global financial institutions.  There&apos;s a trade-off here. Parodying slightly again, one could say that the west wants China to take more responsibility without giving it more power, while China wants more power without taking more responsibility. We&apos;ll have to meet somewhere in the middle. 4. Deep cultural and social engagement  (DoR: 50-50) The peaceful power shift from Britain to the United States was facilitated by the fact that they were culturally about as close as it is possible for two different countries to be. Brits and Americans speak the same language, more or less. America and China - the west altogether and China - are culturally very different. They don&apos;t speak the same language.  Mutual understanding requires a correspondingly greater effort. China is using some of its foreign currency reserves to send its students to American and British universities; we should be using our resources to welcome them here, and send more of our own students there with the necessary language training. Our newspapers should report China in as much detail as we do the United States. We should encourage people-to-people exchanges on a massive scale, and use the potential of the internet. For a meeting of minds, the best thing of all is still a personal meeting - but these days, we don&apos;t need to meet to get talking. timothygartonash.com", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-12-18T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/18/barclays-sponsorship-premier-league", "sentences": ["The tournament will move from Shanghai to London in 2009."], "title": "Premier League: Barclays announce sponsorship review that could hit English elite", "article": "The Premier League may be in need of a new sponsor in 2010 after Barclays bank announced a review of its worldwide sports deals.

Now Beijing is to cement its love of musicals by building &quot;China&apos;s new Broadway&quot;, a complex of 32 theatres to rival those of New York and London. The Beijing Daily newspaper announced yesterday that the city&apos;s sprawling northwest suburb of Haidian - home to schools and universities, as well as the prestigious hi-tech industrial park of Zhongguancun - is to demolish another chunk of ageing tenements over the next six months to make room for the complex, which will include a flagship theatre with a capacity of 2,000, and another 31 venues of various shapes, styles and sizes capable of holding between 300 and 500 people. The complex will become &quot;a Chinese Broadway base for composers, writers, performers and actors in training,&quot; said a spokesman for the developer. In recent years, Beijing has had the opportunity to taste lavish productions by the Royal Shakespeare Company, as well as painstaking translations of Chekhov, but the new theatre complex appears to be aiming for the more profitable middle-brow audience. The Sound of Music has been popular in the capital for decades, and more recently, shows by Andrew Lloyd Webber have been drawing big crowds in both Beijing and Shanghai. There are already plenty of western producers keen to play a part in China&apos;s cultural development, and claim a share in the gate receipts that might accompany it.  British impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh - the producer of Lloyd Webber&apos;s Cats as well as the West End blockbusters Les Mis\u00e9rables and Miss Saigon - signed an agreement with the China Arts and Entertainment Group last year to bring his musicals to China. And the Beijing Shibo Group has entered into a separate agreement with Broadway company Nederlander to bring popular American musicals to China. Nederlander, has already showed its willingness to cross the cultural divide by staging a translated production of the hit show Fame, in collaboration with local partners. Beijing Shibo said it is planning to stage as many as 100 musicals at the new facilities, once construction is completed. But in an editorial in the culture section of the People&apos;s Daily, the official journal of the Chinese Communist party, there was some lament over the end of an era. In Beijing&apos;s theatrical heyday, venues were spread throughout the suburbs and were designed to bring enjoyment to the masses in a convenient way. &quot;In those days, residents living near the theatre either had to only walk a small distance or could even stay in their own street to watch a show. The theatres were built right next to their home,&quot; the People&apos;s Daily wrote. Beijing, which is traditionally seen as China&apos;s cultural centre, had a vast amount of small theatres buried in a maze of alleys and lanes. But town planners, zealously trying to turn the capital into a modern, efficient and cosmopolitan city, have consigned most of them to history. Developers of the new complex will be hoping the local appetite for foreign musicals continues to thrive. In the two decades that followed the revolution in 1949, China&apos;s theatre groups were only permitted to stage government-approved plays written by the likes of Ibsen and Chekhov. But by 1968, thousands of local actors were exiled to the countryside by Jiang Qing, wife of the communist leader Mao Zedong, who sought to promote her own corpus of eight &quot;socially improving&quot; works. Times have changed, and the propaganda dramas of the 1960s and 1970s have given way to feel-good western productions. The developers of the new theatre complex - the Beijing Shibo Group and the Oriental Broadway Company - will be hoping that the local appetite for foreign musicals continues to thrive.

Some strange men were standing on the doorstep. &quot;I&apos;d never seen anything like these huge armed men in flak jackets. They were scary. My father was worried they were going to kill us.&quot; The men turned out to be bodyguards for a Fox News crew, come to interview Ali and the other four members of his band UTN1. Fox News weren&apos;t the first or last western journalists to visit. During 2003, wave after wave of advancing media troops from Britain and the US fell on UTN1, each one withdrawing in triumph with the same putatively sweet story. In the middle of the unremitting bleakness of war, here was comforting, upbeat news about five cute guys who, inspired by Boyzone and Westlife, had firmed their abs, modulated their harmonies and followed a career path comprehensible to us in the west: they had formed a boy band.  It was an irresistible story. UTN1 wore singlets - like Take That! They pouted broodingly for the cameras - like Ronan Keating! They sang in English and wore Converse! They crooned about peace, rather than detonating themselves at army checkpoints! Better yet, somehow these plucky guys had managed to imbibe western popular culture (meaning the Spice Girls, Boys to Men and, just possibly, Blue). They were a multicultural melange of Muslims and Christians, Sunnis and Shias - thus pointing the way to the fine democratic future that Bush and Blair said Iraq would enjoy as soon as the west had won. In a marvellous piece of cultural imperialism, the west wrote up these five men - Shant Garabedian (30), Akhlad Raof (28), Artin Haroutiounian (31), Hassan Ali (26) and Nadeem Hamid (26) - as Iraq&apos;s only boy band, and a symbol of the country&apos;s bright post-war future.  The story suggested Iraqis wanted to be like us; and, more, that our invasion was to liberate people like us from people - devils, really - who weren&apos;t.  Iraqi culture thus apparently consisted of citadels of western-facing music and art in an otherwise toxic wasteland. Iraq had one boy band. It also had just one heavy metal band, we learned, called Acrassicauda, who had a similar tale of battling Saddam&apos;s censorship to hear the inspirational tones of Metallica and Napalm Death. If only western journalists had dug deeper, they might have found Eminem&apos;s spiritual brother in Mosul, Iraq&apos;s answer to Tracey Emin in Basra and an underground network of Harry Potter nuts extending from Kurdistan to the Gulf.  Only one problem with UTN1&apos;s story as it appeared in the west. It wasn&apos;t true. &quot;We weren&apos;t a boy band,&quot; says Hassan, who is UTN1&apos;s guitarist and singer. &quot;That was just a handle for the western media.&quot;  &quot;We formed just before the millennium,&quot; recalls keyboardist Haroutiounian. &quot;We wanted to do something unique in the Arab-speaking world: writing and performing our own songs in English.&quot; Their ambitions were written into the band&apos;s name: UTN1 stands for Unknown to No One. &quot;We were very influenced by Boyzone and Westlife. I was fascinated by the Spice Girls.&quot;  Why, for the love of Mel C, why? &quot; We liked the harmonies of singing together in these groups. Each singer had a different line,&quot; says Garabedian. &quot;In Arabic music there is no such harmonising group singing; it&apos;s usually just one vocalist. We really wanted to do what they did, but with our twist. Yes, we were inspired by western pop music, but that was never all we were.&quot; How did UTN1 feel about being made into poster boys for the liberation of Iraq? &quot;The media interest was an opportunity for us at the precise moment when there were no other opportunities for us as musicians and the future for musicians in Baghdad looked - as it has indeed proved to be - very bleak,&quot; says Hamid. &quot;We didn&apos;t see ourselves as poster boys: we saw ourselves as musicians struggling to carry on our careers in very difficult circumstances.&quot; But the band had previous in pursuing dubious-seeming opportunities. They once wrote a song celebrating Saddam Hussein&apos;s birthday; it was commissioned by a radio station run by his son Uday. It&apos;s not entirely clear to me whether they were exploiting or exploited. &quot;Let me explain how that happened,&quot; says Artin Haroutiounian with a grin. &quot;We wanted to be the next U2, and we thought it was possible if we sang in English.&quot; So the band wrote a love song that they wanted broadcast on the Voice of Youth, an English-language radio station in Baghdad.  VoY agreed to play the song, but on one condition: UTN1 would have to write another commemorating the birthday of Saddam. &quot;We wrote the song in three days!&quot; says Raof. All five chuckle over this memory as if it were just one of those crazy things one has to do in showbiz, like Take That wearing nipple-gaping tops to titillate pre-pubescent girls in the early 1990s. Didn&apos;t you have qualms? &quot;We wanted our record played,&quot; says Haroutiounian, staring me down. Their song included the following lines: &quot;All bells let them ring/ As we all will sing/ Long live dear Saddam.&quot; &quot;They told us we had to use the word &apos;Saddam&apos;. Otherwise we probably wouldn&apos;t,&quot; Haroutiounian says. VoY played it incessantly, but only spun their love song once.  UTN1 went on to make an album of songs in English, funded by Alan&apos;s Melody, the only shop selling imported CDs in the Iraqi capital. Ali says: &quot;In Saddam&apos;s Iraq there was no satellite TV, no internet, not much access to the outside world, so [the shop&apos;s] influence was vital.&quot; They sent copies of their CD to record companies in London, says Haroutiounian. &quot;It is a capital of the musical world and we wanted to go there.&quot; But it wasn&apos;t to be. It was now late 2003 and the dictator whose birthday UTN1 had been obliged to celebrate in song had been swept from power and their homeland was being razed. &quot;None of us had passports and getting new ones in wartime was impossible. It would have taken a year and a half.&quot; As a result, the boys contemplated giving up music. Handily, while working for an import-export company, Garabedian met an American businessman called Larry Underwood whose Laudes Corporation was operating in post-Saddam Iraq. After hearing the CD, Underwood, who saw commercial possibilities of Iraq&apos;s first ever international pop group, decided to invest in them and so arranged for his new charges to go to Jordan. Once in Amman, the members of UTN1 successfully applied for a UK visa at the British embassy. As a result, they spent seven months in London in 2005 and 2006, learning to dance, sing and finesse the buffing of their six packs in the manner deemed requisite by UK style gurus. &quot;It is a great city and we want to go back there sometime,&quot; says Haroutiounian. &quot;Yes,&quot; agrees Raof, &quot;we never did go on the London Eye.&quot; Seemingly UTN1, funded by an American and groomed by Brits, was being moulded to became even more western than before. Ali, who not only plays guitar, but also oud on some UTN1 tracks, denies this: &quot;Yes, we perfected that kind of boy-band style, but our Iraqi identity is clearly in the music.&quot; The band also uses the joza, a violin-like instrument which Hassan describes as having &quot;its own special scale of sadness&quot;. You can hear it on their first single called While We Can. In the song&apos;s video (available on YouTube), children carry wooden guns which they symbolically drop at the end. &quot;It is about stopping war,&quot; says Haroutiounian. &quot;That is what we believe in.&quot;  Once their UK visas ran out, UTN1 settled in Beirut. Why the Lebanese capital? &quot;It is impossible to make music in Baghdad. We are musicians, so we are in Beirut,&quot; says Hamid. &quot;If we were freedom fighters, we would be in Baghdad.&quot; Only one problem: they moved to Beirut in 2006, shortly before the Israeli-Lebanon war broke out. &quot;War seems to follow us,&quot; says Haroutiounian. UTN1 withdrew to Amman, returning to Beirut only after hostilities ceased. They remain exiles in Lebanon. Do you want to go home? &quot;We go back to Baghdad occasionally,&quot; says Hamid, &quot;and we would like to play a concert there, but it is not clear whether that would be too risky. As for living there - yes, perhaps, sometime, though who knows when?&quot;  What do your families make of your chosen careers? &quot;When we started some of them thought it was crazy for us to try to make our livelihoods in music. It just didn&apos;t happen. But now we&apos;re successful, we hear less of this,&quot; says Ali. All five prefer not to discuss their families who still live in Baghdad. &quot;One day,&quot; says Raof, &quot;we hope to return to Baghdad. We want to set up a music school there, or a music store, or do something for our homeland. Iraq has too little music these days. We have been away for too long and we have so much to give back.&quot;  We&apos;re sitting in the new offices of UTN1&apos;s management company in central Beirut. From the fourth floor window one can see not just the Mediterranean, but also gridlock reportedly caused by a Hezbollah rally. Outside a muezzin is vying with the jackhammers and construction cranes as he summons the faithful to prayer at the Al-Omari Mosque. Beirut&apos;s city centre is being rebuilt. Only in Shanghai have I been more overwhelmed by the omnipresent sound of construction. This, I say, to UTN1, is what Baghdad will sound like in a happier time. All five giggle obligingly but none comments. Instead, they tell me about their latest career move. Last year they decided to start singing in Arabic, recording a single called Jamila, which means beautiful. &quot;It was number one across the Middle East,&quot; says Haroutiounian proudly. Why was it a success? &quot;Because we sang Arabic but with western-style harmonies. There is nothing like it in the world. It blew people&apos;s minds.&quot; It did too: if you consult UTN1&apos;s MySpace page, you&apos;ll find encomia from around the world.  Hassan Ali tells me they have already recorded an album of six English and six Arabic songs and their management is waiting for the right time to release it. &quot;Our hope is to heal the wounds between east and west, to spread a message of reconciliation.&quot; Are you a political band? All five shake their heads. &quot;We always wanted to show that something good can come out of Iraq,&quot; says Haroutiounian. &quot;We are three Muslims and two Christians. We show how things are changing in Iraq.&quot; I notice that on the band&apos;s MySpace page, Nadeem cites Robert Fisk&apos;s The Great War for Civilisation: the Conquest of the Middle East as one of his favourite books. &quot;I will remove that reference. I am not sure that I trust his politics, having now finished the book.&quot; Are you happy the British are leaving? &quot;We&apos;re glad that the withdrawal shows that Iraqi police and soldiers can now look after their own country,&quot; says Hamid.  What would you be doing if you weren&apos;t successful in music? &quot;I have a qualification in agriculture so I would be a farmer,&quot; says Garabedian. &quot;I have a degree in chemistry, so I would be working for a corporation,&quot; says Ali. &quot;I would be a porn star,&quot; says Haroutiounian who, I think, isn&apos;t taking my question seriously. &quot;I would be his assistant,&quot; says Raof. &quot;I studied biology,&quot; says Hamid, &quot;but I don&apos;t see myself in a lab coat.&quot; It&apos;s all smiles until Hamid adds: &quot;Actually your question is impossible. None of us can imagine what we would have done. It&apos;s hard enough to know what you&apos;ll be doing in two weeks&apos; time if you&apos;re an Iraqi. It&apos;s too dangerous to imagine the future. Hassan couldn&apos;t have been an industrial chemist because for him to step outside his house in Baghdad would have been suicide. Shant couldn&apos;t farm - it would have been too dangerous. And Art is Armenian so he would have been abducted by some sect. Normal dreams weren&apos;t available to us.&quot;", "tags": ["Iraq", "Pop and rock", "World news", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2008-12-27T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/27/fiction-bestbooks", "sentences": ["The first was Miracles of Life (Fourth Estate), JG Ballard&apos;s startling, moving and unforgettable life story, focusing on his boyhood in Shanghai and the shock of his coming to England as a teenager."], "title": "You really must read . . .", "article": "Stella AldertonRadlett, Hertfordshire Impressed by Bernhard Schlink&apos;s The Reader, I was eager to read The Homecoming (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, translated by Michael Henry Heim). The narrator again travels from boyhood to maturity; the story again covers postwar Germany, up to the present day. But this novel is more complex and wide-ranging than The Reader: Schlink engages even more powerfully with the moral legacy of Germany&apos;s recent history. Stan AllenBirmingham No one appears to be reading or recommending The Gone-Away World (Heinemann), the fantasy first novel of Nick Harkaway (John le Carr\u00e9&apos;s son). Suspend disbelief after the first page and you won&apos;t want it to stop. The Booker judges didn&apos;t know what they were playing at when they gave the award to The White Tiger, which I found contrived and irritating. Kate AndersonSheffield  Winton&apos;s strong voice and the importance of place surge through Breath (Picador), a terrific novel about surfing. Suddenly the allure of the perfect wave is understandable. Alongside wonderful descriptions of waves and fear, this is also a non-mawkish coming-of-age novel that deals with male friendships and the bond that comes from sharing a potentially dangerous activity. Steven BaileyBognor Regis Barack Obama&apos;s grandly titled The Audacity of Hope (Canongate) was first published in 2006. But he&apos;s now taken on a new importance. The book acts both as a personal statement - his reflections on faith, family and race - and as a considered analysis of the political system. Will his high-minded ideals be compromised by the messy practicalities of the American political process? Sam BanikLondon  Judt&apos;s Reappraisals (Heinemann), about our collective cultural amnesia, is an excellent anthology of essays on writers, humanists and Marxist intellectuals. Judt is enlightening on the political milieu of European nations, America&apos;s last half-century and Israel. Steve Toltz&apos;s Booker-shortlisted debut, A Fraction of the Whole (Hamish Hamilton), is an elegantly written novel about a family of \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Australia. Natalie BarkerLeigh-on-Sea, Essex  Ross Raisin&apos;s debut novel, God&apos;s Own Country (Viking), is a darkly humorous yet haunting evocation of lost innocence. Sam Marsdyke is an adolescent loner whose aggressive defence against a hostile world becomes an attempt to transform his fantasies into criminal reality. The novel&apos;s force resides in the fact that Sam is peculiarly likeable, making poignant his final identification with the monster he has long been accused of being. Robin Wilson&apos;s Lewis Carroll in Numberland (Allen Lane) is a surprisingly readable foray into Charles Dodgson&apos;s lifelong relationship with mathematics. Highly enjoyable, even for the most mathematically challenged reader.  Chris BirchLondon A book that mentions my name three times and refers to me in the introduction as a &quot;sprightly 80-year-old&quot; is bound to find a place on my crowded bookshelves. Its title is Letters to the Editor 2008 (Guardian Books). If you have been held incommunicado in, say, Belmarsh for the last year, there can be no more entertaining way of catching up on what has been happening in Britain and the world. The only puzzle is why my name was not included with David Hockney, Martin Amis and Tom Stoppard on the jacket. Charles BoardmanNottingham Wonderful short story collections from Jhumpa Lahiri and Tobias Wolff, and Richard Holmes&apos;s masterly The Age of Wonder (HarperPress). For my novel of the year I choose Muriel Barbery&apos;s The Elegance of the Hedgehog (Gallic Books), in which a middle-aged female concierge of a Paris apartment block is thrown together with two of the block&apos;s residents - a precocious young girl and a cultivated Japanese man - with surprising consequences.  Vidya BorroahBelfast Rose Tremain&apos;s The Road Home (Vintage) charts the journey taken by many immigrants who leave their country and loved ones to seek work here because there is none to be had at home. It tells the story of Lev, from an unnamed east European country, grieving for his dead wife, who has come to London to earn enough to support the young daughter and elderly mother he has left behind. Phelim BradyNormandy, Surrey If you would like to meet William Shakespeare, visit his rooms in London and learn about the man, read Charles Nicholl&apos;s The Lodger: Shakespeare on Silver Street (Penguin). You will understand the darker plays better and catch a fascinating glimpse of the playwright caught in a domestic dispute between father and daughter. Jerard BrettsMilton Keynes David Wroblewski&apos;s The Story of Edgar Sawtelle (Fourth Estate) is a mammoth reimagining of the story of Hamlet set on a dog-breeding farm in Wisconsin. Lyrical, absorbing and wise, it must be the closest anyone came in 2008 to writing the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;. In non-fiction, Charlotte Higgins&apos;s It&apos;s All Greek to Me (Short Books) is a wonderful introduction to ancient Greece. She brings the world of Homer, Herodotus, Plato and Sappho vividly to life, making it clear how relevant their works are to our own world of fragile democracy and warfare. Jane ButlerLondon  Thomas Glavinic&apos;s Night Work (Canongate) takes a science-fiction clich\u00e9 - the solitude of the only survivor of a global catastrophe - and turns it into a compelling exploration of death, memory and the hunger for consolation. In Elizabeth, Shakespeare and the Castle: The Story of the Kenilworth Revels (Zoilus Press), Ronald Binns provides a gripping account of what went on during the legendary royal entertainments at Kenilworth in the summer of 1575. He examines the intriguing possibility that the young Shakespeare was there, watching the galaxy of Tudor talent.  Michael CallananBirmingham The best book of the year was The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar Wao (Faber) by Junot D\u00edaz. How could only one author recommend it in this year&apos;s picks? D\u00edaz is the future of writing. Philip Acree CavalierSalisbury, North Carolina, US Tom Rob Smith&apos;s Child 44 (Simon &amp; Schuster) deserved its place on the Booker longlist. Smith evokes a Stalinist world in which murder is not allowed to exist and in which trying to catch a mass murderer is therefore next to impossible. He captures the suffocating quality of Stalin&apos;s Russia, where almost no one could be trusted.  Morag CharlwoodShoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex It has been a good year for short stories. Shena Mackay&apos;s The Atmospheric Railway (Cape) weaves fabulous tales, in sensual prose. With In the Driver&apos;s Seat (Vintage), Helen Simpson continues her deft exploration of the clich\u00e9s of modern middle-class life. Her portraits of characters on the edge are drawn with wit, compassion and economy. Simon ClarkeLondon Heather O&apos;Neill&apos;s Lullabies for Little Criminals (Quercus) portrays the difficult life of a 12-year-old Montreal girl - her heroin addict father, her time in care and as a prostitute. It is a highly original work and, despite the subject matter, written with much humour.  In non-fiction, Fishing in Utopia by Andrew Brown (Granta) is a wise, respectful and wonderfully written book in which the author returns to Sweden, where he lived both as a child and in his 20s, to try to define his relationship with the country. Marge CloutsGloucestershire Aleksandar Hemon&apos;s third novel, The Lazarus Project (Picador), is a moving parallel narrative: a Bosnian refugee arrives in Chicago in 1992 - as Hemon himself did - and becomes absorbed by the tragedy of an earlier refugee, a young Jew who had escaped the Kishinev pogrom only to be shot by the Chicago chief of police.  Max DunbarManchester My favourite non-fiction title of 2008 was Nick Davies&apos;s Flat Earth News (Chatto &amp; Windus). In an age when so much hype surrounds the media, this experienced journalist exposes with hilarity and horror the debasement of his profession. Paul M EastwoodStamford, Lincolnshire I seem to have spent the year in the company of alcoholics in Soho. It started with Nigel Jones&apos;s biography of Patrick Hamilton, Through a Glass Darkly (Black Spring Press). Hamilton presented to the world the debonair man about town, but as this memoir reveals, he was far more interesting. Rereading Hangover Square, Hamilton&apos;s finest work, inevitably led to sharing a glass or two with Julian Maclaren-Ross via Fear and Loathing in Fitzrovia, his biography by Paul Willetts. Graham Greene, Anthony Powell, Evelyn Waugh and John Betjeman all enthusiastically endorsed this laconic writer.  Gil ElliotLondon The books of the year lists contained multiple tributes to various Booker contenders, but only a couple of mentions of the actual winner. Yet Aravind Adiga&apos;s The White Tiger (Atlantic) is everything a novel should be - it breaks new ground, in an audacious style and form. The book crashes outwards with cocky street-humour, identifying the humiliated and broken lives that sustain India&apos;s new wealth, and exposing the disgusting disparity between the lives of the rich and poor.  Gareth EvansLondon The books that seemed most welcome this year came from three writers closely associated with London, offering a range of fiercely personal works. The unstoppable city chronicler Iain Sinclair produced three fine titles. The Firewall (Etruscan Books) delivers a &quot;selected poems&quot; from three decades, while Buried at Sea (Worple Press) riffs in multiple forms on the culture of the south coast. After a long period out of print, his Kodak Mantra Diaries, about Ginsberg&apos;s 1967 visit, was reissued in a special edition by Beat Scene. The woefully under-appreciated Nicholas Royle was also busy with two distinctive novellas, The Appetite (Gray Friar Press) and The Enigma of Departure (PS Publishing). The prolific poet and novelist Jeremy Reed created The Grid (Peter Owen), an ignored speculative fiction of rare imaginative reach. Audrey FogelmanRutland As a fairly innumerate non-scientist, I am perversely drawn to books about maths and science and usually abandon them with ignorance intact. However, Quantum by Manjit Kumar (Icon) is so well written that I now feel I&apos;ve more or less got particle physics sussed. Quantum transcends genre - it is historical, scientific, biographical, philosophical.  Anne FowlerSurrey I quickly became immersed in The Black Madonna of Derby by Joanna Czechowska (Silkmill Press), the story of a Polish immigrant family. The daughter is especially intriguing, as she grows up and learns to reconcile her desire to fit into English life with the Polish aspects of her family life.  A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini (Bloomsbury) gives a fascinating insight into life in Afghanistan, especially into the lives of women. A moving but not depressing read. Kate GunningLondon I&apos;m a sucker for literary biographies and autobiographies, and there were two that stood out this year. The first was Miracles of Life (Fourth Estate), JG Ballard&apos;s startling, moving and unforgettable life story, focusing on his boyhood in Shanghai and the shock of his coming to England as a teenager.  The second was The Semi-Invisible Man (Cape), Julian Evans&apos;s vast and vastly enjoyable portrait of the great travel writer and novelist Norman Lewis.  Jeremy HayesSnodland, Kent Bloody Old Britain by Kitty Hauser (Granta) is a biography of the Marxist geographer and archaeologist OGS Crawford. Born in 1886, Crawford served in the Royal Flying Corps during the first world war, where he developed his skills of landscape observation. He later worked as archaeology officer with Ordnance Survey. The book takes its title from one of the same name, written by Crawford but never published. It was a rant against 1930s Britain and what he saw as its shoddy goods, poorly built houses, bad service and landscape destruction. A lively biography of the sort of person I remember from my childhood in the 50s - the well-educated, opinionated, unmarried, eccentric Englishman. Jennifer HewitKidderminster There are gardening books for looking up facts and advice, and much rarer ones that are to be read for the quality of the writing. The Morville Hours by Katherine Swift (Bloomsbury) is the most outstanding recent example of the latter. Although it describes the creation of her garden in Shropshire, it ranges widely over archaeology, history, people, animals, geology. All this within, but not constrained by, the framework of a medieval Book of Hours. Martin HillsChichester Mick Imlah&apos;s The Lost Leader (Faber) is a breathtaking romp through Scottish history and myth, right up to the poet&apos;s own times. Prince Charlie, Braveheart, rugby players, soldiers, drunks, family and friends feature in narrative and anecdotal poems of dazzling variety and originality. In Palestine Walks (Profile), we learn that Sarha means &quot;to roam freely, without restraint&quot;: Raja Shehadeh, a lawyer from Ramallah, recounts a series of progressively interrupted walks through a contracting homeland, stolen and despoiled under occupation. A lyrical, heart-rending testimony to a human, political and ecological disaster.  Liz HoffbauerOld Hunstanton I nearly drove some people mad by reading out excerpts from The Discovery of France by Graham Robb (Picador). As a Francophile, I thought I knew France, but this was full of amazing new facts, some horrific and some hilarious. A wonderful read. After the Reich by Giles MacDonogh (Basic Books) is a gloomy catalogue of atrocities perpetrated on Germans by eastern and western Europeans and Americans after the war, and an examination of the initial chaos of the occupation of Germany; it makes you realise that war in Europe then differed little from war in Africa now. Gerry JeffersDublin  The African children who are the central characters in Uwem Akpan&apos;s debut short story collection, Say You&apos;re One of Them (Little, Brown), linger long after you put the book down. We encounter modern-day slavery through the eyes of a 10-year-old boy. A Nigerian bus journey in the company of Jibril/Gabriel, a teenager with a Muslim-Christian identity, brilliantly captures ethnic tension. Freda KeysCounty Antrim The Secret Scripture by Sebastian Barry (Faber) is by far the best book I have read this year. The nature of memory, with its distortions and shifting emphases, is finely handled. The voice of the central character, Roseanne McNulty, is sure and marked by &quot;an inexplicable joy&quot;, which transcends all the suffering and humiliation she has undergone. Bridget KhursheedMelrose, Roxburghshire  The Glass Swarm by Peter Bennet (Flambard Press) is a most original, erudite and human collection of poems placed in Bennet&apos;s familiar and alchemical Northumbrian home landscape - a worthy Poetry Book Society Choice.  Kate LathanCornwall The sudden appearance of a third Marilynne Robinson, Home (Virago), required an immediate trip to the bookshop. Glory has relinquished her career and foundering relationship to return to small-town America to care for her ageing father. Jack, the most prodigal of sons, also returns, unkempt, unsettled and fleeing a past. Complex and subtle with luminous prose, it is a deeply satisfying read.  Ian LeeLondon It seems wrong that a book about death should be so enjoyable, but Julian Barnes&apos;s Nothing to Be Frightened Of (Cape) is stimulating, moving and philosophical, holding humour and perspicacity in an exquisite balance. I read it in April, 18 months after my wife&apos;s early death. In characteristically elegant prose, it weaves the subject of death back into the fabric of life.  Terry LempriereWarrington I thoroughly enjoyed Andrew O&apos;Hagan&apos;s The Atlantic Ocean (Faber), a collection of superbly crafted essays covering a period of about 15 years since the early 1990s. The Atlantic is the common background: events and people include the James Bulger case, Hurricane Katrina, the assassination of JFK, George Bush, Tony Blair and Marilyn Monroe. I particularly enjoyed the more parochial pieces about the &quot;Scottish Injury&quot; and the Glasgow sludge boat. Darran McLaughlinLondon I&apos;m amazed that no one in the books of the year roundup mentioned McMafia by Misha Glenny (Bodley Head), which demonstrates the inextricable connection between legitimate business and the criminal underworld in our hyper-globalised economy. Anne MillsTonbridge, Kent  Here in Kent, we have a particular interest in Adam Nicolson&apos;s Sissinghurst: An Unfinished History (HarperPress), an eloquent and poetic account, with insights into the relationship between the owners and the National Trust. Susan O&apos;ConnorLiverpool Robert Macfarlane&apos;s The Wild Places (Granta) allowed me to travel to wonderful landscapes while I was recovering from foot surgery. I also enjoyed Tobias Wolff&apos;s collection Our Story Begins (Bloomsbury): &quot;Nightingale&quot;, especially, is absorbing, lyrical and shocking. Stephen ParkinLondon The Paris Review Interviews (Canongate) delivered another impressive list of writers, including Jean Rhys in the year she died and Evelyn Waugh - circumspect, cigar-smoking and wearing white pyjamas. Many thanks to Faber for its list of print on demand titles (faber.co.uk/faberfinds), a highlight in a year dominated by TV and sports personalities writing about themselves. Jane PartridgeDevon Andr\u00e9 Aciman&apos;s Call Me By Your Name (Atlantic) will have you weeping for times lost and relationships severed. Let yourself be drawn into Elio&apos;s and Oliver&apos;s relationship, experience their pain, sense of urgency and regret. This book will lodge itself in your mind. Terry PhilpotSurrey Alex von Tunzelmann&apos;s Indian Summer (Pocket Books) has the epic sweep that its subject warrants: the struggle for Indian independence, which redrew the subcontinent&apos;s boundaries and plunged it into chaos, resulting in a million dead and the world&apos;s largest ever movement of population. The personal and political are finely balanced as Tunzelmann explores the triangular relationship of three of the players in this extraordinary drama: Louis and Edwina Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru. Both Melissa Benn&apos;s One of Us (Chatto &amp; Windus) and Robert Harris&apos;s The Ghost (Arrow) are compulsively readable novels about modern Labour politics. Harris never fails with another thriller that surprises on almost every page and delivers a denouement that leaves the reader open-mouthed. Benn&apos;s novel weaves politics and ambition with family drama to create a work that historians may come to admire as much as literary critics. Ronnie RandallRadcliffe-on-Trent, Nottingham A Freewheelin&apos; Time by Suze Rotolo (Aurum), the artist who was Bob Dylan&apos;s girlfriend when he made the Freewheelin&apos; Bob Dylan album, and who appears on the album cover, is an immensely rich evocation of Greenwich Village in the 1960s. Her portrait of Dylan is sympathetic but realistic, without either recrimination or hero-worship. The Believers by Zo\u00eb Heller (Fig Tree) is a novel set in New York about a dysfunctional leftwing family whose fundamental beliefs are thrown into disarray by a family crisis. Heller&apos;s characters are drawn with quirky and authentic detail.  Jill SandersonLispole, County Kerry Deer Hunting With Jesus: Guns, Votes, Debt and Delusion in Redneck America by Joe Bageant (Portobello). Take a look at the Guardian map of the US election - it shows a solid block of Republican support in middle America. Low wages, poor education, costly housing, third-rate medical care, substandard media and entertainment facilities encourage general apathy and low expectations. The lawyer, the real estate agent, the medic and the factory executive are all implicated in this ruthless dissection of local vested interests. Religious fundamentalism is graphically described, as is the historical background to gun ownership rights. Peter SavageLondon The Blue Manuscript by Sabiha Al Khemir (Verso) is a remarkable novel, skilfully and imaginatively weaving history and human lives across time and continents. It&apos;s mainly set in Egypt on an archaeological excavation in search of the &quot;blue manuscript&quot;. As an international team dig deeper in the earth, excavating layer after layer, they dig deeper into themselves and their relationships with &quot;the other&quot;.  Fred SedgwickIpswitch Edna Longley&apos;s marvellous The Annotated Poems of Edward Thomas (Bloodaxe). I have known these poems for decades, but Longley, with her immaculate ear for the sound of words, especially Thomas&apos;s half-rhymes, and her empathy for this troubled poet, has produced a book that makes earlier editions redundant. For once it doesn&apos;t matter that the introduction and notes together take up more pages than the poems: the notes make you read the poems again and again with increasing understanding and enjoyment.  John ShieldsWilmslow, Cheshire Day by AL Kennedy (Vintage) is rewarding in the way that difficult books often are. The revisiting of the past is evoked in a multilayered narrative that I found very moving. Siri Hustvedt&apos;s The Sorrows of an American (Sceptre) is hugely impressive, thanks to her measured prose, psychological insights and narrative mastery.  James SmithLondon I have chosen two European novels that sparingly dissect the secrets and resentments at the heart of rural families. In Berlin Poplars by Anne B Ragde, translated by James Anderson (Harvill Secker), family members, scattered both emotionally and geographically, return reluctantly to the isolated Norwegian farm of their birth as the matriarch approaches death. The Twin, by Gerbrand Bakker, translated by David Colmer (Harvill Secker), is an understated portrayal of a lonely man struggling to look after his ageing father, but it is also a paean to the Dutch countryside. The literal translation of the book&apos;s Dutch title - &quot;It&apos;s Quiet Upstairs&quot; - better conveys the heart of this quietly profound novel.  Tim SmithWorthing, West Sussex With thanks to an article in Review, I have been reading the novels of Henry Handel Richardson. The Fortunes of Richard Mahony (Penguin Classics) is a brave and wonderful book drawn from the life of the author&apos;s father in 19th-century Australia. A great joy of this year has been The Book of Ebenezer Le Page by GB Edwards (Penguin), a fictional life based entirely on Guernsey - little incident, but completely mesmerising.  Ray SnapeYork Women&apos;s Work: Modern Women Poets Writing in English edited by Eva Salzman and Amy Wack (Seren) is a remarkable anthology of women&apos;s poetry of the highest quality, beautifully themed and modulated. There are names familiar (Dickinson, Mew, Duffy, Boland) and less so (Clare Pollard, Kimiko Hahn); poets under 40 (Stephanie Bolster, AE Stallings) and poets who died too young (the richly rewarding American Jane Kenyon).  Jean SpiersBeckenham, Kent During the second world war in Britain, members of the armed forces and officials were forbidden to keep diaries concerning their war duties. It was a prohibition that was widely ignored, and diaries are at the centre of Andrew Roberts&apos;s Masters and Commanders (Allen Lane) - a fine, stylish account of the struggles between Churchill, Roosevelt, Alanbrooke and Marshall over the strategic direction of the war. Roberts contends that when three of those four were in agreement, the other was in effect forced into consensus. With four out of five German soldiers killed on the eastern front, he also shows where the war was won, and by whom. Philip SpinksStratford-Upon-Avon Martin Amis&apos;s The Second Plane (Cape)is a powerfully written and provocative view of a free society&apos;s response to terrorism. Alberto Manguel&apos;s The Library at Night (Yale) is a beautifully written set of musings on libraries, a book to savour. Dry Store Room No 1 by Richard Fortey (Harper Perennial) is a delight; I&apos;ll never look at the Natural History Museum in the same way again. It is a secret history written by someone who loves his subject and who is generous in letting the reader into his world.  Tereza StehlikovaLondon The work of the great Russian film-maker Andrei Tarkovsky is explored and celebrated in Tarkovsky, a vast book edited by Nathan Dunne (Black Dog), and in Robert Bird&apos;s Andrei Tarkovsky (Reaktion). The artist&apos;s own luminous polaroids appeared in the beautifully produced Bright, Bright Day (White Space). Soul (New York Review Books) gathered eight works from another Slavic giant, Andrei Platonov. Works of great tenderness and insight in the face of oppression, they&apos;re brilliantly rendered by one of the great translators of our time, Robert Chandler, and his team. It features a striking afterword by John Berger, who has also contributed to the lyrical and insightful essay collection Matters of Life and Death (Radcliffe) by the exceptional GP and medical activist Iona Heath.  Gareth StoreyLondon James Frey&apos;s A Bright Shiny Morning (John Murray). Like many others, I had written Frey off and ignored his second novel - My Friend Leonard - after the scandal surrounding his &quot;memoir&quot; A Million Little Pieces, but he&apos;s made a brilliant return. Frey&apos;s prose is outstanding and the interlinked narrative and structure centring on Los Angeles makes for addictive reading. Anne SummersLondon The Visible World by Mark Slouka (Portobello) moves between wartime and contemporary Czechoslovakia, and the postwar America of Czech exiles. The narrator is the child of parents displaced by history, trying to penetrate the mystery of the lives they had before he existed, a time traveller between the present and a past that has locked itself tightly around all of them. This is gracefully written, but also a dark and demanding experience. Simon SurteesLondon Between the Monster and the Saint: Reflections on the Human Condition by Richard Holloway (Canongate) is a profound, moving analysis of the capacity within human beings for the extremities of evil, suffering and love. Bill SwainsonLondon  In a strong year for poetry, which included Mick Imlah&apos;s long-awaited second collection, The Lost Leader, and Mark Doty&apos;s Theories and Apparitions (Cape), I played catch-up with an exciting new beginning and an unexpected and tragic end: Frances Leviston - Public Dream (Picador) - was the sure-footed tyro and the late, greatly lamented Mahmoud Darwish - The Butterfly&apos;s Burden (Bloodaxe), superbly translated from the Arabic by Fady Joudah - was the past master. In fiction, Aleksandar Hemon&apos;s The Lazarus Project spliced together mutually revealing stories of the perils of emigration to the US in the early 20th and 21st centuries, while in non-fiction The Journal of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Berr (MacLehose Press) saw the vital rediscovery of a young Jewish woman&apos;s heartbreaking diary of Nazi-occupied Paris. Dorrie SwiftLondon I&apos;m a David Lodge fan, so I couldn&apos;t wait for Deaf Sentence to come out in paperback (Harvill Secker). I love the variety in this novel as it tackles deafness, growing old, retirement, suicide and relationships, with forays into linguistics, poetry, religion and Beethoven. The prosaic and the bizarre occur alongside each other and there are some wonderful scenes that are both farcical and poignant. I marvelled at how Lodge managed to weave all this into a coherent story that had me eagerly turning the pages, and at his ability to make you imagine what it might feel like to be deaf. Jill TheisBattle, East Sussex I enjoyed The Bolter by Frances Osborne (Virago), a biography of Idina Sackville. Osborne is George Osborne&apos;s wife and the great-granddaughter of Idina, whose brother, the ninth Earl De La Warr, inspired Bexhill&apos;s De La Warr Pavilion of 1935. Osborne shares with the reader her intimate knowledge of Idina&apos;s adventures, often culled from family diaries, during her &quot;dazzling troubled life&quot; in London and Kenya.  Helen WalkerBrentford, Middlesex Gordon Burn&apos;s writing always manages to make me feel as though he were me. Born Yesterday: The News As a Novel (Faber), weaving news stories from 2007 into a fictionalised tale of connections, coincidences and accidental voyeurism, generates a palpable feeling of unease. It features the author himself as a background character, moving through the book and events of the year, looking more closely than we ever have time for and in the process exposing how the media have come to dictate the national discourse about who we are and how we should be living.  Michael WallingEnfield It was a joy to discover Alexis Wright&apos;s epic Aboriginal novel Carpentaria (Constable), at once a family chronicle, a social document, a fantasy, a spiritual meditation and the realisation of myth in the contemporary world. No less vast in its ambition, though many pages shorter, is Terry Eagleton&apos;s The Meaning of Life: A Very Short Introduction (OUP). Following on from his brilliant (and long overdue) demolition of Richard Dawkins, this is a magnificent jeu d&apos;esprit. Eagleton even manages to make Schopenhauer accessible and (a still greater feat) funny. Terry WardWickford, Essex In the 1960s, as a teenager living in Romford, I subscribed to IF Stone&apos;s Weekly. Forty years later, I have now read Myra MacPherson&apos;s impressive biography All Governments Lie! The Life and Times of Rebel Journalist IF Stone (Scribner). Stone spent his career challenging government deception and press complicity. He campaigned against fascism and McCarthyism, and in support of civil rights and in opposition to the war in Vietnam. Stone covered stories the mainstream press ignored. A number of famous American journalists began their careers helping him to publish his magazine. In his retirement he taught himself ancient Greek in preparation for writing his powerful book The Trial of Socrates. Stone was a man who made a difference, a true American hero. Vivien WhitakerDronfield, Derbyshire Zany Zuzu&apos;s Petals by Sue Hepworth (Snowbooks) is a delight. Partying in the hot tub with a broken leg, paying for your funeral in advance so you can spend the &quot;divi&quot; . . . the humour is warm and distinctively northern. The hero, a provocateur in cycling shorts, highlights the essentials in life and got me thinking about my own priorities. Alan WillisPortsoy, Banffshire As some of my ancestors originated in the Old Nichol area of London&apos;s Bethnal Green, Sarah Wise&apos;s new book, The Blackest Streets: The Life and Death of a Victorian Slum (Bodley Head), was an essential read this year. It is an incisive account of people struggling to survive in formidably difficult circumstances.  Selected Translations by Ted Hughes has been edited and introduced by Daniel Weissbort (Faber), and is out in paperback this year. This book is a compelling collection of poems, translated from a variety of languages, both classical and modern. Jennifer Haigh&apos;s latest novel, The Condition (Harper), is a deft exploration of the emotions and experiences of an American family over recent decades.  Angus WilsonAshford, Kent Crisis? What Crisis? Britain in the 1970s by Alwyn W Turner (Aurum) is in three parts, driven by the chronology of the political leadership of Heath, Wilson and Callaghan, but the chapters are thematic: the environment, unions, obscenity, race and sexualities. These are signposted by lyrics from popular songs, quotes from fiction and dialogue from television. The title was not voiced by a politician, of course, but was a headline in a newspaper. Mary WorrallBirmingham The Behaviour of Moths by Poppy Adams (Virago). Why has one sister become a recluse and spent 40 years alone and isolated in the grand decaying family home waiting for the return of the other? Not a nice story, but compelling . . . creepily magical! \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 8 January 2009. We conflated two novels by Sebastian Barry in a selection of books recommended by readers. The Secret Scripture is not set in County Wicklow in the 50s.

The skull, which is between 2.16m and 2.55m years old, is superbly preserved and its location has cast doubt on ideas that cheetahs evolved in the Americas. One theory is that modern cheetahs shared a common ancestor with pumas in the Americas, but the fossil record of the puma goes back only around 400,000 years in the US. Because the current find is so much older, it is strong evidence for an evolutionary origin for cheetahs in Asia. Cheetahs are the fastest land animal, using short bursts of speed in excess of 70mph to capture prey. They are now found almost exclusively in Africa and are classified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature&apos;s Red List of endangered species as vulnerable to extinction.  One sub-species called the Asiatic cheetah still exists in Iran. Numbering between 60 and 100 individuals and critically endangered, according to the Red List, it represents the remnants of a much larger population that was once widespread across Asia but was devastated by human-induced habitat destruction and hunting. The new find, from the Linxia basin in China&apos;s Gansu province, suggests that Asia was the evolutionary cradle for the fleet felines. The nearly complete skull is among the oldest cheetah fossils yet found. It is around the same age as a 2.5m year-old related species discovered in Casablanca, Morocco, in 1997.     The skull is from a new species of primitive cheetah. Photograph: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences    But according to its discoverers, Dr Per Christiansen at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, and Dr Ji Maz\u00e1k of the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum in China, the new find \u2013 dubbed Acinonyx kurteni \u2013 has a unique set of characteristics. &quot;We present a new discovery from the late Pliocene of China of a new species of primitive cheetah, whose skull shows a unique combination of primitive and derived characters,&quot; they wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The big cat&apos;s evolutionary history is poorly understood because few fossils have been found. The skull is around the same size as living cheetahs, but it has a very wide braincase relative to the skull&apos;s length. It also has enlarged frontal sinuses and its teeth are &quot;surprisingly primitive&quot;, according to the researchers.  They suggest that other cheetah specimens that are known only from fossilised teeth may have been misidentified by other scientists. &quot;The dentition is far more primitive than in all other cheetah-like cats, raising doubts on the identification of isolated dental finds of large cats from the Pliocene-Pleistocene of Eurasia and Africa, which are often attributed to leopards,&quot; they wrote.", "tags": ["Science", "Evolution", "Fossils", "World news", "China", "Zoology", "Biology", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2008-12-29T22:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/31/shares-markets-record-losses", "sentences": ["Second worst hit was China&apos;s benchmark Shanghai composite index, which plummeted 65% \u2013 its largest-ever annual drop \u2013 after soaring more than 300% over 2006 and 2007."], "title": "Stockmarkets around world suffer worst year on record", "article": "A record $14 trillion (\u00a39.7tn) has been wiped off world share values in 2008 as many stockmarkets around the world suffered their worst 12 months on record. Turmoil in the financial system and the worst global recession since the 1970s have sent shares reeling. Global stocks, as measured by the MSCI index, have fallen by a record 44% over the year. In London, the FTSE 100 index lost 31.3% in 2008, its worst annual decline since it was created in 1984, and following a 3.8% gain in 2007. It edged up 0.94% to 4434.17 on the last trading day of the year, a gain of 41.49 points. Banks, at the centre of the financial storm, were among the biggest losers ranging from HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB to Barclays. Mining companies Kazakhmys, Xstrata and Rio Tinto also fared badly as the economy worsened. Drugmakers AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline were among the best-performing stocks on the FTSE. British Energy was another big gainer, up more than 40% in a year in which the government secured the sale of its stake in the nuclear power firm to French energy giant EDF. David Buik at BGC Partners talked of an &quot;annus horribilis by any standards&quot;. It started with the Northern Rock nationalisation, and got progressively worse. In March, US investment house Bear Stearns became the first major bank to be rescued from collapse and by the autumn scores of banks around the world had gone under \u2013 notably Lehman Brothers \u2013 or been bailed out. Lending between banks ground to a halt, triggering more government interventions, and most major economies slid into recession. Sterling has also had its worst year against the euro since the single currency started life almost a decade ago. The pound staged a rally on the last day of the year, rising 2% to 95.44p versus the euro. But analysts say there was nothing to prevent further losses that could take the pair to parity, with UK interest rates set to fall close to zero in the new year from 2% now \u2013 far below rates in the eurozone, currently at 2.5%. Against the dollar, the pound has lost nearly 27% over the year, the sharpest drop since the gold standard monetary system was abolished in 1971. It traded around $1.4605 today. Oil dropped to $37 a barrel, heading for its worst year ever with a slump of more than 60%. Last night, Wall Street took heart from Washington&apos;s expanded bail-out of the embattled auto sector, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up 2.2%. The Dow is off nearly 35% so far this year. The mainland European bourses that opened for a half day drifted marginally upwards but still registered their worst yearly losses for decades. The CAC-40 in Paris notched up a decline of 43%, the worst run in its 20-year history. Germany&apos;s Dax-30 closed down 40.4% yesterday while Italy&apos;s MIB-30 was off 48.5% and Spain&apos;s Ibex-35 down 47.5%. The worst-performing stockmarket over the year was Russia&apos;s, where the benchmark RTS index plunged by 72%. Second worst hit was China&apos;s benchmark Shanghai composite index, which plummeted 65% \u2013 its largest-ever annual drop \u2013 after soaring more than 300% over 2006 and 2007. &quot;China&apos;s economy is obviously at a turning point. There are too many uncertainties, and past huge losses have made investors increasingly cautious,&quot; said Cheng Weiqing, an analyst at Citic Securities in Beijing. Many investors are hoping for a better year in 2009, taking heart from the stock gains seen during December. &quot;If there&apos;s any optimism, it&apos;s on the basis that stockmarkets recover in recessions,&quot; said Justin Urquhart Stewart of Seven Investment Management. &quot;Now we have the real recession, rather than the phoney recession. Last year we were so optimistic that we were fooling ourselves. It&apos;s gone too far the other way.&quot; Buik said the outlook for the UK was mixed. &quot;With the dole queue likely to increase to 2.5 million by the end of May 2009, and with corporate profits in the next quarter likely to fall by 15% and with the housing market continuing to retrench, the immediate outlook for equities is unappetising,&quot; he said. &quot;However, with many companies still paying reasonable dividends, the UK stockmarket should rally strongly in the second half of the year with the FTSE ending at 5000, as the UK attempts to dig itself out of recession.&quot; Across Asia, stocks suffered record falls over the year, a painful change from its once-booming markets. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei closed for the year yesterday having recorded the biggest annual percentage loss in its 58-year history. Modest gains in December \u2013 the first since May \u2013 did little to mitigate a yearly loss of 42% after the world&apos;s second-largest economy sank into recession. In Hong Kong, also in recession, the Hang Seng index ended the year 48% lower, its worst annual drop since the global oil shock of the early 1970s. India&apos;s main index in Mumbai plummeted by 52%. The South African stock exchange lost 27% this year and the rand slipped almost 30%.", "tags": ["Global recession", "Business", "Shares", "Investing", "Investments", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2008-12-31T14:37:00Z"}], "docs": 585}
