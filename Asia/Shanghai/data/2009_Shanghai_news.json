The British No1, in commanding form from the start, broke the American in his first service game and went on to win the opening set without facing a break point. Blake&apos;s start to the second was similarly woeful as he was broken to love, a setback he never recovered from. &quot;It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve played James in about three years so I expected it to be a tough match,&quot; said the Scot, &quot;but I played much better than I expected for the first match of the year.&quot; With Federer and Rafael Nadal given byes into today&apos;s semi-final round, the Swiss world No2 might be ring-rusty against the Scot he dispatched easily in the final of last year&apos;s US Open.

Questions of integrity Victoria Derbyshire The Radio 5 Live presenter shook the country to its foundations this week by revealing the BBC offered her &quot;crib sheets&quot; on her chosen subject - the novels of Thomas Hardy - when considering taking part in Celebrity Mastermind. Our Beloved Broadcasting Corporation responded immediately, saying they would point contestants in the direction of &quot;helpful resource tools&quot;, but never provide them with answers like some foul sneak in the fourth remove. Derbyshire later clarified her statement, saying that by &quot;crib sheet&quot; she had meant no more than &quot;research guidance&quot;. Honour was thereby satisfied, particularly as the education minister&apos;s pitiful performance in the chair suggested that he had never got so much as a sniff of a crib sheet. Or perhaps David &quot;13 points and 82 billion passes&quot; Lammy was the only person to refuse one? Is he in fact the only honest man in a pitful of bounders? The nation must be told.", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2009-01-03T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/04/china-human-rights-charter-08", "sentences": ["The writer Wen Kejian has been detained in the resort city of Hangzhou, close to Shanghai."], "title": "Beijing strikes at Charter 08 dissidents", "article": "China has launched a tough countrywide crackdown on a new network of political activists, writers and lawyers who have supported a bold new manifesto that presses for the end of one-party rule. The group of 300 or so people had all signed Charter 08, which called for democracy and the rule of law in China and was named after the famous Charter 77 dissident group formed in cold war Czechoslovakia. Charter 08 has been hailed as the most significant act of public dissent against China&apos;s Communist party since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests were brutally crushed in 1989. It was posted online on 10 December, the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It condemned recent economic modernisation efforts as having &quot;stripped people of their rights&quot;, and called for political reform and a new liberal, democratic constitution. However, Beijing has reacted by jailing some of Charter 08&apos;s public supporters. At least 70 of the original signatories have been summoned or interrogated by the police. Prominent dissident Liu Xiaobo has been put under house arrest. The writer Wen Kejian has been detained in the resort city of Hangzhou, close to Shanghai. Police have also ransacked the Beijing home of Zhang Zuhua, one of the main authors of the charter, confiscating his passport as well as his computers, books and notebooks.  Professor Xu Youyu, a leading philosopher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, has been told by police to retract his signature. The hard line of the Chinese authorities comes after the success of the Beijing Olympics last summer. But any hopes held by pro-democracy activists that the event would soften the ruling party&apos;s stance on dissent have now been crushed. The party has long tolerated riotous economic freedom as China has opened up to capitalism, but has twinned that with an iron fist when it comes to political activities.  It seems that the stance has not changed. The central propaganda department has warned all domestic media not to interview or write articles about anyone who signed Charter 08. All mention of the document is barred from emails, websites and search engines. According to Amnesty International, Beijiing considers the charter a &quot;counter-revolutionary platform&quot;, which lays the basis for future arrests of its supporters. Beijing has also used the launch of the charter to crack down on citizens who have campaigned against other abuses, widening the scope of its moves to crush dissent. Zhao Lianhai, who had organised parents of children affected by the recent tainted milk scandal, had been picked up police in Beijing. At the same time, parents of children who died in a collapsed school during the Sichuan earthquake last year have been told to stop talking to foreign journalists. But it is not clear if the clampdown will succeed. The charter has now circulated widely in China, collecting some 7,000 signatures. Indeed, part of the reason for the severity of the security response is likely to be because many of the document&apos;s backers are prominent, and even include some party officials.  Yet Beijing could not just ignore the challenge to its rule. China, after decades of growth, is being hit by the global economic downturn and the government is hypersensitive to any signs of social tension as it seeks to manage a wave of factory closures and job losses.  Senior government officials - including Zhang Ping, the head of the powerful national development and reform commission - have already expressed concern that a heavy rate of unemployment among migrant workers could foment further unrest and instability in 2009.  China is also bracing itself for a sequence of potent political dates over the course of this year. By the time the party celebrates 60 years since the founding of the People&apos;s Republic on 1 October, 1949, it will first have to endure the 90th anniversary of the 4 May movement, one of the seminal acts of protest in modern Chinese history.

As well as strappy sandals, a summer dress, a Time Out city guide, a big fat novel, various hair products and unguents, and there, buried at the bottom of my case like an afterthought, a pair of stout walking boots, and a sensible fleece.  When I finished packing it struck me that it looked like the kind of case Bear Grylls might pack if Bear Grylls were a tranny, but then I was going on the most surreal hiking holiday known to man, in one of the most densely populated cities on earth, and, frankly, luggage was really the least of my issues. I was, in fact, going hiking in Hong Kong, which sounds like one of those oxymorons made up by an overenthusiastic tourist board, like a Dubai culture break or a Scottish winter sun holiday, with the crucial difference that you actually can go hiking in Hong Kong. No. Really. Proper, in the middle of nowhere, slogging your guts out up a mountain trail, hiking. It surprises a lot of people who haven&apos;t been to Hong Kong but then again it also surprises a lot of people who have. I went pre-handover and had no idea it was anything but high-rises until my friends Aussie Pete and Czech Zuzana, who live there, rang up and invited me camping.  &quot;Camping? Are you mad?&quot; I said. But then I rang the tourist board and they said, oh yes, as if it were the most normal thing in the world, and found me a guide and a really spiffing hotel, the Mandarin Oriental, which, while not a tent - in that it had a marble bathroom as well as walls, a roof, a bed, liveried doormen etc - was, I decided, tent-like enough. For all I knew, Pete&apos;s idea of &quot;camping&quot; could easily involve sleeping rough on a Kowloon pavement.  There was a snag, though. Usually on a walking holiday, I end up in an Alpine hut sharing a room with four snoring Germans, the plus side of which is that when you put on your three-quarter-length trousers and your microfibre top, your thick socks and your stout boots, you don&apos;t have to walk past breakfasting businessmen and liveried doormen. I think I may have looked somewhat unusual.  Since Pete and Zuzana were working for the first part of the week, I was going to go walking in the day and then meet up with them for a spot of big city entertainment, and the tourist board had rustled up a walking guide called Fred. Fred wasn&apos;t quite a walking guide, it turned out, so much as a guide, who appeared to have been cajoled into doing some walking. What do you normally do with your tourists, Fred? I asked. &quot;Shopping. Always shopping. Sightseeing. Eating. But mostly people come here to shop.&quot; Not walking then? &quot;Oh no!&quot; We were starting off with the Dragon&apos;s Back trail, a gentle warm-up on Hong Kong island, about a 20-minute cab ride away. I really couldn&apos;t believe that a 20-minute cab-ride could take you anywhere remotely wild, but by the time we had climbed to the first viewpoint, it was spectacular: undulating hills covered with thick vegetation, a series of beautiful bays, and not a soul to be seen. It&apos;s the best urban hike in the world, according to Time magazine, although apart from a distant tower or two, and a couple of far-off villages, it didn&apos;t feel very urban at all. Over the top of the hill was the throbbing metropolis, the gorgeous shimmering Bank of China tower designed by IM Pei, and Norman Foster&apos;s HSBC tower, then the as-yet-unfinished International Finance Centre, which Batman jumps off in The Dark Knight. But on this side, butterflies fluttered in the breeze, and the sea shimmered in the distance. &quot;What&apos;s that building on the cliff top over there?&quot; I asked Fred, thinking it must be some millionaire&apos;s pad. &quot;That,&quot; said Fred, &quot;is a prison.&quot; There was something else bothering me. Where was everybody? &quot;They are working. Maybe some come at the weekend but Hong Kong people are very lazy. Take me. On Sunday, I sleep until maybe one o&apos;clock and then I go and see my family and eat a very big lunch.&quot;  The amazing thing about Hong Kong is that it is both one of the most populated cities in the world, and one of the least populated countries ... well, not a country, a &quot;territory&quot;, but you know what I mean. Everybody lives in tiny flats in soaring skyscrapers but only some 30% of the land is built on. Because of Britain&apos;s world-leading position in petty bureaucratic planning rules - and here feel your patriotic heart swell with pride - the other 70% is countryside, most of it protected national park. Parts of it are nothing less than breathtaking. The next day, I went out into the Sai Kung national park in the New Territories with an outfit called Kayak and Hike, set up by an Australian called Paul Etherington, and couldn&apos;t believe that I wasn&apos;t in Thailand or back a hundred years in time - give or take the fact that we were in an ex-police powerboat of the type that tends to get blown up in Bond films. We zoomed out into the South China Sea, past tiny wooden boats containing fishermen wearing conical bamboo hats of the type I&apos;ve only ever seen in blatant racist stereotyping, past towering sea-cliffs and circling sea-eagles and postcard-perfect white sand beaches and the occasional semi-abandoned village or lone building.  &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; I asked Paul, thinking that it was perhaps a simple traveller&apos;s hostel rather like the ones you get on Thai beaches.  &quot;A drug rehabilitation unit.&quot; This is the madness of Hong Kong. Anywhere else, it would be a boutique hotel, but here people have been too busy working to take time to appreciate the glories of nature, so it has been left to the junkies and prisoners. Even the tourists don&apos;t come here. Everybody else on the boat either lived in Hong Kong, had lived in Hong Kong, or was visiting relatives in Hong Kong. &quot;I&apos;ve tried for years to get tourists out with us,&quot; said Paul. &quot;But they&apos;re just not interested. I think they prefer to go shopping.&quot;  They&apos;re mad. Really, they are. We stopped at a tiny village and then got into kayaks and paddled out to a crumbling sea arch, although the sea was too rough to go through it, and then off to a deserted beach where we snorkelled above a coral reef, climbed a hill to get a view of the bay, and then paddled back to the village, where we had a slap-up lunch in a simple fish restaurant.  It&apos;s a grand day out by any reckoning. And half an hour after zooming over the waves in the Bond boat, I was back among the skyscrapers of Central making plans to meet Pete and Zuzana in a bar. &quot;It&apos;s the best city break in the world!&quot; I said. All the joys of a big Asian city, and none of the stuff you feel obliged to do on most minibreaks: the sightseeing, the museums, the shopping. Instead, it&apos;s all the spirit-lifting, feel-good, hard-earned kicks you get from a walking holiday.  The next day, I head for Lamma, an island a half-hour ferry from Central, and can&apos;t believe I&apos;m just 30 minutes away from one of the financial centres of the world economy, in a hippy enclave that is one of the last vestiges of the old trans-Asian overland trail.  There are no cars, just bicycles, and notices everywhere for &quot;Free Healing&quot; and &quot;Psychic Massages&quot; and little shops selling dodgy handmade tie-dyed things last in fashion around 1969. And everywhere, ageing western men with greying ponytails who washed up here in the Seventies and appear not to have heard that Hong Kong has become a financial powerhouse, is part of the People&apos;s Republic, and that shrooms are now illegal.  It&apos;s lovely, though, Lamma. Once you&apos;re past an ugly power station, and the hippy bead shops, it has endless footpaths and a rugged coastline. At a beach at the far end, there is just enough civilisation - spotless showers and changing rooms - and a slightly disconcerting notice: &quot;Please note that we have taken down the shark nets for annual maintenance.&quot; I swim anyway but keep feeling things brush past my legs, make a quick exit, and head back to Central and the sharkless water of the rooftop pool of the Four Seasons hotel. I swim back and forth in the fading light, with the neon lights of the skyscrapers all around me, as transcendental an experience as you can have on any Lamma shroom. I&apos;ve gone, deliberately, in the best month - November - when the raging humidity has subsided and the skies are blue and clear. There are other Asian cities, such as Shanghai, that are even buzzier and more exciting; or more exotic ones, like Beijing; but what Hong Kong has, like Sydney and San Francisco have, is an amazing natural setting that dwarfs even its tallest buildings and its busiest highways. With Fred, I climb Lantau Peak, Hong Kong&apos;s second-highest mountain - a relentless vertical slog, capped with amazing views. But the highlight is my day back in the Sai Kung national park with Pete, who wants to take me to his favourite beach. We do a four-hour walk that culminates at a tiny semi-abandoned village, Ham Tin, on a gorgeous deserted beach and eat delicious beef fried noodles in a beach-side shack. &quot;Wow,&quot; I say. &quot;You&apos;re right. This beach is amazing.&quot; &quot;Oh no,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re not there yet.&quot; And we climb over a final headland to the kind of beach I&apos;ve only ever seen in a Seventies aftershave advert - long, rugged, backed by dunes and jagged hills, and pounded by surf. It&apos;s completely undeveloped and we had planned to camp but Pete had an early shift the next day, and since the sun was setting we figured we ought to start on the two-hour walk back to the nearest stretch of road and the bus stop. And then we see the boat. It has brought in provisions for the restaurant and the boatman agrees to take us back to Sai Kung, the nearest town, for 20 quid a head.  &quot;What a bargain!&quot; says Pete. &quot;I love a boat ride.&quot; &quot;Me too!&quot; I cry and we take photos of each other larking around on the beach before getting on board. When I look at them later, they remind me of photos of young men playing cricket on the playing fields of Eton shortly before being slaughtered in the Great War. We were so innocent! It takes about two and a half minutes to realise that we have made a terrible, terrible mistake. It&apos;s a flat-bottomed motor boat, the sun is setting, and as soon as we&apos;re out of the little bay, the waves are huge. Of course! That&apos;s why there was such good surf. There&apos;s a single piece of rope to hold on to and we keep on hitting the waves at strange angles and ploughing into the troughs, and the boat is very light and very flat and I&apos;m no marine engineer but this strikes me as not ideal when it comes to not capsizing. In the dark. In the middle of the South China Sea.  &quot;We&apos;ve gone on holiday by mistake!&quot; I say, a line from Withnail &amp; I, although I&apos;m not sure Pete gets the allusion, seeing as how he&apos;s clinging to the rope and making strangulated noises. &quot;What&apos;s the worst that can happen?&quot; I shout over the wind with extremely faux bravado. &quot;We&apos;ll get wet.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s like concrete at this speed!&quot;  I think back longingly to my day out on the James Bond powerboat. A lovely bit of soft adventure as opposed to the half-hour, white-knuckle, terror boat ride from hell, but then the marvellous thing about near-death experiences is that when you don&apos;t actually die, the adrenaline high makes you realise why people go sky-diving or take cocaine. We arrive back in Sai Kung in the pitch dark, our legs shaking, our hair at 90-degree angles to our heads, laughing semi-hysterically. Thirty minutes later, we step off the metro, in the gleaming Central station, still in our walking boots and with crazy hair, and bump into some friends of Pete&apos;s before joining them in a city slicker bar. They have spent the day in the office. We feel as if we&apos;ve come back from the moon. It&apos;s the best city break in the world, I tell you.

It is home to China&apos;s only &quot;wetland park&quot;, Xixi, which covers more than 26,000 acres, and the beautiful West Lake national park, with paths through the hills that are ideal for hiking or mountain biking, and cross-country skiing and tobaganning in winter.  visithangzhou.com  GranadaFamed for the Alhambra palace and its atmospheric gypsy quarter, Granada is also just a 20-minute drive from the dramatic peaks of the Sierra Nevada national park, the second-highest massif in western Europe. Thanks to its rare plant, bird and animal species, this is a designated biosphere reserve, with horse riding, bike and hiking trails winding their way across the peaks. In the winter, the fast road through the park means you can be skiing down the pistes in the morning, before soaking up the winter sunshine in the city centre for a late lunch.  turgranada.es", "tags": ["Hong Kong holidays", "China holidays", "Walking holidays", "Camping holidays", "Flights", "Hotels", "Los Angeles holidays", "Kenya holidays", "Granada holidays", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-04T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/04/andy-murray-qatar-open-doha-tennis", "sentences": ["For similar reasons that he bust a gut to beat Federer at the ATP year-end championships in Shanghai when he was already certain of a semi-final place, Murray wanted to better Federer and Nadal this time around, too."], "title": "Tennis: Andy Murray begins his defence of the Qatar Open in fine form and confident mood", "article": "Most people have been looking forward to this week&apos;s Qatar Open producing the first rematch between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer since their sensational Wimbledon final six months ago. But suddenly Andy Murray, who beat both players in the same tournament for the first time last week, and who has the chance of another semi-final with Federer here, seems capable of preventing that much-desired encounter. True, the Scot&apos;s two big wins were \u00adunofficial, because the so-called World Championship in Abu Dhabi was an exhibition, while the Qatar Open starting on Monday is the first tournament on the 2009 ATP World Tour and results count for ranking points and prize money. But neither Nadal nor Federer, who were Sunday being photographed playing on top of a dhow in finger-stiffening cold, would compete in either event but for the huge appearance money. Both regard the actual tennis only as preparation for the Australian Open in a fortnight&apos;s time, and for which match practice is at a premium. Do Murray&apos;s wins therefore really count for much? Psychologically, they do. For similar reasons that he bust a gut to beat Federer at the ATP year-end championships in Shanghai when he was already certain of a semi-final place, Murray wanted to better Federer and Nadal this time around, too. Each win increases the world No4&apos;s feeling that he belongs alongside them at the top of the game. Murray has quickly added four kilos and a heavier reputation and if he is gaining weight of shot as well to add to his mobility, guile and skill, he will be formidable indeed. Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras \u2013 and even Nadal and Federer themselves \u2013 have suggested Murray is ready for a grand slam title; now he feels able to suggest it himself. &quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m aiming for,&quot; the Scot said on Saturday when asked about his Australian Open title aspirations. &quot;This victory [in Abu Dhabi against Nadal] was good before I go to Australia,&quot; he added. &quot;I have never been past the fourth round there. I trained hard over the break and the victories over the past three days have given me confidence. &quot;I know I am closer to winning that grand slam title than I have ever been. I&apos;ve proved I can win against these guys. I have always said I want to win a major. Going into a new season, I don&apos;t think that brings any added pressure.&quot; All this sounds like a new Murray. However, he is not quite as new as he sounds in the 2009 ATP World Tour guide, which quoted him as saying his serve is the best part of his game. That&apos;s not yet true, although he may like it to be, and would certainly like opponents to think so. Given that his first delivery has improved in its ability to earn cheap points, if not in the consistency required to impose prolonged pressure, the bluff is worthwhile. Tomorrow Murray will be promoting tennis among local children, and on Tuesday he begins his title defence against Albert Monta\u00f1\u00e9s, the world No43 from Spain. He will hope to proceed via a comfortable-looking second round and a likely quarter-final with Christophe Rochus of Belgium or Dmitry Tursunov of Russia to another semi-final with Federer on Friday. But little is certain at this time of the year; and certainly not in such unseasonably low temperatures.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport", "Roger Federer"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-04T17:10:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/05/china-russia", "sentences": ["The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) brings together almost half the world&apos;s population, several members own nuclear weapons, many are big energy suppliers, and it includes some of the world&apos;s fastest-growing economies."], "title": "Marcel de Haas: Central Asia's waking giant", "article": "The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) brings together almost half the world&apos;s population, several members own nuclear weapons, many are big energy suppliers, and it includes some of the world&apos;s fastest-growing economies. Yet few outside Central Asia have heard much about it. The SCO emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union in 1996. Today, its members are Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, while Mongolia, Iran, Pakistan and India are observers. Russia and China remain the lead actors. Since its launch, the SCO&apos;s military exercises have become increasingly ambitious, growing from largely bilateral to inclusion of all members. The SCO is also beginning to work together in the fight against drug trafficking and organised crime.  Until recently, the SCO&apos;s members addressed energy issues only bilaterally. But, in order to coordinate energy strategies and strengthen energy security, last year the organisation launched a club that unites energy-producing and energy-consuming states, transit countries, and private companies. The SCO promotes free trade, too, and aims to build essential infrastructure such as roads and railways to link its members and boost commerce between them while also harmonising customs systems and tariffs.  Yet cooperation within the SCO remains focused on national rather than collective objectives, because its members&apos; interests vary so much. China, for example, seeks markets for its products and further energy resources, while Russia aims to use the SCO to promote its anti-Western agenda. The group&apos;s other members \u2013 led by China and Kazakhstan \u2013 want to strengthen their already robust levels of economic cooperation with the west. Thus, for example, at the SCO summit in August, Russia did not get the support of other members regarding the Georgia conflict. These diverging objectives make it hard to believe that the SCO will ever evolve into an eastern version of Nato. True, its members have held joint military exercises and have expressed a desire to build the SCO into a more mature security organization. But the SCO still lacks many essential elements of a full-grown Nato-style security organization.  The SCO has no integrated military-political structure, and no permanent operational headquarters. It has no rapid-reaction force and does not engage in regular political deliberations. Nato&apos;s focus is on external security risks, while the SCO&apos;s members target security issues within their own territories. It makes sense for the west, particularly the European Union, to seek cooperation with the SCO, as this would also help counter Russia&apos;s attempts to use it as a tool for its anti-western policies. It would also prevent the SCO from turning into a militarised entity. These may look like negative reasons for the EU to engage with the SCO, but there are also ample positive reasons for encouraging cooperation. Europe needs energy supplies from Central Asia, and Central Asia needs European investment. Another sphere of mutual interest is Afghanistan. At present, the EU offers financial support to the Afghan government and helps to train its police and judiciary. The SCO has established a contact group with Afghanistan. Both sides want to do more, and they might be able to make a greater impact by working together rather than separately. The EU has money and the SCO organisation, most of whose members border Afghanistan, has trained personnel and direct experience in the region. Cooperation with Nato also looks strategically wise. Given China&apos;s importance in both military and economic matters, growing energy and trade relations between Central Asia and the west, and the reasonable assumption that Central Asia&apos;s security will continue to have great significance for western security, cooperation between the SCO, the EU, and Nato looks inevitable. This is all the more true in view of the common security threats faced by Nato and the SCO in Central Asia, such as al-Qaida and Taliban-sponsored terrorism and drug trafficking.  But both Nato and the SCO have so far hesitated to engage in closer contact. It is hard to discern whether Nato has any opinion at all about the SCO. At best, Nato seems to regard it as being neither a problem nor an opportunity. Reaching out to the SCO would certainly seem to support Nato&apos;s stated objectives. After 9/11, the alliance came to the conclusion that threats may need to be dealt with on a worldwide basis, which explains Nato&apos;s presence in Afghanistan. As a part of this global strategy, Nato strengthened its relations with partners elsewhere, including in Southeast Asia which is the SCO&apos;s chief area of responsibility. Perhaps inevitably, the SCO \u2013 and Russia and China as its leading members \u2013 regards Nato&apos;s increased presence in the region with some distrust. As long as Nato remains reluctant to enter into a dialogue with the SCO, such a cautious attitude looks set to linger, and may even intensify. Consideration also needs to be given, therefore, to the establishment of a Nato-China Council, along the lines of the Nato-Russia Council, and to the creation of arrangements that would facilitate greater cooperation with the SCO as a whole. Such cooperation would not bridge the main differences between SCO members and the west over issues like democratisation and human rights. Cooperation would also need to comprise much more than mere joint policy development, and should involve the practical pursuit of mutually beneficial, smaller-scale ad hoc projects. Nato and the SCO could work together on neutralising anti-personnel mines in Afghanistan, as well as other possible types of confidence-building measures, such as joint police training and counter-narcotics operations. If security cooperation is to be a success, politically sensitive issues should be avoided, with the emphasis squarely on practical measures. This approach would serve the interests of the EU, Nato, the SCO&apos;s members, and, not least, Afghanistan.

The most recent boost of course was the central government&apos;s RMB 4 trillion (US$585 billion) economic stimulus package, which includes RMB 350 billion (US$36.5 billion) for environmental projects, such as waste-water treatment and renewable energy facilities. The benefits of this government-backed stimulus are already being felt as there has been a surge in government-solicited bids for environmental projects across the country. This of course has led to new investor optimism. The private consulting firm, the CleanTech Group, reported that investors at its recent December conference in Shanghai see no slowdown in the Chinese cleantech industry. Meanwhile, the super-ministry National Development Reform Commission recently reported that for the 4th quarter alone, investments in the country&apos;s rural water resources and energy facilities, such as biogas, topped over RMB 22 billion (US$3.2 billion). While all this is no doubt good news for Chinese green industries and the country&apos;s quest to improve its environmental quality, investors seeking to make a quick profit from this growth must beware. The reason is simple: while significantly improving, the Chinese green sector remains an extremely competitive industry that is fraught with challenges in which only the strongest companies can thrive. One key challenge is costs. While labor is no doubt cheaper in China than elsewhere, the Chinese business climate is still exposed to withering competitive pressure, and firms must constantly find ways to make lower-priced products. However, Chinese manufacturing expenditures have surged, particularly on raw materials, many of which must be imported. For example, the August 2008 Chinese purchaser prices for raw materials, fuel and power jumped by 15.3 percent compared to the same period in 2007. These pains are particularly being felt by the Chinese photovoltaic firms who pay as much as 100 percent more than their global competitors for imported supplies of silicon needed to produce the wafers. This added cost often negates the competitive advantage in labor costs. Another challenge is the lack of human capital. While China has no shortage of smart people, the brightest minds are entering more lucrative industries, such as finance and information technology. These companies can quickly turn around profits, as opposed to the environmental companies whose revenue streams may take years to develop. The result is that many Chinese green companies face a deficit of human capital, unless they are willing to pay top notch salaries. Perhaps the most important challenge is that the market for environmental goods and services remains fragmented because of the undeveloped regulatory infrastructure. No doubt, the country has been strengthening its environmental laws and increasing the powers of its environmental agencies. However, enforcement remains weak. For example, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) found in an investigation of the country&apos;s 500 largest firms that more than 40 percent failed to adopt the necessary environmental abatement measures (story in english) they promised in their environmental impact reports. MEP also reported that only one-third of the country&apos;s completed waste-water treatment projects are operating at capacity. As a result, China still faces severe pollution problems. According to MEP, the number of reported serious polluting incidents throughout China is increasing by 30 percent annually with one incident now being reported every 2 days. For sure, China remains a fertile ground for greentech entrepreneurs to not only help improve the country&apos;s environment, but earn substantial profits while doing so. But given the cut-throat competitive environment and other market challenges, the success of any particular firm is by no means guaranteed. Investors seeking to profit from China&apos;s environmental cleanup drive should look for firms that have the right combination of human capital, business skills, and strategy. \u2022 This article was shared by our content partner World Resources Institute, part of the Guardian Environment Network", "tags": ["Renewable energy", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-05T16:56:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/06/china-internet-censorship", "sentences": ["&quot;They have used all kinds of ways to distribute content that is low-class, crude and even vulgar, gravely damaging mores on the internet.&quot; Last month, Shanghai police detained a woman who sought to profit after her involvement in a sex video that became an online sensation."], "title": "China cracks down on 'vulgar' online searches", "article": "Chinese officials yesterday launched a crackdown on &quot;vulgar&quot; websites including Google and the country&apos;s leading search engine, Baidu.

The issue is particularly sensitive in China because of the heavy censorship of political and social discussion.

Gradually, it dawned on them that they were witnessing Germany&apos;s clandestine preparations to &quot;traverse the North Sea and throw themselves bodily upon English shores&quot;. Carruthers and Davies may have been fictional characters in Erskine Childers&apos;s novel The Riddle of the Sands, but the German &quot;plot&quot; they uncovered was deemed realistic enough to alert Lord Selborne, the first lord of the Admiralty, that such an invasion was a possibility and that Britain needed to have better intelligence about such risks. So it was, in 1909, with rumours of German spies gathering information in British naval ports, that the Secret Service Bureau was established. The first head of the military section, later known as MI5, was Vernon Kell, or K, as he was called, a young army captain and polyglot whose father had fought in the Zulu wars and who had himself been in Shanghai during the Boxer rebellion. His initial staff consisted of a single clerk. By the start of the first world war, with the number of officers increased to 14, MI5 was fully functioning and had uncovered a real network of German spies in Britain who were sending back messages written in invisible ink. One of them, an Islington hairdresser, Karl Ernst, was arrested for espionage and sentenced to hard labour. Between the wars, attention focused on the growth of the Communist party and on homegrown fascist groups. But the service was seen as underprepared at the outbreak of the second world war and the prime minister, Winston Churchill, replaced Kell in 1940, first with Brigadier &quot;Jasper&quot; Harker and then Sir David Petrie. A revamped service enjoyed some spectacular successes during the war, with more than 100 German agents caught and many of them turned into double agents.  One double agent, Agent Garbo, whose real name was Juan Pujol, helped to mislead Germany over the location of the allies&apos; Normandy landings in 1944 and sent back a &quot;confusing bulk&quot; of information, all the while pretending to be a fanatical fascist anxious only to serve his f\u00fchrer. Another remarkable agent was Eddie Chapman, a safe-blower who was serving a jail sentence in Jersey when the Germans invaded the Channel Islands. The Germans recruited him, codenamed him Little Fritz and parachuted him back into England, where he promptly presented himself to MI5. He became a double agent after being debriefed by the monocled Lieutenant Colonel Robin &quot;Tin Eye&quot; Stephens, who made him Agent Zigzag, later the subject of books and films. After the second world war, attention shifted firmly to the Soviet Union&apos;s influence and the prime minister, Clement Attlee, announced that communists as well as fascists could be excluded from work connected with state security. By the 1950s, as the cold war reached its frozen depths, MI5 had increased its numbers to 850 and the Soviet Union had meanwhile recruited a number of British sympathisers in the shape of diplomats and Foreign Office officials, most famously Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt. The first three defected, while Blunt became a royal art historian before being exposed in 1979 and stripped of his knighthood.  The cold war was also MI5&apos;s most controversial period, with peace activists, trade unionists, civil libertarians, nuclear disarmers, radical journalists, Irish republicans and assorted reds of different shades falling under suspicion and often being investigated in ludicrous circumstances. Those on whom files were opened included the future government ministers Jack Straw, Peter Mandelson, Harriet Harman and Patricia Hewitt.  In the mid-1970s, Harold Wilson, the prime minister, became suspicious that he himself was being spied on by MI5. A former Security Service officer, Peter Wright, in his book Spycatcher, elaborated on this theme with a claim that about 30 officers were part of a plot to overthrow the government - a claim later dismissed after an inquiry. There were other setbacks for the service. One MI5 man, Michael Bettaney, offered to work for the Soviet Union but was caught in the act and jailed in 1984 for 23 years, a sentence completed 10 years ago. Another former agent, David Shayler, was jailed briefly under the Official Secrets Act in 2002 after he spilled embarrassing beans to the Mail on Sunday. In 2000, Straw, now home secretary, said that MI5 had files on 440,000 people. Under pressure, MI5 eventually became more public, naming its director general for the first time when Stella Rimington was appointed in 1992.  Now there is an MI5 website that runs a section on &quot;myths and misunderstandings&quot; in which it attempts to persuade a sceptical public that it does not carry out assassinations, never plotted against Harold Wilson and does not &quot;help terrorists by making secret information publicly available on its website&quot;. Rimington now writes spy fiction. Carruthers and Davies would have been astonished. \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 25 March 2009.

I, for one, would be happy for this custom to die out", "article": "India has long held the record as the world&apos;s largest consumer of gold. But now China is catching up. For me and many Indians, China is a constant reminder of what we are not, and what we could be if we tried hard enough. We compare ourselves to China constantly: computer programmer cousins of mine come home to laud the skyscrapers of Shanghai and the ring roads of Beijing. But I for one will be quite happy to see the day India falls behind in the gold race. India&apos;s huge appetite for gold has its origins in deep-rooted customs. The birth of a new baby prompts the new mother&apos;s parents to buy, as is their duty, gold for the grandchild \u2013 which for most Indians means a small chain, anklets and even a gold loin chain. When a young girl comes of age, it falls to uncles to come visiting laden with jewels and gifts. Then the girl gets married. This is where the fun begins. This time it is not just the maternal uncles and grandparents who cough up. The mother of the bride is stripped of her ornaments, which are converted to new gold. Assuming her daughter conceives, a ceremony takes place in the seventh month of her pregnancy, when she receives further jewels and anything left over from the promised dowry. As a young trainee doctor, I used to look after women in the burns ward. It is an unpleasant task for anyone, but to the sole female trainee goes the job of delivering all the premature babies whose mother&apos;s body has been badly burned, and thus rejects the added burden of another life. In the burns unit, the women always outnumbered men with ease; and never once in my difficult time there have I seen a mother-in-law on whom the kerosene stove had &quot;accidentally&quot; fallen. Night after night I lay shivering and waiting for the call. It was always either young men who had burned themselves in an attempt to take their own lives, or it was the daughter-in-law. Many times she was seven to eight months pregnant \u2013 the time when her family are expected to arrive laden with gifts. One can do nothing but wonder at the timing of the stoves and kerosene lamps. By the time I finished my placement there, I stopped even speculating about such things; I was on to more practical issues \u2013 doing a preferential mapping of the burns area: please God, let there be no burns on the abdomen; it will be difficult to listen to the baby. The scenario among the middle classes in India is quite different. Shortly before a cousin&apos;s wedding recently, I helped my aunt sort out the bride&apos;s jewels. The necklaces, bangles and earrings had to be worn for different ceremonies and the same jewel could not be worn twice. I told her that I had heard that even the Queen of England wore the same jewellery more than once. I was asked to leave my English ideas back in England. And I assure you that mine is just an upper middle class family. As I took a breath of fresh air that night, I watched a pig wallowing in the gutter of the sewage channel that runs along the front of the house. Shouldn&apos;t one deal with open sewage before hoarding diamonds and gold? But what do I know? I sounded my uncle out. He asked what would happen if &quot;luxuries&quot; like clearing the sewage and the pig stood in the way of my cousin getting a well settled life. What if they meant we couldn&apos;t afford the extra 20g of gold as a dowry for the boy with a good job in America? In India, gold is not just a litmus test of one&apos;s status.

The national tourist administration said the total fell by 2% to 130m. Shao Qiwei, head of the administration, blamed the fall in visitors squarely on the global financial slump.

She would pay one yuan - roughly 10p - for a kilogram of plastic. Around the corner in Shi Yuhai&apos;s yard, the offer was no better. Wu shrugged his shoulders and began to heave bags from his tricycle on to the scales. &quot;One kuai [yuan] here, one kuai there - everywhere&apos;s the same these days. This industry has broken down,&quot; he grumbled.  Wu is one of 160,000 collectors in Beijing who make a living from the detritus of urban life - plastic sheeting, office printouts, bottles, radiators and scraps of cardboard. Recycling has become a global industry and China is the largest importer of the world&apos;s waste materials, taking in as much as a third of Britain&apos;s recyclables for example. Then came the slump, decimating the Chinese recycling industry and leaving Britain, the US and others grappling with growing volumes of recycled waste and nowhere to send it. &quot;It&apos;s a canary in the coalmine: it&apos;s the front and back end of industry,&quot; said Adam Minter, who runs the Shanghai Scrap blog and specialises in the metal trade. &quot;Until about eight weeks ago, for example, the entire [US] west coast paper market was sent to China and most of it was sent south. It was processed and made into packaging for products that then shipped back to the US ... But when US consumer demand dropped off, that broke the cycle.&quot; Across the scrap trade, prices have halved or worse in a matter of months. Each link in the chain is disintegrating, from factories to scrapyards to collectors such as Wu, 56, a former farmer who now plans to return to Hubei province.  Official media reported that four-fifths of China&apos;s recycling units had closed and that millions will eventually be left without employment.  Dongxiaokou, on the outskirts of Beijing, is a village composed of scrap: blocks of crushed metal are stacked in a tower, heaps of plastic bottles glint in the sunshine and piles of newspapers and rags fill yards. But the merchants all have the same story - they have lost tens of thousands of pounds in a few months, wiping out years of hard work.  Shi puffed on a cigarette as he counted out notes for Wu. &quot;I&apos;ve been in this business for 15 years and it&apos;s been bad before, but never this severe. Everyone&apos;s lost a huge amount of money and some can&apos;t sell their stock,&quot; he said. &quot;Usually we sell to factories and they recycle them into plastic chips. But the price of chips has dropped so it&apos;s had a knock-on effect on us.&quot; This area deals in domestic waste rather than imports, but Shi said every part of the industry had been affected.  Beijing dealers have taken a particularly hard hit. They stockpiled large quantities of recyclables because prices were soaring, but as the market began to soften, the Olympic security clampdown prevented trucks from entering the capital. The merchants could only watch as the value of their holdings plummeted.  &quot;In a good year we can earn about 50,000 yuan but this year we lost 200,000,&quot; said Gong Rongchuan, 45, whose yard lies across the rutted alley from Shi&apos;s. &quot;We came here more than 10 years ago and at the beginning we collected ourselves. Then we managed to start the business. We were too poor to get loans but we managed to borrow 100,000-200,000 from friends and relatives and we work from morning to night every day. But we haven&apos;t paid them all back because of our losses.&quot; Minter says the predicament is typical of the trade. &quot;People would borrow money from relatives and buy a container of scrap and then throw all that money back in and reinvest it. Great if it goes up - but the moment it starts slipping, especially if it&apos;s slipping 20-30%, you&apos;re finished,&quot; he said. Gong said: &quot;Once we have sold all this stock we&apos;ll leave. My son&apos;s sorting it because we can&apos;t afford workers any more. We haven&apos;t figured out what to do next. We have seven people in the family and only 2.5-3 mu [less than half an acre] of farmland. It&apos;s too many people and too little land, so even if we go home there&apos;s not much we can do. We have both old and young to support.&quot;  The effects can be felt across China. Most of Gong&apos;s customers were plastics recyclers in Wen&apos;an, Hebei, where by one estimate 93% of income depends on the trade. Some are already bankrupt. Wen&apos;an Dongdu Jiacheng Recycling Resources is clinging on. But Miss Han, a materials buyer, said all but three of the 26 production line workers had been sent home for the new year holiday more than a month early.  There is no longer demand for plastic granules from nearby companies such as Hongkai Plastic Products, which made items such as bicycle handlebars. Its owner, Mr Zheng, has sent 20 workers home. &quot;My factory was hit by the economic crisis - it&apos;s been closed for two months already,&quot; he said. &quot;We usually sell our products to a dealer and most of his business is exports.

Mopping up after the botched launch of Heathrow Terminal 5 included fielding accusations of poor performance from British Airways and enduring a public haranguing from MPs. A self-confessed obsessive about &quot;operational stuff&quot;, the head of Britain&apos;s largest airport operator believes that the group can fend off hordes of critics if it does a better job running its main asset. &quot;If you don&apos;t have Heathrow working well your legs are chopped off at the knees in any argument you make,&quot; he says.  Environmental campaigners, politicians and thousands of local residents are hacking away at BAA and Gordon Brown over plans to expand Britain&apos;s biggest airport. The government could announce as soon as next week that it approves the construction of a third runway, accompanied by a relaxation of flight restrictions that will see more planes using the existing runways. It will unleash a backlash that will dwarf the fury over security queues, poor service and T5 that has dogged BAA since 2006. The parochial issue of improving Britain&apos;s derided international airport will collide with the global fight against climate change. Matthews, the man in the middle, discusses the emotive topic in the same direct and pragmatic manner that persuaded BAA to hire him last year to tackle irate customers and dodgy infrastructure. It is a temperament that will be tested by public and political anger over Heathrow. This time, BAA will not be confronted by airport users but a broad constituency of communities, green groups and MPs. &quot;How can anyone take pleasure in stirring up people&apos;s lives and making them move if they don&apos;t wish to move or have noise that they don&apos;t want to have? Personally, and I hope as a company generally, we are hugely sympathetic to that.&quot;  It could be read as an apology for what he hopes will be the go-ahead for a project that by 2020 would demolish 700 homes, expose 20 schools to high noise pollution and increase the annual total of flights from 480,000 to 702,000.  Staff at BAA&apos;s modest Heathrow headquarters are preparing for a decade of attrition if the government says it will back a planning application. An attempt to draw Matthews on the difficulty of reconciling economic growth with environmentally responsible policies also reveals a sensitivity over the issue of whether, in the case of Heathrow, the government is choosing financial imperatives over environmental care. &quot;You are making a false distinction, as if profits are for someone else. They fuel pension plans and provide jobs.&quot; Thin line Opponents of the runway, including senior government figures, argue that the environment should be at the fore, ahead of economic benefits. After all, Britain is committed to an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and Heathrow&apos;s expansion will push noise and air pollution standards to their limit. Matthews, treading that thin line between economic gain and environmental loss, argues that there is no point scrapping runway plans in order to meet CO2 targets if planes that would have landed or taken off from Heathrow&apos;s third runway go to Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol or Frankfurt instead. &quot;It is possible that London will be at the end of a branch line. It is possible that, in order to get to most of the world&apos;s long-haul destinations you will have to go through Paris or Schiphol. That&apos;s transferring carbon dioxide from one place to another. It imposes net damage on the UK economy and it&apos;s not a net gain for the environment.&quot;  This argument antagonises environmental campaigners, who state that CO2 reductions should be a global priority and should be backed by a moratorium on all runway construction. It also undermines the government&apos;s aim to be a leader in the global response to climate change, say opponents. The response to a question about the impact on local residents also draws a tacit admission from Matthews that the environment and the economy are awkward bedfellows.  &quot;You can have both [limited environmental impact and economic gain] and you need to have both,&quot; he says, adding that carbon trading will help mitigate Heathrow&apos;s environmental impacts. &quot;But I am not suggesting that this is an easy decision. The environment debate has various dimensions. There are climate-change dimensions and there is the impact on local communities. Local communities benefit from the jobs but don&apos;t enjoy the noise. You cannot close Heathrow in order to prevent planes flying over west London and not think about the jobs impact.&quot;  Matthews, who gained a reputation as safe pair of hands as chief executive of services group Hays and utility firm Severn Trent, is not a likely candidate for prophet of doom. However, it is an important mantle for anyone backing a third runway. Without expansion, says BAA, Heathrow will wither away and become a minor airport serving far fewer destinations than its rivals.  Heathrow is a hub airport, which means many passengers fly into it in order to take a connecting flight elsewhere, choosing from around 180 destinations. Its owner believes that without expansion the delays caused by its two congested runways will drive those passengers to other airports that offer connections to the same destinations without the &quot;Heathrow hassle&quot;.  Connectedness As a consequence, routes such as Heathrow to Bangalore and Shanghai will be rendered unprofitable and dropped, forcing passengers and airlines to look elsewhere. If that happens, says Matthews, multinational businesses will quit the UK and jobs will follow. &quot;If you are a financial services company and your headquarters is in Canary Wharf, you normally ask where your main base should be every five years. One of the issues you consider is your connectedness to the global markets you serve. Right at the top of business travellers&apos; concerns is the availability of direct flights and frequency. Heathrow provides that with its network.&quot;  So why not lift the landing fee caps on Heathrow in order to reflect its premium to business passengers? It would mean higher ticket prices as steeper fees are passed on, but business passengers are relatively immune to price changes and it would have the added benefit of freeing up much needed space by pricing out some of the leisure flights that help gum up the airport. That way, Heathrow stays a two-runway operation with the economy remaining unscathed.  Well versed in these arguments by now, Matthews points out that business passengers are not in a majority and that you need leisure passengers, supplemented by people on family visits, to keep long-haul routes viable.  Perhaps the anti-runway lobby should hire Christopher Clarke of the Competition Commission. Towards the end of the interview Matthews admits in effect that he cannot win over the chair of the commission investigation into BAA, who is likely to recommend that Stansted, Gatwick and Edinburgh airports are sold against BAA&apos;s wishes, leaving it with four airports including Heathrow.  Matthews says: &quot;There are some real issues where we disagree but I have to be realistic. We might not succeed in winning those arguments. It is one thing to have a technical argument with the commission but there is also the weight of public opinion that we are fighting.&quot;  If the government approves a third runway this month, that battle against public wrath will enter a new phase.

On Broadway, Hairspray and Grease have packed their bags, while in London, Spamalot has closed with no word about the tour that was rumoured. The West End will also be bidding farewell to The Sound of Music and Avenue Q before the weather warms up. Those of us with a ray of sunshine in our souls can look ahead with excitement to some new openings. There&apos;s the bilingual West Side Story on Broadway; London is now the proud host of Thriller at the Lyric; and later this year, Whoopi Goldberg brings her production of Sister Act to the Palladium. Plus, after the disappointment of Jimmy Osmond curtailing his run in Grease before it even started, you can cheer yourself up with the news that he&apos;s heading out on the road to play Billy Flynn in the UK tour of Chicago. Still, if it&apos;s a dose of theatrical schadenfreude you&apos;re after, there&apos;s always Andrew Lloyd Webber to keep you entertained. The king of all British theatre (if you believe the Stage) has bagged his yearly slot on prime-time BBC1 by promising to write a fabulous entry for this year&apos;s Eurovision song contest. So far, so good. However, he&apos;s poisoned the chalice for himself somewhat by declaring that the UK&apos;s previous decade of Eurovision failures were entirely down to the fact that the songs were rubbish. One trusts he will adhere to that rationale should his own offering bag nul points in Moscow come May. Worrying about Eurovision clearly isn&apos;t taking up too much of Lloyd Webber&apos;s time, as he&apos;s got big plans for the Phantom sequel, Love Never Dies, which he wants to launch in three cities simultaneously \u2013 London, New York and Shanghai. Lloyd Webber obviously sees himself as musical theatre&apos;s equivalent of John Harvey-Jones at the moment, because he&apos;s been revisiting his old shows and trying to figure out why they weren&apos;t as successful as he thought they would be. For The Woman in White, he&apos;s decided it&apos;s Wilkie Collins&apos;s fault for not plotting something sufficiently sophisticated and enthralling for 21st-century audiences: &quot;It was a novel about a faked birth certificate \u2013 and people said, &apos;So what?&apos; That was our mistake \u2013 if ever I revisited the piece, we would have to stop at the point where it is revealed that the sisters are swapped in the asylum,&quot; he declared this week. Marvellous. Expect him also to rewrite the end of Starlight Express so it ends before the big race, Joseph so it ends before the titular hero is reunited with his father and brothers, and Jesus Christ Superstar so that it concludes with Jesus and his mates at a nice dinner party.  A musical for people who don&apos;t like musicals: If sci-fi and B-movie homages are your thing, catch Little Shop of Horrors on its UK tour.

But those worth \u00a32bn a year can afford to rise above the critics who talk of a midlife crisis. Barbara Millicent Roberts, better known as Barbie, wants the world to know she is turning 50 \u2013 and will \u00adcelebrate with an aggressive campaign to see off younger rivals. First comes a new home: the \u00a320m, six-storey House of Barbie department store that rises in glazed, pink-tinged splendour from one of Shanghai&apos;s premier shopping streets. Due to open in March, the building will present a \u00adfuchsia and crystal opulence that Elton John would regard as outr\u00e9. It will include a luxurious spa, a full-service restaurant serving Barbitinis and a \u00ad&quot;couture&quot; (read: pricey) clothing salon complete with \u00a310,000 Vera Wang \u00adwedding dress. Its impressive scale reflects Mattel&apos;s ambitions for its brand \u2013 and anxieties within the world&apos;s biggest toy firm. US sales of Barbies have been squeezed for\u00a0several years and fell 15% in 2007, even before the downturn took hold. Third-quarter results for 2008 showed that Barbie worldwide gross sales were down 1% \u2013 though other brands ensured Mattel&apos;s worldwide net sales rose 7%. The store also encapsulates three core elements of the recovery plan: \u00adcon\u00adquering new territory overseas; reclaiming the &quot;tweens&quot; \u2013 fashion-\u00adconscious older girls \u2013 who have \u00adabandoned Barbie; and extending the brand to tempt young women with a taste for kitsch. In February, 50 \u00addesigners will unveil \u00adBarbie-inspired full-size outfits at New York Fashion Week. &quot;Doll Face&quot; make-up and &quot;Plastic Fantastic&quot; skincare will soon follow. More surprises are promised over the year. &quot;There&apos;s a product in here for three-year-olds and 80-year-olds,&quot; said Richard Dickson, general manager of Barbie, as he bounded through the Shanghai store with all the enthusiasm of the doll he promotes. &quot;It represents eternal youth and happiness and fun. It&apos;s a brand which celebrates girls and women.&quot; The love affair was mutual. But in the last few years &quot;it&apos;s been pretty bad \u2013 everything Barbie has been down&quot;, said Gerrick Johnson, toy industry analyst at BMO Capital Markets. &quot;2008 shouldn&apos;t be as bad as 2007, and I think 2009 will be better. &quot;But I&apos;m not ready to say Barbie is back. We&apos;ve had head-fakes before. In &apos;06, it looked like the early stages of a turn-around \u2013 but that failed to materi\u00adalise. They report earnings on February 2 and we will see how that goes.&quot; In the last decade, Barbie has fought alternative distractions \u2013 such as the internet \u2013 as well as other dolls. A court awarded her an early birthday present in November, ruling that her knowing arch-rival Bratz, which had seduced older girls, infringed Mattel copyright. It told manufacturers MGA to remove the dolls from shelves within weeks. But this week, following an appeal, MGA gained at least a year&apos;s reprieve while legal wrangles continue. It is not clear how Mattel will react if it prevails; it says it is open to &quot;all viable options&quot;, though Dickson&apos;s disapproval of the line \u2013 shared by many mothers \u2013 is evident. He suggested that it &quot;represented a moment in time \u2026 that culture of celebrities \u2026 particularly young women, displaying behaviour that perhaps was not ideal for moms to associate their girls with&quot;. Whatever the decision, Johnson argues Bratz was only part of the problem. &quot;The onus is still on Mattel to make toys that kids want,&quot; he said. &quot;Bratz has been down [recently], but Barbie&apos;s still struggling. &quot;If Barbie starts accelerating and showing growth, people start talking about Mattel being the &apos;Barbie company&apos; again and stock will start moving again. It&apos;s a major piece of business for Mattel and it&apos;s also a world brand. Everyone knows Barbie.&quot; The firm&apos;s other lines include Hot Wheels and Fisher Price. But chief executive Bob Eckert, visiting Shanghai for a preview of the store, acknowledged: &quot;While we have a portfolio of brands, as the number one selling toy in the world, Barbie is very important to the total Mattel business.&quot; Dickson points to the success of brand extensions; \u00adBarbie&apos;s diamond-hard ambition is barely concealed by her fluffy exterior. When she fails to crush her rivals, she seeks to assimilate them: taking on internet successes such as Webkinz with heavy investment in Barbie.com; moving into entertainment with the launch of branded MP3 \u00adplayers and hugely successful DVDs. But he admitted Barbie has faced &quot;challenging moments&quot; and said that the brand would now expand &quot;with&quot; rather than beyond the doll. He insisted the economic downturn will not mean a bad year, because parents will not &quot;want to deprive their kids&quot;. And though Mattel announced 1,000 redundancies in autumn, he described the decision as part of the regular business cycle, allowing the company to invest elsewhere. Above all, he is adamant that the brand remains relevant to girls, praising Barbie as a proto-feminist embodiment of aspiration. One wall of the new store celebrates her role in &quot;inspiring girls \u2026 with over 100 careers&quot; from president to\u00a0astronaut, by way of nurse and gymnast. Yet though girls will be able to stride a miniature catwalk, design a doll or enjoy &quot;mommy and me&quot; make\u00adovers, there are no plans for \u2013 say \u2013 a pink laboratory. Critics may also query the attempt to sell a blonde icon to a nation of raven-haired, brown-eyed girls (Mattel&apos;s spokeswoman describes such concerns \u2013 like those about Barbie&apos;s implausible proportions \u2013 as adults&apos; &quot;psychological baggage&quot;). Even the special Shanghai Barbie has pale skin, fair tresses and blue eyes. The firm argues that Barbie comes in numerous skin tones, face sculpts and body shapes. But around the world, it has been consumers&apos; love of the blonde prototype that has propelled international sales to twice the US level. In Chile, half of all girls own a Barbie. Mattel is confident China will also prove a winner: &quot;It&apos;s a very large market growing rapidly and [sales of] premium branded toys basically tripled in the last three years,&quot; said Bryan Stockton, president of Mattel International. His optimism is shared on the shop floor at the House of Barbie. Zhao Li shares the doll&apos;s birthday (March 9) and has been hooked since receiving one when she turned 15. So much so, that \u2013 aged 22 \u2013 she gave up her steady office job to become a sales assistant. &quot;I wanted to see her every day. She&apos;s lovely, so cute and kind and beautiful \u2013 and sexy. If I get a staff discount, I want to buy more.&quot; Additional research by Chen Shi China doll leads Mattel&apos;s fightbackTwo Barbies are sold every second worldwide, but the doll \u2013 like her parent company Mattel \u2013 is a survivor who has experienced hard times. Launched in 1959, she proved an instant hit with children; but by the early 1980s, she was seen as dated and past her prime. An overhaul and heavy advertising paid dividends over the next decade and a half, with the brand&apos;s earnings rising tenfold and Mattel&apos;s shares soaring from under $3 to well over $40. They had plummeted to a quarter of their peak by 2000, thanks in large part to a failed attempt to acquire an educational software company. Bob Eckert stepped in as chief executive and helped to restore Mattel&apos;s fortunes, but faced another crisis with the recall of more than 20m toys owing to safety issues \u2013 some ascribed to Chinese manufacturers, some to design flaws. Shares now stand at over $15 as the global slowdown takes its toll on the industry as a whole. &quot;People say toys are recession-proof \u2013 but you don&apos;t need to get your child 10 Star Wars figures; maybe they can make do with five,&quot; said Gerrick Johnson, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. &quot;At the beginning of a downturn, parents cut back on the number of the toys they buy or buy cheaper items. But as people go farther in they look at other areas and don&apos;t cut back any more on kids and toys.

For scholarships, for instance, although 70% of the assessment is based on a student&apos;s exam score, 10% goes on sports ability and 20% on moral education.

To help bring about change the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has called for a return to the traditional strengths of higher education and set out a new five-year plan that involves building 50 more universities and hundreds of new colleges, following on from the creation of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) in the 1960s. India has about 400 universities and about 18,000 colleges and this includes both the state and private sectors. In the past decade there has been a sharp increase in the growth of private colleges and universities. Dr Singh has said that the government is committed to a &quot;quantum leap&quot; in higher education, which is &quot;at the threshold of a new era&quot;. The government has allocated 19% of GDP to fund education. With these changes the higher education participation rate is predicted to rise from 10% to 15% by 2012, which adds up to an extra 6-7 million students, but the worry is that even if the plan succeeds, there will still be too few university places to meet the demand. Although Mike Thornton, operations manager of the UK-India Education and Research Initiative (Ukieri), which aims to improve education links between India and the UK, worries that many would say the plan is too little, too late, he believes the situation can be fixed. &quot;After 40 years of neglect, Universities UK along with the abroadnew Education Forum created out of Ukieri are addressing how UK universities can assist with faculty development.&quot; A small eliteThe university system in India is based on a pyramid structure, with a handful of high-quality providers at the top. This originated with the establishment of universities at Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Allahabadand Lahore between 1857 and 1902, modelled on the British universities of the time. Today the top universities in India are Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Calcutta, the Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management. In the state sector there are central universities and state universities run by India&apos;s Ministry of Education. The quality of higher education providers has long been an issue in India, says Thornton. &quot;None of the traditional high-quality providers get into the Shanghai top 100 and thousands of other providers are attempting to meet the ever-increasing demand as disposable incomes rise.&quot; Dr Subir Sinha, senior lecturer in development studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, says many students would rather go abroad than study in the unregulated private sector or the state sector in India. He thinks one of the major stumbling blocks to improving the quality of higher education has been the lack of funding for staff salaries: &quot;Pay scales for academics are below the national average, but this is being addressed by the new pay commission and salaries are currently rising at 50%-70%.&quot; It has been difficult for academics to manage on their salaries, he says, but this is changing. &quot;There is now going to be an expansion of subsidised housing for academics and this will be an incentive for them to stay working in India,&quot; he says. Another problem has been the brain drain \u2014 students and lecturers leaving India to head for the UK or the US. But Sinha thinks this is changing: &quot;The flow of academics out of India has now gone into reverse \u2014 they are going back to India.&quot; To meet the demand for access to higher education many foreign countries \u2014 including the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand \u2014 are interested in setting up campuses in India. Sinha sees this foreign investment as &quot;vital&quot; but the Indian government is cautious about this overseasinfluence. The highly regulatory Foreign Educators Providers (FEP) bill is currently waiting to go through parliament. Thornton says UK universities want to work in India to &quot;strengthen their international collaborations through fresh ideas, recruiting and seconding staff and students and accessing new markets for courses&quot;. But if the Indian government makes the whole process of running collaborative courses and setting up campuses in India prohibitively interventionist and expensive, these providers will simply lose patience. &quot;Foreign universities will spend their money elsewhere,&quot; he cautions. Another major challenge for India&apos;s universities over the next few years is to increase the use of ICT. In terms of distance learning, the larger cities are well plugged into the internet, says Dr Sinha, but there is a problem with the electricity supply in many small towns: &quot;There is a lack of penetration of ICT in small town states but, once power issues are solved, computers will become more widespread and ICT literacy will follow.&quot; He cites one example that sums up the problem. &quot;My brother-in-law teaches computer literacy in a small town \u2014 they have lots of computers but don&apos;t have connection to electricity for seven hours a day.&quot; Weblinks Indian institute of technology \u2013 Delhi: iitd.ernet.in/Ukieri: ukieri.org/", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2009-01-19T15:17:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/21/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-tennis", "sentences": ["The pressure is on the 21-year-old Serb who, despite winning the title here last year, and defeating Federer in the semi-finals, failed to improve on his No3 ranking, though he finished strongly with victory in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai."], "title": "Australian Open: Andy Murray's title chances have been written off by Novak Djokovic", "article": "It does not take a huge amount to get under the skin of Novak Djokovic, the reigning Australian Open champion, and mention of Andy Murray was enough to ruffle the Serbian&apos;s feathers on the third day of the Australian Open. It was suggested to Djokovic, who in his second-round match defeated Jeremy Chardy of France 7-5,6-1,3-6,6-3, that whereas he had been considered as the third challenger last year to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, this time it was Murray being discussed in these terms, and even as the favourite. He bridled: &quot;Why Andy? What&apos;s his ranking and my ranking? With all respect, and I like him as a person and a player, you cannot put him as the favourite with Roger, Rafa and myself here.&quot; Djokovic, who has lost his last two matches to Murray, having previously held a 4-0 lead, is sensitive to such nuances and while acknowledging that the Scot had done a lot in the last couple of months, was very talented, and could be expected to win majors in the future, he was not about to concede that his first slam title might happen here next week. The pressure is on the 21-year-old Serb who, despite winning the title here last year, and defeating Federer in the semi-finals, failed to improve on his No3 ranking, though he finished strongly with victory in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. Nevertheless he has been aware of the criticism, the suggestion being that his game may have reached a plateau and that Murray, who is one week older, is poised to slip past him and mount the real challenge to Nadal and Federer. &quot;I think I am playing better and better which is very encouraging for me, and something I planned to do,&quot; said Djokovic, who had a stuttering start to the season, blamed by many on his decision to change his make of racket. &quot;It&apos;s normal to have ups and downs, but now things are changing.&quot; So have the expectations on his broad shoulders after last year, which is one of the fascinations. Federer and Nadal have proved over a long period that they can respond to and deal with the pressure of defending their status; as yet Djokovic&apos;s response remains something of an unknown quantity. And the rise and rise of Murray as a genuine contender this year has obviously added to whatever uncertainties may lurk within the sometimes overly sensitive Serb. Djokovic, who is seeded to meet Federer in the semi-finals again here, next plays Amer Delic, the US qualifier who was born in Bosnia. &quot;He&apos;s a big server.

The effect of his books isn&apos;t comparable to those of any other writer. His prose, right from the beginning, has a mesmerising pace, rhythm and decorum all its own. Even more remarkably, Ballard has established his own set of visionary locations. Plenty of other writers now fictionally venture into multistorey carparks, airport hospital wards, decaying hotels, but they do so in the knowledge that they&apos;re trespassing on Ballard&apos;s territory. He was here first; he was the pioneer - back when these places were seen as totally unliterary. What could possibly happen on a motorway embankment that was of interest? Ballard&apos;s first four novels, The Wind from Nowhere, The Drowned World, The Drought and The Crystal World, can be read as a series of variations on the global catastrophe novel. Some critics have discovered an elemental programme within the quartet: world-death by air, water, fire and earth. Whether or not this is the case, Ballard was definitely experimenting with different ends for civilisation. In the wake of his bestselling autobiographical novel The Empire of the Sun and his most recent autobiography, Miracles of Life, it&apos;s easy to trace glib links between Ballard&apos;s boyhood in a wartime Shanghai internment camp and the collapsed-then-resurrected ecologies and communities that so often feature in his novels. Ballard has always been remarkably chipper on the subject of his imprisonment. And, through the total destruction of normal human society, his invariably male heroes are able to find some sort of fulfilment. The Drowned World is perhaps the most mesmeric of these four novels. It contains a series of hyperreal descriptions: a cityscape beneath waves, suburban swamps and lagoons. Too much contemporary art is compared with a state of waking dream, but in this novel Ballard really comes close. He&apos;s always been a devotee of the surrealists (Max Ernst is a close companion-in-imagery), and in The Drowned World this works in synch with the hero Kerans&apos; quest to adapt and survive. In mid-period Ballard, represented by Crash, the catastrophic collapse moves inside the characters&apos; heads. Guided by the monomaniac Vaughan, our hero enters a society-within-a-society - life as a sterile mating game in which first contact can be made only by car crash. Mechanistic paraphilia has replaced any sort of romantic love or genital sex. The human body is attractive only when seen within the intersecting frames of car door, seatbelt, steering wheel - preferably smashed and warped. The flesh comes to erotic life only once violated. Of Ballard&apos;s most recent novels, the most successful, in my opinion, is Millennium People, which redoes the collapsing society but in a comic mode. A middle-class revolution takes place within Chelsea Marina, an exclusive Thames-side estate. Unsurprisingly, the results are inept and farcical. Ballard&apos;s writing, though still focused on the weird forms human normality can take, is gently tickled by our creative misdemeanours rather than awed by them. \u2022 Toby Litt&apos;s Journey Into Space will be published in March by Penguin", "tags": ["JG Ballard", "Best books", "Books", "Culture", "Science fiction"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-22T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/22/china-fears-year-of-slump", "sentences": ["&quot;There were still positive signs from investment and consumption.&quot; Share prices on the Shanghai stock exchange jumped by 1%, to a one month high, amid hopes of a recovery later this year.", "Jin Yanshi, chief economist at Sinolink Securities in Shanghai, said: &quot;The government ... regards the 8% target as a political task."], "title": "China prepares for year of decline", "article": "      Collapsing exports to the west caused China&apos;s GDP growth to slide to just 6.8% in the final quarter of 2008, underlining the rising economic giant&apos;s vulnerability to the global downturn.

There were some causes for optimism in the detail of the figures: stronger-than-expected growth in retail sales and a surge in lending after the government lifted credit quotas, which caused some economists to suggest the worst could be over. &quot;It obviously indicates a significant slowdown, but 6.8% is not a collapse,&quot; said Andy Rothman, China macro strategist for CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. &quot;There were still positive signs from investment and consumption.&quot; Share prices on the Shanghai stock exchange jumped by 1%, to a one month high, amid hopes of a recovery later this year. However, with the slowdown in consumer demand in the US, eurozone and Japan expected to worsen, Mark Williams, of Capital Economics, said it was &quot;too soon to be talking about turning points&quot;. He predicted that Chinese growth could sink to just 5% in 2009. That would be well below Beijing&apos;s target of 8%, the level many analysts believe is needed to create enough jobs for new workers entering the labour force and keep a lid on social unrest. There have been reports of protests as factories are mothballed in response to sliding export demand. Ma Jiantang, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, insisted that the government&apos;s growth forecast would be met. &quot;As long as we can boost domestic demand and increase investment, we can absolutely achieve the 8% GDP growth target in 2009,&quot; he said. Analysts said Beijing would do whatever it takes to meet the target. Jin Yanshi, chief economist at Sinolink Securities in Shanghai, said: &quot;The government ... regards the 8% target as a political task. Therefore I think we can achieve the goal.&quot; The Chinese government recently announced a 4 trillion yuan fiscal stimulus package to shield the economy from slumping world trade. Williams warned that it may have to spend much more. &quot;China&apos;s economy is likely to slow further before the fiscal stimulus provides some stability in the second half. But a strong recovery will depend on more aggressive action by the government,&quot; he said. Most economists believe China&apos;s economic statistics are susceptible to political manipulation. Confusingly, some thought the 6.8% figure artificially low while others believed it was too high. Glenn Maguire, of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in Hong Kong, wrote: &quot;The headline GDP figure reveals very little resemblance to the underlying nominal growth trends. Growth does not appear to be as weak as these headline numbers suggest.&quot; He thought officials might be finessing the data in the hope of engineering a recovery in the second half of the year.

John Sutherland Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Pat Barker: Regeneration (1991)  Inspired by her grandfather&apos;s experiences in the \ufb01rst world war trenches, Barker&apos;s trilogy of novels \u2014 which also includes The Eye in the Door (1993) and The Ghost Road (1995) \u2014 centres around the Edinburgh psychiatric hospital where soldiers were &quot;cured&quot; of psychological trauma before being sent back to the front. Rivers is the heroic therapist handling \ufb01rst public objector Siegfried Sassoon, then Wilfred Owen and the \ufb01ctional Billy Prior, before sending them back to the devastation of the \ufb01nal few months of the war. There are horrifying descriptions of trench warfare, but it is Barker&apos;s forensic examination of the psyche of these men that makes her novel both contemporary and timeless. Nicola Barr  Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Sebastian Barry: A Long Long Way (2005)  The familiar horrors of the \ufb01rst world war are seen from the fresh perspective of a young Irish volunteer in this passionate and lyrical novel, one of two by Barry to have been shortlisted for the Man Booker prize. Too small to be a policeman like his evered father, Willie Dunne is proud to enlist in the British army. But on leave in 1916 he helps put down the Easter Rising, only to discover that some of his fellow countrymen regard the &quot;\ufb01lthy Hun&quot; as &quot;our allies in Europe&quot;. The appalling complexity of war for soldiers who have been rejected by their homeland and can no longer identify the enemy is gripping and inevitably tragic. Joanna HinesBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop HE Bates: Fair Stood the Wind for France (1944)  &quot;Sometimes the Alps lying below in the moonlight had the appearance of crisp folds of crumpled cloth.&quot; What could be more English than crumpled linen? Or HE Bates. And this novel is classically English in many ways. The brave, sensitive RAF bomber pilot John Franklin, for instance, is all restrained emotion even when his plane is shot down in France. Yet he falls so heartbreakingly completely for Francoise, the daughter of the mill owner who hides him in his home. Bates&apos;s war novel concentrates on the continuance of love, and the possibility of renewal, his hero and heroine exhibiting levels of trust and commitment undimmed by their experiences. Nicola Barr Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Nina Bawden: Carrie&apos;s War (1973)  Twelve-year-old Carrie Willow and her younger brother Nick are sent to Wales to escape the dangers of wartime London. Housed with the grim Mr Evans and his timid sister Lou, they encounter warfare of a di\ufb00erent kind and seek refuge with the enchanting inhabitants of the farm at Druid&apos;s Bottom. Carrie&apos;s e\ufb00 orts to help the people she has come to love lead her to commit what she believes to be a terrible crime. Though written primarily for children, this is an almost perfect novel, to be enjoyed at any age. Joanna HinesBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Roberto Bola\u00f1o: The Savage Detectives (1998)  Central characters Arturo Belano and Ulises Lima are likened to &quot;two Dennis Hoppers walking the streets of Mexico City&quot;, but they are neither savage nor good detectives. They are part of a literary movement called &quot;visceral realism&quot; though, a minor movement engaged in gang warfare with another group, the &quot;Stridentist&quot;. At its heart, Bola\u00f1o&apos;s novel is a kind of road novel: made up of interviews with Belano and Lima&apos;s acquaintances, it sketches a scorching, epic portrait of the Americas. An novel as brilliant in its execution as it is bonkers in its conception. Philip Oltermann Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Paul Bowles: The Sheltering Sky (1949)  A signi\ufb01 cant forerunner of the Beat movement, Paul Bowles&apos; bestseller is the story of three jaded American travellers \u2014 Port Moresby, his wife Kit and their friend Tunner \u2014 drifting through postwar north Africa. Having rejected the comforts of civilisation in their search for identity and ful\ufb01 lment, the trio are soon under threat from the sense of alienation and hostility that surrounds them. Inspired by Bowles&apos; own period of exile in Morocco, this account of a di\ufb03cult emotional journey made a huge impact on publication, having astutely tapped into a growing state of disa\ufb00ection across America. Charlotte StretchBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop William Boyd: An Ice-Cream War (1982)  In the early stages of the \ufb01rst world war, newlywed Gabriel Cobb \ufb01nds himself caught up in the \ufb01 ght for control over eastern Africa. Meanwhile, in England, Gabriel&apos;s brother Felix and wife Charis are left alone together as a mutual attraction grows between them. Their a\ufb00 air is cut short when they discover that Gabriel has been captured, prompting Felix to travel across an increasingly war-torn African landscape to \ufb01 nd him. Interspersing vivid action scenes with moments of tranquillity in Kent, Boyd&apos;s novel is a stirring portrayal of decaying British imperialism and the ordinary lives that become shaped by con\ufb02ict. Charlotte StretchBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Raymond Briggs: When the Wind Blows (1982)  This depiction of an elderly rural couple attempting to shield themselves from a nuclear blast by putting blind trust in government guidelines (cover windows with sheets and climb into paper bags) caused a sensation when it was published in 1982. Blacker-than-black comedy ensues as James and Hilda unwittingly succumb to radiation sickness, unable even to eat their reserved ginger nuts because their gums are bleeding uncontrollably. Surprisingly, it&apos;s still classi\ufb01ed as a children&apos;s picture book in many a local library. Chris Ross Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop  Italo Calvino: Invisible Cities (1974)  Gore Vidal called Calvino&apos;s seventh novel \u2014 &quot;or work or meditation or poem&quot; \u2014 his most beautiful. Marco Polo describes his travels to Kublai Khan, presenting the world-weary emperor with fractal glimpses of 55 fantastic cities \u2014 the un\ufb01nished, the unforgettable, the dreamlike, the destroyed \u2014 that are all ultimately versions of his &quot;\ufb01rst city&quot;, Venice. This glittering jewel of a book has been an inspiration to travellers, architects and authors alike, its pages brimming with meaning and possibility. Justine JordanBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Elias Canetti: Auto-da-F\u00e9 (1935)  Peter Kien is an eminent sinologist in interwar Germany, comfortably insulated from humanity and any &quot;touch of the unknown&quot; by his library. Until, that is, he falls victim to his illiterate housekeeper and a proto-Nazi concierge, and begins a grotesque descent into madness and the urban underworld, guided by an evil dwarf. This is a blackly comic study of vulnerability, fascism and self-destruction by the polymathic author of Crowds and Power, and a serious novel of ideas in the grand Central European manner. Chris Ross Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Willa Cather: One Of Ours (1922)  When it was published, Cather&apos;s account of a Nebraskan farmer&apos;s journey to the \ufb01rst world war and his sacri\ufb01cial death in battle garnered high praise and vitriolic criticism in equal measure. The Pulitzer prize the following year was o\ufb00 set by condemnation from Hemingway, among others, for daring to tackle the &quot;masculine&quot; subject of war. But her novel is as much an epitaph for the passing of the pioneering experience and the in\ufb01nite opportunities of Western expansion, and far more ambiguous and wide-ranging than her critics allowed. Joanna HinesBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line: Journey to the End of the Night (1932)  This dark but humorous novel follows a young man, loosely based on the author, through the \ufb01rst world war and into the poorest suburbs of postwar Paris. With its use of natural speech patterns and un\ufb02 inching descriptions of misery and wickedness, it was hugely popular in the 1930s, and continued to be in\ufb02 uential \u2014 Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller and the Doors are among the many who have referred to it in their work \u2014 even though C\u00e9line was subsequently branded a Nazi sympathiser.David Newnham Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Wu Cheng&apos;en: Monkey (1590s)  In this Chinese classic, the monk Tripitaka travels to India to fetch sacred Buddhist texts, accompanied by three disciples: the greedy Pigsy, the river monster Sandy and Monkey (recruited so that they may atone for past sins), on the way doing battle with demons, monsters and evil magicians. This boisterous comic adventure tale is both an allegory for the individual&apos;s journey towards enlightenment and a social and political satire. The quest may have been given to the blundering monk, but the real star of the story is its antihero, the irrepressible trickster, rule-breaker and troublemaker Monkey. The novel was the inspiration behind a cult Japanese 1970s television show, and its latest incarnation is Jamie Hewlett and Damon Albarn&apos;s &quot;pop opera&quot; Monkey: Journey to the West. Ginny Hooker Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Joseph Conrad: Heart of Darkness (1902)  The most explosive, and recently controversial, indictment of European colonialism in British \ufb01ction. Conrad&apos;s series hero, Charles Marlow, is discovered spinning a yarn to a group of friends on board his yacht, in the mouth of the Thames. Marlow ruminates about his early assignment, from the &quot;Company&quot; in Brussels, to steam upstream to the heart of the Belgian Congo, where the manager of the inner station, who is in charge of ivory harvesting, has apparently gone mad. Despite obstacles (and witnessing scenes of hideous colonial cruelty), Marlow completes his mission, and \ufb01nds Kurtz \u2014 originally a fervent idealist \u2014 has reverted to savagery. He dies, with the words: &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; Marlow himself has seen into the heart of darkness, and is a changed man thereafter. John Sutherland Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Joseph Conrad: Lord Jim (1900)  Lord Jim takes the familiar narrative of the seafaring hero and turns it inside out, as only Conrad can. His Jim is a young idealist who is promoted in the merchant navy without ever really having had his mettle tested. When the moment comes, Jim makes the coward&apos;s choice \u2014 an act that determines the rest of his life, down to his idolisation by a Malaysian tribe. But is he really in the wrong? Conrad uses every trick he knows to express the doubts and fears of a time when ideas of conventional morality seemed to be crumbling underfoot. Carrie O&apos;Grady Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Joseph Conrad: Nostromo (1904)  Settlers, natives and interlopers all battle for control of a silver mine in the \ufb01ctional South American country of Costaguana. Many of Conrad&apos;s familiar obsessions are here: revolutionary politics, the curdling of ambition into avarice, oppressive heat, confusion and corruptibility. But where Heart of Darkness draws us into a deeply subjective interior, the language of Nostromo is radically exteriorised \u2014 alienating, even. An essential modernist experiment, as rigorous and unsparing in its imagination as the glare of the midday sun that falls upon its cynical protagonists. Chris Ross Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Bernard Cornwell: Sharpe&apos;s Eagle (1981)  According to legend, Cornwell only started writing his \ufb01rst book about his lantern-jawed, Napoleonic-era ri\ufb02eman because green card regulations prevented him earning a conventional living when he relocated to America. It&apos;s a story guaranteed to infuriate unpublished writers su\ufb00ering for their art. What makes the series so pleasurable: is Cornwell&apos;s enthusiasm for his historical subject and delight in his rough-hewn hero&apos;s escapades. His prose may be workmanlike, but his relish for the books is infectious. In short, Sharpe is fun. Sam JordisonBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Francis Coventry: The History of Pompey the Little (1751)  Coventry&apos;s satirical novel follows the adventures of a small canine across numerous di\ufb00erent owners&apos; laps to the top of English society. He may have no religion, but Pompey, &quot;always willing to fetch and carry&quot;, has &quot;courtly manners&quot; and proves an object of adoration until he su\ufb00ers &quot;a violent physick&quot; and barks his last. To describe this satire as unique barely does justice to its eccentric charm, but only recently has Coventry been recognised as a talent independent of his hero Henry Fielding. A shame, since this book deserves a wide readership. Sam JordisonBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Stephen Crane: The Red Badge of Courage (1895)  When Crane started reading Civil war veterans&apos; reminiscences, he complained: &quot;They spout enough of what they did, but they&apos;re as emotionless as rocks.&quot; So he created someone altogether more feelingful. His own Union army private Henry Fielding may start ardent for glory, but his \ufb01rst experiences of the horror and cruelty of battle forces him to plumb the depths of fear. Crane&apos;s empathetic ability to convey the full gamut of these emotions, combined with the bracing realism of his battle sequences, make this a milestone in American literature. Sam Jordison Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Daniel Defoe: Robinson Crusoe (1719)  This is the original adventure yarn. Crusoe rebels against his father, runs away to sea and has all sorts of adventures, including a daring escape from slavery in north Africa, before God decides to teach him a lesson and shipwrecks him on his desert island. The only survivor, our entirely resourceful hero, survives for 26 years by learning how to make everything from scratch, from pots to Christian theology (he does have a bible). He also defeats encroaching cannibals and pirates. The older, wiser Crusoe tells the story, seeing God&apos;s will \u2014 &quot;the Chequer-work of Providence&quot; \u2014 at work in every event. John MullanBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Len Deighton: Bomber (1970)  Set over the course of a single day, Bomber charts the progress of an ill-fated RAF raid on Nazi Germany. The dramatic events are seen from multiple vantage points, adopting perspectives from both sides of the con\ufb02ict.The level of detail employed in this frequently underrated novel is what makes it truly shocking: its tone of cool, clinical analysis is always the same, whether applied to death and destruction or machinery and weather conditions. An acclaimed BBC radio dramatisation, starring Tom Baker, capitalised on the novel&apos;s potent docu-drama feel by using a highly e\ufb00ective real-time framework, drawing out in full the terrifying intensity of Deighton&apos;s writing. Charlotte Stretch Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop James Dickey: Deliverance (1970)  Four friends set out on a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee, a soon-to-be-dammed river in northern Georgia. While there, the men encounter two savage locals who quickly transform the weekend adventure into a traumatic ordeal \u2014 one that not everyone survives. Though frequently overshadowed by the success of John Boorman&apos;s 1972 \ufb01lm adaptation, Dickey&apos;s novel possesses its own strain of intoxicatingly visceral poetry. This compelling story of two cultures, brought together in a state of violent con\ufb02ict, serves as a gripping examination of lost innocence and moral uncertainty in the quiet backwoods of America. John DugdaleBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop John Dos Passos: Three Soldiers (1921)  Dos Passos worked as an ambulance driver during the \ufb01rst world war, and this shows in a book which cleverly contains very little combat but all the boredom and brutality of the sidelines. The bewildering idiocies of boot camp, the interminable waiting around with no idea why, the a\ufb00ectless encounters with prostitutes \u2014 all combine to grind three Americans of diverse backgrounds into just so much &quot;meat for guns&quot;. Characteristically episodic and disorienting, this is a gem of an antiwar novel by an unjustly overlooked writer. Chris Ross Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Norman Douglas: South Wind (1917)  In 1916 Douglas was arrested when a boy made a complaint to the police for (as Douglas said) &quot;kissing [him] and iving him some cakes and a shilling&quot;. He jumped bail, \ufb02eeing to Capri, whose salubrious atmosphere inspired this captivating song of praise to the beauties of the Mediterranean and the pleasures of hedonism. Often criticised for having no plot, South Wind is a mystifying, but still enlightening, conversational novel, full of entrancing discussions of love, pleasures and scandals that together form a touching plea for tolerance and fantastic evocation of bohemian life. Sam JordisonBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Alexandre Dumas: The Three Musketeers (1844)  The story of the dashing d&apos;Artagnan, the swashbuckling musketeers Athos, Porthos and Aramis and their epic struggles against the feline M&apos;Lady is one of the best-loved in western culture. It may be the subject of more than a dozen \ufb01lms, not to mention endless TV serials, cartoons and spin-o\ufb00 books, but Dumas&apos;s book is still the best place to go to really get to know the characters. Its fast-paced narrative and curious philosophical musings also ensure it remains the most entertaining and intriguing of all the versions out there. Sam JordisonBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Lawrence Durrell: Justine (1957)  The \ufb01rst of the Alexandria Quartet \u2014 with Balthazar (1958), Mountolive (1958) and Clea (1960) following \u2014 which chronicles the lives and loves of a group of expatriates in Egypt before and just after the second world war, was an instant and lasting success, both popular and critical. The eponymous heroine is &quot;a child of the city, which decrees that its women shall be the voluptuaries not of pleasure but of pain, doomed to hunt for what they least dare to \ufb01nd!&quot; Alexandria, &quot;the great winepress of love&quot;, is evoked in prose of intoxicating lyricism, but for many readers these books are a vintage best appreciated in youth.

As he lies dying on his bamboo bed, search-and-rescue pilot Captain Knightsbridge makes love to the beautiful nurse Jane in his helicopter (which, in poignant synchronicity, is itself dubbed the &quot;Bamboo Bed&quot;). Meanwhile two hippies, Peter and Bethany, are attempting to resolve the con\ufb02ict with \ufb02owers and a guitar. Eastlake, a former war correspondent, redraws the Vietnam war as a surrealist fantasy, \ufb01lled with grotesque comedy and philosophical deliberation. His irreverent approach conveys, with startling e\ufb00 ectiveness, the true absurdity of war. Charlotte Stretch Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop JG Farrell: The Siege of Krishnapur (1973)  Farrell&apos;s unconventional historical novel is set during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. The town of Krishnapur is under siege and the garrison is hard put to survive and, just as importantly to some of them, to cling to their Victorian values. They believe in science but their two doctors disagree about almost everything; they believe in their civilization but their subjects are rebelling. The local Indian populace picnic on a nearby hill and enjoy the spectacle of the unfolding drama. Violence is coolly recorded, derring-do excitingly narrated, yet this is a darkly funny book, whose unsentimental, omniscient narrator scrutinises the self-delusions of the colonialists. John Mullan Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Sebastian Faulks: Birdsong (1993)  Novels depicting the horrors of war are seldom more moving than Sebastian Faulks&apos; 1993 bestseller. After embarking on a doomed love a\ufb00air with the unhappily married Madame Azaire, Stephen Wraysford becomes an army o\ufb03cer \ufb01ghting in the \ufb01rst world war. The novel traces Stephen&apos;s harrowing experiences in the blood-soaked trenches of northern France, and his growing determination to survive the con\ufb02ict. Almost universally considered Faulks&apos; \ufb01nest moment to date, Birdsong hauntingly captures the essence of war in all its terrible brutality. Charlotte StretchBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Ford Madox Ford: Parade&apos;s End (1924-28)  Less well known than The Good Soldier, and considerably longer, Ford&apos;s depiction of the \ufb01rst world war and its impact on English society is a strangely haunting work. Christopher Tietjens, the central character, is passionately attached to a gentlemanly code that brings him nothing but trouble in Whitehall, the army and his marriage to the icy Sylvia. Ford&apos;s kaleidoscopic descriptions of trench warfare are the book&apos;s main claim on posterity, but the whole thing is shot through with an attractively eccentric sense of humour as well as nostalgia. Secondary characters include &quot;Breakfast&quot; Duchemin, an insane and sex-obsessed vicar. Chris TaylerBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop CS Forester: The African Queen (1935)  Set in &quot;German Central Africa&quot; in late 1914. Rose Sayer, the spinster sister of an English missionary, \ufb01nds herself alone when her brother dies. She befriends by a cockney sailor, Charlie Allnutt, commander of the decrepit African Queen. Rose persuades the cowardly Charlie to sail down the Ulanga river and blow up a German warship. The subsequent hardship brings them together as lovers. The African Queen sinks before they can make their suicidal strike. They are taken prisoner by the Germans, who treat them well. The enemy ship is eventually sunk by the Royal Navy. John Huston&apos;s 1952 Oscar-winning \ufb01lm starred Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart \u2014 playing against their conventional screen personalities. John SutherlandBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop George MacDonald Fraser: Flashman (1969)  The most enduringly popular of neo-Victorian novels. Flashman was the loathsome bully in Thomas Hughes&apos; Tom Brown&apos;s Schooldays. Unlike that &quot;prig&quot; Brown, Flashy is not one to play up and play the game. On being expelled (for drunkenness and worse) from Dr Arnold&apos;s Rugby, Harry Flashman joins the army to \ufb01 ght, as an o\ufb03cer and anything but a gentleman, in the \ufb01 rst Afghan war. It is the proverbial military cock-up. The series, allegedly based on the anti-hero&apos;s &quot;papers&quot;, continued, volume by bestselling volume, to cast a cynical but hilariously comic anti-establishment light on &quot;England&apos;s century&quot;. Ironically, Harry emerges as, underneath it all, rather a good fellow. A dispiriting number of American reviewers assumed this \ufb01rst volume to be authentic autobiography. John SutherlandBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Charles Frazier: Cold Mountain (1997)  In Frazier&apos;s Civil-war era novel, the injured and disillusioned Confederate soldier John Inman begins a long, treacherous journey back to his home to Ada, the woman he loves. On Cold Mountain, after the death of her father, Ada is struggling to run the farm she is ill-equipped to manage, until the arrival of the illiterate but formidably resourceful Ruby helps her to take control of her future. Echoes of Homer&apos;s Odyssey run throughout and there are allusions to Ralph Waldo Emerson in a novel which is both an exploration of man&apos;s relationship to nature and a narrative of the human devastation of war. Ginny Hooker  Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Alex Garland: The Beach (1996)  This, more than any other, was the novel that launched a thousand gap years. For a short time in the late 1990s, a copy of Alex Garland&apos;s huge bestseller was as much a staple of the travel kit as spare socks and a toothbrush. The story of Richard, roaming Asia in search of a secret Thai island, inspired an entire generation of backpackers. Its star might have waned in recent years \u2014 thanks in part to Danny Boyle&apos;s disappointing \ufb01lm adaptation \u2014 but as a cautionary tale of paradise gone wrong, it still packs a mighty punch. Charlotte Stretch Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop  William Golding: To the Ends of the Earth trilogy (1980-89)  A warship journeys from Old Albion to the Antipodes, some time in the early 1800s. We chart its progress through the journal of Edmund Talbot, whose tone is at \ufb01rst arrogant, as be\ufb01ts a young man with aristocratic connections. His chronicle of shipboard life eventually comes to focus on the decline of the Reverend Colley, a &quot;new-hatched parson&quot; who is gradually destroyed by his own lethal innocence and the cruelty of others. The sailing ship&apos;s closed community provides the perfect setting for Golding&apos;s brilliant and unsparing depiction of man&apos;s capacity for inhumanity to man. Joanna Hines Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Ren\u00e9 Goscinny Asterix the Gaul (1959)  Hard to imagine that anyone might not have encountered Asterix before they&apos;ve grown up, let alone died. Spawning TV spin-o\ufb00s, movies and theme parks, he is arguably not just a global cultural phenomenon, but part of the mental landscape of childhood. Let&apos;s face it: Asterix, not Caesar, has shaped our understanding of the Gallic wars \u2014 and he is also the only means by which many of us could enjoy learning French. Asterix the Gaul, the \ufb01rst part of a series currently totalling 33, is still the best way to start. Chris RossBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop G\u00fcnter Grass: The Tin Drum (1959)  When The Tin Drum was published &quot;it was as if German literature had been granted a new beginning&quot;, stated the Nobel committee&apos;s citation. This vibrant epic covers German history during the \ufb01rst half of the 20th century through the eyes of a diminutive protagonist. At the age of three, the precocious Oskar Matzerath decided to stop growing and acquired the ability to shatter glass with his scream. He was also given his \ufb01rst toy drum which became an extension of himself. Earthy, anarchic and funny, Oskar&apos;s adventures brim with humour, insights and magical realist invention. Joanna HinesBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Robert Graves: Count Belisarius (1938)  The Emperor Justinian and his wife Theodora are now familiar mainly from their mosaic portraits in Ravenna. With their greatest general, Belisarius, and his remarkable wife Antonina, they are brought to life in Graves&apos;s lavishing story of 6th-century Byzantium. Campaigns in Persia, Carthage, Sicily and Italy, and a vibrant cast of dancing girls, concubines, charioteers, bear masters, Nestorian monks and Herulian Huns, and even a whale called Porphyry, combine to make this a vibrant account of a period that should be better known. Joanna HinesBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Vasily Grossman: Life and Fate (1960)  As a Soviet journalist in the 1940s, Vasily Grossman reported from the battle of Stalingrad and published the \ufb01rst account in any language of the Nazi death camps. Completed in 1960 but not published until the 1980s, and then only outside the USSR, Life and Fate is a conscious attempt to write the War and Peace of the second world war. Grossman takes his readers into Auschwitz and the Lubyanka, but he also describes the sense of freedom brie\ufb02 y experienced by the defenders of Stalingrad before the state reasserted its grip on their lives. Chris TaylorBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop CT Rawi Hage: De Niro&apos;s Game (2006)  Hage&apos;s \ufb01rst novel, a blistering portrait of adolescent swagger set against the Lebanese civil war, came from nowhere to win the Impac award. War-torn Beirut has been a childhood playground for Bassam and George; now the former is dabbling in petty crime to fund his escape, while the latter looks for status and purpose with the local militia. In prose that is brutal, tender, bitter and deadpan by turns, Hage sketches a fresh and utterly convincing portrait of war&apos;s brutalising e\ufb00ects. Justine JordanBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop H Rider Haggard: King Solomon&apos;s Mines (1885)  If Robert Louis Stevenson could do it with Treasure Island, why couldn&apos;t he write a rattling adventure yarn for the millions, wondered Haggard? The result was this primal episode in the eventful life of &quot;Hunter&quot; Allan Quatermain of Natal. The big-game man is approached by Henry Curtis and Captain John Good to \ufb01 nd Curtis&apos;s younger brother, who has disappeared in the interior of the dark continent \u2014 allegedly in search of the fabulous diamond mines of King Solomon, somewhere beyond the &quot;Breasts of Sheba&quot; mountains. The quest involves battles with natives and the discovery of both the lost white man and the Solomonic treasure. The novel \u2014 one of the great page-turners in English literature \u2014 launched the author on a bestselling literary career. John SutherlandBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop  H Rider Haggard: She (1887)  The sexiest of Haggard&apos;s many African yarns. Leo Vincey is left an iron box by his dead father, to be opened when he is 25. It contains the startling information that he is descended from an ancient Egyptian priest, Kallikrates. Leo is instructed to go to Africa and kill the mysteriously immortal queen whok killed Kallikrates. Braving shipwreck, cannibals, and crocodiles, Leo \ufb01nally discovers Ayesha, or &quot;She&quot;, high in an impenetrable mountain range. She takes Leo as her lover. At the heart of her lair, she shows him the pillar of life \u2014 a \ufb02ame that ensures immortality. But, perversely, when she enters it, the \ufb01re restores Ayesha to her true 2,000 years of age, and she dies resembling a shrivelled monkey. Leo returns to England, a wiser and older man. Few read the novel nowadays without visualising Ursula Andress, who made the titular character her own in the \ufb01lm version. John SutherlandBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Patrick Hamilton: The Slaves of Solitude (1947)  This short novel&apos;s slightly silly title and unexciting-sounding setting haven&apos;t always worked to its advantage, but Hamilton&apos;s fans consider it one of his best. In his hands, the story of a festering quarrel between the inmates of a dreary suburban boarding house becomes a comic tour de force as well as an unusually sardonic depiction of life on the home front during the second world war. Mr Thwaites, the heroine&apos;s tormentor-in- chief, is one of Hamilton&apos;s most memorably unpleasant characters, and the book&apos;s mixture of pathos and comedy is perfectly judged. Chris TaylerBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Robert Harris: Enigma (1995)  In March 1943, a group of codebreakers are attempting to break the German U-boat Enigma cipher from their secret Buckinghamshire base. Among them is Tom Jericho, who is in love with the beautiful but mysterious Claire Romilly. Her sudden disappearance, amidst suspicion that the team has been in\ufb01 ltrated by a spy, propels Tom on to a desperate mission to uncover the truth. This twist-laden thriller, later adapted into a screenplay by Tom Stoppard, popularised the previously little-known story of Bletchley Park. That the site&apos;s imminent closure is currently the subject public campaign is a strong testament to the power of Harris&apos;s story. Charlotte Stretch Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Jaroslav Hasek: The Good Soldier Svejk (1923)  Hasek was 39 when he died of tuberculosis, after decades of boozing and vagrancy. The Czech anarchist and prankster, once sacked by a wildlife publisher for writing articles about non-existent animals, didn&apos;t get around to \ufb01nishing his life&apos;s great work, and translator Cecil Parrott claims that &quot;sometimes it is apparent that he must have been drunk when he was writing&quot;. Yet there is an irresistible, feverish energy to this picaresque comedy about a little man dodging the horrors of the great war. Without Svejk, Joseph Heller has said, there would have been no Catch-22. Phil Daoust Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Ernest Hemingway: For Whom the Bell Tolls  Anyone who comes to this novel expecting simplicity of style and unthinking machismo will be swiftly disabused. Rather, this story of an American joining forces with Andalucian freedom \ufb01ghters during the Spanish civil war is one of \ufb01ction&apos;s most searching considerations of altruism, accountability and sacri\ufb01ce. Hemingway&apos;s deliberate archaisms and literalised Spanish jolt the reader into thinking a fresh about choices and the motives behind them. And it is a wonderful evocation of what it means to love a land and a people other than one&apos;s own. Chris RossBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Anthony Hope: The Prisoner of Zenda (1894)  The novel which bequeathed adventure-\ufb01 ction writers &quot;Ruritania&quot; \u2014 one of the genre&apos;s most pro\ufb01 table territories. Visiting the country, Rudolf Rassendyll is observed uncannily to resemble the soon-to-be- crowned King Rudolf. Villainous Duke Michael abducts him and Rassendyll is prevailed upon to impersonate the monarch whom, with the assistance of loyal Fritz von Tarlenheim, he later rescues. Things are romantically complicated when Rassendyll falls in love with the King&apos;s intended bride, the Princess Flavia. Having put Ruritania to rights, he returns to England and a somewhat pointlessly unadventurous existence. Hope was inspired to write the novel by seeing two men in a London street who closely resembled each other.

Two boys grow up in the same household: Amir is privileged while Hassan is virtually a servant, but they remain uneasy allies until a brutal incident during Kabul&apos;s annual kite-\ufb02ying festival in\ufb02icts wounds that will never heal. A moving and ultimately life-a\ufb03rming story of love and betrayal, redemption and forgiveness, and private worlds destroyed by public horrors. Joanna HinesBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Richard Hughes: A High Wind in Jamaica (1929)  Before Lord of the Flies there was A High Wind in Jamaica, an un\ufb02inching, wryly observed portrait of the madness of children. Hughes \ufb01lters his pirate adventure through the sensibilities of a band of middle-class siblings, and the e\ufb00ect is intoxicating. These primal creatures come at events from left-\ufb01eld \u2014 fastening on certain details while glossing over others, so that terrible events \ufb02utter, half-glimpsed, in the shadows. Some of these are even caused by the children themselves. Xan BrooksBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Samuel Johnson: Rasselas (1759)  Tired of a life of constant pleasure in Happy Valley, Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia, travels to Egypt to meet scholars, astronomers, shepherds, hermits and poets, and discovers that &quot;while you are making the choice of life, you neglect to live&quot;. He then returns to Abyssinia. Written in eight days to pay for his mother&apos;s funeral, Dr Johnson&apos;s philosophical romance became a bestseller when it was published in 1759. The plot is thin and &quot;nothing is concluded&quot;, but its true appeal is as an essay on the nature of happiness and the vanity of human wishes.  Ian Pindar Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop James Jones: From Here to Eternity (1951)  Set in Hawaii in 1941, just before the attack on Pearl Harbor, this novel is loosely based on the author&apos;s experiences in the US army. The story follows several characters, including Captain Dana &quot;Dynamite&quot; Holmes and First Sergeant Milt Warden, but at its heart is a con\ufb02ict between authority and individuality, as Private Robert E Lee Prewitt stubbornly resists the treatment meted out to him by his superiors to crush his spirit. Published in 1951, it became a bestseller and gave the world a memorable \ufb01ctional hero who dares to take on the system.  Ian Pindar Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop MacKinlay Kantor: Andersonville (1955)  The Confederate prisoner-of-war camp Andersonville held 33,000 Union POWs during the American civil war of 1861 to 1865. Based on prisoners&apos; memoirs, this Pulitzer prize-winning novel appeared in 1955, and uses real and \ufb01ctional characters to explore the conditions in the camp from multiple viewpoints. The book includes a sympathetic portrait of Henry Wirz, the camp&apos;s commandant, as well as the camp physician and various guards. Kantor also shows how the ordinary prisoners were preyed upon by a gang of thugs called the Raiders, led by a Union soldier called William Collins.  Ian PindarBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop  Thomas Keneally: Confederates (1979)  This realist epic, shortlisted for the Booker prize, follows a ragbag Confederate army as it crosses Virginia to take part in the 1862 Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest con\ufb02 ict of the American civil war. Drawing on his extensive research of the incident, Keneally spares the reader none of the horrors of war. He also adds a level of personal con\ufb02ict, intrigue and romance by focusing on Private Usaph Bumpass, his wife Ephaphtha and her lover Decatur Cate, who is one of Usaph&apos;s companions or &quot;confederates&quot; in the battle. Retribution comes when Cate su\ufb00ers an emasculating injury.

By the end of the war he had become an unlikely hero, risking his life to save more than a thousand Jews from being sent to the concentration camps. Inspired by meeting a Schindler survivor, and based on the testimonies of survivors and documents of the period, Keneally&apos;s historical novel caused an outcry when it won the Booker in 1982. Was it a work of \ufb01ction or faction? Liam Neeson starred in Spielberg&apos;s screen adaptation, Schindler&apos;s List.

When his plane is shot down, he parachutes to safety in a German prisoner-of-war camp, but after the war he discovers his crew are all dead. In 1949, while employed as an extra in a war \ufb01lm about a prison camp, the painful memories come \ufb02 ooding back. Through an extraordinary act of ventriloquism, she describes the waste and eventual resurrection of a young life shattered by war,&quot; said the judges when they awarded Kennedy the Costa Book of the Year in 2007. &quot;This book is a masterpiece.&quot;  Ian PindarBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Arthur Koestler: Darkness at Noon (1940)  Along with Orwell&apos;s Nineteen Eighty-Four (which it strongly in\ufb02uenced), Koestler&apos;s novel expresses his generation of intellectuals&apos; traumatic disillusionment with Soviet Communism \u2014 the &quot;God that Failed&quot; (as a book edited by Koestler called it). The narrative centres on the scandalously corrupt Moscow &quot;show trials&quot; (in fact a bloody Stalinist purge) of the 1930s. The novel ponders the question, why did so many of the accused meekly confess their guilt in court? The answer is given in the person of Koestler&apos;s hero, Rubashov, who, under interrogation, is eventually &quot;educated&quot; into the admissions of wrongdoing that lead, inevitably, to his execution. John SutherlandBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Jerzy Kosinski: The Painted Bird (1965)  After losing his parents in the mayhem of the second world war, a Polish child wanders through the countryside at the mercy of the brutal and ignorant central or eastern European villagers he encounters, who assume he is a Jew or a Gypsy. When it \ufb01 rst appeared in 1965, this controversial novel full of graphic descriptions of murder, torture, rape and bestiality was widely regarded as semi-autobiographical, but is now accepted as \ufb01 ction. Dogged by controversy, Kosinski committed suicide in 1991, leaving behind a note: &quot;I am going to put myself to sleep now for a bit longer than usual.

(1982)  Levi, most renowned for his coruscating documentary report on life in a concentration camp, If This Is A Man, published this, his only novel, in 1982. Set in 1943, it follows a group of Jewish partisans making their way, behind enemy lines, across a Europe unmarked by place names and directions, with Palestine their aim. The horrors they have endured are revealed only through dreams and halting recollections and, as in all Levi&apos;s work, their days are characterised by the biggest threat of all: the disease of despair. &quot;The war would last forever: death, pursuit, escape would never end, the snow would never stop falling, day would never break.&quot; Nicola Barr Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Jack London: The Call of the Wild (1903)  St Bernard Buck leads a good, even pampered life when he is abducted, sold into a team of dogs pulling sleds across the frozen Alaskan landscapes, transporting a new &quot;yellow metal&quot; that is changing men&apos;s natures. &quot;It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law, and Buck met it halfway.&quot; Only the most extreme of traits \u2014 human or otherwise \u2014 are on show in London&apos;s classic, relentless adventure story. Good, evil, respect, dignity, primal fear, blood lust, leadership, greatness and cowardice are all in constant battle as Buck struggles for survival against his new owners and the &quot;devil dog&quot; Spitz.

There they meet the reckless Jimmy Blevins, a younger teenager in possession of a \ufb01ne horse that may not be his, a pistol and a nose for trouble. Jimmy loses the horse and pistol in a storm; John and Lacey decide to help get them back, setting o\ufb00 a fatal chain of events which also have consequences for Cole&apos;s love a\ufb00 air with the daughter of a Mexican ranch owner. This is both a coming of age story and an elegy for a lost American era. Ginny Hooker Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Cormac McCarthy: Blood Meridian (1985)  Blood Meridian is not a revisionist western so much as a gore-soaked demolition of the myth of manifest destiny. Using the true-life Glanton gang as its touchstone, McCarthy drops an unnamed protagonist (&quot;the kid&quot;) in among a band of bounty hunters and proceeds to paint the frontier in stark, Darwinian terms \u2014 as a brutal, bloody free-for-all. The New World is born out of violence. It belongs not to the humble settler but to men such as &quot;the judge&quot;, a corpulent, amoral monster who by the \ufb01 nal chapter has emerged victorious.

Nicola Barr  Buy this book at the Guardian bookshop Norman Mailer: The Naked and the Dead (1948)  Mailer was just 26 when his debut novel was published, three years after the end of the second world war. His tale of a platoon of young American soldiers making their way through treacherous jungle on the Japanese-held island of Anopopei was without respite. Its focus on the ordinary American in all his bullying pettiness and fear, its detailed depictions of armed combat and insight into the psychology of men in pursuit of power caught the mood of an American public searching for the reality of war; it made this a bestseller and Mailer a superstar.

M\u00e1rquez&apos;s looping chronology and extended cast of interrelated characters give us history as a continuous process of repetition and recon\ufb01 guration. This novel remains the beacon of magical realism and the standard bearer for Latin American literature; in Spanish, only Don Quixote has been more successful.

The Roundheads burn the Beverleys&apos; house, Arnwood, and the children, thought dead, are given refuge by a faithful old retainer, Jacob Armitage, in his cottage in the New Forest. The story follows their growing to adulthood and \u2014 with the Restoration \u2014 the rebuilding of Arnwood and the Beverley family fortunes. The novel was immensely popular with Victorian children and became the pattern for innumerable juvenile tales over the next century. John SutherlandBuy this book at the Guardian bookshop Herman Melville: Moby-Dick or, The Whale (1851)  We all know the story: man seeks unattainable object of deranged desire and causes general devastation in the process. This is the novel of restless human drive: to perfection, to mastery, to madness, to write a novel in the \ufb01rst place, to aim for something other than &quot;a damp, drizzly November in the soul&quot;. A Very Big Theme, necessarily expressed in dense, wildly idiosyncratic prose as ambitious as Ahab himself.

The exotic Tonkinese ladies and wistful Bali Hai romances give it lasting (and musical) appeal, but the morality of Michener&apos;s tales is that heroism is not only seen on the battle\ufb01eld, and his commander-narrator&apos;s voice has a downbeat languor that captures the spirit of a war- weary nation (&quot;The waiting.

She (like Morante herself) is half-Jewish, and lives in a permanent state of fear that her forbidden faith will be discovered. Morante&apos;s eight-part epic closely examines Jewish identity in a context of Aryan domination. The contrast between Nino&apos;s involvement in the war and Giuseppe&apos;s unsullied innocence further demonstrates the corrupting e\ufb00ect of war on its victims&apos; sense of self.

The cause of this crisis is the deregulation and privatisation that was started under Thatcher, which has brought economic catastrophe. It must be, and is now being, reversed. But in the immediate future virtually every Londoner is going to be worse off as a result. Many will lose their jobs. An economic shock on that scale will affect every other sphere of society: sustaining good public and social services, protecting the environment, stopping racism and maintaining good community relations, as well as affecting the entire culture of the city. It also requires open and constructive discussions within a broad framework of progressive opinion to develop fresh ideas. Within this framework no one strand has all the answers. But it is possible and necessary to hammer out some of the areas where the progressive majority in London can unite around radical steps to sustain our city, support social justice and promote good community relations. This issue of how to protect London and Londoners in the context of the worst economic crisis for 80 years will push aside the kind of trivia that some commentators and politicians prefer to addressing the real issues affecting our city. On the directly economic front, four interlocking challenges have to be tackled. The first is that this crisis is registering a colossal shift in the centre of gravity of the world economy with the rise of the huge new markets of China and India. China, for example, is now the single largest source of finance in the world. Rapidly deepening London&apos;s links with China, India and other dynamic Asian economies is essential for the London economy across the board, from business services to tourism. The debate about whether London needs offices abroad can now be seen to be just out of touch with economic reality. London needs more, not less, international openness and links if its massive service sector and creative industries, which will continue to supply the great majority of jobs and incomes in the city, are to prosper. Second, it is clear that the core of Britain&apos;s banking system must, and probably will be, nationalised. Contrary to Thatcherite nonsense still coming out of the new London mayor&apos;s office, the deregulation espoused by Thatcher in large part caused the present catastrophe and offers no way out of it. The real issue is how to make the newly nationalised banks successful. That will be critical to London&apos;s success. Third, with private sector investment collapsing and the international benchmark for city infrastructure being set, and constantly raised, by the huge scales of investment in cities such as Singapore and Shanghai, we need massive investment in London&apos;s infrastructure in areas such as transport, housing and other public services. This is necessary immediately to counter the downward spiral of recession, but it is equally vital over a prolonged period to meet the competitive challenge that is now coming from Asia, to make London more competitive and to maintain and boost employment and living standards.The &quot;small government&quot; approach of the present Tory administration of London is a recipe for both short-term and long-term disaster for the city. Fourth, in a recession the living standards of low- and middle-income Londoners come under the greatest attack and have to be protected. All of the steps above assist this but more specific and short-term measures will be needed. For example, Boris Johnson pushing up fares above the rate of inflation, while cutting transport investment, is the last thing we need. Instead of throwing money away by ending the congestion charge in the richest part of London, Kensington, and scrapping plans to tax gas-guzzlers more, London government should be doing the opposite. Investment should be sustained, fares held down and money raised by charging those who choose to clog the roads and pollute the roads with gas-guzzlers or use cars in the centre of the city, where public transport is far more efficient. Housing is another key area where massive government intervention at every level is now essential. The private sector is not building homes because its profits are falling \u2013 and this will put the greatest pressure on affordable housing. But that does not mean Londoners&apos; need for homes is any less. So another programme to tackle the crisis must be massive government-led investment in building new, affordable homes. To be effective this has to include ensuring the right of local authorities to draw on all appropriate income streams to build homes. London&apos;s relationship with the emerging new world economy is intimately linked to the correct orientation of the culture and community relations of our city. London must be a centre of cultural creativity, but it can only be this to the degree that it is simultaneously open to the culture creativity of the entire world. That is the kind of open city which will produce the best music, film, art and community relations. It is the kind of city that welcomes international visitors, whether as tourists, workers or investors. And it requires taking on and defeating every form of racism, xenophobia, religious and cultural intolerance that some politicians will try to stir up to scapegoat minority communities as people face the greatest economic crisis most of us have ever seen. Anything else will destroy the community relations essential to one of the most diverse cities and in the world, and repel, rather than attract, the international connections that must be at the heart of our economic strategy. Finally, whatever the short-term economic pressures, the great priority of the environment, above all, climate change, continues. There has to be a radical shift in the burden of taxation onto the most well-off and those who produce the greatest pollution. That is a further reason why holding down fares and proceeding with a CO2 charge on gas-guzzlers, together with a return to London&apos;s radical environmental agenda, is required.", "tags": ["Credit crunch", "Housing", "Society", "Economic policy", "Politics", "London", "Boris Johnson", "Local government"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-23T15:40:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/25/tennis-roger-federer-del-potro-berdych", "sentences": ["For a young guy to cope with the pressure and make the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai at the end of last year was a great effort."], "title": "Tennis: Roger Federer faces Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro in Australian Open after beating Thomas Berdych in five sets", "article": "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro has always been a tall story. Now the 6ft 6in 20-year-old Argentinian has the opportunity, having risen sharply to No6 in the world, to make the sort of mark at the Australian Open that would place him even closer to the major-winning elite at the top of the men&apos;s game. All he has to do is beat Roger Federer on Tuesday. &quot;He had a great run after Wimbledon, winning two tournaments on clay and two on hard courts, kind of out of the blue. For a young guy to cope with the pressure and make the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai at the end of last year was a great effort. It&apos;s going to be an interesting match,&quot; said Federer, omitting only that he had won his previous three encounters against the towering Argentine without dropping a set. A year ago, before he lost to Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals here, Federer was all but untouchable in the grand slam events, having won eight of the previous 10 majors, with only Rafael Nadal, on the clay of Roland Garros, capable of denying him. The Swiss continues to be the benchmark by which others gauge their progress, though these days the fear factor has been considerably diminished. &quot;He&apos;s human, mate&quot;, as the Aussies would say. Federer was beaten in 15 matches last year, twice as many as in the two previous seasons combined. He also lost \u2013 and it had been unthinkable \u2013 his Wimbledon crown. Suddenly, and rather shockingly, he had become more than a little vulnerable. The patina of invincibility had gone, though normal service was resumed at the US Open when he claimed his 13th major to place him one short of Pete Sampras&apos;s all-time record. Yet, as the new year unfolded, he was unravelled for the third successive time by Andy Murray, whom he had beaten so comprehensively at Flushing Meadows. Last year&apos;s doubts resurfaced. Three straight-set wins here had calmed the worries of his legion of supporters and then, in the fourth round, the trapdoor opened up. He trailed Thomas Berdych of the Czech Republic by two sets. The crowd in the Rod Laver Arena gawped. In eight previous meetings Federer had won seven. Berdych had threatened untold damage when he charged into the top 20 three years ago but the power surge disguised a fragile temperament. He became known as the Czech choker, though nobody dared cough at 3-3 in the third set. Federer looked ill at ease and flat; he was unusually passive, waiting for Berdych to make mistakes rather than force the issue. &quot;It seemed like every corner he wanted to hit, he hit it,&quot; said Federer, who only four times before in his career had come back to win from two sets down. It is a reflection of his ability to close out best-of-five-set matches early that Federer had played only 23 of five sets since 1999 and, when he was in his grand slam pomp during 2006 and 2007, he played only three. &quot;Once you start running behind against a player who can take such huge cuts at the ball, he can only get more confident and that made it very, very difficult to find any rhythm,&quot; said Federer, whose footwork, despite his protestations to the contrary, appeared sluggish in those opening two sets. The last time Federer had lost before the semi-finals in any slam event was at Roland Garros in 2004, though even in this precarious position and with Berdych playing so well, he was not thinking about losing. He never does. &quot;It&apos;s good to have five-setters to see where you are at. In the end it becomes very mental and I know that is where my biggest strengths always come into play,&quot; said Federer. &quot;I&apos;m always going to favour myself in a fifth set.&quot; But that was what had been so devastating at Wimbledon last year when Nadal won the fifth set of that epic final 9-7. Berdych was no Nadal. In the third set he began to miss easy volleys, while an awful overhead miss spoke volumes of his mental gremlins. He doubted himself, Federer did not. And that was the key, the Swiss winning 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. Djokovic did not get on court until well after 11pm, reaching the quarter-finals with a 6-1, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2 win over Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, the 2006 Australian Open runner-up. Last year Baghdatis was involved in a match with Lleyton Hewitt that did not finish until 4.34am. These late matches are &quot; a pain in the arse&quot;, said Baghdatis, though by comparison this was an early cut, finishing at 2.26. Djokovic, the reigning champion, will now play Andy Roddick, three times a semi-finalist here. Roddick, under the guidance of Larry Stefanki, who once coached Tim Henman, has played with growing confidence and easily defeated Spain&apos;s Tommy Robredo. &quot;Novak has won here, so I&apos;m going to be up against it,&quot; said the American. However the feeling remains that Djokovic, with the burden of the title defence on his shoulders, is vulnerable.", "tags": ["Australian Open 2009", "Australian Open", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-25T22:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/26/andy-murray-australian-open-tennis1", "sentences": ["Roger Federer knew Murray was shattered in the final of the US Open last year and Nikolay Davydenko could see the Scot was exhausted in the semi-final of the subsequent Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, the Scot having beaten Federer the previous day."], "title": "Great Scot? Steve Bierley's guide to how Andy Murray can improve", "article": "First Serve Murray has developed this into a potent weapon that can win him a lot of cheap points. Against Fernando \u00adVerdasco he served seven aces and his percentage was good. It is still not as consistent as he would like, though. Second Serve This remains attackable, but it is also improving. Murray is such a good returner that when his serve is going well he is extremely difficult to beat; he must work hard to attain greater variation. Ground strokes One of Murray&apos;s great strengths is his ability to mix up the pace and destroy his opponent&apos;s rhythm and he is one of the most interesting players to watch, simply because he has so much variety. But that can also cause problems. Because Murray has such good hands, and can turn defence into attack in an instant, he sometimes overdoes the complexity when he could finish points more quickly. He has the necessary power on his forehand and his backhand, but on occasions he is inclined to keep too much in reserve. Fitness Murray has worked immensely hard \u2013 too hard, some have suggested. That may have left his body open to the sort of illness he picked up in Australia. However there is little evidence for this. He had won all of his previous five-set matches \u2013 the last two from two sets down \u2013 since Rafael Nadal beat him here over five in 2007. More immediately, Murray needs to work on his body language when he is feeling the strain. Roger Federer knew Murray was shattered in the final of the US Open last year and Nikolay Davydenko could see the Scot was exhausted in the semi-final of the subsequent Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, the Scot having beaten Federer the previous day. Temperament Murray has matured on and off the court. He now speaks fluently and thoughtfully about his matches and rarely loses his control when playing. He does not needlessly expend emotional energy, as he once did. Experience Despite having risen to No4 in the world behind Nadal, Federer and Novak Djokovic, Murray&apos;s experience is still relatively limited, after he missed the French Open and Wimbledon in 2007 with a wrist injury. The past eight months have seen him move to a different level and he will need to adjust to the added stress, and the demands on his time. Can he win a major? Murray&apos;s best surface is hard and he has always believed that the US Open is his best chance of winning a slam, having won the junior title at Flushing Meadows and having reached the final last year. He is also comfortable on grass, which, combined with the home support, gives him the edge over most leading players. That means winning Wimbledon is also a realistic target. Murray&apos;s verdict &quot;For me this defeat is not a disaster. I&apos;m still playing well, and I lost to a good player in a very close match [Overall Murray won one more point than Verdasco]. I&apos;ll have more chances to win grand slams&quot;", "tags": ["Australian Open 2009", "Andy Murray", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-27T00:05:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/27/china-globalrecession", "sentences": ["Writing in the Shanghai Daily, columnist Wang Yong raged that a local official&apos;s calls to invest in property as a &quot;patriotic duty&quot; were a &quot;bizarre call to beggar the poor to bail out housing speculators&quot;."], "title": "Catherine Sampson: China's Communist party is anxiously awaiting the fallout of the global downturn", "article": "The fireworks that ushered in the lunar new year were as deafeningly defiant as ever, but as the red ash is swept from the gutters and the air of celebration cools, China&apos;s Communist party leaders will be watching anxiously to see how the mood of the population changes.  China&apos;s economic and political future now hinges not only on policy decisions made at the centre, but on the response of provincial officials, migrant workers, university graduates and many others. The Communist party&apos;s claim to legitimacy, founded on the now faltering economic boom, is now at stake. After early attempts to try to pretend to its own population that the global economic slowdown would have little impact on China, the tone of official statements is becoming increasingly dour.  Exports, energy consumption, property prices and the stock market have all fallen, and fourth quarter growth slowed. As Jonathan Fenby wrote here, however, these facts do not necessarily spell catastrophe.  They do mean that no one is in any doubt that while China may not be in the same boat as the west, it is adrift on the same sea. Yesterday (26 January), finance minister Xie Xuren said there it would be difficult to balance the budget this year, and warned that external and internal conditions impacting on China were &quot;very severe&quot;.  It is already clear that migrant workers have been the first to suffer, as exports have dropped and factories have closed in the south of the country. Many who found themselves without a job returned to their homes early for the new year holiday. It will not be until after that holiday that we find out whether they can be reabsorbed by the rural economy (many families have had their land confiscated by local officials), or whether those who are unemployed simply hunker down grimly and wait for better days. Or whether newfound poverty leads to an angry expression of frustration in the countryside.  Early this month, Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, warned that the unemployment situation was &quot;grim&quot;. Later in the spring and summer it will become clear how many new graduates are going to be unemployed. Graduate unemployment was already a problem last year (27% of new graduates could not find a job in 2008), and is a particularly sensitive subject because of the heavy investment by families to fund a degree. In 2009, the 20th anniversary of the student-led demonstrations that ended in a massacre by the People&apos;s Liberation Army, student dissatisfaction could be a political minefield.  Graduates may of course simply take refuge in their parents&apos; flats and wait for the recovery that will inevitably come. That might drive parents to quiet despair, but it is unlikely to result in protests on the streets.  The finance minister told officials nationwide yesterday that they must cut costs. Car purchases, meetings, catering and overseas travel have been frozen at last year&apos;s figures. Some provinces are attempting to cut costs. This may come hard to some provincial officials, who are deeply attached to their perks and adept at turning a deaf ear to orders from the centre. So far, protests of all sorts have been scattered and easily contained by the leadership. But discussion of government policy is becoming heated. The website danwei.org, which follows Chinese media, has noted and translated fierce debate in newspapers and on the internet about official calls for the population to spend as a &quot;patriotic duty&quot;.  Writing in the Shanghai Daily, columnist Wang Yong raged that a local official&apos;s calls to invest in property as a &quot;patriotic duty&quot; were a &quot;bizarre call to beggar the poor to bail out housing speculators&quot;. Continued stability will depend on whether ordinary people feel that their needs are being addressed in the stimulus package. The leadership says it will raise the personal tax allowance, which will be welcomed, and that more will be spent on medical care in an effort to stop people hoarding savings to be used in case of a serious illness.  The next year brings the 60th anniversary of the communist takeover of China. By October, when a huge military parade is planned on the country&apos;s national day, we may know whether the party&apos;s control remains absolute, or whether the economic crisis has put unbearable stress on the system.", "tags": ["China", "Global recession", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-27T21:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/29/china-economy-growth", "sentences": ["The latest government stimulus package of 4tn yuan ranges from development in transport infrastructure (the new Beijing-Shanghai route will be the longest high-speed train in the world, covering 1,200km in five hours) to subsidies for the purchases of domestic appliances in rural areas."], "title": "Michele Geraci: The financial crisis gives China a chance to build a more harmonious society", "article": "While the western world is questioning the long-term viability of a totally free market economy and nationalising its banks, the current global financial crisis offers China a unique opportunity to accelerate its evolution towards a more &quot;harmonious society&quot; \u2013 that is, a society where wealth is more evenly distributed across its population. There may be no better time for the Chinese government to implement social policies and focus growth on the tail end of the income spectrum, even if this will come at the expenses of headline GDP. After all, GDP is a single figure to which we tend to give, sometimes, too much importance: the debate on whether China&apos;s GDP in 2009 will grow by 6% or 9% seems to neglect the fact that the country has been on a double-digit growth trajectory for a decade and that the &quot;call&quot; on China development must be based on long-term projection, not the next 12 months. The shift towards a more even income distribution could have a cost in terms of overall GDP growth. But China can always blame this on declining exports to Europe and the US (whose actual impact on Chinese GDP growth is in itself a topic of heated debate, anyway). Many years of emphasis on economic growth have created enormous personal wealth for some Chinese and eradicated poverty among more than 300 million people (data that human rights activists often fail to remember). However, right now narrowing income disparities and maintaining social stability should take priority over GDP growth per se. It may seem a paradox, but exactly after 30 years of market-driven economy and reforms, it is finally social policies that take higher priority. In other words, China may achieve a socialist system after experiencing a short, and somewhat limited, capitalist system. The current global mayhem also offers a theoretical backdrop for a new course of action \u2013 and China is in a good position to learn from other countries&apos; mistakes. Chinese leaders have talked of creating a harmonious society for quite some time, and it is now apparent in many corners of daily life, from real estate advertisement (&quot;harmonious homes&quot;) to public transport (&quot;harmonious trip&quot;). National TV broadcasts commercials that encourage the population to offer a helping hand to those in need. The Paralympic games was broadcast almost 24 hours a day. The latest government stimulus package of 4tn yuan ranges from development in transport infrastructure (the new Beijing-Shanghai route will be the longest high-speed train in the world, covering 1,200km in five hours) to subsidies for the purchases of domestic appliances in rural areas. The plan also targets public housing, education, healthcare and environment in a clever combination of actions aimed at both developing social projects and stimulating domestic consumption, which is part of a longer-term plan to make the Chinese economy less dependent on foreign demand. The combination of the undeniable economic crisis and the shift in government policy is likely to have its losers: some enterprises, especially in the export-driven province of Zhejiang (Wenzhou city in particular) are beginning to suffer from declining foreign sales and many businesses are shutting down. It is not clear how many of those foreclosures are directly linked to actual worsening economic conditions or simply due to the drying up of credit facilities generously offered until now for businesses that were never profitable anyway. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. In any case, the process will clean up unprofitable sectors and consolidate businesses. Meanwhile, China could reduce its dependency on exports and try to increase domestic consumption. The challenges are immense, with many pitfalls along the way \u2013 but I believe China has both the willingness and the capability to achieve this goal, as well as $2tn in foreign reserves. If this plan works, and only time will tell, it will be the crowning of a spectacular development success story that Deng Xiaoping began in 1978.", "tags": ["China", "Credit crunch", "Global recession", "World news", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-29T21:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/feb/01/dali-china", "sentences": ["Dali is a four-hour bus trip from the nearest big city, Kunming, which is an hour&apos;s flight from Bangkok, or three hours from either Beijing or Shanghai."], "title": "Simon Lewis in the Yunnan province", "article": "The mellow little town of Dali is my favourite China oasis, my retreat when the pace of the cities seems too frenetic. It&apos;s the capital of the minority Bai people in the southwestern province of Yunnan. The centre of the walled old town is China-lite, a tourist-friendly strip of hippyish caf\u00e9s, but outside it&apos;s pretty and relaxed, and the countryside around is breathtaking: in the dramatic Cangshan mountain range to the west I came across esoteric temples, guesthouse retreats, hot springs and even a secret monastery of kung fu monks. At the huge Erhai Lake, just to the east, I sat and watched locals fishing with trained cormorants.  As the closest uptight China gets to bohemia, the town has become the haunt of alternative types from the big cities, which makes the bar life intriguing, and I bumped into a few famous writers and bands, down to renew their creative juices.  Chinese student dropouts turn up, learn to fire-juggle and dream about opening a caf\u00e9. But the place maintains, at least for the moment, its rural charm.  The main street, cobbled Renmin Lu, for instance, looks the way Chinese roads do in the imagination - its terraced houses have decorative shutters and grass growing between the roof tiles; minority women in traditional dress squat beside their produce, while tailors and cobblers work in their little stores - and, towering over it all, are the mist-shrouded mountains.  \u2022 Bad Traffic by Simon Lewis is published by Sort of Books, \u00a37.99. Dali is a four-hour bus trip from the nearest big city, Kunming, which is an hour&apos;s flight from Bangkok, or three hours from either Beijing or Shanghai. Flights cost around \u00a3120 from each of those cities. I recommend staying at the Moonshine Inn (www.bb-china.com), a well-run guesthouse in a traditional Bai courtyard house, or for a mountain retreat, try the Higherland Inn (www.higherland.com), accessible by cable car.

I&apos;m a guest editor for Observer Sport Monthly magazine.  Gordon Brown: That&apos;s good of you.  RF: It&apos;s nice of them. And obviously I was reading up that you are a Raith Rovers supporter...  GB: Well, you will know all about our problems then [laughs].  RF: When did you start supporting them?  GB: When I was really little I played football all the time; there was a park very near the house. And the football ground was literally round the corner. I started selling programmes that was when Raith Rovers were in the top division, so they were playing against Rangers and Celtic and Aberdeen and all the top teams. The best player we ever had was Jim Baxter, and he then went to Rangers, sold for \u00a317,500. People thought that he&apos;d fallen out with the local people because they didn&apos;t think that was a fair price, they should have got more for him . He went on to play for Scotland. But Jim, tragically, had a drinking problem . I met him a lot of times later in his life. He thought training was for other people [laughs]. He died, Jim, very young. We erected a statue of him. He&apos;s probably the best footballer to come out of Fife, if not Scotland, just an amazing passer of the ball. So that was my introduction to football.  RF: What&apos;s the \ufb01rst match you ever went to?  GB: Raith Rovers-East Fife.  RF: And what was the score?  GB: I think it was Raith Rovers 2-1. I was sitting there with my father and my father had this habit, when the other team played well and did something good, he&apos;d clap them as well. And I said, &apos;Why, how you can do that? We&apos;re supporting Raith Rovers?&apos; [Laughs] So I went to lots of matches, and I&apos;d loved to have played more football, but that&apos;s how it is.  RF: Do you play any sports now?  GB: I did, I played a lot of rugby as well, and I ran in the Scottish athletics championships. I played a lot of tennis, a lot of football, a lot of rugby, and then I had this eye injury and had to give up.  RF: So if you could have been a professional in any sport  GB: I think football, to me, is the best sport to watch. But I did play a lot of rugby because the only other thing I had was speed. I was quite fast at that time. But to be a good footballer you have to have this great balance, haven&apos;t you, you&apos;ve got to have this great ability to move.  RF: I think you&apos;re either born with it or you&apos;re not, the balance. You can&apos;t learn it.  GB: I don&apos;t know if you ever watch rugby?  RF: I watch rugby a lot. I prefer rugby league myself, to be honest, to watch.  GB: Well, rugby union is more like rugby league than it was before. Rugby is amazing how fast it&apos;s become. If you were a forward before you could probably get o\ufb00 without being a great passer of the ball, but you can&apos;t now. You must be enjoying your football now? Sir Alex is great. RF: Yeah, I&apos;m enjoying it now. When I started at West Ham ...  GB: There were some great players there.  RF: Di Canio\u2026 Lampard was there. I never wanted to leave and at the start it was really good ... but since I&apos;ve been at Man United it&apos;s been a dream, really. To work with the manager is the best thing.  GB: You are having a pretty good season.  RF: Yeah, we are in a good position now. The Club World Cup was a bit of a hindrance but luckily we won it and that instilled a bit of con\ufb01dence in the team again.  GB: You have got such a good squad of players, haven&apos;t you?  RF: The team the manager picked yesterday [when United beat Chelsea 3-0 at Old Trafford] \u2013 I don&apos;t know if you saw it, but no one in the world would have picked that team. But he&apos;s a genius, he&apos;s unbelievable. You would have picked Scholes or Carrick, de\ufb01nitely; both of them were on the bench.  GB:And he picked Giggs and Darren Fletcher. Is Fletcher a good guy?  RF:Yeah, really nice guy. He&apos;s done really well this year, he&apos;s probably been our best player. He&apos; really up and down, works hard for the team. Typical Scot, isn&apos;t he? [Laughs.] Works hard.  GB: I saw David Moyes the other day, he played for Dunfermline, but they didn&apos;t give him the manager&apos;s job. Then he went to Preston and Everton. He wasn&apos;t a brilliant player but he got his coaching certi\ufb01cate at the age of 22, because he decided early on as a player that he wanted to be a coach.  RF: I want to be a coach. A few years yet...  GB: You will be very good at it.  RF: I hope so.  GB: David Moyes said that all the time he was playing he was taking notes from every manager he worked with.  RF: I&apos;ll tell you who does that \u2013 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He was doing that when he was a player. He works with the reserves now, he&apos;s good with the lads, he&apos;s doing well. He&apos;s a proper student of the game, he was always taking notes on what the manager said and different methods of training we used to do.  GB: You have got all these diets and nutritional experts now.  RF: When I \ufb01rst started playing, John Hartson&apos;s meal on a Friday before a game was spaghetti bolognese with a fried egg on top. Now the chef would scream at you if you even mentioned fried eggs. Have you been to our training ground?  GB: I was at the training ground with Alex some time ago. It&apos;s very impressive.  RF: Yeah, it&apos;s beautiful.  GB: I went to the Emirates Stadium, and the Arsenal dressing room compared to the visitors dressing room is just two di\ufb00erent worlds.  RF: Most dressing rooms are the same. When yougo to see David Moyes at Everton, go into the visiting changing room \u2013 you can walk through touching both walls it&apos;s that small and tight.  GB: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is very big on diet isn&apos;t he?  RF: Yeah, I think he was one of the main reasons why, in this country, it changed. He had a lot of di\ufb00 erent methods and training regimes, diet and nutrition, obviously picked up from when he was in Japan. And at Arsenal they had a big drinking culture \u2013 Tony Adams and Ray Parlour \u2013 and he changed it dramatically.  GB: And he does specialise in bringing young players on, doesn&apos;t he?  RF: They&apos;ve got a young lad called Jack Wilshere who&apos;s really special. I spoke to Wenger about him when he was training with England \u2013 he&apos;s centre mid\ufb01eld or on the left or the right. GB: And they&apos;ve got that Welsh guy ...  RF: Aaron Ramsey. You know he almost signed for us? The manager spoke to him, but he eventually signed for them for some reason. The manager won&apos;t forget that.  GB: He&apos;s got most of the people he&apos;s gone for ...  RF: I think Paul Gascoigne is the one \u2013 did you watch the programme the manager has done? With David Frost, I think. He said that Gascoigne was his biggest regret, not getting him.  GB: Because he would have sorted him out.  RF: Yeah, maybe he could have changed him. If anyone could have, it would have been him.  GB: It&apos;s amazing he hasn&apos;t lost the energy. You could see him yesterday.  RF: Yeah, the passion&apos;s there.  GB: I hope he might be manager of a British Olympic team ...  RF: Would he be your choice?  GB: Yes, I think so. I think he would be everybody&apos;s choice, actually. The danger in 2012 is that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland won&apos;t participate because they think they are going to lose their international status, as in the World Cup.  RF: I&apos;d love to play in the Olympics representing Great Britain. How do you think we will get on with that?  GB: Fifa has already passed a resolution saying that if Scotland and Northern Ireland agree to be part of it, it will not a\ufb00 ect their status. What Fifa are saying is that they will recognise this as a one-o\ufb00 and not penalise them. So now we have to get the Scottish FA and the Welsh and the Northern Irish to agree to be part of it.  RF: Have they been a bit o\ufb03sh about it?  GB: Yes, and I think it will take a bit of time but I hope we will be able to persuade them. The Olympics is such a big event and you guys should have the chance to win Olympic gold. You will still be young by then [laughs].  RF: I will be one of the two players over 30.  GB: It&apos;s two over 23 I think.  RF: Surely I&apos;ve got to be one of them! I&apos;ll be campaigning for that.  GB: Well, one of them will probably be a goalkeeper, and one of them will be you.  RF: Me and David Seaman then.  GB: Seaman! Bring him back! But Britain&apos;s a great sporting nation and I keep saying, the next 10 years will be the best years for British sport ever, because we&apos;ve got the Olympics 2012, we&apos;ve got the Commonwealth Games 2014 in Glasgow. We&apos;re hoping to get the rugby World Cup 2015, we&apos;re oping to get the football World Cup in 2018 \u2013 so just think of the next 10 years.  RF: They won&apos;t give us all that, surely? The powers that be aren&apos;t going to...  GB: We&apos;ve got the Olympics, and the Commonwealth Games. I think we&apos;ll get the rugby World Cup. The question is, can we get the football World Cup? Will you still be playing?  RF:When&apos;s that?  GB: 2018.  RF:[Laughs.] That&apos;s just past my retirement ... I&apos;ll be the manager then.  GB: I met your brother in the summer ...  RF: Yeah, he said.  GB: Did you and your brother play together a lot?  RF: Yeah, I used to be in goal and make him do little skills and that. Obviously I was seven years older than him, so I trained him, so I take all the credit.  GB: My older brother is two and a half years older than me and my younger brother is \ufb01ve years&apos; di\ufb00 erence from me, so my younger brother had seven years&apos; di\ufb00 erence and I think my older brother didn&apos;t really take much interest in my younger brother.  RF: It was lucky it was just me and Anton, to be honest. I was bored a lot of the time so I would just take him out and he had a mate the same age and I would make them play against each other all the time, and I&apos;d always let his mate win.  GB: So you could be the goalkeeper as well?  RF: Did you not see me go in goal? It was against Portsmouth in the FA Cup last year. I was the worst goalkeeper you&apos;ve probably ever seen.  GB: You didn&apos;t let in any goals, did you?  RF: The keeper gave away a penalty and I went in goal. It was a poor excuse for a dive [laughs]. So I know you are a big sports fan \u2013 have you ever rescheduled meetings around sporting events?  GB: Oh yeah, all the time. Now you can actually tape these matches which you didn&apos;t used to be able to do. I mean, I watched the Manchester United match yesterday at about nine o&apos;clock last night because I was working through until nine and I was hoping nobody would tell me the score [laughs]. It&apos;s not so good if you know the score.  RF: Have you ever spoken to any other presidents or anything about teams and results?  GB: Oh, all the time, a lot of them are big supporters. The Spanish prime minister, [Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Rodriguez] Zapatero is a big supporter of Spanish football, and the Portuguese PM Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates is a big supporter of Brazil. The one country you would think [football] would have taken o\ufb00 more in is America, at the highest level. All the new countries in eastern Europe, a lot of their status comes from the international football teams and all the prime ministers and presidents are determined that the football team succeeds. So it&apos;s quite a big thing. And then in Africa, football&apos;s really growing, there are some great players coming over.  RF: Yeah, de\ufb01nitely, I didn&apos;t realise until I actually went to Uganda and Nigeria how much they know. You think it&apos;s so far away and their technology&apos;s probably not as developed as ours, so do they watch the games? But they just love it.  GB: We went to Shanghai, and Shanghai&apos;s twinned with Liverpool, so we took Liverpool and Everton strips to give to the kids that we were meeting in this school. Then we arrived and the \ufb01 rst thing we&apos;re told is that they&apos;re all Manchester United and Arsenal supporters. The second thing was , because it was being \ufb01lmed for television, instead of the 12-year- olds we thought it was, they&apos;d put on 16-year- olds so they couldn&apos;t \ufb01 t the strips anyway! [Laughs] But that&apos;s how big it is in China.  RF: It&apos;s massive. The Asian market is the biggest. We go there on tours most years; we went this summer just gone, and it&apos;s just ridiculous, it&apos;s crazy. At United, because a lot of our kit gets left over, I&apos;ve managed to get the kit manager to send it out to Uganda or wherever we have a soccer school because they appreciate it a lot more than most. Do you think as sportsmen we have got a bit of a responsibility to the young children to be role models? GB: I think I&apos;d put it the other way round: If you decide that you&apos;re going to help young people, it can make an enormous di\ufb00erence . I mean some footballers don&apos;t, but you do, and many others do. And I think it makes a big di\ufb00 erence when you can get people who are role models like you to say things that are important \u2013 people who wouldn&apos;t listen to me might listen to you. I remember when I was young we looked up to the footballers in the local team; it&apos;s even more so now because we never had football on television the way we do now when I was young. And now, when you&apos;ve got a worldwide audience, what you do can actually make a difference to loads of young people and how they see themselves. Particularly kids that are in care, or kids that are on their own, just to make them feel that they&apos;ve got some talent and they can actually do something with it is a really important part of them having con\ufb01dence in themselves  RF: Yeah, de\ufb01nitely. I always look back at when I was at school, and Paul Elliott, who used to play for Chelsea, came in. He talked about certain issues, and you hang on their every word . That&apos;s what I look back on. You&apos;d get your school teacher talking to you about the same subject and after a couple of seconds you&apos;d be thinking about something else.  GB: And certainly, what you&apos;ve done about racism; racism in sport is completely unacceptable and it is something that&apos;s tarnished the reputation of football in many places. The Emile Heskey thing is the most recent worst example. Croatia should have been forced to have their games behind closed doors or something. They didn&apos;t take tough enough discipline with them.  RF: I said that all along, especially after the Spain incident, when they \ufb01ned them about \u00a335,000. Money isn&apos;t going to really a\ufb00ect anybody, especially the fans. Do you think that the current \ufb01nancial state of the world will have any bearing on the 2012 Olympics?  GB: No, we&apos;re getting on with the construction of the Olympics and we&apos;re spending the money now when there&apos;s less of a demand for construction workers, so that perhaps helps us get on with the job. But it&apos;s not a good thing to have a downturn and we don&apos;t want that so we&apos;re taking measures. We&apos;re building schools in the next year, so about 100,000 people will be working on building schools.  RF: All over England?  GB: Yes, we&apos;ve decided to advance a school building programme, road building, railways, hospitals, so in a period where there&apos;s fewer houses being built you can actually get some of your construction projects moved forward. I was opening a school in Swindon on Thursday; there&apos;s a lot of schools being opened at the moment and a lot of them have great sports facilities. I don&apos;t know what your sports facilities were like when you were at school?  RF: We used to have to walk to the place where the sports facilities were and they weren&apos;t the best. Do you agree there should be more sport training in schools?  GB: I want \ufb01ve hours a week. It&apos;s only two hours at the moment. We&apos;ve got 90% doing two hours. I think about 10 years ago it was only 25%, so it&apos;s gone up . And the range of sports is a lot wider so you&apos;ve got all sorts of things now, not just football and rugby and so on. So we want to get that up to \ufb01 ve hours. Roughly speaking, everybody would be doing an hour a day of sport and that would be really good. It makes for more \ufb01 tness, it makes you more healthy, it makes for more teamwork, it makes more potential in sports being realised, and it has an e\ufb00 ect on the academic studies as well. The Olympics were a huge boost, I don&apos;t know if you met Rebecca Adlington.  RF: Yeah, the swimmer \u2026  GB: She&apos;s done brilliantly, she&apos;s a great role model for girls doing swimming. And Chris Hoy&apos;s a great guy, the cyclist .  RF: Yeah, it&apos;s great, de\ufb01nitely a massive inspiration, plus with 2012 being here, it&apos;s something for everyone to work towards. If people think, &quot;Maybe I&apos;ve got a 50% chance to be an Olympian...&quot; they&apos;ll work harder.  GB: And we won a medal in Beijing in gymnastics, which was amazing because we&apos;re starting to get into areas that nobody thought we&apos;d do well in before. The TeamGB cycling coach, Dave Brailsford, has done a great job.

It&apos;s hard for people to understand that sometimes, especially people involved that are playing GB: Well, in any team, it&apos;s not just the individual player, it&apos;s how they work together.  RF: Yeah, de\ufb01nitely. That&apos;s another thing that&apos;s coming big into football, the psychology ...  GB: Mind games [laughs]. Like Rafael Ben\u00edtez.  RF: Yeah, he just fell into the hole, I think. One last question: which sportsman do you think would make a good politician?  GB: Well, Alex Ferguson would be a good politician. He would do well. Managers are good leaders because they&apos;ve got to bring people together. You&apos;ve got to have a plan. They&apos;re leading a team, and in politics I think that&apos;s what it&apos;s about. You&apos;ve got people not showing their true potential and somehow you&apos;ve got to motivate them to do so. Gordon Banks told me this great story about Alf Ramsey, when he was England manager. Ramsey would shake hands with the players when they left the Saturday after the match; but he always wanted to keep players on their toes so he never wanted to promise them they&apos;d be in the team the next time. And Gordon Banks told me he made the mistake of saying to Sir Alf as he was leaving after one match, he said, &quot;See you next time,&quot; and Alf Ramsey said, &quot;Will you?&quot; [Laughs]  RF: That puts you back in your place, that.

Buy a flat \u2013 and we&apos;ll give you a job to go with it. The developers, who have so far hired eight buyers, say the deal demonstrates their sense of social responsibility. Others think it says as much about the fear gripping the market as house prices in China tumble after soaring growth. Other Shanghai companies are slashing as much as 30% from the price of flats. British estate agents might wonder what the fuss is about. China&apos;s urban house prices fell 0.4% in December; the first year-on-year decline since records were first published in 2005, but hardly disastrous in the global context. Yet the headline rate disguises huge disparities within the market; while some cities in the centre and west of China are still enjoying growth, the &quot;first-tier&quot; cities such as Shanghai and Beijing have already been hit. Official estimates this week suggest that 20 million migrant workers have returned to the Chinese countryside from the big cities because of the economic downturn, reducing the demand for accommodation. The worst market of all is the export-led Pearl river delta; last month Shenzhen prices saw a drop of almost 18% year-on-year \u2013 and experts warn that things are going to get much worse.  &apos;Sellers were not willing to come to the realisation that the market was changing, so they haven&apos;t dropped their prices significantly yet \u2013 but that&apos;s what we are starting to see in &apos;09 and I think we will see further drops. &quot;I&apos;m sure it&apos;s going to be a difficult time for China over the next year, and therefore for the property market&apos; James MacDonald  The effects are beginning to be felt far beyond the glossy offices of developers: on empty building sites, in quiet factories, and in distant rural villages where families depend on the wages of migrant labourers. Tens of millions work in construction. Fewer house sales mean less demand for builders, materials, appliances and furniture \u2013 and a smaller chance of the government hitting its 8% growth target this year. According to Macquarie Securities, commercial, industrial and residential construction rose by more than 32% in 2007 and another 9% between January and September last year. But in October it fell by more than 16%. This year it will shrink another 30%, the firm predicted. Ma Jun, Deutsche Bank&apos;s chief economist for China, has warned that falling property prices would contribute to the worst deflation in a decade. Experts believe steep falls are inevitable because transaction volumes have plummeted, with a year-on-year drop in sales of about 20% for the first 11 months of last year. A report from the UK property consultancy DTZ Holdings this week said that unsold residential property in nine of China&apos;s biggest cities now totalled 38m square metres. James MacDonald, the Shanghai-based senior manager of China research for Savills, said: &quot;Sellers were not willing to come to the realisation that the market was changing, so they haven&apos;t dropped their prices significantly yet \u2013 but that&apos;s what we are starting to see in &apos;09 and I think we will see further drops. &quot;I&apos;m sure it&apos;s going to be a difficult time for China over the next year, and therefore for the property market.&quot; It is in stark contrast to the halcyon days of 2007, when prices went through the roof \u2013 rising by as much as 60% in fashionable areas of central Shanghai. Record growth and export values and chunky salary increases fuelled the market, and rising prices themselves drew more buyers in. Some saw property as a sure-fire way of making money, while others wanted to buy a home while they could still afford one. The government tried to rein back the market but the impact of its policies may have coincided with the start of the downturn, creating a bumpier landing than anticipated. More recently it has introduced measures to help purchasers, cutting property taxes and loosening mortgage policies for second-home buyers. Zhang Haiqing, of the real estate research centre at Shanghai Centaline Property Consultants, said it would take time to feel their effects, adding: &quot;In the short term, the downturn will last and the prices will even keep dropping. In the middle of this year, we believe the market will become better again.&quot; Savill&apos;s MacDonald said he would &quot;probably&quot; predict an upturn late this year or in early 2010, depending on the state of the global economy. But no one expects a return to the frenzy of 2007. Developers draw faint hope from the likes of 40-year-old Li, a banker who splashed out on a second flat in Shanghai last month, in part because of the new incentives. &quot;I thought about buying in August or September but I felt the price was higher than it should be, so I waited for a few months till it dropped another 10%. Then I figured it was the right time to buy,&quot; he said. &quot;In Shenzhen, more people bought as an investment, but here people buy places to live in. In the long term I believe that Shanghai prices will go up again.&quot; Additional research by Chen Shi.", "tags": ["Credit crunch", "World news", "Global recession", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-03T16:09:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/04/kingfisher-china-economy", "sentences": ["It was a much-hyped operation that started with a single Shanghai store in 1999 and expanded rapidly."], "title": "Chinese property slump hits B&Q after DIY group Kingfisher's attempt to cash in on boom", "article": "The Chinese property downturn has hit UK DIY group Kingfisher, which exported its B&amp;Q brand to China to cash in on the booming economy.

A single event, something I said or did, was being talked about by everyone around me. People knew details about me they could not have known. I was convinced I could hear thoughts, and that friends were speaking without moving their lips. At the time I could not see this was abnormal; now, when I try to explain it, I say: &quot;You know what a dream or nightmare is like? Imagine that lasting for months.&quot; This psychosis crept up on me when I was 23, but I had had mental health problems since I was 17. I was studying for my Baccalaureate in France when one morning I woke up, started crying and couldn&apos;t stop. I spent a month in hospital and after other periods of illness I was eventually diagnosed with manic depression and put on medication.  Despite this I was well enough to spend my gap year teaching in India and then take a degree in Mandarin at the School of Oriental and African studies in London. After graduating it seemed a natural step to take up a teaching post in China. My first year in Shanghai was wonderful. I settled in quickly, found a flat, and met new friends. We were out socialising almost every night and on my days off, I took kung fu classes, or explored the city on my bike. The children in my school were delightful and I loved teaching. But by the winter of 2004 I began to feel unnaturally elated. I was too frightened to see a local doctor because suffering from a mental illness is against the Chinese work visa requirements. I became confused about what to take to balance out this elation and in the end I just stopped taking my drugs. That was when the delusions started; the secret police were after me and were spying on my flat. I became convinced I was a martial arts expert and was being given advice by the white cat on a washing-up liquid bottle. I believed my family had once ruled the world and had all been murdered. Instead of working I was staring out of the window for hours. I have no idea what my boss thought of my erratic behaviour - but the day after I walked into her office and accused a taxi driver of being a cannibal, she fired me. Soon I was homeless too. For some reason I decided to travel to Changsha in central China by train and fly back. This used up all the available credit on my card and when my flow of money ran out I stopped paying my rent. My landlord turned up at the apartment with his mother and daughter, shouted at me, and kicked me out on to the streets. My possessions were stolen after I left a bundle on my front step and went to get a glass of water. Somehow I managed to keep hold of my suitcase on wheels and backpack. I saved my CDs, some clothes and my passport. It was November and freezing. I walked around the city from one end to the other for days. I was terrified and couldn&apos;t eat properly because I thought the meat on sale was human flesh. It could have been as long as two weeks later when I finally ended up shoeless on the steps of my old block of flats. The local women&apos;s association found me and gave me some bread. Then the police picked me up. They managed to get the address of an old university friend from me and took me to his flat. He called the British Consulate and they escorted me to the Shanghai No.1 Psychiatric Hospital. One interview with the doctor and I was in. It wasn&apos;t bad after the streets - a private bathroom, a TV (which I unplugged so that it couldn&apos;t watch me), and wooden floors. The nurses restrained me to force medicine down my throat and occasionally tied me to the bed, but they were kind too. The auxiliary nurse who slept next to me humoured me by calling me Mao Yilan (I thought I was Mao&apos;s great-granddaughter). Another gave me cigarettes. Back in Europe my parents were frantic with worry. My father, who lives in Norway, flew out to try to take me home, but the hospital refused to release me. He says that the doctors were very gentle, but would not give me the medicines used in Europe because they believed they were too strong. One chilling morning I was taken from my private room and into another building. I was taken into a room, where electrodes were attached to my head and when the woman turned the dial the pain was excruciating.  I don&apos;t know if this was electroshock therapy or I imagined the pain - it doesn&apos;t sound like accounts I have heard since about the practice, but I washed my hair every morning after that so it would be wet, and I was never taken back. A medical evacuation doctor eventually came to accompany me back to Paris, where my mother lives, and I thought I was free.  Instead I was taken to a French clinic. I had been here before in 2001 and it made the Chinese hospital look like a holiday camp.  I was surrounded by people who had been accused of crimes such as arson and rape. We weren&apos;t allowed in our rooms during the day and I spent my time trying to avoid other people. But it was when I saw my mother on the third day in the clinic that I was struck by the realisation of what had really happened to me. In my psychotic state I had been sure she had been murdered. Yet here she was, chatting away about taking her dog to the vet.  The thought was the beginning of the path to recovery, but it was also incredibly painful. I felt as if my brain was being twisted and wrenched as the medicines kicked in. It was hard to adjust to the idea that all the things I believed had happened to me were in my imagination. After this there was just the long trudge back to reality through four months of paralysing depression. Yet five years later, I know I am very lucky. Not just to have survived my time on the streets, but to be born at a time when my illness can be treated. I am finally taking medicine that suits me - an upper (anti-depressant), a downer (anti-psychotic) and a mood stabiliser (lithium) - and am more attuned to my symptoms. If I start to feel they are not working, I will go straight to a doctor. Most importantly, I know I will never be that ill again. It is not all plain sailing and I still have days when I am elated and others when I am subdued. But I have learned it is all about riding out the waves, holding on and realising that you are not going to get thrown out of the boat. After a few directionless years I have become a self-employed translator in Belgium, where I have a lovely flat and am very happy. My family is supportive, and I am excited to wake up in the mornings. The struggles I face today are with people&apos;s attitudes to my past. The reactions from employers, men I date, and (former) friends make me feel as though I have a skeleton to hide. Yet as far as I am concerned there is no difference between psychosis and other illnesses, and I do not see why I should be made to feel ashamed. I feel I have a duty to explain what it is like to be psychotic - to be that person muttering at you in the street. But what I really want to explain is that you can come out the other side.", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Mental health", "Life and style", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-06T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/feb/06/society-email-briefing", "sentences": ["Welcome to the morning news alert from SocietyGuardian.co.uk ********** Today&apos;s top story - Health watchdog reports sharp increase in childhood measles Outbreaks among children who aren&apos;t vaccinated blamed on academic paper linking MMR jab to autism ************ MORE NEWS \u2022 Weather: Services at breaking point as freeze continues Councils run low on salt to treat roads, while Met Office warns of more snow on way \u2022 Health: Lack of sunshine found to trigger MS Research finds people with gene variant who lack vitamin D can develop condition \u2022 NHS: No 10 adviser &apos;ignored concerns of statisticians over knife crime figures&apos; &apos;Premature, irregular and selective&apos; publication of figures went ahead despite concerns by NHS and Home Office statisticians, MPs told \u2022 Voluntary sector: Head of Barrow Cadbury Trust quits Sukhvinder Kaur-Stubbs leaves social justice group &apos;to explore new opportunities&apos; \u2022 Health: A&amp;E tsar to head diabetes charity Prof Sir George Alberti to be next chairman \u2022 International development: Charles declares Mumbai shanty town model for the world Dharavi slum contains attributes for environmentally and socially sustainable settlement, prince says *********** FEATURES AND COMMENT \u2022 Recession: Tales from the frontline Guardian writers meet some of those hardest hit by the recession \u2022 Mental health: My nightmare in Shanghai First person: A year after she moved to China to take up a teaching post, a mental breakdown left Lucy Hill penniless and barefoot on the streets \u2022 Public services policy: Bursting bubbles Public services in a recession - does something have to give?"], "title": "SocietyGuardian.co.uk email briefing 06 February 2009", "article": "Welcome to the morning news alert from SocietyGuardian.co.uk ********** Today&apos;s top story - Health watchdog reports sharp increase in childhood measles Outbreaks among children who aren&apos;t vaccinated blamed on academic paper linking MMR jab to autism ************ MORE NEWS \u2022 Weather: Services at breaking point as freeze continues Councils run low on salt to treat roads, while Met Office warns of more snow on way \u2022 Health: Lack of sunshine found to trigger MS Research finds people with gene variant who lack vitamin D can develop condition \u2022 NHS: No 10 adviser &apos;ignored concerns of statisticians over knife crime figures&apos; &apos;Premature, irregular and selective&apos; publication of figures went ahead despite concerns by NHS and Home Office statisticians, MPs told \u2022 Voluntary sector: Head of Barrow Cadbury Trust quits Sukhvinder Kaur-Stubbs leaves social justice group &apos;to explore new opportunities&apos; \u2022 Health: A&amp;E tsar to head diabetes charity Prof Sir George Alberti to be next chairman \u2022 International development: Charles declares Mumbai shanty town model for the world Dharavi slum contains attributes for environmentally and socially sustainable settlement, prince says *********** FEATURES AND COMMENT \u2022 Recession: Tales from the frontline Guardian writers meet some of those hardest hit by the recession \u2022 Mental health: My nightmare in Shanghai First person: A year after she moved to China to take up a teaching post, a mental breakdown left Lucy Hill penniless and barefoot on the streets \u2022 Public services policy: Bursting bubbles Public services in a recession - does something have to give?", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2009-02-06T10:54:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/06/judaism-race", "sentences": ["Jewish refugees in Shanghai, though never comfortable, at least remained alive under Japanese protection.", "This was good for the Jews of Shanghai."], "title": "Ian Buruma: The 'Jewish conspiracy' in Asia", "article": "A Chinese bestseller entitled The Currency War describes how Jews are planning to rule the world by manipulating the international financial system. The book is reportedly read in the highest government circles. If so, this does not bode well for the international financial system, which relies on well-informed Chinese to help it recover from the current crisis.  Such conspiracy theories are not rare in Asia. Japanese readers have shown a healthy appetite over the years for books such as To Watch Jews Is To See the World Clearly, The Next Ten Years: How to Get an Inside View of the Jewish Protocols, and I&apos;d Like to Apologise To the Japanese \u2013 A Jewish Elder&apos;s Confession (written by a Japanese author, of course, under the made-up name of Mordecai Mose). All these books are variations of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Russian forgery first published in 1903, which Japanese came across after defeating the Czar&apos;s army in 1905.  The Chinese picked up many modern western ideas from the Japanese. Perhaps this is how Jewish conspiracy theories were passed on as well. But Southeast Asians are not immune to this kind of nonsense either. The former prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Bin Mohammed, has said that &quot;the Jews rule the world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them.&quot; And a recent article in a leading Filipino business magazine explained how Jews had always controlled the countries they lived in, including the United States today.  In the case of Mahathir, a twisted kind of Muslim solidarity is probably at work. But, unlike European or Russian antisemitism, the Asian variety has no religious roots. No Chinese or Japanese has blamed Jews for killing their holy men or believed that their children&apos;s blood ended up in Passover matzos. In fact, few Chinese, Japanese, Malaysians, or Filipinos have ever seen a Jew, unless they have spent time abroad.  So what explains the remarkable appeal of Jewish conspiracy theories in Asia? The answer must be partly political. Conspiracy theories thrive in relatively closed societies, where free access to news is limited and freedom of enquiry curtailed. Japan is no longer such a closed society, yet even people with a short history of democracy are prone to believe that they are victims of unseen forces. Precisely because Jews are relatively unknown, therefore mysterious, and in some way associated with the west, they become an obvious fixture of anti-western paranoia.  Such paranoia is widespread in Asia, where almost every country was at the mercy of western powers for several hundred years. Japan was never formally colonised, but it, too, felt the west&apos;s dominance, at least since the 1850s, when American ships laden with heavy guns forced the country to open its borders on western terms.  The common conflation of the US with Jews goes back to the late 19th century, when European reactionaries loathed America for being a rootless society based only on financial greed. This perfectly matched the stereotype of the &quot;rootless cosmopolitan&quot; Jewish moneygrubber. Hence the idea that Jews run America.  One of the great ironies of colonial history is the way in which colonised people adopted some of the very prejudices that justified colonial rule. Antisemitism arrived with a whole package of European race theories that have persisted in Asia long after they fell out of fashion in the west.  In some ways, Chinese minorities in Southeast Asia have shared some of the hostility suffered by Jews in the west. Excluded from many occupations, they, too, survived by clannishness and trade. They, too, have been persecuted for not being &quot;sons of the soil&quot;. And they, too, are thought to have superhuman powers when it comes to making money. So when things go wrong, the Chinese are blamed, not just for being greedy capitalists, but also, again like the Jews, for being communists, since both capitalism and communism are associated with rootlessness and cosmopolitanism.  As well as being feared, the Chinese are admired for being cleverer than everybody else. The same mixture of fear and awe is often evident in people&apos;s views of the US, and, indeed, of the Jews.  Japanese antisemitism is a particularly interesting case. Japan was able to defeat Russia in 1905 only after a Jewish banker in New York, Jacob Schiff, helped Japan by floating bonds. So The Protocols of the Elders of Zion confirmed what the Japanese already suspected: Jews really did pull the strings of global finance. But, instead of wishing to attack them, the Japanese, being a practical people, decided that they would be better off cultivating those clever, powerful Jews as friends.  As a result, during the second world war, even as the Germans were asking their Japanese allies to round up Jews and hand them over, dinners were held in Japanese-occupied Manchuria to celebrate Japanese-Jewish friendship. Jewish refugees in Shanghai, though never comfortable, at least remained alive under Japanese protection. This was good for the Jews of Shanghai. But the very ideas that helped them to survive continue to muddle the thinking of people who really ought to know better by now.

In Dublin, one such &quot;headquarters&quot; turned out to be merely the premises of the company&apos;s accountants. Other multi-nationals had just a handful of staff at work, no nameplates outside, or occupied the premises only sporadically. WPP, one of the world&apos;s biggest advertising companies, is one of those which says it is now controlled from Dublin. When we went to its headquarters, in a Georgian town house, it appeared to be deserted. We were told only eight staff worked in the headquarters and they were all &quot;out&quot;. WPP says it has held board meetings in Dublin and recruitment for its office there was &quot;ongoing&quot;. Since the move to Ireland, WPP appears to have kept intact its 300-strong division - based in London, New York, Hong Kong, and Shanghai - which was previously said to &quot;centrally co-ordinate&quot; the company&apos;s activities. The media company UBM also says it has moved to Ireland. The firm only occupies a single floor of a townhouse in Dublin&apos;s Merrion Square, where no more than five or six staff work.  In the six months since its move, UBM says it has held three board meetings in Dublin and three in other parts of the world. At UBM&apos;s large Thames-side office block in London, the British staff continue to fill up four floors. Tarsus, a business media group, say its new Irish headquarters is in a redeveloped Dublin dock by the river Liffey. But when we went there, it appeared to be merely the premises of their tax advisers, PWC. Henderson Global Investors has only three staff at its Dublin suite of off-the-shelf rental offices, compared with 550 who continue to work at its main London office. A receptionist in Ireland said: &quot;They are not here a lot of the time.&quot; Charter engineers has no nameplate on its temporary offices, and the company secretary - one of only five staff flies in on Monday and home again on Friday, staff there say. In order to escape the British tax net, companies who claim they have shifted to Ireland are required to show that their firm is not &quot;centrally managed and controlled&quot; in the UK. This does not seem to be regarded as an onerous hurdle to overcome, particularly as the companies can continue to be listed on the London Stock Exchange while claiming foreign status. Tax advisers tell companies that the legal requirements may be satisfied merely by flying to Dublin airport to hold board meetings. They advise companies also to keep some staff in Ireland, designated as helping the board reach strategic decisions or managing its tax affairs. Migrating companies do not even need to submit to Irish company law. Firms such as WPP have technically re-incorporated themselves as offshore entities in Jersey, in the Channel islands, as part of their move. Tax experts say this use of a tax haven saves the cost of stamp duty. Dublin&apos;s heavily-advertised 12.5% low rate of corporation tax is not the real reason for company flight, taxation experts say. Subsidiaries which remain in the UK in any case continue to be taxed in Britain. What is crucial, especially for firms which hold &quot;intellectual property&quot; such as patents or brands offshore, is that they can take advantage of Ireland&apos;s lack of rules on taxing the profits of multinationals&apos; offshore operations. The Guardian&apos;s findings have prompted campaigners and politicians to call on HM Revenue &amp; Customs to investigate whether the companies are engaged in a charade. The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Lord Oakeshott, said: &quot;Reputable British-based companies don&apos;t twist and turn to dodge tax, or slink off across the Irish Sea to Liechtenstein on the Liffey. &apos;Little people&apos; in Britain pay far more tax because our big companies squirm through tax loopholes.&quot;  Dave Hartnett, HMRC&apos;s chief tax official, said: &quot;Moving a company&apos;s residence is not as easy as some believe. HMRC examines carefully situations in which companies claim to have changed their residence. We will challenge vigorously where the facts don&apos;t support a change of residence.&quot; UBM, Charter and Tarsus would not comment on the Guardian&apos;s findings. Henderson&apos;s chief financial officer, Toby Hiscock, said: &quot;In redomiciling to the Republic of Ireland, we are confident that we are acting within the relevant laws and rules of tax residence. Currently, most of our business is generated in the UK, where we continue to make substantial contributions to the UK Exchequer.&quot;", "tags": ["Business"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-10T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/11/eco-soundings-environment", "sentences": ["Back to the &apos;burbs When Gordon Brown went to Shanghai last year, he spoke passionately about how China and Britain were leading the world in building eco cities and how the two countries were setting up academic and financial partnerships to further them.", "Ambitious plans to build Dong Tang, a carless, sustainable city of 400,000 people outside Shanghai, appear to be collapsing, with the likelihood that it becomes just another conventional suburb."], "title": "Eco Soundings: February 11 2009", "article": "Pool of tears Is Hartlepool becoming the waste capital of Britain?

Back to the &apos;burbs When Gordon Brown went to Shanghai last year, he spoke passionately about how China and Britain were leading the world in building eco cities and how the two countries were setting up academic and financial partnerships to further them. Alas, Britain&apos;s ambitious programme has wilted to practically nothing, and now it seems China is rowing back fast. Ambitious plans to build Dong Tang, a carless, sustainable city of 400,000 people outside Shanghai, appear to be collapsing, with the likelihood that it becomes just another conventional suburb. Gone with the wand Gordon, have your ministers no shame? Last September, you faithfully promised the nation that 6m homes - nearly a quarter of Britain - would be insulated via government programmes by 2011, and tomorrow climate change minister Ed Miliband and Hazel Blears, his opposite number at housing, will jointly set out exactly how they intend to do this. Eco Soundings predicts a chill wind whistling down the chimneys of the land when people work out that only around half the promised number of homes will actually be insulated. It seems that civil servants have cleverly redefined what qualifies as insulation. No longer does it mean expensive stuff being bunged into lofts, pumped into cavity walls or fitted to the outside of homes; from now on it can include anything from double glazing put in council houses to a draught excluder stuck around a pensioner&apos;s letter box. Still, in the middle of the coldest spell we have known for 20 years, this redefinition does allow government to say that the magic number of 6m households &quot;insulated&quot; will be fulfilled.  Daddy&apos;s boys Some children seem destined to follow in father&apos;s footsteps. Old hands may remember that Tony Benn, when he was energy minister, was passionate about a giant barrage on the river Severn in the late 1970s, but never quite managed to push it through. Now his son, environment secretary Hilary, will probably have to decide whether or not it is built. Meanwhile, if Boris Johnson, London&apos;s mayor, is to build a giant airport in the middle of the Thames estuary, he will have to negotiate tough EU wildlife laws established largely by his dad, Stanley, when he was an EU bureaucrat in the late 1970s. Stanley, a keen environmentalist, conceived Europe&apos;s habitats directive, which many believe will make it nigh on impossible for Boris to build his airport, seeing as it will effectively be in the middle of a giant bird reserve. Is it a bird? Still with the birds, one RSPB man who took part in the society&apos;s great birdwatch last week reported 27 birds, ranging from blackbirds to magpies and thrushes. Out of interest, he then decided to count planes.

No wonder then that Jeanette Kwakye grew up idolising the American sprinter and hurdler Gail Devers because, she says, there were no British role models for her. Kwakye was still in nappies when athletes such as Kathy Cook and Bev Kinch were running, &quot;and you can&apos;t exactly look them up on YouTube for inspiration&quot;, she says. Instead, the 25-year-old from east London has had to do her own ground-breaking. And boy has she done that. Last year \u2013 her first as a full-time athlete \u2013 she won her first major medal, silver at the World Indoor Championships over 60m, and finished sixth in the 100metres final in Beijing with a personal best of 11.14sec. \u00a0 The achievements \u2013 two goals she had set herself this time last year \u2013 have swelled not only her own confidence, but the confidence of the next generation following fast on her heels. Kwakye is spearheading that talent, with the likes of Asha Philip, Ashlee Nelson, Shaunna Thompson and Jodie Williams \u2013 all still in their teens \u2013 smashing British records that have stood for decades. Asked whom they look to for inspiration, they say Kwakye. She is happy to take on the mantle. &quot;The first thing I did after my Olympic final was to send a message out to all of them, Ashlee, Asha, Joey Duck, all the younger girls. I said, &apos;Right I&apos;ve done it now, you can do it, too.&apos; Literally I got in from my final and I said, &apos;Now you go out and do it, let&apos;s just keep it at this level.&apos;&quot; Of course we have heard of promising young talent before and been let down \u2013 former 100m world junior champion Mark Lewis-Francis is the classic example \u2013 but in Kwakye, these girls have a mentor, &quot;a sensei&quot; according to Nelson, to help them bridge that gap. Nelson, younger sister to sprinter Alex Nelson, won silver in last year&apos;s 100m junior world championships and has already been warned by Kwakye about the pitfalls of making that transition. &quot;Jeanette said when she was our age, she was coming fifth and sixth at English schools [championships] and not running anywhere near the times we&apos;re running, but she said she looks back and the girls who used to win everything are now nowhere to be seen. &quot;It made me think, if I&apos;m not careful I will be one of them girls who always came first in the juniors but never made it in the seniors. It&apos;s all right going, &apos;I was world junior champion&apos;, but who&apos;s going to remember that in a few years&apos; time?&quot; Nelson was in Beijing as a reserve for the British relay team and was inspired that &quot;people you actually know&quot; can achieve so much on a world stage. &quot;We were like, &apos;Oh God, Jeanette just came sixth in the Olympics!&apos; Except I kept calling her Estelle [the Grammy award-winning singer] because she looks like her and they&apos;re best mates. She kept looking at me like a crazy person! &quot;I also spent a lot of time with Christine Ohuruogu in Beijing. You start to realise that people like Christine and Jeanette are just normal, but they&apos;re winning things. I was sitting in the dinner hall with Christine the day before her race \u2013 she&apos;d be telling me what to eat because I always eat the wrong foods \u2013 and then she&apos;s winning a gold medal the next day. It&apos;s really surreal. But, like Jeanette says, if you work hard anyone can be the best.&quot; Mention the Olympics to Kwakye and she rolls her eyes theatrically. &quot;Oh, man. The Olympics,&quot; she says. &quot;I woke up the morning of the semi-final and I said to my coach: &apos;I don&apos;t know if I can do it, my legs are killing me.&apos; Literally my legs felt like rocks. The one piece of advice he gave me, I&apos;ll never forget, he said, &apos;Don&apos;t worry because everyone else is feeling the same. It just depends on how much you want it compared to everyone else.&apos; &quot;I remember getting such a blistering start I shocked myself, I thought, &apos;Oh my God, I&apos;m in front!&apos; I got to 60 I was like huhuhuhuhuh! Then I made it \u2013 the only European \u2013 and there were some European girls there who were fierce, you know. It was good to know that I took their scalps. To line up in the final was just a joy, the noise, the crowd, I thought, &apos;Wow this is the Olympic final, this is what it is and I&apos;m here.&apos;&quot; Kwakye finished in sixth place, ahead of the American Torri Edwards and Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie of the \u00adBahamas. &quot;Little old me,&quot; she marvels. This year Kwakye wants more. The girl who terrorised the boys at school playing kiss chase, the fastest kid in the playground \u2013 &quot;if Jeanette was on your tail you knew you had to shift&quot; she cackles \u2013 has had a taste of being one of the fastest women in the world and she likes it. &quot;I never had the British role models so I was always looking on a worldwide level \u2013 at Gail Devers, at Gwen Torrence, at Merlene Ottey, the greats. I&apos;ve put myself in that position now of being the [British] role model. I don&apos;t mind that at all. This year is all about going one better than last\u00a0year.&quot; Veronica Campbell, the Olympic 200m champion, says: &quot;Jeanette has come a long way in a short time and her world indoor medal stamped her as one to watch. I have raced against her in Shanghai and watched her in Beijing and as she continues to gain experience at this level, it can only be good for British sprinting heading into London 2012. She is a very good talent.&apos;&apos; Perhaps her success can also be a victory for the discipline. Women sprinters are so often eclipsed by their male colleagues in the media \u2013 typified when Kwakye won silver at the world indoors last year but was hardly mentioned in the newspapers as Dwain Chambers&apos; silver medal stole the headlines. &quot;You know a lot of people wait for two things: the fastest man in the world and the heavyweight champion of the world,&quot; Kwakye says. &quot;Sometimes women produce better performances than men, but the men always seem to be at the forefront, they&apos;ll always get more prize money, more appearances, more \u00adrecognition.&quot; Kwakye&apos;s view is not old and embittered. Even the teenagers concur, says 16\u2011year\u2011old Shaunna Thompson. &quot;If you ask someone who won the 100m final they&apos;ll tell you Usain Bolt. But ask them who won the women&apos;s, they wouldn&apos;t know. They&apos;d be like, &apos;Who&apos;s Shelly-Ann Fraser?&apos; It&apos;s my event and even I don&apos;t know sometimes, they&apos;re just not names that people talk about on TV in the same way.&quot; Now, though, Thompson has a new hero. &quot;It&apos;s Jeanette, because she made the final. Beijing was during the school holidays so I stayed up until 5am every night just to watch it. My mum was like, &apos;just watch it in the replay&apos;, but you&apos;ve got to watch it live. When Jeanette made it I was really happy for her, like she was my best friend.&quot; So will Kwakye be expecting a little more credit for her achievements? She grins. &quot;Oh let the guys have it, they love all that bravado! You know how sprinters go on, they think they&apos;re God&apos;s gift \u2013 and you can quote me on that.&quot; If 2009 is as good for Kwakye as 2008, we may just start quoting her a whole lot more. \u00a0", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-15T00:05:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/17/grazia-launches-china-victoria-beckham", "sentences": ["Grazia is available in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and other major Chinese cities, with ads for western firms Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Lanc\u00f4me, Tod&apos;s, Trussardi and Guerlain in its first edition."], "title": "Grazia launches in China - with Victoria Beckham on front cover", "article": "The Grazia phenomenon has hit China, with the glossy fashion magazine launching a fortnightly edition in the country and featuring Victoria Beckham on its first cover.

Stuart Jeffries finds out", "article": "When World Tourist Attractions erected a 60m-high ferris wheel in Birmingham&apos;s Centenary Square in 2003, there was an unexpected bonus. As passengers rose in their gondolas above canals, tower blocks, dual carriageways and derelict factories, they heard a commentary in French. The Birmingham wheel, you see, had previously been installed in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. But, instead of visitors being told that if they looked to the left they could see the Carrefour de Pates (Spaghetti Junction) and, if they looked right, l&apos;Anneau du Taureau (the Bullring), the commentary pointed out Parisian landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame and the Arc de Triomphe. &quot;[It&apos;s] disappointing,&quot; said a council spokesman, &quot;as there are so many great things to say about our city.&quot; This is true: Birmingham is known, thanks to its canals, as the Venice of the North. But even Venice can&apos;t boast gondolas that rise above the ground and fly in circles.  Birmingham, like everywhere else, had to have its wheel. Britain&apos;s second city&apos;s wheel was a temporary phenomenon, like those that went up over the past few years in York, Newcastle and Plymouth, but Manchester and Belfast still have them. Jay Pender, commercial manager of World Tourist Attractions, says business is booming. &quot;We can&apos;t really build them fast enough, but that&apos;s OK by us.&quot; Hasn&apos;t the credit crunch dampened demand for this pastime? &quot;Not at all. We don&apos;t know why there is so much demand, but there is. Three more WTA wheels are opening in Australia this year. Success breeds success,&quot; he says.  Pender&apos;s firm supplies temporary big wheels that can be rolled into town and out again. Its parent company, Great City Attractions, also owns the Great Wheel Corporation, which is responsible for a rash of huge permanent wheels (some more than 200m high) around the globe. &quot;The budget and the sky really are the limit,&quot; he says.  So what is the attraction? &quot;There is something iconic about really big wheels that gives the impression of modern go-ahead cities,&quot; says a Visit Britain spokeswoman. &quot;In places like York, a modern, gleaming big wheel can complement the historic sites and architecture.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s true,&quot; says Pender. &quot;We find that in places like Belfast they have become symbols of resurgence, which is a nice thing to be associated with. For instance, we&apos;re putting a 60m wheel up at the seafront in Weston-super-Mare in May, which is just the thing the place needs after the pier burned down last year. Even though they aren&apos;t designed as permanent structures, people often want them to be permanent because they become so fondly regarded.&quot;  Today, it seems, any city that wants to prove its municipal virility and seal its international status has a permanent, beautifully designed ferris wheel complete with air-conditioned gondolas and an allied shopping mall at ground level. &quot;It&apos;s a shame that this is happening,&quot; says George Ferguson, former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, director of Acanthus Ferguson Mann Architects and a man who has spent many happy half hours aboard the world&apos;s big wheels, &quot;because, for me, part of the magic of ferris wheels was that they were ephemeral&quot;. Like skyscrapers, ferris wheels are becoming fixtures on our cityscapes. The London Eye, conceived as a temporary structure and built at a cost of \u00a375m, has been such a triumph that it seems to have become permanent. Since it opened in March 2000, more than 32 million people have travelled on it - at least 15,000 visitors a day pay up to \u00a315.50 for a ride. Despite this, the wheel (now owned by Merlin Entertainments, which runs 26 Sea Life attractions, five dungeons, four Legoland parks, five theme parks and seven Madame Tussauds) has failed to turn a profit for most of its existence - and its owners won&apos;t say if it&apos;s currently making money. However, inspired by its apparent popularity, bigger ferris wheels are springing up around the world. Like opera houses, like high-spec-designed provincial galleries with little to go in them, like bombastic lumps of sculpture in our public squares, they are must-haves for any city with more ambition than imagination.  &quot;It&apos;s always dubious when cities go &apos;me too&apos;,&quot; says Ferguson. &quot;It&apos;s like having the biggest building in the world. It&apos;s completely infantile. The big wheels are becoming the new little boys&apos; game.&quot;  The soon-to-be world&apos;s biggest ferris wheel is currently rising above Beijing. It will be the seventh to go up in a Chinese city since the millennium. When it opens later this year, the 208m Beijing Great Wheel will allow passengers to see the Great Wall of China in the mountains to the north on sunny days (which is something that even Birmingham&apos;s couldn&apos;t claim). Dubai, global centre of architectural hackdom, opened a wheel last year that is bigger than the London Eye. Even Baghdad has announced plans for a giant wheel larger than the Eye as part of a rebranding exercise (which also includes the creation of a &quot;romantic&quot; island on the river Tigris) aimed at making the Iraqi capital a leisure-friendly city. The Great Wheel Corporation is responsible for the wheels going up in Beijing, Berlin and Orlando as well as the world&apos;s current biggest wheel, in Singapore. Next year, Berlin&apos;s wheel will rise in the Hertzallee near the city zoo, making it the biggest in Europe. Why Berlin? In 2007, Berlin had 7.6 million guests, who booked a total of over 17 million overnight stays - the fourth annual record in a row. The company believes the city will continue to prosper as &quot;the ultimate tourist destination&quot;. Whether this hope is well-founded in recession remains to be seen. One problem, surely, is the existence of the Fernsehturm (TV tower), which has a rotating visitor platform 365m above the city&apos;s Alexanderplatz. From it you can see, according to the promotional bumf, &quot;ganz Berlin auf einen Blick&quot; (all Berlin in one glance).  Soon, then, the London Eye, the cantilevered beauty designed by Marks Barfield architects (who prefer their creation to be known not as a ferris wheel but as an observation wheel) will be only the sixth or seventh tallest wheel in the world as other cities seek to copy its business model. &quot;To my mind the London Eye has never been bettered,&quot; says Ferguson. &quot;The fact that it is a cantilevered rather than a spoked wheel is part of its appeal, as is the fact that you see it in different lights and from different angles wherever you are in central London. It has become a lovable landmark in itself.&quot;  Indeed, the London Eye may well be more a symbol of the city in the new millennium than Norman Foster&apos;s Gherkin or the Houses of Parliament. This is significant: the Eye thereby helps define the British capital not so much as financial hub or home of the mother of parliaments, but, one might think, as a post-industrial fairground. Which, in a sense, it is. Not to be outdone, Belfast has a wheel, billed as the city&apos;s &quot;own version of the London Eye&quot;. The best thing about it (apart, obviously, from the view) is that you can hire a VIP gondola with champagne for \u00a370. It has one drawback, though: it only takes 12 minutes to complete a circuit. That&apos;s no good, as the people who set up a ferris wheel in the Japanese city of Fukuoka realised. The Fukuoka Sky Dream claims that its slow speed (0.6 miles per hour) offers &quot;maximum kissing time&quot;. Good point: much of the charm of the ferris wheel, surely, is to take a slow ride of about 30 minutes towards a destination that is the least interesting thing about the journey, during which time you should be savouring the shifting panorama, mutating light effects and your partner&apos;s lips. The key constraint in what ferris-wheel designers call &quot;flight time&quot; is the dearth of on-board toilet facilities: if the journey takes much more than 45 minutes, even those who have been crossing their legs will do more than whimper. Sceptics will suggest there is surely little else to do once aboard the Fukuoka Sky Dream but snog since if you look out of your window you will see only an ever-changing vista of, erm, Fukuoka which, whatever else it is, is not Rome. That, though, is unfair. There is at least one thing worth seeing in Fukuoka. The city has not one but two wheels parked at a right angle to each other. As a result, you can look at one from the other when you get sore lips from kissing. Looking is the key pleasure offered by the eyes that spin above our cities. &quot;Part of the magic of the ferris wheel is that it&apos;s usually a half-hour trip,&quot; says Ferguson. &quot;Buildings change their appearances as you move and as the light changes when you&apos;re on the Eye. You can&apos;t get that anywhere else in London, even in the National Portrait Gallery restaurant, which has the second-best views of London.&quot; At best the ferris wheel offers a vertical experience akin to the horizontal one Proust described in A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, when his hero travelled on a coach through the French countryside and saw three church spires swap position and change colour as dusk descended. &quot;I&apos;m not somebody who goes round the world visiting every ferris wheel,&quot; says Ferguson, &quot;but I did have a wonderful time in Chicago&apos;s at the Navy Pier. It was a slightly odd experience, though, certainly very different from the London one, because the wheel in Chicago is much smaller than the skyscrapers around it.&quot; Chicago&apos;s biggest building, the Sears Tower, is 442m high (527 if you include the antenna), while the Navy Pier ferris wheel is 46m high. So why would you bother going on a seven-minute ferris-wheel journey in a circle above (but only just) Chicago? One answer is for historical reasons. It was in Chicago in 1893 that the first ferris wheel went up (the current one is a copy). It was built by George Washington Gale Ferris, who designed an 80m wheel to really stick it to the French, who had built the Eiffel Tower four years earlier. That Ferris didn&apos;t succeed in this aim is hardly the point. Ferris unwittingly created something more readily reproducible than Gustave Eiffel&apos;s miracle of air and steel. After 1893, ferris wheels were soon going up all over Europe and America - in Blackpool, Vienna, Earls Court, Ocean City, even Paris. Despite all the hoopla about big wheels as iconic structures in the new millennium, it is surely significant that Shanghai, one of the world&apos;s fastest rising cities and China&apos;s commercial centre, decided to scrap its 2002 plans to build the world&apos;s biggest wheel. The Shanghai Star was to have been constructed on top of a 50m-high entertainment complex on the Huangpu river, near the Bund waterfront. The idea was that the Shanghai Star would open in 2008 and would be one of the projects that would make Shanghai&apos;s 2010 World Expo a triumph. But it never happened. In 2005, new mayor Han Zheng described the wheel as &quot;politically incorrect&quot; and expendable. In this, you might think, he was prescient. A big wheel could become a big white elephant in an unpropitious economic climate. There was, surely, another reason the Shanghai wheel was nixed. There are already lots of skyscrapers from which one can have a good view of the city. London was not like that: it had few tall buildings and few commanding vistas. The London Eye thus offered something new in a city that hitherto hadn&apos;t cared to look at itself. Thus, the London Eye&apos;s success may not be so readily reproducible elsewhere. Ferris wheels, if too much copied, are nonetheless beautiful things. There is a particularly lovely one at Deno&apos;s Wonder Wheel Park on Coney Island that went up in the 1920s and thrillingly features two wheels of gondolas, one inside the other. The Wonder Wheel was built by the Eccentric Ferris Wheel Company and when there was a power cut in July 1977 all riders were brought down safely because forbiddingly butch Americans hand-cranked the thing. There is a replica of the Wonder Wheel in Yokohama but the Japanese one doesn&apos;t of course have views of the New York city skyline or indeed the New Jersey coast. But my all-time favourite human-bearing spinning wheel is the 17th-century Turkish proto-ferris wheel called the &quot;Ups and Downs&quot;. It looks less like a fairground attraction and more like a means of firing troops from their rotating seats over a city wall to break a siege. If only Birmingham had imported that one (ideally with Turkish commentary) rather than the relatively conventional Parisian version, Brummies could have seized Coventry. What is the future for big wheels? Will Beijing remain the biggest wheel in the world for long, or will some strutting pretender quickly eclipse it, possibly giving us 360-degree views over Swindon and the Wiltshire countryside? Is there any technical constraint on the diameter of a ferris wheel, or will our descendants be able to touch the stars from their gondolas? &quot;There are sensible constraints over wheel size, just as there are with wind turbines,&quot; says Ferguson. &quot;But such is human ingenuity that even those constraints could be overcome. &quot;What I hope,&quot; he adds wearily, &quot;is that on a drawing board somewhere, someone is creating something new that will replace ferris wheels, because we&apos;ve surely had enough of them.&quot; What does he have in mind? &quot;I hope it would be something that wasn&apos;t just a two-dimensional experience - because, after all, ferris wheels only use two planes - but a 3D one. &quot; What that will look like we don&apos;t yet know, but it could be fun trying to imagine.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture", "Travel", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-18T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/20/chinese-imperial-treasures-taiwan", "sentences": ["It added that officials would also discuss the possibility of a joint exhibition in Shanghai, in the hope that a Song dynasty painting - Riverside Scene at the Pure Moon Festival - could be shown in its entirety for the first time in decades."], "title": "Chinese treasures to be reunited in Taiwan", "article": "Chinese imperial treasures kept in Beijing and Taipei are to be temporarily reunited after six decades - but only on one side of the Taiwan strait. China&apos;s state media reported this week that 29 Qing dynasty relics would be lent to Taiwan for an exhibition this year, as leaders seek to improve relations. But yesterday officials in Taipei said they had not made a reciprocal offer, despite mainland hopes that antiques carried to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek could return. The National Palace Museum in Taiwan is renowned for its 650,000 treasures, regarded by many as the finest collection of Chinese antiques in the world, many of which were from the Forbidden City, where the emperors resided. They formed part of the assets taken to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the civil war to the communists in 1949.  China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, but relations have improved since Ma Ying-jeou became president of Taiwan last year, paving the way for discussions between Taiwanese and Chinese museum officials. Earlier this week the state-owned China Daily newspaper said Beijing would lend portraits of the 18th-century emperor Yongzheng and his concubines for an exhibition in Taiwan. They are among the 600,000 pieces Chiang left behind at the Forbidden City.  It added that officials would also discuss the possibility of a joint exhibition in Shanghai, in the hope that a Song dynasty painting - Riverside Scene at the Pure Moon Festival - could be shown in its entirety for the first time in decades. Half of it has hung in Taipei since 1949, while the rest remains in Beijing. But while officials reached several agreements, there was no deal on loans to the mainland, Taipei&apos;s museum director Chou Kung-shin told a press conference on her return to Taiwan yesterday. &quot;Senior leaders from both sides will need to talk further about this ... That would be a second phase of our engagement,&quot; she said. Taiwan fears that China may not return any treasures it sends over, a museum publicist told Reuters. Because of the collection&apos;s historical sensitivities, the Taipei museum only lends antiques on a strict guarantee of freedom from borrowers that they will be returned.", "tags": ["China", "China arts 2008", "Heritage", "Art and design", "Culture", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-20T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/21/emipre-of-the-sun-interview", "sentences": ["&quot;We&apos;ve been travelling through all the places in the world where there had been sun worship, finding out about ancient cultures from Shanghai and Mongolia to Mexico."], "title": "Space cadets: Rob Fitzpatrick talks to Empire of the Sun", "article": "Sometimes you meet pop groups and they&apos;re actually so boring you go off their bloody record while you&apos;re talking to them. Other times you meet pop groups and they turn out to be exactly the same as every other pop group you&apos;ve ever met (this is more common than you might think). On rare and special occasions you meet a pop group who make you laugh out loud with the sheer audacity of the whole thing, a group that have decided that too much is nowhere near enough and that if a thing&apos;s worth doing it&apos;s worth over-doing so much that the original thing itself gets buried and something even more ludicrous and wonderful and silly and startling comes swimming to the surface. Today is one of those days. Luke Steele and Nick Littlemore \u2013 for they are Australian duo Empire Of The Sun \u2013 sit across the table from me. They aren&apos;t like most pop groups; for one thing, they haven&apos;t played any gigs yet and aren&apos;t in any hurry to start, though they dream of a &quot;10-hour extravaganza&quot; in a few years&apos; time. For another thing, they have ambition up the wazoo. In an age where cardigans and spectacles are considered quite a racy combination they have decided to look completely, unashamedly ridiculous (and, therefore, wonderful). According to their MySpace page they have 12,887 billion friends \u2013 somehow, this doesn&apos;t seem quite enough. And then there&apos;s the music, which slips a softly stroked, super-70s radio-pop satin bomber jacket over some lithe synth&apos;n&apos;drum-machine rocking shoulders (Nick used to be in a band with Pip Ladyhawke - and it shows). Today Luke is wearing a sort of Chinese hat that appears to have metallic gold branches with tiny mandarins growing on them. His eyes have been enclosed in white rectangles with blue trim, making them look rather like quizzical speech bubbles. He is wearing a long, powder-blue robe (&quot;from Afghanistan&quot;, apparently) and white gloves with two fingers removed. To his left sits Nick who is grinning under a huge, black-feathered head-dress. His robe and gloves are also black and his eyes are kohl&apos;d to the nth degree. &quot;The look is part of the music,&quot; says Luke. &quot;Aurally we&apos;re like King Crimson standing on the shore playing guitar with the sharpness of Prince&apos;s vocal, so that stimulates the ears \u2013 but you can&apos;t see it, that&apos;s where the look comes in.&quot; &quot;The name is so bold that it needs a strong look,&quot; says Nick. &quot;We&apos;ve been travelling through all the places in the world where there had been sun worship, finding out about ancient cultures from Shanghai and Mongolia to Mexico. They are the original empire of the sun.&quot; What have you learned on your travels? Nick: &quot;Oh, a lot. Like, we need to pay more attention to the natural world and lessen our dependence on technology as it&apos;s not making our lives any better. We need to live more simply.&quot; Now, these are fine words and Nick is a very likable sort of bloke, but his call to live more simply is hard to take seriously when he&apos;s sat on the seventh floor of a West End nightclub drinking Irish coffee at three in the afternoon while wearing an $800 hat and sporting a &quot;third eye&quot; (trans: gold triangle) on his forehead. You can&apos;t live simply and do this for a job, can you? Luke: &quot;No you can&apos;t.&quot; Nick: &quot;It isn&apos;t strictly possible. But we still want to put that message out there for our audience. We want to make the world a better place. We want to channel all the wasted tears towards a useful future. Take the darkness and make it light again.&quot; How&apos;s that working out so far? Nick: &quot;What&apos;s important is that we try. People are so driven by money and success, we&apos;re trying something else. Luke: &quot;You&apos;ve got to keep the dream alive, man!&quot; Nick: &quot;If everyone in the whole world only ate fruit for two weeks, that would change a lot of things, wouldn&apos;t it? We all need to start doing things that don&apos;t just follow the beliefs we were brought up with. We need to take chances, make our own art, be imaginative. Look at the shit that&apos;s going on in Israel!&quot; How would you approach that problem? Nick: &quot;I think firstly people need to realise we&apos;re all the same \u2013 we all have blood running through our veins. Greed is contrary to our human existence. Greed is the reason so many civilisations have crumbled. You have to be happy with what you&apos;ve got. Luke: &quot;We need to bring the romance back!&quot; Luke Steele is a fascinating chap. His previous project, the Sleepy Jacksons, touched on melancholy country rock and art-punk. He shed a number of members along the way as other musicians realised how hard he was to keep (or, perhaps, put) up with. In late 2003 I interviewed him in Chicago where he told me he wanted to stay on the road forever, only stopping to make a film with Steven Spielberg (interestingly, it was Spielberg who adapted the JG Ballard novel Empire Of The Sun for the big screen). As soon as he finished the tour he met his wife and got married. He now has a daughter called Sunny Tiger and no great desire to get back out on tour. &quot;Back then I was living the big rock dream,&quot; he says, &quot;travelling America! I capitalised on sin and debauchery. It was sex, drugs and rock&apos;n&apos;roll \u2026&quot; You talked of finding someone. Luke: &quot;Wow! I did, didn&apos;t I? I was so lonely then.&quot; You talked a lot about religion too; is that still as important to you? Luke: &quot;The gospel, the scriptures, the bible \u2013 it&apos;s the book of life. Christ said, &apos;Follow me and you&apos;ll never fail.&apos; Never!&quot; That&apos;s a pretty big promise. Luke: &quot;It is, but people don&apos;t realise that the spirit of the risen Christ is in everyone \u2013 every single person has the holy DNA whether you want it or not. You might as well get used to it!&quot; Nick: &quot;I&apos;m reading a lot about Buddhism right now. Religions are all interesting, it&apos;s good how no one says, &apos;And lo, all these aliens came down and \u2026&apos;&quot; Well, there is one &quot;religion&quot; that says that \u2026 Nick: &quot;Ha! Yes there is.&quot; Luke: &quot;Those guys are really out there.&quot; Do they have the holy DNA? Luke: &quot;Yeeaaahhhhhh!&quot; Nick: &quot;The truth of it all is that we&apos;ve put everything into this. That&apos;s why the artwork and the costumes and the stories are so big \u2013 we&apos;re not holding back. We have surrendered all our egos and all our bullshit to get to this point and we&apos;re honestly trying to make something better to get to something great.&quot; Have you not made it more difficult for yourself with this look? Nick: &quot;Maybe, but it&apos;s great having a project where you can justify buying an $800 headpiece \u2026&quot; It&apos;s almost like you wanted to buy one anyway and thought you might as well form a band and put it through on expenses. Nick: &quot;Ha ha ha! Yes, well, you could look at it like that.&quot; I turn off my tape recorder and Nick immediately takes off his head-dress. &quot;That thing is bloody hot,&quot; he says, his eyes shining with laughter as Luke quietly sucks on his orange juice, his headwear tinkling. \u2022 Empire Of The Sun&apos;s album Walking On A Dream is out now (Virgin)", "tags": ["Empire of the Sun", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-21T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/feb/20/buyingpropertyabroad-alternativeinvestments", "sentences": ["China  Analysts expect prices in Beijing and Shanghai to fall by as much as 25% this year, after a frenzied decade of apartment construction.", "Savills said prices in Shanghai fell 19.5% in the third quarter of last year."], "title": "World quakes as foundations shake: Italy's property market bucks the trend of global gloom", "article": "United States  Prices fell a record 18.2% in the year to last November, according to the 20-city Case-Shiller index, which puts Phoenix and Las Vegas (down an annualised rate close to 40%) at the forefront of the nation&apos;s continuing property collapse. Housing starts are at their lowest since the government began keeping records in 1959, amid a huge number of foreclosures. The epicentre of repossessions is the former boom town of Merced, 110 miles south-east of San Francisco. Prices jumped from an average of $150,000 (\u00a3105,000) in January 2002 to a peak of $382,750 in December 2005, but have now marched back down to $120,500. Four out of five sales over the past year in the town were repossessions. Spain  There are more than 1m unsold villas and apartments and that could increase by 500,000 this year, according to surveyor Tinsa, which is predicting a fall in prices of around 20% for 2009. Credit rating agency Standard Poor&apos;s reckons Spanish house prices may not hit the bottom until 2010. Housing starts have tumbled, with the Spanish banks doing everything to avoid further collapses among major developers. Dubai  Probably the world&apos;s most devastated property market, prices in Dubai are likely to be around 60% below their peak levels by the end of this year, according to local analyst Roy Cherry of Shuaa Capital. The population is shrinking fast, with UBS bank anticipating an 8% dip this year, mainly as a result of the collapse in the construction sector. Ireland  Prices dived on average by 10% last year. Many predict the Celtic Tiger will see the biggest falls in the developed world. Since the downturn began in 2007, prices in many parts of the country (particularly Dublin new-build) have fallen 35%. According to Permanent TSB, prices slid by 9.1% on average in 2008, and by 7.3% in 2007. With its banks in deep trouble, amid renewed emigration and job losses, analysts forecast a 9%-10% slide in 2009. North of the border, prices in Ulster are falling faster than anywhere in the UK. Poland  Eastern European builders losing their jobs in Britain and Ireland have little hope of finding work at home. Polish house prices will fall between 15% and 20% this year and wont start rising until 2012, an analyst at the country&apos;s central bank was quoted as saying. He blamed a glut of unsold homes and a withdrawal of financing.

Savills said prices in Shanghai fell 19.5% in the third quarter of last year. France Price declines accelerated in the last quarter of 2008, according to FNAIM, the national association of French estate agents. Average house prices were 10% lower by the end of 2008, with the biggest falls in the previously booming south-east. The heaviest falls were in Cannes, where apartment prices were down 13.2% on the year before. FNAIM expects a decline of 10% this year, with falls possible through 2010 and 2011.

Each spine is tipped with a tiny coloured light source, and those spines can ripple in the breeze: well, that&apos;s the idea, anyway. Heatherwick&apos;s concepts are always ambitious, but what is there to lose? This expo is expected to bring in the largest number of visitors in the history of world fairs, and we need to be bold, according to Sir Andrew Cahn, chief executive of UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI). &quot;We are currently living in the midst of a technology revolution, and we need to maintain our edge - whether it&apos;s through R&amp;D or architectural icons.&quot; Leveraging the British brand presence in Shanghai is part of a five-year UKTI marketing strategy announced last year to bolster the UK&apos;s creative reputation. China is an obvious candidate for British expertise, not least because British consulting engineers helped create the iconic Birds Nest Stadium at Beijing.  And it does look as if China is receptive, despite the world downturn. It&apos;s said that recession is the time to innovate and invest, rather than retrench. British designer Paul Priestman has just won a project to design the world&apos;s biggest ever train, for the Chinese Sifang Locomotive Company. He hopes to create the definitive symbol of modern China, just as the bullet train seen next to Mount Fuji has come to define Japan. Official UK trade missions have been useful to his consultancy, Priestman Goode, he says, but landing business is not just a case of downing some drinks at a posh reception party. &quot;How do you do it? By carefully cultivating contacts you meet and by not dropping the ball,&quot; he says.  Architect Nick Thompson agrees. A trade mission 10 years ago led to his specialist firm Integer being asked to spread the word in Hong Kong about green building technologies. The resulting exhibition building, modelled on the traditional Chinese roundhouse, &quot;was a sensation: we had thousands and thousands through the pavilion: a jamboree.&quot; Meanwhile the British embassy acted as a business base, a place to hold workshops and a call centre. &quot;Sometimes it takes a little while to get your match to light. But if the right spark is struck, the government is very effective,&quot; says Thompson. His building was eventually re-sold and resurrected in China as a permanent environmental centre. &quot;There are certainly big challenges,&quot; says Cahn. &quot;The UK is respected for its strong creative heritage, but is perhaps perceived less as a dynamic and innovative nation.

Seven years on, the Serpentine has gone to Japan again to find its architects. This time around it&apos;s the turn of Sanaa, a Tokyo practice founded by Kazuyo Sejima (48) and Ryue Nishizawa (38) in 1995. Like Ito, Sanaa&apos;s work is ethereal, exquisite, translucent and testing. Very quietly, very gently, Sejima and Nishizawa, have pushed the boundaries of contemporary architecture. It might be a little corny to say they have done so in a Zen-like fashion, and yet their buildings, interiors, installations, furniture and other designs have been remarkably calm and quieting, objects for contemplation as well as buildings and designs with a practical purpose. Quite what Sanaa will do for the Serpentine and Kensington Gardens remains to be seen, but if their best known building to date, The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, completed four years ago, is anything to go by, it will be sculptural, peaceful and gently haunting. Haunting, that is, not in the sense of disturbing, but in a way that will very probably remain in visitors&apos; memories long after it&apos;s be disassembled, sold and re-erected somewhere else in the world as several of the Serpentine pavilions have been over the past decade. The New Museum of Contemporary Art is one of the most striking buildings on Manhattan&apos;s boisterous skyline. It rises like some shimmering stack of half-open, half-closed drawers among the city&apos;s spires, and yet, although an undeniably strong composition, it&apos;s as gentle as a spring breeze. To make large-scale structures so seemingly weightless, as if consisting more of air and light than steel and glass, takes both imagination and a truly refined skill. As for smaller buildings, including a number of fine houses in Japan, Sanaa has the knack of shaping structures that really do resemble \u2013 in the very best sense \u2013 fine card or paper models. These can seem improbably delicate, and even when chastely minimal, very beautiful indeed. Both architects are self-effacing, modest and highly talented. To be asked to design their first building in Britain at a time of recession may seem something of a thankless task, yet there are many of us hoping that when the economic going gets good again, the next generation of architecture will be more like Sanaa&apos;s than Shanghai&apos;s, Dubai&apos;s or Stratford&apos;s \u2013 east London, that is. Even if it isn&apos;t, Sanaa and the Serpentine Gallery are very likely to shape a special place in Kensington Gardens that, like Ito&apos;s pavilion, we will dream about happily even when it&apos;s long vanished into the architectural ether.

But what is more of a surprise is the arrival of a new, local car manufacturer with breathtaking ambitions, supported by a government seeking to become a world leader when it comes to green technology. BYD Auto \u2013 short for Build Your Dreams \u2013 was only founded in 2003, yet it has pulled off a global coup by mass-\u00adproducing the world&apos;s first plug-in, petrol-\u00adelectric hybrid, the nifty-looking BYD F3DM (byd.com). Under the bonnet, the car is more of a purely electric car than any similar hybrids on the road today, and has made its debut at least a year ahead of similar models from the US and Japan. This year&apos;s model The car, which does not need a specialised electric charging station and can be charged using a normal household supply, is now on sale in China, where it costs just under 150,000 yuan (\u00a315,000), a similar price to a mid-range petrol-powered sedan and a bit more than half the 250,000 yuan it costs to buy a Toyota Prius. BYD has come from nowhere to sell 24,107 vehicles in January alone, an increase of nearly 80% from the previous year, and aims to sell 400,000 models in China this year. BYD aims to tap into the world&apos;s fastest-growing auto market as China&apos;s emerging middle class \u2013 now estimated to number between 100 million and 150 million people \u2013 swap their bicycles for four wheels. While the economic crisis has sent vehicle sales tumbling around the world, Beijing alone is still adding more than 1,500 new cars to its gridlock every day. &quot;The use of alternative types of cars could really make a contribution to the reduction of pollution in large Chinese cities,&quot; says Karl-Thomas Neumann, chairman of the carparts manufacturer Continental. A survey by Continental shows that Chinese consumers are much more interested in hybrids than their European counterparts, with 53.7% of those surveyed happy to buy a hybrid and 73.4% who would consider an electric car \u2013 decidedly more green than the UK&apos;s respective 30.2% and 37.1%. Chinese drivers are more open to hybrids as &quot;more than 90% drive in urban centres and travel less than 60 miles a day&quot;, says Paul Lin, BYD Auto&apos;s marketing manager. Hybrids come into their own in cities because of their limited range and top speeds. In queues, the car&apos;s electric engine shuts down before restarting when the car moves again. While the auto company is a newcomer, its parent company, BYD \u2013 which itself has only been around since 1995 \u2013 is the world&apos;s biggest supplier of rechargeable batteries, giving them a huge jumpstart when it comes to the production of hybrid and electric cars. And the company has audacious ambitions \u2013 it aims to be China&apos;s No 1 car firm by 2015, and world No 1 in 2025. BYD vehicles will be launched in Europe \u2013 provisionally Denmark, because of its friendly tax policies towards green technology \u2013 in 2011. &quot;We respect our competitors abroad,&quot; says Lin, &quot;but we are aiming to show that we can not only compete on the world stage, but dominate.&quot; Environmentalists and Chinese commuters frustrated at the rising price of fuel aren&apos;t the only ones with their fingers crossed that the car takes off. The US investment guru Warren Buffet has bought a 10% stake in the firm for $232m. In China, electricity is cheap, though this is produced by burning coal. The company decided to avoid building expensive charging stations. &quot;Most Chinese live in apartments and don&apos;t have their own garages, so instead, drivers unplug the battery and charge it in their homes overnight,&quot; says Lin. The car has a range of 62 miles on a fully charged battery, and once the battery runs out, the car switches into hybrid mode. Lin claims the batteries will not degrade until they have been fully charged 2,000 times, which should take seven years, and even then, the battery&apos;s capacity only drops to 80%. Communist revolution Of course, one company alone won&apos;t change China&apos;s dirty habits, let alone those of the world, says Bradley Berman, editor of Hybridcars.com. &quot;BYD deserves credit for producing plug-in hybrids. But to make a real dent in auto pollution, these plug-in cars will need to scale up to hundreds of thousands per year. So, it&apos;s not who&apos;s first with the first models. Environmental and economic success will come with high-volume production sustained over many years,&quot; he says. An analyst with IHS Global Insight Auto, Duan Chengwu, says China&apos;s advances in green technology have come about because of backing from its most dominant power source \u2013 its Communist government. &quot;The government firmly supports these companies producing hybrids and electric cars,&quot; says Duan. Measures to stimulate the ailing car industry include the halving of sales tax on certain cars, subsidies for owners of high-emission vehicles who exchange them for more fuel-efficient vehicles and a 10bn yuan fund to promote new technology. Thirteen cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, offer subsidies to hybrid buyers. While combating pollution problems is one incentive, the Chinese government has another reason to push green technology: pride. &quot;The government wants to leapfrog western countries and become a global leader in the field,&quot; Duan says. &quot;The country is years behind its competitors in the auto industry as a whole, but when it comes to green technology, everyone is starting from scratch. In this scenario, China has a great opportunity.&quot; Four wheels good The most famous hybrid car of choice is still the Toyota Prius, the first mass-produced model. The car is essentially petrol-fuelled but has an electric engine that propels the car at low speeds and assists the main engine when accelerating. First launched in Japan in 1997 before going worldwide in 2001, more than 1m Prius hybrids have been sold. There will be a plug-in version of the Prius for fleet customers by the end of the year, and the company also recently announced they will produce a commuter battery-electric vehicle by 2012. General Motors won&apos;t be joining the electric car fray until 2011, when it says it will launch the Chevy Volt in the US. The car will have a lithium-ion battery with a petrol-powered engine that drives a generator to provide electricity when you drive beyond its 40-mile battery range. The Volt is expected to cost around $40,000 (\u00a327,500). Here in the UK, the independent car company Lightning wins the award for the most stylish option \u2013 their swish-looking fully electric Lightning model looks like something an eco-friendly James Bond would drive, and should be available from late 2010.

Yet as the prime minister, who has experienced it himself, knows, it is a tragedy that continues to befall many parents, even if child mortality today is a mere fraction of what it used to be. I have only to look at my own family. Those lost in childhood included one boy who, if he had lived, would have become my great-uncle, another who would have been my uncle, and a third who would have been my first cousin. And then there was a girl, Sophia, who would have been my sister. She died, aged four, of spinal meningitis in 1934, six years before I was born.  The circumstances of her death remain hazy for the simple reason that my parents never ever mentioned her. My mother&apos;s response to her grief was to behave as if Sophia had never existed. I don&apos;t know how often mothers react in that way, but I don&apos;t think it should be taken as callousness: one way of dealing with unbearable pain must be to try to suppress all memories of its cause.  Nevertheless, it&apos;s not a good way. My brother John, now 81, who was two years older than Sophia, believes that he has suffered emotionally as a result. And what about the little girl herself? Did she not deserve to be remembered and celebrated in the way that Ivan Cameron will surely be? Even John, the eldest of my parents&apos; four surviving children, and the only one old enough to have known her, has only the sketchiest memories of Sophia; and this may be largely because they were never reinforced by subsequent talk of her with his parents.  My own knowledge of Sophia is confined to a photograph of her sitting with my mother on a beach. She is wearing a bathing costume and a floppy cotton hat, and her eyes are almost shut as she squints into the sun. But you can see that she was pretty and, at the time of the photograph, perfectly healthy. She was not, like Ivan Cameron, a child whose life expectancy was already short - and that may have made her death, if no sadder than his, even harder to deal with. It happened in China, where my parents lived throughout the 30s, my father being the far-eastern manager of Reuters news agency, based in Shanghai. When meningitis struck, Sophia was taken to Beijing for specialist hospital treatment, and our mother shunted backwards and forwards between the two cities, tending to Sophia in one and taking care of John in the other. It so happened that she died while our mother was in the wrong city, and this almost certainly burdened her with feelings of guilt.  John remembers clearly how he learned of her death. Our mother was in bed in Shanghai, crying, when she broke it to him that Sophia had &quot;gone to heaven&quot;. He must have looked blank, for the Russian nanny who was with them accused him of hard-heartedness and boxed his ears. When he was at Eton, John kept a framed photograph of Sophia in his room, which our mother was once shocked to come across. I asked him why he did this. &quot;I think I was proud of having had such a pretty sister,&quot; he said. Our mother never ever mentioned Sophia to me, and never again to John until she herself was dying, aged 95. She then tried to talk to him about her, but he could not make out what she was saying. Did Lord Ahmed&apos;s peerage help or hinder him in his trial for sending text messages while driving his car? His solicitor said he ought never to have been sent to prison for such a minor offence and had been &quot;used as a scapegoat&quot; because of his status. The family of the Slovakian factory worker who died when Lord Ahmed crashed into his car said that, on the contrary, he had been let off lightly. &quot;Because he is an important person, the judge didn&apos;t give him a big sentence [it was three months in jail],&quot; said a spokesman for the family of Martyn Gombar. &quot;His mother has lost her son, but this man will be free in weeks.&quot; The Gombar line doesn&apos;t work because the judge made clear that Lord Ahmed&apos;s long fiddle with his mobile phone had nothing to do with the collision, which took place two minutes after he had finished his texting, and that he wasn&apos;t in any case responsible for Mr Gombar&apos;s death. The Slovakian had been drinking, and his car, having already been crashed by him into the central rail of the M1 in Yorkshire, was stationary, facing the wrong way, and straddled across two lanes, when Lord Ahmed drove into it. So it looks like Lord Ahmed&apos;s solicitor, Steve Smith, was nearer to the mark. The judge, in emphasising that it was &quot;of the greatest importance that people realise what a serious offence dangerous driving of this type is&quot;, may well have felt that a custodial sentence for someone of Lord Ahmed&apos;s prominence would be helpful in publicising this point (not to suggest that he would have given a lesser sentence to a lesser person).  The irony in this case, however, is that if Martyn Gombar had lived and Lord Ahmed had died, which is a perfectly plausible scenario, Gombar would probably have gone to prison; and more deservedly so, because, unlike Lord Ahmed, he would have been responsible for a person&apos;s death. And it does seem strange that the illegal use of a mobile phone at the wheel of a car should, of itself, carry a custodial sentence when being slightly drunk, for example, does not.

One, El Armario (on Carrer de la Riereta), involves actually walking through the owner&apos;s wardrobe to get to the bar area. Far too cool for a telephone number or website, it rarely opens before 3am (and sometimes not at all) but if you do get in there&apos;s a fair chance you&apos;ll be the only tourists there. If it&apos;s closed, try El Mariachi (corner of Carrer dels C\u00f2dols and Carrer d&apos;En Rull in the Gothic quarter) or The Front Room (its unofficial name - it doesn&apos;t really have one), behind the metal door on Carrer d&apos;En Carabassa.

From the outside, a tourist would only see a row of dangling hams and an old-fashioned till. But &quot;tras tienda&quot; translates as &quot;behind the shop&quot;, so locals disappear behind the counter to find a cosy bar serving good house wines, local beer and, of course, Andalucian meats.

Formerly Le Christine, the bar has retained a distinctly sexy feel, with fibre-optic stars in the ceiling, crystal chandeliers, boudoir lamps and a red London phone box that has been transformed into a smoking booth. This is a late-night hangout - don&apos;t expect things to liven up until about 3am. 37 rue de Ponthieu, 8e Jenseits, ViennaAlthough there is a tiny sign, it&apos;s very easy to miss - and easier to think the bar is closed. Ring the doorbell, however, and you are ushered into a scarlet-walled den, with gold drapes and warm lighting giving proceedings a sultry, &quot;boudoir&quot; feel - probably because it was a brothel in a former life. The thirtysomething crowd may look grown-up, but the tiny dance floor is always packed, regardless of the sometimes eclectic playlists (which can range from rockabilly to schlager - Austrian country music).

The Greenwich, in the highly hip Mitte district, adheres to the same principles by having neither telephone number nor website; although it remains in the same place, hidden behind an unmarked door, with no hint of the sleek decor within - ribbed lime sofas and a giant fishtank.

Don&apos;t expect languid sophisticates sipping Cosmoplitans; this is Czech grunge at its most, um, grungiest. House rules are nonexistent (apart from respecting other punters) and the house cocktail mixes vodka, gin, tequila and white rum.

Hidden from the rest of the city you&apos;ll find two bars, Buza I and Buza II, teetering precariously on several levels of jagged rocks 60ft above the Adriatic. They are little more than a patio, seats and a straw roof (and the toilets are a whiffy, fly-infested shed), but it&apos;s hands down one of the most romantic bars in the world. Order an Ozujsko beer and lap up that eye-wateringly beautiful sunset. There&apos;s no phone number and no website, but word of mouth means you&apos;ll always find a crowd here. South of Main St, Old Town Cafe Barrita, HavanaThe art-deco frontage of the vast former headquarters of Bacardi is one of Havana&apos;s most eye-catching buildings - although it&apos;s now home to more mundane offices. But hidden away on the first floor is the fabulously ornate Cafe Barrita, which does a spectacular line in mojitos. Ask at the front desk, and you&apos;ll be taken up in the lift. 261 Monserrate, Bacardi Building Ocho7ocho, Buenos AiresThe bar may be hidden behind a nondescript door, but it&apos;s relatively easy to find because the name of the bar (eight7eight) is actually its street number. Once you&apos;re inside, the space opens out - the bar is housed in a former textiles factory - to reveal a chic, slightly austere interior with exposed brickwork and high bar stools that are dangerously easy to fall off after one mojito too many. 878 Thames, Palermo Soho; 00 54 11 4773 1098 Feather Boa, Hong KongWalk through an unmarked door near the intersection with Peel Street, push back the heavy velvet curtain and you&apos;re suddenly transported from the 21st-century neon of Hong Kong to 19th-century Paris.

The former tailor&apos;s studio, on the outskirts of Chinatown down a cobbled alleyway, has two separate areas. The downstairs room, all lush scarlet decor and dim lighting, has a distinctly opium-den feel, while the upstairs room is kitsch-pink, with antique furniture and a neat line in sours. Music is unpredictable, lurching from 1930s swing to 1970s new wave, which appeals to the slightly older crowd. 21 Liverpool Street; 00 61 3 9650 8859; newgoldmountain.org Tonic Lounge, SydneyThis looks like a normal house in a Kings Cross terraced street, but once inside...it still feels like a mate&apos;s house, only one with a slightly kitsch taste in interiors. Lush red drapes, shabby velvet couches and chaise longues create a boudoir-ish feel, matched by the cocktails - the raspberry and lychee martini is a house favourite. The lounge is where the band plays and where the staff dispense drinks, and there are several smaller rooms - all dimly lit and cosy - although there is space to dance in the main room.

At the Casino, housed in a palazzo perched on the Grand Canal, organisers totted up the numbers: one million visitors; hotels 95% full and 100,000 packed into St Mark&apos;s Square to watch a woman dressed in white wings descend on a wire from the bell tower of St Mark&apos;s Basilica. Alongside the jubilant carnival managers stood Massimo Cacciari, the heavily bearded, stick-thin mayor of Venice who still comes across as the distracted philosopher professor he was before seeking election. Given the stellar returns from his city&apos;s latest masked spectacle, Cacciari seemed subdued. And as the carnival-goers left he had good reason to be. For months now, Cacciari has been under attack from locals who believe that he is failing to protect the soul and vibrancy of perhaps the most beautiful city in the world. There was outrage when the mayor allowed the erection of massive advertising hoardings in St Mark&apos;s Square, which Cacciari claims are essential to pay for the upkeep of the city as Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s government squeezes funding. There was further restlessness when officials announced the installation of 60 Coca-Cola vending machines in the city&apos;s piazzas, in return for \u20ac2.5m over five years from the drinks giant. The deal has a whiff of double standards, critics argued, since the city has been sending out &quot;decorum&quot; patrols to stop tourists picnicking in St Mark&apos;s Square and dropping Coke cans in canals. But Cacciari again pleaded poverty, arguing: &quot;We need a financial strategy to save our cultural heritage.&quot; And then there are the growing number of Venetians such as Matteo Secchi, the combative son of a Venetian wine merchant, who has been totting up some alarming numbers of his own. Every week Secchi heads to the town hall to check on the number of residents in Venice. Almost every week that number is lower than the week before. Armed with the latest grim statistics, Secchi updates the electronic board he has erected in a shop window near the Rialto bridge. Venice, as a lived-in city, is dying. A population which peaked at 164,000 in 1931 is now hovering at around 60,000. Since about 20 million tourists pour in each year - 55,000 a day - it&apos;s a safe bet that most days there are now more tourists than locals in Venice. &quot;The number of locals has dropped 600 since we started counting last March and we are set to go under the psychological 60,000 barrier in May,&quot; said Secchi, who heads a residents&apos; group, Venessia.com, which is planning a procession to mark the occasion. &quot;We will hold the funeral of Venice and take a coffin down to the town hall,&quot; he said. Secchi and the 600 members of Venessia.com did not stay at home during the carnival, but organised their own protest party for residents by the Rialto, dressing up as American Indians. &quot;Tourists were welcome, but the point was to show we feel like we are living on a reserve,&quot; said Secchi. Leaflets in five languages said: &quot;Our cultural identity is at risk of dissolving if Venice becomes a theme park - we Venetians will not surrender!&quot; Co-hosting the party was Venice&apos;s second new activist group, 40xVenezia, which has been battling against the creeping colonisation of houses and apartments by bed-and-breakfasts and rental agencies, which push up rents and property prices beyond the reach of locals. &quot;We believe 1,000 homes were lost between about 2002 and 2007, and we have been kicking up a stink about a new proposal to allow hotels in Venice - a very powerful lobby - to turn more houses into tourist-based accommodation, which would be devastating,&quot; said activist and lawyer Francesco Versace. By the time the bed-and-breakfasts arrived in Venice, thousands of locals had already packed up and left. The exodus became marked in the 1970s and 1980s, when Venetians, exasperated by the aftermath of the floods of 1966, fled towards the promise of a house on the mainland with a garden and a car in the garage. The jobs, too, were migrating to the mainland. As the old industries on the Venetian island of Guideca, notably the manufacture of watches and components for bombs, died out, the new place to look for work was in the chemical factories around the mainland town of Mestre nearby. When the February carnival tradition was revived in the 1970s, in the hope of attracting tourists in greater numbers, many locals thought of it as a last hurrah for the old city. Former Venetians now living in Mestre still recall the 70s carnivals as a kind of collective goodbye party. Enrico Crosara, 40, would love to join his mates in Mestre, but as a baker working in Via Garibaldi, close to the walls of the old shipyards, his early shifts rule out the long ride in from the mainland. So he stays in a city whose habits he no longer recognises. &quot;It&apos;s like a curfew after dark, there is just nothing to do,&quot; he said. He remembers the area bursting with life and a sense of community when he was a child. Now the doors are bolted and white sheets flap from occasional washing lines like flags of surrender. Next door, at the association for second world war partisans, Renzo Fa\u00e8, 65, is yelling down the phone in Venetian dialect, giving an elderly local tips on how to fill in his pension form. &quot;This used to be a very tight community,&quot; he said, after putting the phone down. &quot;Locals would take their honeymoon near St Mark&apos;s Square, less than a mile away.&quot; Matteo Secchi passed this way as a child, en route from his home sestiere, or neighbourhood, of Cannaregio, to see Venezia play football at the stadium built at the tip of the city. &quot;Back then, visiting fans used to come in by boat under escort and there were always plans to play pirate and board them by force,&quot; he said. &quot;After games we would play against neighbouring squares or just gossip. In such a small place news travelled fast, so I would walk down to the bridge and everyone would know what I had been up to!&quot; Today Venezia football club has dropped from Serie A to Italy&apos;s third division, a decline bemoaned by the men who gathered last week at a backstreet supporters&apos; club for a 50-cent, mid-morning glass of red wine. &quot;Membership here has halved to 111 since the 1970s and those left are all old,&quot; said bar worker Rosa Ferruccio. Across from Crosara&apos;s bakery there has been a church since the 14th century, when Venice&apos;s empire spanned the Mediterranean and the local population was already close to 150,000. Today the cavernous interior of the church of San Francesco Di Paola, complete with a Giandomenico Tiepolo painting, draws as few as eight worshippers to mass. &quot;We did get 150 in for Ash Wednesday,&quot; said priest Don Giuseppe Faustini, &quot;and we do fill up for funerals.&quot; The city&apos;s predicament is compounded by the fact that even the death of Venice is taking place somewhere else, according to Ernesto Fabris, a local stonemason. Fabris is one of six remaining gravestone specialists whose workshops are tucked away down the narrow streets opposite the island of San Michele, Venice&apos;s cemetery. &quot;There used to be a lot more of us tagiapiere round here,&quot; he said, &quot;but annual deaths in the Lagoon are now just 1,200 a year, 30% down on 20 years ago.&quot; As he spoke he watched his brother rub gold leaf into the lettering on the headstone for a recently deceased gondolier, one of the few trades still on the up. Fabris also battles costs and delays his mainland competitors do not face. With a small, dusty storage space down at the end of a dark, fetid alley, he cannot order stone in bulk. &quot;One tonne of white marble cut into 40 slabs that we ordered recently took four men two days to wheel, slab by slab, from the quay to the lock-up,&quot; he said. As the local population dwindles, the tourists are slowly killing off the same Venice street life that they dream of witnessing close up, said postwoman Orietta Sinibaldi, 50. Sinibaldi works around Salizada San Francesco, where a cluster of neighbourhood shops huddle inches from St Mark&apos;s, protected by a network of back streets that has apparently left traditional lifestyles intact. &quot;It may look that way, but even here the tourists have cut into a space in which Venetians used to live,&quot; she said. The &quot;decorum&quot; patrols that sometimes pounce on tourists should they dare to eat a sandwich in the street are an attempt by the authorities to address some residents&apos; complaints without scaring away the city&apos;s principal source of income.  &quot;Tourism is the biggest business in town, and the key is decorum,&quot; insisted tourism assessor Augusto Saladori. But Michela Scibilia, a graphic designer who moved to Venice 22 years ago, said Saladori was missing the point. &quot;This town needs the kind of tourists the Biennale and the film festival bring, not necessarily rich, but certainly not the huge groups that follow raised umbrellas. The city was sold off cheap to the hoteliers, water taxi operators and shopkeepers, who got the chance to make money, and now Venice has the mass tourism it deserves,&quot; she said. Scibilia, 43, a mother of two, is one of the 1,500 members involved in the lively debate on 40xVenezia&apos;s forum, which includes academics, architects, lawyers and priests. The group has revived neighbourhood festivals and gathered signatures to keep the local maternity ward open. It is now campaigning against the garish display that Venice plans to take to the Shanghai Expo in 2010, complete with a water-filled canal. &quot;It looks like the fake Venice in Las Vegas,&quot; said Scibilia. &quot;If you promote the city like this to millions of potential Chinese tourists they will come and just object to the smell of the canals and the fact there is nowhere to pee.&quot; Working out of a restored palazzo with its own boat moored by the back door, Scibilia represents a new generation of Venetians who have settled to find a quality of life absent in Italy&apos;s car-clogged towns.  &quot;I met four people I needed to see this morning walking to school. Where else can I have a village life in an international city?&quot; she said. For those bucking the trend by moving in, the internet is proving crucial. Once a week Scibilia orders vegetables from an Excel file emailed by the vegetable-growers on the lagoon island of St Erasmus and joins a queue on the quayside to pick up her order when the boat comes in. &quot;This does not have to be a city stuck in the past,&quot; she said. &quot;When experts dream up perfect cities, without cars and liveable, it&apos;s Venice.&quot; But back in Via Garibaldi, a filled-in canal which is the nearest Venice has to a high street, a handful of shoppers tightened their coats against the cold last week as they passed the numerous boarded-up shop fronts.  Watching them from the till at the bakery, Enrico Crosara&apos;s mother Angela said she was not so sure Venice was set for a rebound. &quot;Ten years ago there were four of us behind the counter and the queues stretched out the door on a Saturday morning,&quot; she said. &quot;Now there are two of us and we spend most of the time staring out the window.&quot; A short history of Venice \u2022 Attila the Hun invades northern Italy in AD452, razing the great Roman city of Aquileia and causing its population to flee to the small islands in the lagoon.  \u2022 Pope Gregory II encourages Italian cities to claim independence from the Byzantine emperor. Venice&apos;s council elects its first doge or leader, Orso Ipato, in 726.  \u2022 With trading ports at the mercy of Norman raiding parties, the Byzantine emperor offers Venetians free trading rights throughout the empire from 1081 in return for naval assistance. Venice expands its control over the Adriatic. \u2022 The fourth crusade of 1202 comes under Doge Enrico Dandolo&apos;s control. He leads a conquest of the Dalmatian coast and then Constantinople, sacking the city in 1204 and taking charge of the eastern Mediterranean.  \u2022 Four wars with Genoa from 1255 for control of the Mediterranean end with the surrender of the Genoan fleet in 1380. Venice also enters the battle for mainland power, taking Treviso&apos;s territories from Milan in 1329. \u2022 Pope Julius II forms the League of Cambrai in 1508 to halt Venice&apos;s increasing expansion. Venice&apos;s mercenary army is routed by French forces, losing many of its mainland cities.

The relics were sold in Paris last week, to the anger of many in China. The telephone bidder paid \u20ac31m (\u00a327m) for the two bronzes. The Chinese government warned that the sale would affect auctioneer Christie&apos;s development in China, and even the action movie star Jackie Chan described the auction as &quot;shameful&quot;. While a French court ruled that the auction was legal, Beijing argued that the sculptures should be returned to China. Today, the argument took a fresh twist as Cai Mingchao, an adviser to a Chinese foundation which seeks to retrieve plundered treasures, told a news conference that he was the collector who won the auction. &quot;What I need to stress is that this money cannot be paid,&quot; he added, describing his bid as a patriotic act. &quot;I think any Chinese person would have stood up at that moment. It was just that the opportunity came to me. I was merely fulfulling my responsibilities.&quot; Christie&apos;s had no immediate comment and could not confirm Cai as the bidder, the spokeswoman Yvonne So told the Associated Press. She said that if a bidder couldn&apos;t or wouldn&apos;t pay, Christie&apos;s usually worked with the buyer and vendor to find a solution. The auction house said the legal ownership of the pieces had been clearly confirmed, a view upheld by French courts. Wang Weiming, one of the heads of China&apos;s Lost Cultural Relics Recovery Programme \u2013 the foundation which Cai advises \u2013 said she was &quot;not sure&quot; if or when the bronzes would return to China. &quot;These national treasures are probably still in France,&quot; Wang told Reuters. &quot;We&apos;ll have to see how the situation develops.&quot; The rabbit and rat heads were part of an elaborate fountain which stood in the Yuanmingyuan, the imperial summer residence, until it was razed and looted by French and British troops in 1860. The destruction of the Old Summer Palace still rankles and Pierre Berg\u00e9 \u2013 Saint Laurent&apos;s partner and co-owner of a vast art collection \u2013 further upset Chinese patriots when he offered to return the relics without charge if China would &quot;give the Tibetans back their freedom&quot;.

Five of the other fountain heads have been bought by Chinese business figures and repatriated, while experts fear the other five may have been destroyed.

A global car business is also close to signing a product-placement deal for the film, the company&apos;s first production since new management took over in 2006. HandMade&apos;s chief executive, David Ravden, said the company had raised the finance for the film \u2013 which opens in the US on the key Thanksgiving weekend in November \u2013 on the back of signing distribution deals in all the major global markets. The distributors, including Sony in the US, paid 5-10% of their fees immediately, with the balance due when the film is delivered to them in June and July. The film, written by Joe Stillman, who was part of the team behind Shrek and Shrek 2, involves an astronaut landing on another planet, only to find that its inhabitants live in the style of 1950s American TV programmes and treat him like an alien invader. Ravden said: &quot;A successful film of this type could take $150m-$400m in the US. I&apos;m not saying we&apos;ll be at the top end of those numbers but if we get it right, there is no reason why we can&apos;t be in that area.

It has lined up new versions of The Long Good Friday and Mona Lisa (the latter with Kids director Larry Clark involved and Mickey Rourke and Eva Green being sounded out for the lead roles). Further down the line, a remake of Terry Gilliam&apos;s Time Bandits and a possible Time Bandits 2 are being considered, as well as an original film about the Roman emperor Hadrian directed by John Boorman. Ravden is keen to establish HandMade as a force to be reckoned with, and feels the success of Slumdog Millionaire can only be beneficial. &quot;It is quite important,&quot; he said. &quot;It sends a signal to the global film community and Hollywood in particular that the UK can deliver films that win awards and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 have commercial value.&quot;", "tags": ["Business", "Film"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-02T14:46:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/03/uk-news-in-brief", "sentences": ["Tibet!&quot; at the end of her song, Declare Independence, in Shanghai last year and warned that it would tighten controls on foreign artists.Tania Branigan Scottish alcohol pricing plans &apos;may be illegal&apos; Pubs and supermarkets in Scotland could be banned from selling cut-price alcohol and forced to adopt minimum prices for all wine, spirits and beer, under swingeing measures proposed by ministers yesterday."], "title": "UK news in brief", "article": "Authorities ban Oasis from playing in China Oasis said yesterday they were bewildered at news that the authorities had banned them from playing in China next month, deeming them &quot;unsuitable&quot;.

You must be joking. And what exactly is a Wonderwall?&quot; Perhaps the biggest surprise isn&apos;t that the band&apos;s two shows have been cancelled, but that they were given the go-ahead in the first place. After all, since Bjork&apos;s outburst in Shanghai last year, the government has kept an increasingly close eye on western acts looking to make musical forays into the country.  Just last week one of China&apos;s preeminent newspapers shelved a review of U2&apos;s latest album after it became clear that Bono has vocally supported Tibet&apos;s cause, incidentally at the same 1997 New York concert of Noel Gallagher&apos;s indiscretion. But you could be forgiven for thinking that the government are slightly overestimating Oasis&apos;s ability to stir the revolutionary spirit of China&apos;s indie kids. For one, the band is far from the household name it is in the UK. For all China&apos;s opening up in recent years, the music industry remains intensely insular. Hollywood movies may play in cinemas, but the Chinese have their own pop stars to worship. Secondly, by cancelling the concert several weeks after tickets first went on sale, they are turning Oasis into the sort of dangerous band it never was. Noel has barely been championing the plight of Tibetans in the 12 years since he performed in New York. Any Chinese student downloading Definitely Maybe tonight in hope of a pro-democracy rallying cry is going to be deeply disappointed.  The last three major western acts to visit Beijing have been safe choices. Avril Lavigne&apos;s idea of rebellion is an ill-fitting tie, the biggest concern with Kylie Minogue was her outfits, and Kanye West appeared unusually muted on stage between songs. What is puzzling is that Oasis seems to fit into this category as well. Perhaps what&apos;s really happening here is that, by causing a furore over a big western act, the ministry of culture is shifting attention away from the growing number of Chinese bands who are beginning to sing about how they feel the country should be governed. Carsick Cars, one of Beijing&apos;s most popular rock bands, usually stick to non-political material but, at a recent show, they sang &quot;fuck the police&quot; in both English and Chinese.  Another possibility is that the whole charade will act as a way of warning major western artists to stay away from China. Certainly those big enough to embark on world tours will be put off from adding a Beijing or Shanghai date to their itinerary following this debacle. Although the government is finding it increasingly difficult to stop western film and music from entering the country via the internet, they can still control their cinemas and concert venues.  If anything, it is likely that the people most disappointed by the news will be British ex-pats, not young Chinese. Either way, it is unlikely that Oasis will be too bothered. Their date in Hong Kong remains, and their world tour continues around south-east Asia unaffected.

The spokesman for the National People&apos;s Congress \u2013 China&apos;s rubber-stamp parliament, which begins its annual session tomorrow \u2013 told reporters it was a &quot;modest&quot; increase which would increase capabilities and improve conditions for the 2.3 million members of the world&apos;s largest army. Li Zhaoxing said defence spending will reach 480.6bn yuan (\u00a350bn), 62.5bn yuan more than 2008. But the rise is slightly below last year&apos;s 17.6% increase \u2013 and the total is still dwarfed by US military spending. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates that even when comparative buying power is considered, China spent the equivalent of $140bn (\u00a399bn) in 2007, to America&apos;s $547bn. The UK spent the equivalent of $54bn. SIPRI suggests defence spending in China has risen threefold in real terms over the last decade. Chinese officials argue that heavy investment is needed to modernise its military after years of financial neglect and in the light of other countries&apos; increasing capabilities and China&apos;s growing responsibilities. It has begun contributing to peacekeeping efforts and recently sent ships to join the taskforce battling Somalian pirates. Li said the rise would mainly go towards raising wages and conditions, improving the military&apos;s hi-tech ability and enhancing its emergency response capabilities in &quot;disaster relief, fighting terrorism, maintaining stability and other non-warfare military operations&quot;. The former foreign minister added: &quot;China&apos;s limited military strength is to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity and would not threaten any country.&quot; A Japanese foreign ministry deputy spokesman, Takeshi Akamatsu, said there were &quot;untransparent points&quot; in the defence budget. Last year a Pentagon report suggested China&apos;s true budget was two to three times the official figure. But Li insisted: &quot;There is no such thing as so-called hidden military expenditure in China.&quot; Rory Medcalf, of the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, Australia, told Reuters: &quot;It is a bit surprising that they have maintained this level of spending despite the global economic crisis. Fifteen per cent is certainly not modest. &quot;There certainly is a sense of concern in countries like India, Japan, Vietnam, and even Australia about a much more powerful China and what this is going to mean in the future.&quot; US national intelligence director Dennis Blair said last month that China&apos;s military budget increases &quot;pose a greater threat to Taiwan&quot;. Although relations have improved, Beijing has warned it would use force to prevent Taiwan moving from de facto to formal independence. Teng Jianqun, a retired colonel and now deputy secretary general of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Associated Press that spending should go down, but predicted that &quot;the double-digit rate will remain for at least a few years&quot;. China observers are also watching closely this week for details of the 4tn yuan stimulus package announced in November. It aims to boost domestic consumption in the face of slumping exports, largely through spending on public works. A group of respected Communist elders has written to the leadership supporting the plan but warning that corrupt officials could squander the money. &quot;We are very concerned that privileged and corrupt individuals may use this opportunity to enrich themselves, damaging relations between the party and the people and exacerbating social conflicts,&quot; said the letter, obtained by Reuters, and signed by a former secretary to Mao Zedong and other liberal elders. Yan Yiming, a prominent Shanghai lawyer, has also filed two government information disclosure requests demanding more details. China&apos;s growth fell to a seven-year low of 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and analysts say the government will struggle to meet its 8% target this year even with the package. Standard Chartered economist Stephen Green suggested this week could see an announcement of further investment. He said in a report that officials had told him as much as 8tn to 10tn yuan in investment over two years was &quot;possible, if not likely&quot;.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Arms trade", "US news", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-04T15:18:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/05/war-on-drugs-prohibition", "sentences": ["And yet the majority of governments have supported a worldwide ban on the cultivation, distribution and use of psychoactive substances ever since the signing of the Shanghai convention, which aimed to target opium use, in 1909."], "title": "Libby Brooks on the futility of the war on drugs", "article": "This year marks the 100th anniversary of global drug prohibition, and what an inglorious centenary it is when we consider the millions of lives that have been blighted as a consequence of the war on drugs. And yet the majority of governments have supported a worldwide ban on the cultivation, distribution and use of psychoactive substances ever since the signing of the Shanghai convention, which aimed to target opium use, in 1909.  Next week, political leaders gather in Vienna to contemplate the state of international drug policy and sign up to new accords. It is a decade on from the last UN General Assembly special session (UNGASS) on narcotics in New York, which took as its ridiculously gauche slogan &quot;A drug-free world - we can do it&quot;. The reality of the past 10 years - from the poppy fields of Afghanistan to Manchester street stabbings - could not have been more different.  UNGASS is accused by some of being little more than a talking shop - its recommendations are, after all, non-binding. But this meeting is a crucial barometer and, for better or worse, will codify the consensus around global drug policy for the next decade. As the International Drug Policy consortium notes in a recent briefing, it&apos;s hard to overestimate the devastation caused to individuals and societies across the world by this strict prohibitionist stance.  Excluding Africa, one in three HIV infections results from the use of contaminated injecting equipment. But, while countless studies have concluded that provision of sterile equipment reduces needle-sharing but does not promote drug use, in many countries drug control continues to trump public health. In Russia, which has the fastest growing HIV epidemic in the world, users don&apos;t even have the option of weaning themselves off illegal drugs using a substitute such as methadone, because it is itself illegal. Despite a global trend towards the abolition of capital punishment, the number of regimes applying the death penalty to drug offences is increasing, in contravention of international human rights law. More broadly, punishing drug users doesn&apos;t work; it costs the taxpayer billions and keeps prisons dangerously overcrowded. Mike Trace, the former deputy UK drugs tsar, says successive studies show minimal correlation between the severity of law enforcement and demand for illegal drugs. Some of the toughest countries, such as the US, still have the highest rates of use. Then there are the devastating environmental effects of coca crop-spraying in Colombia. Or the forced detoxification of thousands of users in China. Or the fact that the illegal drugs market gifts millions to organised criminals and paramilitaries who destabilise entire countries. These are the consequences of prohibition, and a &quot;drug-free world&quot; has not been one of them. Until recently there had been strong indications that the Vienna talks would consider a more pragmatic and compassionate approach. EU countries, backed by some Latin American states, Australia and New Zealand, have been lobbying for the new declaration to explicitly mention harm reduction for the first time. But such optimism has evaporated, as the EU line founders, with the Vatican issuing a statement that harm reduction leads to the liberalisation of drug use and so is &quot;anti-life&quot;, while the US, Japan and Russia continue to veto anything other than zero tolerance.  Although the Obama administration has indicated a more progressive attitude than the Bush-led war on drugs - the president has already lifted the ban on federal funding for needle exchanges - it&apos;s unlikely that this new approach will filter through to the US negotiators in Vienna, which risks sealing the fate of global drug policy for another decade. Harm reduction - needle exchanges, prescription of substitute drugs and management of addiction - is no panacea, of course, but in individual countries where such interventions are long-established, they have saved many lives. The tragedy is that a consensus already exists among experts in drug policy, as well as among many senior politicians and police, but is only acknowledged in private. And that consensus is that the illegality of drugs causes more harm than good, and that the sanest response would be a system of regulation and taxation, bringing drugs into line with the other harmful choices that people make, like smoking and drinking.  As Danny Kushlick, of the drugs reform charity Transform, says: &quot;No amount of counselling, clean needles or methadone makes up for the fact that [a user&apos;s] drugs cost more than their equivalent weight in gold, that they are of unknown purity and that their possession is a criminal offence. And sadly, safe injecting rooms and heroin prescribing will not help the plight of Afghan and Colombian opium and coca growers.&quot; But legalisation and regulation is not a debate that will be going public in Vienna, nor anytime soon in Britain, given the way the government has ignored its advisory committee on the misuse of drugs in the last two reclassification exercises. Those who have seen the consequences of prohibition at first hand are still praying for a miracle in Vienna. And the rest of us will have to take slim comfort where we can get it. Like the story about a home affairs select committee session in 2001, during which one eager young backbencher was surprisingly vocal about the need for a mature discussion about legalisation. That MP was David Cameron. Now that really would be a turn-up.

His comments \u2013 made in an annual speech to the National People&apos;s Congress, the largely ceremonial parliament \u2013 underlined Beijing&apos;s keenness to bring the island closer after six decades of hostility. They came as Wen warned that the year ahead would be the most difficult the country has faced this century because of the global economic crisis. The approach to Taiwan built on earlier comments by the Chinses president, Hu Jintao, and omitted last year&apos;s warning that China would never allow anyone to separate Taiwan from &quot;the motherland&quot;. Taiwan broke away when the Kuomintang fled there after losing the civil war to the communists in 1949. The threat of war has hung over the Taiwan Strait for years, with Beijing warning that it would use military force if the self-ruled island sought formal independence. &quot;Cross-strait relations have embarked on the track of peaceful development,&quot; Wen said. &quot;We are ... ready to hold talks on cross-strait political and military issues and create conditions for ending the state of hostility and concluding a peace agreement between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.&quot; Relations between the two sides thawed when President Ma Ying-jeou took office in Taipei last May, having campaigned on a platform of improving cross-strait relations. The results of that policy have included direct flights and shipping routes between the island and its biggest trade partner. However, Taiwanese officials said last month that China had increased the number of short-range missiles aimed at the island to about 1,500. &quot;A peace deal has advantages for both sides,&quot; Tony Wang, a spokesman for Ma, said today. &quot;But our thought is first to seek economic deals and political ones later.&quot; Officials have said political issues must be shelved until at least 2010 because of anti-China sentiment on the island. Beijing&apos;s leading negotiator faced violent protests during his first visit to Taiwan last year. Zhu Weidong, a researcher at the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Reuters Wen&apos;s remarks &quot;echo and push forward&quot; Hu&apos;s proposition. Lin Chong-pin, a strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan, said: &quot;I think Beijing means it, and not only Wen Jiabao. &quot;Beijing wants to incorporate Taiwan into its influence. It&apos;s a comprehensive integration objective.&quot; Wen also laid out the budget for the world&apos;s third-largest economy, announcing that government spending would increase by a quarter to hit growth targets, but stopped short of a sought-after pledge to boost the country&apos;s 4 trillion yuan (\u00a34bn) stimulus package. Global markets rose yesterday amid speculation that such an announcement would be made. The boost in expenditure will see the Chinese deficit balloon to its highest level in 60 years, from 0.4% of national income last year to 3% this year. But the 950bn yuan deficit is still small in comparison to other countries, such as the US, where the deficit is more than 12% of income. &quot;The continuous drop in the economic growth rate due to the impact of the global financial crisis has become a major problem affecting the overall situation,&quot; Wen warned. The warning was in stark contrast to last year&apos;s speech, in which he said the main dangers facing the Chinese economy were inflation and overheating. While he has set the same growth target for many years in succession, analysts said the challenge this year would be to hit the 8% figure. In previous years, China has far exceeded it. &quot;Maintaining a certain growth rate for the economy is essential for expanding employment for urban and rural residents, increasing people&apos;s incomes and ensuring social stability,&quot; Wen said. Overall, the central government will increase spending by 24%, to 4.38 trillion yuan, while raising the limits for local government spending by nearly 25% to 6.1 trillion yuan.

Wen told the National People&apos;s Congress that government spending would increase by a quarter to hit the target of 8% growth. However he stopped short of a pledge to boost the country&apos;s 4tn yuan (\u00a34bn) stimulus package. Stockmarkets rose yesterday amid speculation that such an announcement would be made, and many fell back today after it became clear that no new package was forthcoming. The FTSE 100 dropped 63 points, or 1.75%, this morning. The boost in expenditure will see the Chinese deficit balloon to its highest level in 60 years, from 0.4% of national income last year to 3% this year. But the 950bn yuan deficit is still small in comparison to other countries, such as the US, where the deficit is more than 12% of income. &quot;The continuous drop in the economic growth rate due to the impact of the global financial crisis has become a major problem affecting the overall situation,&quot; Wen warned, in an address that also hinted at a peace deal with Taiwan. The warning was in stark contrast to last year&apos;s speech, in which he said the main dangers facing the Chinese economy were inflation and overheating. Analysts said China faced a challenge this year to hit the 8% target Wen has set for many years in succession. In previous years, China has far exceeded it. &quot;Maintaining a certain growth rate for the economy is essential for expanding employment for urban and rural residents, increasing people&apos;s incomes and ensuring social stability,&quot; Wen said. Overall, the central government will increase spending by 24%, to 4.38tn yuan, while raising the limits for local government spending by nearly 25% to 6.1tn yuan.

For film historian Law Kar, that price is a chicken curry at a Malaysian restaurant just around the corner from the Hong Kong Film Archive in Sai Wan Ho. &quot;If you buy me lunch, then I&apos;ll tell you everything I know - or everything I think I know,&quot; Law had promised, speaking down the phone from the archive. Hong Kong is this year celebrating its centenary of cinema - it has been 100 years since a comedic short entitled Stealing a Roast Duck became the first locally made production in 1909. The problem is, no proof remains that the film was ever actually made.  &quot;There is nothing left of anything produced before the second world war,&quot; Law explains, as we sit down to eat. &quot;The Japanese melted all the film stock down to extract the nitrate, so they could use it to make bombs.&quot; What we know about Stealing a Roast Duck is rudimentary: so rudimentary that some doubt the film ever even existed. The plot apparently followed a thief as he steals a duck from a street hawker, who then gives chase. It is believed the theatrically trained Liang Shaobo directed, using cameras borrowed from a Shanghai-based American cinema impresario named Benjamin Brodsky, and that the film starred Liang (as the thief), Wong Chun-man (the hawker) and Lai Buk-hoi (the policeman). &quot;When it comes to Stealing a Roast Duck, things are very general,&quot; says Law. &quot;All the people from back then are dead, so we have to look for other sources - newspapers and things. This means that there is a lot of argument over the film. What we know about the film is just a very brief storyline, told by [film-maker] Moon Kwan, who said he saw it in California in 1917, together with a film called Zhuangzi Tests His Wife. He said it was made in 1909 and then he told this to [film historian] Yu Mo-wan in the 1960s. So this is the original source.&quot; Of the film&apos;s participants, Lai Buk-hoi (as a producer) would go on to be the driving force behind the Hong Kong film industry for the next 50 years, starting studios and raising funds for feature films and documentaries. His son, Lai Tin-yau - now in his 70s - says he believes Stealing a Roast Duck was in fact made. &quot;From what I know, Brodsky funded that film,&quot; says Lai Tin-yau. &quot;It was working on that film that ignited my father&apos;s interest in film and took my father to Shanghai to learn how to make films properly.&quot; Not so certain is Lai Shek, also in his 70s and the son of Lai Man-wai, the man known as the Father of Hong Kong Cinema. &quot;I would say there are more references to Zhuangzi Tests His Wife as being the first film,&quot; he says, when we meet in a Hong Kong cafe. &quot;It was made in 1913 and my father marked that film and that year in his diary, which I still have.&quot; And so the debate will continue. But Law, for one, seems unconcerned. Any talk about Hong Kong cinema is good talk, he says. &quot;And 1909 is as good a place to start as any,&quot; he says. As he downs the last of his chicken curry, Law is finally ready to reveal his own thoughts on the matter. &quot;OK, here is my theory about how Stealing a Roast Duck might have been made - if it ever was,&quot; he says. &quot;I think Brodsky would have come to Hong Kong with his camera, perhaps to film some scenes for a newsreel or to just shoot some scenery. Then, somehow, he met Liang Shaobo and Lai Buk-hoi, who were engaged in staging plays.  &quot;So perhaps they just decided to shoot something, anything. And perhaps Brodsky paid them by buying them lunch afterwards. Perhaps Liang Shaobo and Lai Buk-hoi met this gweilo [foreigner] and thought, why not find out what this is about and afterwards, we can have a nice free meal.

They bided their time, nurtured their ideals and came to prominence in the decades following the second world war. Since then, modern architecture has passed up, down and through many aesthetic \u2013 &quot;form follows fashion&quot; \u2013 and economic hoops. Today, as architects of the global stature of Frank Gehry, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers lay off staff \u2013 half of them, in Gehry&apos;s case \u2013 the mantra ringing through their minds is very probably &quot;form follows finance&quot;. Just look at the extraordinary worldwide construction boom of the past decade. Entire cities \u2013 London, Leeds, downtown Los Angeles, Berlin, Beijing and Shanghai \u2013 have grown, changed shape and shot up into the sky in a gung-ho manner that makes some of them almost unrecognisable from the way they were such a short while ago. As the good times rolled with the madcap antics of international banking and promiscuous credit, the very shape of so much architecture and so many buildings began to change. Out went austere or ascetic minimalism, and in came a kaledeiscopic, cinematic new architecture featuring the fecund talents of the likes of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and Rem Koolhaas, together with a host of younger architects for whom form appeared to follow fancy \u2013 although, in reality, it was following in the wake of a colossal economic boom. Alongside this urgent flowering of sensational new design, came wave after wave of new skyscrapers. Bigger. Faster. Stronger. Shinier. By the time recession hit home late last year, there were plans afoot to hide what remained of the old City of London in a forest of new office towers, supported by both the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, and by his successor, Boris Johnson. There were plans to do much the same in Paris, with President Sarkozy actively promoting a new generation of towers for which the word &quot;bling&quot; would be too be too posh by half. Chicago was to have been dominated by a spiral skyscraper designed by the master of urban bling, Santiago Calatrava. And, so it went on. And, now? A break in construction, certainly, but after the deluge? What then? Of course, it&apos;s difficult to be sure of future developments in architecture, and yet there is a tendency for architectural action to be followed by reaction, and reaction by further reaction. The collapse of the British economy at the time of the oil crisis and three-day week of 1973-4, for example, spelled the end of straight-up-and-down modernist design, of public-sector architecture, concrete high-rise estates, concrete low-rise estates and Brutalism. A world that had been led by the heroes of post-war British modernists, among then Erno Goldfinger and Denys Lasdun, seemed to have come to a sudden stop. When the going got good again, postmodern design, all bright colours, visual jokes, architectural puns, allusions, elisions, illusions swept into view. Architects such as Terry Farrell popped up with comic relief in the form of his TV-am studios in Camden Town, or architecture in the guise of a knowing street urchin. Piers Gough and his team at CZWG let rip with zany apartment blocks in London&apos;s up-and-coming Docklands. Even the man who more or less invented architectural postmodernism, Robert &quot;less is a bore&quot; Venturi, was shipped in from the States, with his wife Denise Scott-Brown, to design the controversial new Sainsbury wing of the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. But, when the economy dipped again at the end of the 1980s, po-mo was out, and a new wave of expressive modernism, the &quot;iconic&quot; architecture, effectively took its place. So what now? Recessions are a time for architects to rethink their game. They need not despair \u2013 but, rather, regroup for the next boom. For a while, I think there may well be a reaction to the fireworks of the past decade. Architects such as the Tokyo practices of Toyo Ito and Sanaa (currently at work on the design of this summer&apos;s Serpentine Gallery pavilion in Kensington Gardens) point to one highly inventive, yet gentle future. Equally, there may well be a return \u2013 up to a point \u2013 in public architecture and design. Indeed, government investment in building might even be necessary to help kick-start the UK economy in the months ahead. Schools. Hospitals. Colleges. Training centres. All of these would require architects to think outside of the &quot;iconic&quot; box. Commercial skyscrapers and big-name museums and galleries have been flashy in recent years to draw maximum attention to themselves and to their promoters. This wouldn&apos;t be necessary, or even desirable, in the case of clinics and schools. A new modesty, then? Yes, for a while. But, when the wheel of fortune turns up again, expect a reaction to the New Modesty. Expect, at the very least, a Modesty Blaze, and then new forms of architecture that those being made redundant from their jobs, and those about to leave architecture school, are only beginning to formulate. And, by the way, applications to British architecture schools have never been higher. Architecture, more than most arts, requires, and even demands, optimism even in the face of the most severe economic downturns. The Empire State building began to rise the very moment Wall Street crashed. Depression has not, after a shaky financial start, hindered its rise into the firmament of all-time architectural wonders.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-06T17:22:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/07/orthodox-judaism", "sentences": ["In 1941 a group of rabbis and their students arrived in Japanese-controlled Shanghai."], "title": "Face to faith: orthodox judaism", "article": "In 1941 a group of rabbis and their students arrived in Japanese-controlled Shanghai. They were refugees from one of eastern Europe&apos;s most renowned yeshivas (Talmudic academies) from Mir, now in Belarus. At the outbreak of the second world war they had fled to Lithuania, but as the threat of the Nazis loomed they moved once again, settling briefly in Kobe, Japan, before seeing out the rest of the war in China. Now based in Jerusalem, the Mir Yeshiva is a thriving institution with thousands of students, including some from Britain; there is also a branch in New York. But its survival and success tell a larger story. The Holocaust wiped out almost all the seats of traditional Orthodox learning in Europe, so much so that it must have seemed that the devout forms of Judaism they inculcated would vanish before long. Instead, the old yeshivas were revived in Israel and America, and there are more advanced Talmudic students now than probably at any time in Jewish history.  The recovery of the strictly Orthodox, or Haredim - meaning &quot;God-fearing&quot; - is one of the most remarkable features of Judaism over the past half-century. The Haredim are the most rapidly expanding part of the Jewish world. It is estimated that nearly a third of all elementary schoolchildren in Israel will be in Haredi institutions within three years. In the UK, the Haredim have moved from being a small minority once considered on the margins of Anglo-Jewish society to an increasingly visible presence. With large families of often six or more children, they are growing at around 4% annually, concentrated largely in Stamford Hill and Golders Green in north London, Prestwich, Manchester and Gateshead, location of an internationally respected yeshiva. One in three Jewish children under 18 in Britain is strictly Orthodox, according to the most recent survey. Overall, the British Jewish population has dropped from over 400,000 in the 1950s to under 300,000 now. If the Haredim maintain their growth - while other Jewish streams continue to decline through assimiliation, low birth rates or emigration - they are likely to form a majority here within a couple of generations. The Haredim do not comprise a single sect; they are made up of various Hassidic and non-Hassidic groups, some with a more mystical bent, some more worldly than others. But they share a belief that only the most stringent religious lifestyle can guarantee Jewish survival. Whereas the Chief Rabbi&apos;s more modern style of Orthodoxy can allow him to make YouTube videos or liberally quote western thinkers in his writings, the Haredim are far warier of secular culture, frowning on such distractions as television or the free-thinking openness of the university.  While most British Jews would struggle to read a page of the Bible without the aid of a translation, the Haredim are characterised by the intensity with which they cleave to the study of the Torah and the vast corpus of rabbinic law and commentary built upon it.  The Haredim today suffer little defection from their ranks, while a survey in the mid-90s showed that more than half the children of Reform and Liberal Jews in the UK did not belong to a synagogue. A century ago, one of the founders of British Liberal Judaism, Claude Montefiore, could declare: &quot;The traditional conception of Judaism, both in theory and in practice, is, we think, doomed.&quot; No one could be quite so confident now. Reform Judaism arose in the 19th century in an attempt to adapt Judaism in the wake of the Enlightenment. But the Haredim stood firm, following the motto of the influential central European rabbi Moses Sofer (1762-1839) that &quot;The new is forbidden&quot;. In their rising numbers they must see a vindication of their way of life. The renaissance of the strictly Orthodox poses a wider question: could it be that only the most traditionalist forms of religion possess the inner resolve to withstand the challenge of secularism? \u2022 Simon Rocker is a journalist with the Jewish Chronicle", "tags": ["Judaism", "Religion"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-07T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/08/credit-crunch-mbas", "sentences": ["Perhaps more significantly, a Chinese school, the Shanghai-based Ceibs, made it into the top 10."], "title": "Who taught them greed is good: are MBA course to blame", "article": "When the former bosses of HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland were called before the Treasury select committee a month ago to explain exactly how their institutions got into the current mess, one question concerned formal banking qualifications. Just one of the four possessed anything remotely relevant: the Harvard MBA earned by Andy Hornby, the deposed HBOS chief executive. Harvard MBAs are usually worn as a badge of pride, especially when, as with Hornby, you graduate as the top student in your year. But as the debris settles from the worldwide collapse in credit and banking confidence and the reckoning begins on who exactly led the financial system into chaos, an increasing number of fingers are being pointed at leading business schools. Similar arguments have been made before, most recently when US energy giant Enron imploded amid a mountain of concealed debt, a scandal stewarded by another Harvard alumnus, Jeffrey Skilling. Too many MBA programmes, the simplified version goes, draw in young, greedy types with little business experience and indoctrinate them with half-baked management and finance theories, along with an unshakeable belief in their own talents, before sending them out to earn ill-deserved fortunes in investment banking and consulting. This is, of course, a gross caricature. But the turmoil has shaken business schools, many of which are devising courses to examine what went wrong. Professors are pondering whether the theories they taught played a role. Mauro F Guillen, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania&apos;s Wharton school, organised a hastily-arranged programme of lectures examining the economic woes, which started in January. More than 250 students swiftly signed up. &quot;I think we are trying to come to terms with this reality that almost nobody predicted,&quot; he said. While Guillen believes corporate leadership failures were principally to blame, he concedes regret: &quot;We didn&apos;t ring the bell. It&apos;s very easy for me to say in hindsight, &apos;I wish I&apos;d emphasised the idea that leadership and compensation systems can produce these perverse and negative effects&apos;. But I don&apos;t think this has been an ethical issue. The problem was people were on auto-pilot, taking on enormous risks to meet certain targets.&quot; Others argue for nothing short of a complete re-evaluation of how business schools teach and the values they impart. Last October Ken Starkey, a professor at Nottingham University&apos;s business school, wrote a letter to the Financial Times calling for courses to take a broader view and end their current &quot;fixation on markets and individualism (ie, greed and selfishness)&quot;. Simon Learmount, deputy head of the MBA at Cambridge University&apos;s Judge school, has just returned from a gathering of school leaders and MBA programme directors in San Francisco. Many discussions, he said, centred on how schools can focus on social accountability and collaboration. &quot;It&apos;s probably too early to say schools are having a fundamental rethink, but it&apos;s absolutely in the air,&quot; he said. &quot;I won&apos;t mention them by name, but certain other business schools have very strongly fostered that kind of individualistic ethos, the heroic business person going out and slashing costs, increasing value for shareholders. It&apos;s a possibly unfair caricature, but it&apos;s out there.&quot; Chris McKenna, director of the MBA programme at Oxford University&apos;s Sa\u00efd business school, says it is hard to blame students for taking lucrative finance jobs, not least when they face debts from courses costing as much as \u00a345,000. &quot;There were so many jobs and they were so lucrative that when people took an MBA it felt sort of ridiculous not to take a banking job. Why do anything else when there was so much money on the table? I think we&apos;re now seeing a shift to people asking what it is they really want to do. They&apos;re going back to their dreams - at least I hope they are.&quot; One professor with a particular insight into the internal musings of MBA students is Srikumar Rao, who has taught an MBA elective at London Business School, as well as schools in the US, with the grand title of Creativity and Personal Mastery. It requires students to plough through a reading list ranging from PG Wodehouse to books on Zen and quantum physics before addressing whether they even want to spend their lives working 15-hour days in the pursuit of riches. Rao says he is now encountering people &quot;more ready to speak their minds. They are much more reflective. In fact, many have turned down offers at high-prestige firms in favour of asking, &apos;What can I do that really brings meaning to my life?&apos;.&quot; Unusually for a business school professor, Rao expresses serious misgivings about the fundamental ethos of such institutions: &quot;Our top business schools are really not education institutions, they are indoctrination institutions. There are certain things which are so much dogma that you don&apos;t even want to encourage any challenge to them - the primacy and efficiency of markets, maximising shareholder value. These things are not in question.&quot; He believes that notions developed in business schools such as agency theory, which argues that the managers&apos; interests and those of their shareholders need to be aligned through devices such as stock options, have created a world of short-term profits in which executives gorge on bonuses. Someone else with a broad perspective is Derek Walker, new head of recruitment at the Sa\u00efd school, who formerly sat on the other side of the fence employing business school graduates for Barclays Capital and others. He believes that sweeping condemnations are unhelpful. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt the current environment will make everybody sit up and think carefully about how they go about doing what they do in the future,&quot; he said. &quot;But it would be na\u00efve if not inaccurate to say, &apos;Well, it&apos;s all the fault of the business schools because they&apos;re the people who teach business theories&apos;.&quot; Starting in 1881 The first business school in the modern sense was Wharton, founded in 1881, with the first MBAs awarded around 30 years later at Harvard. America still dominates the field , though a handful of overseas institutions are chasing hard. The 2009 edition of the Financial Times MBA league table, generally seen as the most authoritative, placed London Business School (LBS) joint top with Wharton, a first for a non-US school. Perhaps more significantly, a Chinese school, the Shanghai-based Ceibs, made it into the top 10. Many MBA programmes are broadly similar, the uniform flavour increased by the global intake; at LBS 90% of the MBA intake can typically come from outside the UK. While many British MBA courses contain a smattering of people from public administration or government, in America these tend to study separately at places like Harvard&apos;s Kennedy centre for government.", "tags": ["Credit crunch", "MBAs", "Business", "Education", "Training and courses"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-08T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/09/film-picks", "sentences": ["Chow stars as slacker Sing, whose ambition to join the infamous Axe Gang in 1940s Shanghai leads him into trouble in Pig Sty Alley."], "title": "Film picks: In Bruges, Kung Fu Hustle, Basic Instinct", "article": "In Bruges10pm, Sky Movies Premiere(Martin McDonagh, 2008)  Professional hitmen Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) hang out in medieval Bruges while the heat from a botched job dies down: Ken aborbs the culture, Ray champs at the bit in the most boring place in the world.

The consumer price index dropped 1.6% year-on-year, the National Statistics Bureau reported today. But in part that reflected high prices in February 2008 - when inflation peaked at a 12-year high of 8.7%, some of that due to farming problems. A 1.9% fall in food prices and declines in global commodity prices helped to drag the index down last month. Some economists also suggested that prices had fallen as manufacturers sought to shift excess capacity. But the figure underlines the shift in the Chinese economy. Last spring the government&apos;s biggest concern was overheating and inflation; this year it is fighting to shore up growth. &quot;Deflation is the symptom of a weak real economy and industrial overcapacity, which has left companies with little pricing power,&quot; Jing Ulrich, JP Morgan&apos;s chairwoman of China equities, said in a report. She suggested it would be a temporary phenomenon, but added that further interest rate cuts and changes to the reserve ratio could be made, and further measures to stimulate consumption. Andy Xie, an independent Shanghai-based economist, told the Associated Press: &quot;Inventories are being discounted. Once the inventories are sold prices will begin to rise again.&quot; The National Bureau of Statistics said declining commodity prices were only now feeding through to consumers. It pointed out that global natural resource prices, mainly crude oil, fell 48.8% year-on-year. That also accelerated the decline in producer prices (PPI), which fell by 4.5% in the year to February - compared with 3.3% in the year to January - the bureau said today. It added in a statement that the falls in the indices &quot;should not be interpreted as a sign of deflation&quot;, adding that the statistical effect of last year&apos;s high inflation would have been to drive down the CPI figure by 2.5%, even if prices had not changed between the end of 2008 and February. But others are concerned that excess production capacity and depressed global demand could lead to increased deflationary pressures. &quot;I worry about PPI.

But today as millions of Chinese people seek to reinforce the barrier on National Tree-Planting Day, the greater threat comes from within, as a result of an unsustainable demand for wood. Every March 12 an estimated 3m party members, civil servants, model workers, and state leaders take up shovels for the country&apos;s biggest green propaganda event. As well as raising awareness, they are fulfilling a legal duty for everyone over the age of eleven to plant at least three Poplar, Eucalyptus, Larch or other saplings every year. Many are planted in the northern shelterbelt, also known as the Great Green Wall. Initiated in 1978, the tree belt is supposed to stretch 4,480 km from western Xinjiang to eastern Heilongjiang to protect cities and cropland from floods and the desert. If the plan is completed as scheduled in 2050, trees will cover over 400m hectares or 42% of China&apos;s landmass, creating arguably the biggest man-made carbon sponge on the planet. China overtook the US as the largest carbon emitter in 2007, although its greenhouse gas emissions per capita are still much lower. But the mind-boggling statistics mask a calamitous decline of China&apos;s forest quality, diminishing biodiversity and extra pressure on woodland overseas to satisfy an appetite for timber that has \u2013 until the economic crisis - grown enormously in the past 10 years. At Yichun, a north-eastern city in Heilongjiang province close to the frozen river border with Siberia, the forests were once so dense that the area was known as the Great Northern Wilderness. But more than fifty years of unsustainable logging have taken their toll. Yichun was classified last year as one of China&apos;s 12 &quot;resource-depleted cities.&quot; &quot;We are in a situation where we have no wood to cut. None of the forests are mature enough,&quot; Dong Zhiyong, former vice-minister in the forestry administration said. The dire environmental consequences have been apparent for more than a decade now. The loss of forest and grass cover has exposed the soil to erosion and led to dust storms. With fewer trees to retain water, Heilongjiang has suffered devastating floods. The government has tightened logging restrictions and increased reforestation efforts, including aerial seeding of remote areas. Lumberjacks in Yichun have been told that they must soon lay down their chainsaws. Hou Zhengkuan accepted change was inevitable. &quot;The forests are thinning. There are fewer and fewer trees. The whole mountain will be closed off in two years.&quot; To create alternative jobs, the nearby town of Tangwanghe was named late last year as China&apos;s first national park, loosely modelled on Yellowstone in the United States. &quot;We are pioneers. The idea is to protect the ecosystem on a large scale, develop seven tourist sites and to help local people get rich,&quot; explains the town&apos;s young tourist chief, Ma Shengli. But apart from a few small birds, there is little sign of wildlife. The main attractions of the park are granite formations with colourful names, such as Kissing Boulders, Drunken Tortoise and Pine Teasing Golden Toad. The decline of biodiversity is a problem across China. Although tree coverage has increased from 12% to 18% of the nation&apos;s land area, many saplings are planted in semi-desert areas where they deplete water supplies. Even in Heilongjiang, the amount of life underneath the canopies is declining as a result of over-hunting, fungus-and-herb gathering and the tendency of foresters to replace old growth forests with blocks of fast-growing trees. &quot;China plants more trees than the rest of the world combined,&quot; says John McKinnon, the head of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme. &quot;But the trouble is they tend to be monoculture plantations. They are not places where birds want to live.&quot; The vulnerability of the new forest stock was evident last year when winter storms destroyed 10% of these thin barriers. The World Bank has advised China to concentrate more on quality than quantity. But it will take decades. There is almost no old-growth left in China. Until the economic crisis, the global demand for wood rose sharply. The biggest consumer was China. Since domestic logging was restricted in 1998, the volume of wood entering China has risen ninefold. Some is processed for overseas markets, but most logs are consumed domestically for construction timber. This demand has accelerated illegal deforestation in South America, Africa and Indonesia. The biggest supplier by far is Russia, which provides 60% of the logs that come into China. As buildings go up in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing, the vast Taiga boreal forests of Siberia are being flattened. At current harvesting rates, the Russian far east could be logged out in 20 years, according to a study by the Beijing Forestry University. The economic crisis could help. Forestry officials and processing firms say demand for wood is plummeting though it is too early to say how far. In the meantime, China hopes to ease the sand storms and its carbon guilt by mass campaigns. At Tangwanghe, the ground is still frozen too hard for locals to join in National Tree Planting Day, but they will catch up after the spring thaw. This year, the local governments plans to plant 750,000 trees in the mountains and 1,500 in the town to spruce up the streets for the hoped-for influx of tourists. Although tree-planting is a civic duty, the new National Park will pay former loggers to do the job. &quot;Forestry is our business,&quot; says the tourist chief Ma. &quot;Voluntary tree planting doesn&apos;t really work. You see that every year. It&apos;s all for show.&quot; &lt;h2&gt;Biodiversity vs carbon absorbtion&lt;h2&gt; Although it was initially conceived as a barrier against the desert, China&apos;s Great Green Wall is increasingly used as a defence against accusations of climate change irresponsibility. The mass tree-planting required for this and other projects has given China the biggest artificial forest in the world, covering more than 500,000 square kilometres, or twice the size of Britain. While blocks of monoculture tree plantations are criticised as a disaster for biodiversity, the country&apos;s forestry scientists argue they are far more effective at absorbing carbon than old, slow-growth forests. Zhang Xudong, of the China Academy of Forestry, says fast-growing poplar and white birch capture as much as double the amount of carbon as Korean pine, larch and firs. He claims China&apos;s 175m hectares of forests more than offset the country&apos;s 1.6bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year. The claim is likely to be contended given uncertainties about the amount of China&apos;s emissions and definitions of forested land. The government includes \u00a0nurseries and shrubland with very few trees. The balance between forest sequestration capacity and carbon output is also likely to change if China meets its goal to more than double the size of its economy by 2020. &quot;Given that China has large areas of forest, and trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, forest preservation and reforestation can clearly play an important short-term role in climate change mitigation. Of course, forest carbon sinks are no longer-term substitute for reductions in fossil-fuel emissions as there is not enough land in China or elsewhere to plant enough trees to mitigate emissions and avoid danergous climate change,&quot; said Dr Simon Lewis, University of Leeds. Chinese conservationists say the emphasis on forests as mere carbon sinks is wrong. &quot;The west is too focused on carbon. People there have lost sight of the need to protect bio-diversity,&quot; warned a prominent environmentalist.", "tags": ["Trees and forests", "Deforestation", "Environment", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-11T14:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/11/osullivan-ronnie-snooker-world-championships", "sentences": ["Most of the black people in the UK will tune in because they&apos;ve never seen a black guy at the Crucible before.&quot; The other newcomers are Martin Gould, a part-time croupier with a win over Hendry to his credit this season, Andrew Higginson, for whom it will be his most prominent appearance since his surprise run to the 2007 Welsh Open final and Ricky Walden, winner of August&apos;s Shanghai Masters, who has an attractive first round match against Mark Selby, the runner-up two years ago."], "title": "Snooker: Stephen Maguire and Jamie Burnett have been drawn to meet in world championship first round", "article": "The draw for the world championship, which starts at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, on 18 April, has brought together Stephen Maguire and Jamie Burnett, whose match in December&apos;s UK Championship is under investigation by both the gambling commission and the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.

After coming through his last qualifying match this week, Burnett accepted that he would be the focus of unwanted attention but categorically denied any wrongdoing. &quot;As far as the investigation is going, I don&apos;t have any comment to make but it is hard not to think about it because everyone wants to talk about it and it&apos;s the last thing I want to talk about,&quot; said Burnett, the world No45, whose fine form since Christmas has included a hat-trick of centuries in qualifying for the Welsh Open. &quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned, it was a snooker match and I lost and that&apos;s the end of it. When I&apos;m playing snooker I&apos;m fine, I don&apos;t think about it, but off the table that&apos;s all people want to talk about. &quot;It&apos;s getting to be a pain in the backside but I don&apos;t see it as my problem. I don&apos;t have anything to answer for because I haven&apos;t done anything. World snooker can investigate it all they like. As I said at the time, if they want to speak to me they know where I am. It&apos;s down to them.&quot; The Gambling Commission&apos;s enquiries, not only into the Maguire v Burnett match but into the 5\u20130 defeat of Peter Ebdon by Liang Wenbo in August&apos;s Northern Ireland Trophy, another scoreline which attracted substantial betting support, are not expected to be completed before the championship but are taking precedence over the WPBSA&apos;s. The pick of the first-round matches at the Crucible brings together two former champions, Stephen Hendry, who has lifted the 82-year-old trophy seven times, and Mark Williams, who has done so twice. Hendry, whose run to the semi-finals of November&apos;s Bahrain Open is his only notable finish this season, has sunk to 12th in the provisional rankings while Williams, who started the season 22nd, has recovered to 14th. Steve Davis, six-times champion in the 80s, who is drawn against Australia&apos;s Neil Robertson, will be competing at the Crucible for the 29th time but two other former champions, Ken Docherty and John Parrott, casualties of the qualifying competition, will be restricted to BBC punditry duties. Rory McLeod, the world No44 from Wellingborough, will be one of four newcomers to the Crucible and is proud to be &quot;making history&quot; as its first black competitor: &quot;It&apos;s brilliant for snooker and it should be good for viewing figures.

Mohammed Hanif was a much easier choice, the judges said, for the first book category. He emerged quickly as clear favourite for his novel A Case of Exploding Mangoes, a darkly comic tour de force which takes as its starting point the plane crash which killed Pakistan&apos;s military dictator General Zia ul Haq. Praised for its &quot;amazingly detailed and plausible portrayal of historical events&quot;, as well as its &quot;great political insight and stylistic virtuosity&quot;, the novel is the first Pakistani book to be a regional winner.\u00a0 Hanif said he was &quot;especially pleased&quot; to win the prize, particularly given the strength of his fellow nominees, who included Sulaiman Addonia for The Consequences of Love, and Joe Dunthorne for\u00a0Submarine.

It emerged today that a Delta Airlines flight avoided disaster in November after encountering the same problems that forced a British Airways Boeing 777 to crash-land at Heathrow airport on 17 January. Peter Burkill, the pilot, was hailed as a hero after steering flight BA38 into Heathrow after losing power in both engines on approach. Thirteen passengers were injured but there were no fatalities among the 152 people on board. The Delta aeroplane, travelling from Shanghai to Atlanta, was flying over Montana on 26 November when it experienced a sudden &quot;rollback&quot;, or decrease in power, in its righthand engine due to fuel icing. The pilots restored power using safety instructions issued by Boeing after the Heathrow crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US has warned there is a &quot;high probability&quot; of it happening again. This afternoon its UK counterpart, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, called for a probe into fuel icing after warning that industry guidance on the problem was based on 50-year-old research. British Airways has 15 out of the 220 Boeing 777-200 planes worldwide that use the engine, known as the Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800. &quot;With two of these rollback events occurring within a year, we believe that there is a high probability of something similar happening again,&quot; said the NTSB acting chairman, Mark Rosenker. Rolls-Royce has said it expects to have a redesigned engine component ready within 12 months. Rosenker said: &quot;We are encouraged to see that Rolls-Royce is already working on a redesign.&quot; The AAIB report, which followed the NTSB&apos;s urgent safety recommendation, makes five recommendations, including: \u2022 A study into using anti-icing liquids in fuel for passenger aircraft. \u2022 An investigation by US and EU authorities into why ice forms in aviation fuel. \u2022 A probe by the same bodies into why ice forms in the planes&apos; fuel systems. In a second interim report into the Heathrow crash published this afternoon, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said &quot;soft ice&quot; had accumulated in the pipes that feed fuel into the aircraft engines. The ice, possibly formed as the plane flew in low temperatures over Siberia, could have been dislodged as the pilots sought an increase in thrust shortly before landing. Turbulence, shift in the pitch of the aircraft and temperature changes in engine components were also singled out as possible contributors. The AAIB said it was possible that the ice was then flushed into the fuel oil heat exchanger, which warms plane fuel before it is injected into the engines, and subsequently blocked the plane&apos;s fuel supply just as it required more thrust to land. Anti-icing additives are used in fuel by the military and some business jet operators. The AAIB asked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US and the European Aviation Safety Agency to carry out the tests. &quot;Much of the current industry guidance is based on research undertaken over 50 years ago and since that time civil aircraft have become larger, fly for longer periods and incorporate new technology and materials. &quot;In order to improve guidelines for the design and testing of aircraft fuel systems it will be necessary for the aviation industry, led by the regulatory authorities, to undertake a number of co\u2011ordinated research projects.&quot; A Rolls-Royce spokesman said the AAIB report on the BA accident clearly stated that the Rolls-Royce equipment met or exceeded all requirements. &quot;The report also highlights the emerging issue of ice build-up in commercial &apos;long-cold-high&apos; routes. This is an industry-wide issue which requires detailed research that is likely to shape future regulations and requirements.&quot; A spokesperson for British Airways said: &quot;We will work closely with the relevant authorities and will comply with requirements issued to all operators of Boeing 777s powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines.&quot; Boeing 777s used by major airlines American Airlines 47 Singapore Airlines 45 Cathay Pacific 17 BA 15 Malaysia Airlines 15 Thai Airways 14 Emirates 9 Delta 8 BOC Aviation (Asian leasing company) 6 El Al 6 Air New Zealand 4 Kenya Airways 4", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Transport", "UK news", "US news", "World news", "Air transport"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-12T17:11:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/13/little-mermaid-copenhagen-china", "sentences": ["But a decision last night by Copenhagen city council to use her as the centrepiece of a pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, from April to November next year, has caused consternation.", "The decision to send the statue to Shanghai came after 36 out of 50 members voted in favour of the plan."], "title": "Copenhagen's Little Mermaid heads to China", "article": "   The Little Mermaid is inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale. Photograph: Gavin Hellier/Getty    She sits alone on a rock looking longingly out to sea, but a controversial decision to send Copenhagen&apos;s beloved Little Mermaid to China is making waves in the Danish capital. Perched on a rock in the harbour at Langelinie, the statue, called Den Lille Havfrue in Danish, is one of Scandinavia&apos;s biggest tourist attractions. But a decision last night by Copenhagen city council to use her as the centrepiece of a pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, from April to November next year, has caused consternation. The council said it hoped her presence at the exposition, in the middle of a large pool of water taken from the harbour, would promote the capital abroad. But descendants of the mermaid&apos;s sculptor, Edvard Eriksen, said they were upset by the plan. Grandson Erling Eriksen told the Copenhagen Post: &quot;They called us over the summer to tell us about the plan. We said no and said they could make a copy and send it to China instead, but to our surprise they chose not to.&quot; He said tourists would be disappointed to find the statue missing from the waterfront. While the council owns the statue, Eriksen&apos;s descendants own the copyright. The decision to send the statue to Shanghai came after 36 out of 50 members voted in favour of the plan. But according to a poll, six out of 10 Danes would prefer the Little Mermaid to stay, the AFP news agency said. Pia Allerslev, the deputy mayor for culture, said: &quot;The Little Mermaid must remain in Copenhagen because it is her place and thousands of tourists will be terribly disappointed not to find her during her long eight-month [sic] absence.&quot; However, another member of the council, Hamid al-Mousti, defended the decision. &quot;[She] will not feel homesick on her long sea voyage because she will be in her natural element, bathed in water from the Copenhagen port,&quot; he said. Despite calls for the 1.2 metre-high (5ft) statue to remain at the harbour, she has not always been so loved. In 1964 her head was sawn off and stolen by political artists and a new head had to be made. In 1984 her right arm was sawn off and stolen, only to be returned days later. In 1998 her head was stolen again, before being anonymously returned to a television station. The Little Mermaid has suffered numerous coverings with paint and was blasted off the rock in 2003 with dynamite. Commissioned in 1909 by Carl Jacobsen, the son of the Carlsberg beer founder, the statue took its inspiration from the 1837 Hans Christian Andersen fairytale in which a mermaid falls in love with a prince and wishes to transform her tail into legs. The statue found its home in the harbour in 1913, but is actually a copy of an original held by Eriksen&apos;s descendants. Three other copies exist \u2013 two in the US states of California, Iowa, and one in Vancouver, Canada. Mike Lippert, a member of the pavilion consortium, told the Copenhagen Post that an alternative work was being considered while the mermaid was away. &quot;We are working with three Chinese sculptors to get their interpretation of the Little Mermaid. Their work will be displayed at Langelinie during the six months the statue is away,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Denmark", "China", "Copenhagen holidays", "World news", "Travel", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-13T10:54:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/16/national-cultural-heritage-india-china", "sentences": ["One way, perhaps, to renovate the frayed notion of shared global culture would be to establish a roving exhibit of world history and art, a &quot;moving museum&quot; that would take in not only western capitals, but places like a Mexico City and Rio, Lagos and Cairo, Mumbai and Shanghai."], "title": "Kanishk Tharoor: The problem of cultural property and resurgent nationalisms", "article": "India and China are increasingly spoken of in the same breath. As Europe and North America whisper of decline, Asia&apos;s &quot;rising giants&quot; seem convinced that the 21st century is theirs for the taking. The inelegant neologism &quot;Chindia&quot; has already stumbled into the lexicon of analysts and wonks, a measure of the combined heft of the countries&apos; political and economic ambitions. So it is not entirely surprising that in the less wonky realm of art, India and China can steal the show together.  In an auction in Paris in late February, a phone bidder won the rights to two bronze heads taken during the pillage of the Summer Palace near Beijing by French troops in 1860. A week later, the bidder, Cai Mingchao, a Chinese collector and campaigner, revealed in a press conference that he had no intention of paying for objects that &quot;belonged&quot; to China. Cai&apos;s &quot;sabotage&quot; provoked hot debate in China and in the west, and had the added effect of generating interest in another, simultaneous controversy over cultural property: the auction in New York of some of the personal effects of Mahatma Gandhi.  Though less contentious \u2013 an Indian businessman stepped in to buy the items and will gift them to the Indian government \u2013 the flap over Gandhi&apos;s belongings was not without drama of its own. Indian court injunctions, fraught negotiations, and impromptu kerbside press conferences all failed to halt the sale of the objects. Their former owner, Californian hippie James Otis, is now on a 23-day fast to &quot;cleanse his soul&quot; in penance for prompting such a global fuss.  Otis&apos;s conscience may soon be sparkling clean, but both controversies reveal the messy, volatile bounds of cultural property today. In our supposedly &quot;multipolar&quot; world, national sovereignty is back in vogue. Feuds like these are not isolated events, but are deeply connected to the buoyant nationalisms that threaten to define our age.  The furore around the Summer Palace bronze heads fits in a continuum of anger in China \u2013 from protests against western media last year to vociferous anti-Japanese marches \u2013 that while lambasting an external enemy, is really directed internally, with the aim of tapping and fomenting nationalist passions. There may be a perfectly legitimate argument for the repatriation of the pilfered bronzes. But by attempting to stoke anti-foreign outrage, Cai&apos;s publicity stunt seems more disingenuous than principled. Nationalisms anywhere in the world are generally prickly, jealous ideologies that tend to find their apotheosis in unsuspecting symbols. While Indians rightly deplored the sale in New York of Gandhi&apos;s glasses, the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi \u2013 which already houses a pair of his spectacles \u2013 receives very few visitors. There is a hypocrisy of interest here that is typical of nationalisms. The heritage of the nation matters only in moments of strife, when under apparent threat from the outside; otherwise, it is consigned to the dusty safety of platitudes and indifference.  But as distasteful and disproportionate as they may be, modern nationalisms can also be in the right. European societies have slowly but steadily come to terms with the excesses of their imperial pasts. The possession of countless non-western artefacts \u2013 often extracted through blatant theft and smuggling \u2013 is part of that legacy. It is not unreasonable to ask westerners to grapple with the moral aspects of the problem of cultural property (and not just its legal dimensions, which cannot reconcile the full contours of the issue): do we have more right to the objects of &quot;others&quot; than the &quot;others&quot; do? India and China are at the forefront of what Fareed Zakaria terms the &quot;rise of the rest&quot;, a waning of European and north American pre-eminence as other non-western countries assert themselves on the international stage. That many of these nations will increasingly attempt to regain their patrimony from the west is unsurprising and in keeping with a more equal world. It isn&apos;t merely petty nationalism that seeks, for example, the return to India of the Koh-I-Noor diamond in the crown jewels, but a real and undeniable sense of past injustice and, just as importantly, strength and confidence in the present. Of course, the great museums of Paris, New York and London will not be turned overnight (or ever) into quaint, parochial warehouses of national heritage, stripped of the relics of other places. But the static &quot;world museum&quot; seems all the more anachronistic in this post-imperial age. The universal pretensions of places like the British Museum, the Louvre, and the Met in New York are lofty and idealistic, but remain testaments of misappropriation, power, and conquest.  In a time of resurgent nationalisms, how do we resuscitate the universal ideal that the heritage of others is the heritage of all? Oddly, a good suggestion came from the flighty mind of James Otis, the erstwhile owner of Gandhi&apos;s effects. Otis asked the Indian government to sponsor him on a 78-country tour so that he could take the teachings of the Mahatma on the road.

Chinese producers are attempting to transform Das Kapital from a hefty treatise on political economy into a popular stage show, complete with catchy tunes and nifty footwork. Whether Karl Marx would approve of his masterwork being served up as entertainment for China&apos;s new bourgeoisie is a matter of speculation. But the director He Nian \u2013 best known for his stage adaptation of a martial-arts spoof \u2013 has promised to unite elements from Broadway musicals and Las Vegas shows in a hip, interesting and educational play featuring a live band, singing and dancing. &quot;The particular performance style we choose is not important, but Marx&apos;s theories cannot be distorted,&quot; he said sternly, in an interview with the Wen Hui Bao newspaper. Zhang Jun, an economics professor at Shanghai&apos;s prestigious Fudan University, is being drafted in to ensure the production is intellectually rigorous. The director said the play, which is to open next year, will be set in a company and will document the progress of its workers. In the first half they realise their boss is exploiting them and begin to understand the theory of surplus value. But far from uniting, as Marx enjoined them in the Communist Manifesto, some continue to work as before, some mutiny and others employ collective bargaining. Yang Shaolin, the general manager of the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre, said that in the past it would have been difficult to imagine Das Kapital adapted into a play with &quot;main characters, major dramatic elements, and profound educational meaning&quot;, but that it was now possible thanks to the flourishing of different styles in Chinese theatre. Even so, the producers face a tough challenge. True, the social criticism of Marx&apos;s 19th century contemporaries Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo has been transmuted into two hugely successful all-singing, all-dancing musicals \u2013 Oliver! and Les Miserables. But unlike the novels on which those were based, Das Kapital has never been noted for its vivid characterisation or gripping plot. There is some precedent for the new production. A Japanese writer and translator is said to have adapted Das Kapital for the stage in the 1930s, and the result was subsequently translated into Chinese. Three years ago a German theatre group had another bash. But despite an added inducement to attend \u2013 a copy of Volume 23 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels for each theatre-goer \u2013 the Suddeutsche Zeitung described it as mostly &quot;something of a lecture \u2026 at times dry and boring&quot;.", "tags": ["China", "Musicals", "Theatre", "Stage", "Politics", "Books", "Philosophy", "Culture", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-17T08:22:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/mar/17/asian-champions-league-reorganisation", "sentences": ["The launch of the 2009 Asian Champions League was supposed to usher in a new era of professionalism, which meant Asian Football Confederation (AFC) officials weren&apos;t too impressed when they arrived at Shanghai&apos;s Hongkou Stadium last week to find a lingerie exhibition in full swing before Shanghai Shenhua were due to host Singapore Armed Forces in the opening round.", "The Shanghai players were oblivious, relaxed by watching the new film Valkyrie, and went on to win 4-1."], "title": "Football: The Asian Football Confederation has laid down the law as it tries to raise the Asian Champions League's standing in the game", "article": "The launch of the 2009 Asian Champions League was supposed to usher in a new era of professionalism, which meant Asian Football Confederation (AFC) officials weren&apos;t too impressed when they arrived at Shanghai&apos;s Hongkou Stadium last week to find a lingerie exhibition in full swing before Shanghai Shenhua were due to host Singapore Armed Forces in the opening round. Threats of suspensions sounded among the suspenders and the next day dawned with no sexy underwear in sight. The Shanghai players were oblivious, relaxed by watching the new film Valkyrie, and went on to win 4-1. The incident was minor but it highlights the challenges facing the league to realise the goal of AFC president Mohammad Bin Hamman, who believes it will be competing with its European bigger brother within 10 years. It won&apos;t be easy. The tournament has struggled since its inception in 2003 \u2013 before which it was known as the &quot;Asian Club Championship&quot;. While there are fierce rivalries at national-team level, the arrival of a Saudi club in Tokyo or a Korean side in Dubai means little to many who still have the Uefa version in mind when they talk about the Champions League. It is not all the fans&apos; fault. Some clubs, especially in the Far East, were initially reluctant to put in the time and effort \u2013 and a midweek clash in Asia can cost a great deal of both \u2013 for winning a competition that until this year netted just $600,000. That was for the winners, most others were left out of pocket. Only three years ago, Korea&apos;s Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors even wanted to quit in order to cut costs, but a hefty withdrawal fine blocked the Motors&apos; exit. They stayed, won the whole thing and Hyundai executives were soon drooling over showing their brand at the Fifa Club World Cup, a carrot introduced in 2005. The idea behind it was to make the trophy more attractive to previously lukewarm J-League sides. Urawa Reds were the first team to give it a serious go. The club, one that has excelled at marketing longer than it has on the pitch, regularly attracts 50,000 fans to home games and their win in 2007 gave the ACL the credibility and iconic images it needed. Now the AFC is trying to move the tournament to the next level. First, it has a new format this season: 32 teams in eight groups of four, with east and west Asia separated until the knockout stage and two teams instead of one progressing to the next round. The governing body, tired of the way some clubs operate (expulsions for failing to submit player registrations on time were annual events), has become ruthless. Each league was evaluated on criteria that ranged from the quality of the stadiums and marketing to the proximity of international airports. Japan was the only A-grade student, followed by South Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. The &quot;Big Five&quot; were given four spots each (UAE have three plus one qualifier). Australia, Uzbekistan and Qatar have two, with Indonesia allowed one. A club each from Singapore, India, Vietnam and Thailand can try the play-offs. With only 10 out of 46 members having automatic entry, it leaves the European version looking positively egalitarian and, unlike Uefa&apos;s co-efficient ranking, it has little to do with past performances. But for the AFC it creates a core that can drive standards forward. It has started well. This season features the first ever professional league in UAE, and Australia&apos;s A League will expand from eight to 10 teams. Japan, China and Korea have 18, 16 and 15 top-flight teams respectively and are developing extensive lower league networks. In attendance terms, more people are watching the J-league than the Eredivisie, while the Chinese Super League and the K-league outdraw Portugal and Belgium. There is big investment in Uzbekistan and rumours that in Iran some clubs will be moved out of public and into private control. Money also helps encourage the teams and in 2009 the Asian champions will collect around $1.5m. It may be small beer compared to Europe&apos;s offerings, but it is a big step. Asia also boasts a much richer competition than the European version. Only one quarter-finalist from 2005 made it to the knockout stage in 2006 (with the exception of the holders who got a bye \u2013 a practice now rightly abolished). The same happened in 2007 and 2008. Yet this may not help increase interest in the league. For television in Asia, familiarity breeds content as rivalries and stars need to be developed if Europhiles (often dismissive of their local leagues) are to be persuaded that Asia is exciting \u2013 although fortunately time differences mean that televised AFC and Uefa games don&apos;t clash. Gamba Osaka&apos;s win in 2008 helped to put Yasuhito Endo on the map but more of the same is needed, such as expanding representation from the &quot;Big Five&quot; so 2009 stars return in the future. These stars light the way forward and their status will be helped by the start of an intra-continental transfer market. This year has seen most Asian nations adopt the &quot;3 plus 1 rule&quot;. Leagues limit the number of foreign players to three per team, now they can sign one more \u2013 provided he comes from an AFC member. It is early days but Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Australian stars are now moving around Asia. With two Chinese teams losing in Japan last week, Beijing media seized upon the exploits of Li Weifeng. The one-time (literally) Everton defender starred as the K-league&apos;s Suwon thrashed the Japanese champions, Kashima Antlers, 4-1. For the first time in Korea, interest was shown in the western region of the group stage thanks to Fulham&apos;s loan of Seol Ki-hyeon to Saudi Arabia&apos;s Al Hilal. A few world stars who aren&apos;t approaching imminent retirement wouldn&apos;t go amiss either. With oil-rich clubs in the west and eastern outfits with links to big business, the money is potentially there for the right big name. In recent years, however, it just hasn&apos;t happened. Ageing stars such as Gabriel Batistuta and the De Boers liked the sunshine, the gentle schedules, the proximity to Europe and the expat life in the Gulf \u2013 more &quot;professional&quot; regimes may not appeal. It is harder to tempt footballers to the more distant, colder and, both on the pitch and off, more frantic eastern regions. More players are needed and not just for marketing purposes. Asian teams don&apos;t usually have the strength in depth to sustain challenges at home and abroad. When Urawa won in 2007, they promptly collapsed with exhaustion and, over the final five games of the J-League season, lost a 10-point lead and the title. 2006 winners Jeonbuk finished 11th in Korea and Gamba Osaka managed eighth. Japanese clubs are again the favourites, with South Korean teams such as Suwon Bluewings and FC Seoul, the latter coached by Turkey&apos;s 2002 World Cup boss, Senol Gunes, close behind. In the middle of the continent, big-spending, Eto&apos;o-chasing Bunyodkor have the competition&apos;s one world star, Rivaldo, as well as half of the Uzbekistan national team to call on. If gas drives the Central Asian challenge then oil fuels western dreams of a first win since 2005. While the really big names have gone, there is still enough talent to cause problems. Al Jazira and Al Ahli of UAE have Brazilians while Saudi Arabian powerhouses Al Hilal and Al Ittihad have Swedish, Egyptian and Moroccan internationals as well as a wealth of experience winning titles at home and abroad. There is one element to the new format that may backfire on the AFC this season. The Tehran titans Persepolis and Esteghlal regularly attract 70,000-plus crowds. While unlikely on paper, should these rivals, the fiercest in Asia, make the final, both red and blue fans will have to travel all the way to Tokyo for a one-off match in November \u2013 it used to be two-legged. For all the new investment and marketing, therefore, the competition could end in a damp squib. Asian club fans don&apos;t travel overseas in anything approaching large numbers (only Korea&apos;s Seongnam, owned by the wealthy Unification church, AKA &apos;The Moonies&apos;, attract big support in Japan courtesy of local church members \u2013 check out the massed yellow ranks), AFC officials will be praying that a Japanese club makes the final. It may be a mistake to follow Uefa in this aspect but the Asian Champions League is set on shadowing, and one day catching, the giant to the west.", "tags": ["Gamba Osaka", "Suwon Bluewings", "Kashima Antlers", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-17T14:22:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/mar/17/sxswi-startups", "sentences": ["An artist's impression of the interview    Kawasaki said he&apos;d bought a copy of Anderson&apos;s book in Shanghai for 50c, so what about China?"], "title": "@SXSWi: Chris Anderson on why free is the inevitable price for digital content", "article": "Guy Kawasaki starts off his keynote interview with Wired editor-in-chief and Long Tail author Chris Anderson with some predictable gags about last year&apos;s not entirely successful Sarah Lacy interview with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, repeating some very lazy insinuations that she had flirted with him and her skirt was too short, etc etc. Somehow he managed to tear himself away to ask his first question: &quot;How would you fix Twitter, Chris?&quot;     Guy Kawasaki kicked off his Chris Anderson interview by saying it would be better than last year's    &quot;Twitter has committed itself to a free-to-consumer site,&quot; said Anderson. The right question is: &apos;Would you version your product?&apos; So how do you create a version of the product that doesn&apos;t cripple the product, or raise the premium so high that not enough people use it?&quot; &quot;The question people always ask is how do you convert from attention and reputation to cash, and the answer is no one single way. Each one of us is our own platform and has to figure out our own way,&quot; he said. Kawasaki has a company, and builds his credibility and company news through Twitter. For a professor, the objective might be more academic research commissions or for an engineer, new work. The music industry needs to rethink the business as a whole and how individuals are using networks like Twitter so that they think in a more 360 degree way. What&apos;s the problem with the music industry? &quot;It is misaligned,&quot; said Anderson. &quot;The music industry is fine, apart from one single part - publishing. More music is made, more music is listened to, more merchandise bought... it is all working apart from the sales of recorded music.&quot; Is there any model for paper? It&apos;s much the same for book publishing, so a new publisher starting up now should think about aligning their interests with the author and representing them not just for book sales, but for speeches, academic assignments and appearances. &quot;The best business models I&apos;m seeing out there are in the games space - Club Penguin, Neopets, Second Life and online RPGs [role playing games] like Maple Story. They are experimenting with every possible way to charge but 5% is the way forward. If you can convert 5% or even more than you can create a profitable business.&quot; Is there still a place for paper, then? What about newspapers? Anderson said of the New York Times that in the old days - as in before the disastrous financials last September - that it is a company rich in reputation but poor in revenue. It had three options: raising investment; selling to people who valued their product enough to pay for it; or monetising its large online audience volume through schemes like Google AdSense. But he does think there is a future in this 360 world; &quot;There will always be a market for great design , great production, great implementation of long-form journalism,&quot; he said. &quot;You can&apos;t put online gorgeous photos because they turn into thumbnails, and long pieces get cut onto multiple pages... it just doesn&apos;t work.&quot; As long as it adds a perceived value, people will pay, just as with books. Digital versions may be free, but the physical product may have a value that 5% of readers are prepared to pay for - and that&apos;s the business model. A delegate told Anderson his software firm had made $90,000 in one day from one client, but Anderson said although he clearly has a client base that is used to paying that kind of money for software licences, the flip side is that there could be 20 times that audience for a free version of his product. &apos;Free&apos; needs the commas taken off For most of the 20th century, free had been &apos;free&apos; - really something that was only partly free, with a catch. &quot;Twenty-first century free needs to take the inverted commas off,&quot; said Anderson. &apos;Freemium&apos;, offering one free version and then one paid version with extra value, means 95% of the product will be free and 5% paid for - not the 5% free model that markets have used.     An artist's impression of the interview    Kawasaki said he&apos;d bought a copy of Anderson&apos;s book in Shanghai for 50c, so what about China? A country that has &quot;given up on intellectual property and tackling piracy&quot;? China is the future of free, said Anderson. &quot;It&apos;s the animal force of economics. The internet is the most competitive market we have ever seen and costs are nearly zero. The law of physics means that if you do not make your product free, gravity will do it for you.&quot; In China, &apos;cantopop&apos; stars are learning to use piracy because it creates celebrity. Instead of music sales, they make their money through personal appearances, store openings, corporate gigs, company meetings, advertising and product endorsement. And it&apos;s the same in Brazil. It&apos;s not unlike the US town Wall, en route to Mount Rushmore, that started to offer free iced tea to tourists during the depression. They began driving out of their way for free tea, but spent money on other things and today, the town is a huge sprawling tourist trap selling cowboy kitsch. Perhaps Starbucks could do the same, offering a free basic coffee but charging for the double mocca decaf lattes with sprinkles. Online, free wants to be the natural price &quot;There&apos;s a powerful psychology of free,&quot; said Anderson. &quot;It&apos;s like a bug in English because it has two meanings; one as in free speech ad freedom and one as in no price. In Latin and Scandinavian there are two words - libra and gratis. But the advantage we take of that in English is that we use all the good connotations of free to sell things.&quot; It&apos;s like the psychological device of selling things for 99c rather than $1 - that 1 cent gap raises the &apos;value for money flag&apos;. Free doesn&apos;t raise that flag at all. And he can&apos;t think of anything negative about being free online. Nobody thinks less of Facebook, Google or Twitter because they are free: &quot;That&apos;s not the metric we use. We think of utility, not price.&quot; And the toughest question came from the floor. &quot;Don&apos;t you think your article undermined our industry, and that could make you the Henry Blodget of Web 2.0?&quot; There was a perceptible intake of breath from the 1,300 geeks in the room. &quot;I&apos;m not telling the apple to fall - I&apos;m just telling that the apple will fall. That is what the laws of digital economics require.

The daughter of the actor Vanessa Redgrave and the director-producer Tony Richardson, she was among the third generation of a family steeped in the performing arts, her maternal grandparents being the actors Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson.  But while she remained close to her family, it was at the professional distance of her choosing: she settled in New York, took US citizenship, deployed a flawless American accent as necessary, and enjoyed her finest cinematic moment as the kidnapped California media heiress Patty Hearst. Natasha&apos;s career in film started at the age of four, when she and her younger sister, Joely, figured as extras in their father&apos;s film The Charge of the Light Brigade. Joely also went on to a successful acting career, as did their cousin Jemma, daughter of the actor Corin Redgrave, in recent years an admired King Lear. Born in London, Natasha studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais and St Paul&apos;s girls school, Hammersmith. Her parents divorced when she was three. Her mother was much involved in campaigning for the Workers Revolutionary party and fundraising for refugees, and to see their father the two girls went to France and California. Natasha felt strongly loved and supported by both parents, but grew up fast: when she came to have her own children, she was keen for them to have a rather more orderly upbringing. A determined teenager, she decided to take a hold on her future by leaving St Paul&apos;s at 16, so that she could take her A-levels in one year rather than two. When she auditioned at the Central School of Speech and Drama, London, she kept quiet about being a Redgrave.  However, she soon gained a reputation in her own right in the theatre, in particular from a 1985 staging of Chekhov&apos;s The Seagull alongside her mother.  Natasha&apos;s first film role was in the low-budget Every Picture Tells a Story (1984), and two years later she reached a wider audience in the guise of Mary Shelley as perceived by Ken Russell in his extravagant Gothic. This was a gruelling experience in which she was at one point required to be covered from head to foot in spinach as a practical substitute for primeval slime. On location, made up with huge dark circles under her eyes, she cheerfully confided to me: &quot;I&apos;d probably look a lot worse if I had really been through all this.&quot;  Her next screen appearance was in distinct contrast, as the wife of a rural Yorkshire clergyman in A Month in the Country (1987), an adaptation of JL Carr&apos;s novel. Although the film was set in the 1920s, Richardson imported an almost pre-Raphaelite quality of the ethereal.  Ordeal, however, was again the keynote of her next film, which marked her arrival in international cinema with the title role in Paul Schrader&apos;s Patty Hearst (1988). This was a dramatisation of near-expressionist intensity of how William Randolph Hearst&apos;s granddaughter was kidnapped by, and then became an adherent of, the Symbionese Liberation Army. The film inevitably rested to a considerable degree on the quality of its central performance: this was a tour de force, making it all the sadder that its harrowing quality denied the film acceptance by a wide audience.  In Shadow Makers (1989), Richardson took the less central but elegiac role of the suicidal lover of the US nuclear physicist and father of the atom bomb Robert Oppenheimer. Then she was reunited with Schrader for a film in a very different register, The Comfort of Strangers (1990). Derived from Ian McEwan&apos;s novel and set in Venice, it is a chilly chamber drama, with Richardson conveying suitable presence as one half of an English couple caught up in a strange erotic imbroglio.  This film, and the screen version of Margaret Atwood&apos;s The Handmaid&apos;s Tale (1990), may have had an art-house stamp, but in the US, where she went to live in the early 1990s, Richardson was seen by a larger television audience. This came about through two acclaimed 1993 TV films, in roles of a matchingly febrile kind, as the victimised heroine of Tennessee Williams&apos;s Suddenly Last Summer and as Zelda Fitzgerald, disturbed wife of the novelist F Scott Fitzgerald, in Zelda.  From her early 20s, Richardson had been the partner of Robert Fox, a theatre and film producer 11 years older than her, and she took charge of his three children. Fox also came from a theatre family, as the younger brother of Edward and James. They married in 1990. The following year, her father Tony died of an HIV-related illness, and Natasha invited the Irish actor Liam Neeson to co-star with her in a much-lauded Broadway revival of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s Anna Christie. In 1994, Richardson and Fox were divorced, and Neeson, also 11 years her senior, became her second husband. That year, too, they appeared together on screen in the psychological melodrama Nell.  In 1995, she ventured into the more lighthearted, and commercially safer, reaches of family comedy by acting in the Disney remake of The Parent Trap, achieving the feat of not being upstaged in what is essentially a vehicle for a juvenile performer, with Lindsay Lohan in the role that in 1961 had been taken by Hayley Mills. Richardson revisited the territory of glossy comedy to engaging effect with Jennifer Lopez in Maid in Manhattan (2002).  By this time, Richardson had already expended considerable effort on trying to get Asylum, Patrick McGrath&apos;s novel about events in a psychiatric hospital modelled on Broadmoor in the 1950s, translated to the cinema screen. When the project was finally realised, in 2005, it provided her with the sexually charged role of a neglected psychiatrist&apos;s wife who starts an affair with one of her husband&apos;s patients, incarcerated for beheading his former wife. The same year saw The White Countess, the final collaboration by producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory \u2013 Merchant died during production \u2013 exchanging the British in India for displaced Russian aristocrats in the Shanghai of 1936. Richardson took the title role of Countess Sofiya Belinskaya, still glamorous despite her straitened circumstances. For only the second time in her career, she joined her mother and aunt Lynn, with Ralph Fiennes playing a US diplomat in an oblique screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro. Despite a strong lineup of female stars including Richardson, with the central figure played by Claire Danes in youth and Vanessa Redgrave 50 years later, Evening (2007) made little impact. Richardson&apos;s last film appearance came as the English headteacher with the task of instilling a sense of proper, old-world discipline into exiled American schoolgirl Emma Roberts in the teen comedy Wild Child (2008). Stage work continued to be important to Richardson. Her repertoire of strong characters continued with Ibsen&apos;s obsessive Ellida Wangel, The Lady from the Sea, reopening the Almeida Theatre, north London, in 2003, and on Broadway with Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams&apos;s A Streetcar Named Desire two years later. Her range was considerable: in 1998, she won a Tony award for her playing of Sally Bowles in a new Broadway production of the musical Cabaret, and at the time of her death was preparing to co-star with her mother in a Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim&apos;s A Little Night Music. While that link persisted \u2013 Richardson&apos;s first childhood appearance in The Charge of the Light Brigade had been as Vanessa&apos;s bridesmaid \u2013 there is every reason to suppose that she would have continued to demonstrate her versatility in the years ahead.  She is survived by her husband Liam Neeson, their two sons, Miche\u00e1l and Daniel, her mother Vanessa and the other acting Redgraves of their two generations. Natasha Jane Richardson, actor, born 11 May 1963; died 18 March 2009 \u2022 This article was amended on Saturday 28 March 2009. In the obituary of Natasha Richardson above we said she gained a reputation in the theatre from a performance alongside her mother and aunt in Chekhov&apos;s Three Sisters in 1985. She appeared with her mother in Chekhov&apos;s The Seagull that year. Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave appeared with their niece Jemma Redgrave in Three Sisters in 1990.

While Richardson was often considered to have done her best work on stage \u2013 she won a Tony award for her Broadway role as Sally Bowles in Cabaret in 1998 \u2013 she was a film actor of considerable talent, who combined acclaimed performances in art-house fare with effective turns in more mainstream movies such as the 2002 romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan. Richardson made an eye-catching star debut in Ken Russell&apos;s lurid 1986 fantasy Gothic. She played Frankenstein author Mary Shelley (who, in Russell&apos;s conceit, was inspired by real-life events to pen her horror classic) opposite Gabriel Byrne as Lord Byron and Julian Sands as Percy Shelley. Frenzied and flamboyant, the film was widely dismissed at the time of its release, but it now finds itself bracketed as a baroque cult classic.            She gave one of her finest screen performances in Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff&apos;s dystopian 1990 drama The Handmaid&apos;s Tale, adapted from Margaret Atwood&apos;s feminist fable with a script by Harold Pinter. Richardson played the oppressed heroine, paraded as a sexual slave in an America in thrall to the fascist religious right. The trailer is below, and here&apos;s a clip.            Michael Apted&apos;s 1994 melodrama Nell cast Richardson in the pivotal role of psychologist Paula Olsen. The film centres on a kind of female Kasper Hauser (an Oscar-nominated Jodie Foster) living alone in a cabin in western North Carolina, whose only contact with other people was through her recently deceased mother. The shoot was a happy time for Richardson, who ended up marrying co-star Liam Neeson, who played the local doctor trying to help Nell adjust to the outside world.      In Nancy Meyers&apos;s 1998 Disney family comedy The Parent Trap, Richardson starred as Elizabeth James, the harassed mother of twins, separated at birth, who were both played by a young Lindsay Lohan. The film served up a slick diet of mistaken identity, familial tensions and last-gasp reconciliations.            Richardson bagged her biggest box-office hit courtesy of Wayne Wang&apos;s 2002 comedy Maid in Manhattan. The film cast her as Caroline Lane, the feisty but stuck-up British socialite who is upstaged by lowly housemaid Jennifer Lopez in the hunt for the affections of thrusting young politician (Ralph Fiennes).       Shot in 2005, The White Countess was the grand swansong for the legendary production team of James Ivory and the late Ismail Merchant, Richardson played Countess Sofiya Belinskaya, an aristocratic refugee of the Russian revolution working as a taxi dancer in 1930s Shanghai opposite an aspiring nightclub owner (Ralph Fiennes again). The film was notable for the casting of Richardson alongside her mother Vanessa Redgrave and her aunt Lynn Redgrave, who played members of her family.

Instead of focusing on the entire web, Newssift focuses on thousands of business-focused sources, both from traditional media and blogs. Newssift is a work in progress, and is being launched as a beta project. The final format and business model are still being worked out although initially the service will be supported by ad revenue. &quot;We have selected a key number of business content sites, an exclusive content library,&quot; said John Greenleaf, chief marking officer for Newssift. &quot;We have excluded all but topics and titles that we feel are relevant to users&quot;. Search focused on theme or a select group of sites, often called deep search, is not a new concept. General search engines, such as Google, Ask or Yahoo, attempt to index as much of the web as possible, but it leads to what some call the invisible web. New content is added to the internet at such a speed that general search engines cannot keep pace. Deep search focuses only on specific sites or topics to index them more thoroughly. Newssift takes the concept of deep search and adds tagging, both automatic and edited, as well as an easy way to combine search terms to allow users quickly to find the information that they want, said Greenleaf. Newssift is not the first business-focused search offering. Thomson Reuters bought its ClearForest subsidiary in 2007. One of ClearForest&apos;s products is an automatic tagging service called Calais, which it released as an open web service last year to allow people easily to index content based on people, places, events and organisations. Thomson Reuters used to be a half owner of business information text-mining service Factiva with Dow Jones. Semantic search like Newssift is not a keyword search. Every article is annotated and tagged, Greenleaf says. The analysis is done to build meaning and show relationships. The service allows users to search easily by news topic, organisation, person, place or theme. If a user searches for stories about business in China, the search can quickly be refined to cities in China, showing stories about Beijing, Shanghai or Hubei. Greenleaf described this as a &quot;know before you click&quot; model so that users can see related topics and the number of stories available for each sub-topic. In addition to automatic tagging, Newssift editors have also added other relationships to the service relevant to their business audience so that if someone looks for news about Ford Motor Company, they can also see related content from Ford suppliers. Aside from highlighting relationships between people, organisations and events in the news, Greenleaf also says that the service search engine optimisation techniques that can be used by content providers to manipulate search results don&apos;t work with semantic search services like Newssift. Initially, the service will be ad supported, with no paid search placement. The company is considering other revenue possibilities such as charging for services based on specific business sectors or additional services. They might also consider providing feeds of related content back to other content providers similar to a service provided by Topix. They don&apos;t foresee selling the search and tagging service to other companies as ClearForest does. Even with the dramatic downturn in advertising and with many online companies relying on ad revenue models, Greenleaf says there has been strong interest in advertising from &quot;global companies in the financial, electronics and consulting space&quot;. Search advertising revenue is still growing, and the service is finding success with its business focus, even in the global recession. The company will be taking feedback from users during the beta period to refine the list of sources and also the revenue model.

Dressed in black, with an impish trilby, Coco is the face of Shanghai&apos;s jazz renaissance, a sudden blooming of live music after decades of hibernation under communist rule. Jazz clubs are multiplying across the city at a rate not seen since the decadent 1930s, when Shanghai was Asia&apos;s most glamorous city, bustling with everything from big band dancehalls to Viennese showgirls. Once again, Shanghai is an essential stop on the circuit. George Benson and Al Jarreau recently wowed Chinese audiences at a sell-out, one-off gig at the 1,600-seater Yun Feng Theatre, while late last year Gilles Peterson, the British world music and acid jazz DJ, drew a large crowd at the annual JZ music festival organised by the city&apos;s most committed jazz venue, the JZ Club (jzclub.cn). But much of the talent is homegrown, and Coco, whose tremulous voice and ambiguous sexuality hide years of classical training, is leading the way. At clubs across the city, he improvises in English and in Chinese, helping to create a scene where western and local performers are feeding audiences everything from Dixieland to fusions of Chinese folk songs with swing beats. Shanghai&apos;s colonial past is the perfect backdrop for jazz, and couples are once again ballroom dancing at the art deco Paramount Ballroom. Coco has his night, 4Play, at Lounge 18 (lounge18.com), inside the neo-classical former Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China on the Bund, built in 1923.  A rickshaw ride north along the waterfront, in the former warehouse district of Hongkou, is Chinatown (chinatownshanghai.com) the creation of skateboarder-turned-burlesque promoter and nightclub designer Norman Gosney and his showgirl wife, Amelia Kallman.  Gosney, who was born in Bristol, made his name importing skateboards to the UK in 1975 before moving to New York, taking up residency in the Chelsea Hotel and opening the Slipper Room, the club that sparked the burlesque boom. The couple moved to Shanghai in 2007. &quot;Burlesque had become a dirty word in NYC,&quot; Ameila explains, &quot;mainly because it wasn&apos;t being performed well. It&apos;s about telling a story, it has to be clever, to be funny. It&apos;s not just about taking your clothes off.&quot; Chinatown&apos;s eagerly anticipated opening is scheduled for early April and the duo have hired Joey Altruda, who helped score the movies Swingers and LA Confidential, to be their musical director. Also on board is a burly American, Frank Bray, who looks like a rugby player but croons &quot;like Sinatra at his best&quot;, according to Gosney. The club itself is a former Buddhist temple, now tricked out like a Victorian theatre, with private boxes, footlights, trap doors, and red velvet draped across every surface. Miss Amelia, a former Shakespearean actress, will put together a floor show, calling on the expertise of her multi-ethnic burlesque troupe, The Chinatown Dolls.  Further north still, in Shanghai&apos;s Moganshan Lu art district, is a monthly gathering run by one of Coco Zhao&apos;s pianists, the American Steve Sweeting, who set up a residency inside the Two Cities Gallery (twocitiesgallery.com) and plays everything from bossa nova to music from the central Chinese province of Hunan, to a crowd who come to sip tea and wine.  Sweeting, whose collaborations with the soft and sensuous sounding Chinese chanteuse Jasmine Chen have been likened to the work of the 1970s Broadway duo Barbara Cook and Wally Harper, draws a dedicated crowd of enthusiasts to an elegant and whitewashed space so intimate that microphones and amplification are unnecessary. For such simple instrumentation, Sweeting manages to create a huge range of sounds and tempos that provide a swinging backdrop to Shanghai&apos;s night scene.  Acoustic jazz-hounds are also making their way to The Melting Pot (themelting-pot.com), the newest venue in a chain of three across the city, situated in the heart of the French Concession on Hengshan Road next to the down-at-heel Can Can bar. Ruby Hsiao, Shanghai&apos;s jazz matron, insists her bar is &quot;all about the music&quot; and is maternally protective of her house band, a jazz and blues outfit called Keepers of Swing (KOS), led by charismatic New York old-timer Ronnie Williams, currently Shanghai&apos;s most sought-after drummer.  Bigger venues are also opening at an exponential rate. One enthusiastic Chinese fan sketched a &quot;jazz map&quot; on the back of a napkin to show just how much good music it is possible to cram into one night in the city. Almost all of his seven must-see venues have opened in the last six months.  Brown Sugar (brownsugarjazzclub.com), a Taiwanese import, has quickly carved a niche for itself despite having only opened in December. Situated among the converted stone shikumen houses of Xintiandi, the swanky club is not faithful to any particular genre, but is packed out on most nights with glamorous Chinese, foot-tapping to the jazz and blues on offer from the All Stars house band. On the night I drop by, a celebrity guest singer from Taipei, David Huang, has packed the place with executives and artists from Shanghai&apos;s pop scene. Huang is best-known as a hit composer for Asian stars, but nevertheless flits from atmospheric melodies to grander, bolder arrangements of what is more pop than jazz.  Finally there is Cabaret (jozhou0519@gmail.com), a new club on the Bund around the corner from the Shanghai mainstay, House of Blues and Jazz (blues_jazz01@yahoo.com.cn), a sexier, plusher affair with a cut-crystal bar from which to order your bellini-tinis. Heidi Krenn, an Austrian Fulbright scholar, is an experimental musician whose style of singing behind the beat has drawn comparisons with the late Betty Carter, who used to sing with Ray Charles.

A high-speed straight into a tight hairpin here, a nice little left-right-left chicane there: easy enough. Maybe that&apos;s why so many fans think they could do a better job than Hermann Tilke, the world&apos;s leading circuit designer. The German has been accused of penning boring tracks and, even worse, of butchering legendary ones like Hockenheim. Yet according to those most affected by the 54-year-old&apos;s designs, he is able to marry the needs of the drivers, cars and fans better than anyone else. The former formula one driver Anthony Davidson, a race commentator for BBC Radio 5 Live, says he has never heard any of his fellow drivers moan about a Tilke-designed circuit.  &quot;He understands the demands of the modern cars,&quot; says Davidson. &quot;You see very wide circuits with a lot of space; he gives us run-off areas and it&apos;s all well thought out. They are enjoyable to race on because they suit modern F1 cars. At a track like Silverstone you do not get as much overtaking because it was designed for cars that were slower and did not depend on downforce for speed. But the circuits designed in recent years have a long straight and bigger braking zone.&quot; It is quaint to picture Tilke, whose engineering firm has gone from strength to strength over 25 years, with pencil clamped between teeth, dreaming up his next circuit. In truth, a site inspection is the first stop and only once factors such as topography, wind direction, infrastructure and soil quality are known do the first sketches begin, with a group of four or five engineers taking part - and one significant other.  &quot;One of the very first things we do is to sit down with Mr Ecclestone who has a very good understanding and talent for design and has a feel for what is necessary for a venue to be a success,&quot; says Tilke, who competes in endurance races himself. Given the costs involved, it is no wonder such a lengthy process is involved. To build an F1 circuit of about three to four miles in Europe is said to cost in the region of \u00a3100m. Much of Tilke&apos;s effort goes into conceiving dramatic architecture that reflects the host country, like Sepang&apos;s lotus-leaf grandstands in Malaysia. Making sure spectators are comfortable is part of his philosophy, along with giving a good overview and building corners that promise a fast and interesting race but avoid pulling the field apart. There are only four circuit designers recognised by the FIA, formula one&apos;s governing body, and only one man who gets the F1 gigs: Tilke. But drivers and engineers do not give a care to the name behind a track, provided it offers them something to get their teeth into. &quot;Looking at Tilke circuits, if you take Shanghai and compare it with Turkey, they do present different challenges,&quot; says Red Bull Racing&apos;s head of car engineering, Paul Monaghan. He points to circuits like Sepang, where it is necessary to steer while under-braking. &quot;It&apos;s one of the trickiest things - it gives the drivers something to show their skill with.&quot; A great design seems to be one that makes life difficult for the teams and drivers. Clive Bowen is managing director of Apex Circuit Design, which built the Dubai Autodrome, a track that was made to F1 standard but has yet to appear on the calendar. &quot;We play Machiavelli on purpose and with great fun, putting more or less grip at certain parts of the circuit,&quot; he says. &quot;If you can make the engineers&apos; job harder, then there&apos;s a greater opportunity of a spread of vehicle set-up across the field, so a greater opportunity of overtaking.&quot; Bowen admires Tilke&apos;s work, especially Istanbul Park in Turkey, which he describes as &quot;a technical and aesthetic tour de force&quot;, and sympathises with the difficulties of modifying existing tracks. Tilke has come in for criticism for his re-working of circuits like Hockenheim, with fans overlooking the constraints placed on him by safety regulations.  &quot;By cutting off that long blast down through the woods at Hockenheim he was just joining the dots - he did not have much room for manoeuvre,&quot; says Bowen. When Tilke is given a blank canvas, however, the results are different. Take Istanbul&apos;s infamous Turn Eight. &quot;A bit of a legend,&quot; says Davidson. &quot;I wish I&apos;d designed it,&quot; says Bowen. Don&apos;t we all?

So steady, so self-assured and so sure off the ground is the British No1 that Federer appears to feel the need to rush, and the fact that those tactics are fatal is borne out in the results of their continuing rivalry. Murray&apos;s three-set victory over the former world No1 in the ATP tournament on Saturday confirmed a trend that is beginning to establish itself. Murray is winning with increasing ease. Since losing to Federer in the final of the US Open in September, Murray has beaten him in Madrid and Shanghai by scores of 7\u20135 in the third set. Then, in Doha in January, it was 6\u20132 in the third. Here it was 6\u20131. Federer&apos;s impatient tactics are leaving several coaches and ex-players confused. Pancho Segura, who coached Jimmy Connors and others in his day, is considered one of the great gurus of the game. Now in his eighties, Segura is still able to analyse a match at a glance. &quot;What is Federer doing going over the ball so much on his backhand?&quot; Segura asked. &quot;He attacks with it and misses. He needs the slice to get him into the point. He needs patience.&quot; But Federer seems to have little of that these days, least of all with Hawk-Eye which he dislikes but, stubbornly, still uses to query balls that have clearly been called correctly. The Swiss was not making any excuses for his poor third set, just admitting that &quot;the better man won&quot;. The mystery is that Federer can be better than this. Yet he appears incapable of producing his best against Murray which is a huge compliment to the young Scot. Murray, of course, is perfectly happy to bide his time and has faith in his ability to win. &quot;Of course I feel I&apos;m going to win when I play him,&quot; he said. &quot;To be a great sportsman you have to believe you can win. He [Federer] is always capable of producing a couple of great shots like he did in the second set but he has to keep it up the whole match and I was able to prevent him doing that. I was happy just keeping the ball deep and high to his backhand. I am not going to go for huge winners because that is not the way I play. I would lose if I tried those sort of tactics against him.&quot; The only thing that has surprised Murray is his progression to the final. &quot;I really wasn&apos;t expecting to get this far after the virus but I&apos;m hitting the ball a lot better now than I was at the start of the week so I think I have a chance of winning.&quot; Nadal was not at his best against Andy Roddick in the other semi-final but the wind was getting up and controlling the ball became increasingly difficult.

The IIED is not the first organisation to suggest city living is greener than living in the countryside: last summer the Brookings Institute said residents in US cities had 14% lower footprints than the US average. The authors of this new report, however, admit that assessing emissions is not an exact science because different countries and cities employ different methodologies for counting CO2 emissions, making a precise like-for-like comparison difficult. Most city dwellers&apos; emissions are also still too high to curb climate change, despite being low compared with national averages. &quot;With the exceptions of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, all of the cities surveyed already exceed the per capita \ufb01gure&quot; needed to keep CO2 levels below 450 parts per million, warned Dodman.", "tags": ["Carbon footprints", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Travel and transport", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-23T13:12:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/23/china-film-quota", "sentences": ["The country is planning a free market zone in Shanghai where controls on imported movies will be relaxed, and where local film-makers will be encouraged to export to the rest of the world, according to the Hollywood Reporter.", "The &quot;special cultural administrative region&quot; in Shanghai&apos;s Wai Gao Qiao free trade district would be a testing ground for further reform of government policy on foreign imports."], "title": "China plans Shanghai zone where Western film quota to be relaxed", "article": "It could spell the beginning of the end for a seven-year-old policy which caps the number of foreign films allowed to screen in China each year at 20.

Varda, demonstrating the sort of charm, intelligence and sophistication that Madonna would later attempt to acquire osmotically by marrying a Brit, praised the Michigan chanteuse&apos;s industry, professionalism and vast comedic talents. But in the end the project fell through, because, as Madonna herself explained it, the folks with the moneybags in Hollywood insisted on a finished script before shooting, and Varda simply doesn&apos;t work that way. Cl\u00e9o de 5 \u00e0 7 is one of the seminal motion pictures produced by the French nouvelle vague (new wave) movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s. (Technically speaking, Varda is a member of a slightly different movement, a cousin of the new wave, but these distinctions now seem precious, like distinguishing between The Sons of Garibaldi and The Cousins of Mazzini.) In the film, the very young, very lovely Corrine Marchand plays a self-absorbed pop singer who is waiting for the result of a biopsy to determine whether she has cancer. The film follows her from 5pm to 7pm as she buys a hat, rehearses a song, goes for a walk, visits a sculptor&apos;s studio, takes a spin around Paris and meets up with a young soldier who, though badly outclassed in the glamour department, promptly falls in love with her. This is a pretty flimsy plot for a motion picture, but flimsy plots were a central feature in new wave films. Varda, like her more famous contemporaries Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Alain Resnais, was determined to make an entirely new kind of film that would jettison conventional narrative structure. As Godard put it, a film must have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order. A film no longer needed to be logical. Cl\u00e9o would thus face the camera in a blackout and sing a torch song directly to the audience. Cl\u00e9o would show off while trying on strange hats. Cl\u00e9o would visit a movie theatre and watch a slapstick silent film. Cl\u00e9o would treat herself to a cognac. It would never be entirely clear to the audience why she was doing any of it. That was the point. She was killing time while waiting to find out how much time she had left. Looking back on Varda&apos;s jewel now, one can imagine that moment when releases like this seemed to provide a new baseline for cinema itself, ushering in an era when film-makers would no longer simply make &quot;product,&quot; but would take a crack at producing great art. A half-century later, in the era of Watchmen and Saw V and even the beloved Slumdog Millionaire, it&apos;s like looking at Westminster Abbey and Gloucester Cathedral and then gazing at the two cathedrals in Liverpool. What happened? The problem with the new wave is that it was just that - a wave - that rolled in and then rolled out over the course of 10 years. Not all the new wave films were good, and not all have stood the test of time, but the ratio of good to bad and great to good was high enough to make it an unprecedented moment in the history of cinema. No one in the year 2009 will make a better film than Les Quatre Cents Coups (The 400 Blows), Hiroshima, Mon Amour, or Jules et Jim. No one will make a more daring film than Pierrot le Fou, Alphaville or Weekend. No one will make a more adventurous film than Paris Nous Appartient (Paris Belongs to Us) or a more influential film than A Bout de Souffle (Breathless). No one will make a more anachronistic, stranger film than Les Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg). And no one will make a nuttier film than La Chinoise or Le Gai Savoir (Joy of Learning). This was not a wave, it was a tsunami. Like the elusive, gigantic wave surfers spend their lives hunting for, the new wave was a spectacular, once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon that would have no sequel. The next wave would be spearheaded by Claude Lelouch, who hijacked the techniques of Godard and Resnais to make the sappy, conventional love story Un Homme et une Femme (A Man and a Woman), which won a lot of Oscars. The Americans would then get into the act, appropriating the techniques but leaving out the brains. What most of the Yanks would take from the French new wave were jump cuts, voiceovers, weird tracking shots, gratuitous violence, sunglasses, attitude and general disrespect for tradition - but not the passion and intelligence. Today, the very worst things in contemporary cinema - unrehearsed actors; a ceaseless stream of four-second-long tight shots; endless voiceovers; voluble, stylish gangsters - are all direct results of the new wave, which started out as a way to make cheap movies, and then morphed into a cheap way to make bad movies.  At the time it erupted, eight major directors were working simultaneously: Truffaut, Godard, Varda, Resnais, Eric Rohmer, Jacques Demy, Jacques Rivette and Claude Chabrol. To their numbers can be added Chris Marker, whose haunting sci-fi film La Jet\u00e9e, which consists almost entirely of still photography, makes the infantile philosophising of Watchmen seem ... well ... infantile. At the same time, Jean-Pierre Melville, a mentor to the new wave directors, was making superb films such as Le Samoura\u00ef, and Louis Malle, who was never really part of the new wave, was turning out intriguing motion pictures like Ascenseur pour l&apos;Echafaud (Lift to the Scaffold). This was an awful lot of talent to have working in one place in one art form at one time. It never happened anywhere else. And it never happened again. The most amazing thing about the new wave is how little the directors had in common - artistically, philosophically, politically. What united them was a shared determination to breathe life into the corpse of French postwar cinema. In this they resembled the impressionists, who banded together in the 1860s and seemed to have taken an informal vow to blind themselves before they would paint yet another picture of Horatio at the bridge.  Just as Manet and Monet and Degas and Renoir painted in entirely different styles while adhering to the same artistic movement, the new wave directors went off in completely different directions. Truffaut used clever new techniques to tell sad, beautiful stories about doomed romances. Rohmer was a loquacious moralist. Godard - half Swiss, all mean - used his motion pictures as a tool for eviscerating French society. Varda&apos;s vision was personal, idiosyncratic, feminist. Resnais, whose movies are the most mysterious and slow-paced in the genre, was a classicist trying to pass himself off as an iconoclast. Chabrol, who got the whole thing started in 1958 with Le Beau Serge, wanted to make French Alfred Hitchcock films. Demy wanted to tell heart-rending love stories using zany soundtracks. Marker and Rivette wanted to change the way the public thought about cinema for ever. For a while, they did. But for ever doesn&apos;t last as long it used to. Recently, I watched 25 of the most famous films made by this ensemble, just to see how well they held up a half-century after the movement&apos;s birth. Many I had seen in college, when the films were 10 years old and already thought of as classics; several I had seen in my 30s and 40s; a handful I had never seen at all. The films are not star-driven and often showcase mediocre or nondescript actors. A number of them are a bit grainy now, and do not look so great by comparison with what is on offer at any video store anywhere (most are also shot in black and white). The camera jumps around all the time; unoccasioned conversations about Faulkner and Proust and Che Guevara pop up everywhere; and nobody ever bothers to explain why the slow movement from Beethoven&apos;s Seventh is gurgling along in the background while the tall stranger in the cowboy hat drives up to the grubby cabaret in a gleaming white Caddy.  The audience, never allowed to forget that they are watching a film, have to work to appreciate these films. A minimal level of intelligence and sophistication is de rigueur. If you do not know a lot about motion-picture history, these films will not grab you by the lapels: all new wave movies contain references or homages to other movies, and sometimes to other new wave movies. The new wave, after all, was a high-class operation with a low-budget: cheap props, cheap decor, cheap editing, cheap personnel. That&apos;s the main reason there was so much gabbing. But nobody ever did more with less. Reassessing the new wave now, I find that the films I loved when I first saw them 40 years ago are still films I love; that the films whose ingenuity and impudence I admired at the time are less appealing now; and that a lot of the films I never saw at the time seem better left unwatched. There was a brief period in my 20s when I would tell people my favourite movie was Pierrot le Fou, Godard&apos;s 1965 mordant, all-out assault on French intellectuals, the bourgeoisie, the values of the west, capitalism, everything. Today, after seeing the film for the first time in 20 years, I still find it refreshingly vicious, buoyed by Jean-Paul Belmondo&apos;s devil-may-care panache. I feel the same way about Godard&apos;s Le M\u00e9pris, the nastiest film about the movie industry ever made. But A Bout de Souffle, the most influential new wave movie of them all, today seems dull and sophomoric: an endless series of gags about gangsters and secret agents and intellectuals whom Godard happened to despise.  Though it must be a source of rage to Godard, the less daring, less iconoclastic Truffaut is the director whose films have held up best over the years. This is perhaps because Truffaut, by far the most successful of the group, used exciting new techniques to tell the kinds of stories people have been telling since the beginning of time: children bear the scars of youth forever; men and women do not and cannot understand one another; no matter how much you love someone, you can&apos;t make them love you back. Godard made movies with his brain; Truffaut made movies with his heart. Nineteen years after its release, Jules et Jim was remade by the American director Paul Mazursky as Willie &amp; Phil. This was like remaking the Venus de Milo; it wasn&apos;t necessary and the end product was likely to disappoint. Luckily, 1980 was a couple of years too early to cast Madonna in the role originally played by Jeanne Moreau. But the result made one thing crystal clear. Some things are better left to the French. \u2022 The 400 Blows opens on 10 April at selected cinemas nationwide: see bfi.org.uk/releases.

Chinese journalists and student groups have been told to scale back their participation because images of cities and campuses turning dark do not fit the upbeat propaganda message that the authorities wanted to convey by declaring 28 March &quot;Serf Liberation Day&quot; in Tibet. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has urged people around the world to participate in Earth Hour, which he called the largest ever public show of concern about climate change. The WWF, which started the event three years ago, hopes that 1 billion people will join the temporary global switch-off at 8.30pm local time. Illuminations will be cut at The Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum, the Empire State Building and the Moscow government headquarters. But hopes for a similar show of global solidarity in the Forbidden City, Beijing University and the Chinese state broadcaster (CCTV) have run up against official unease about the clash of dates. The Chinese authorities declared Serf Liberation Day as a holiday in Tibet to bolster domestic support for Beijing&apos;s policies in the Himalayan region after a storm of international criticism in the run-up to the 2008 Olympics. It marks the entry into Tibet of the People&apos;s Liberation Army and the fleeing of the Dalai Lama into exile. When the new holiday was announced in January, the state media reported that it was intended to &quot;thoroughly reveal the vicious nature of the feudal serf system and the ulterior political purpose of the 1959 armed rebellion by the Dalai Lama group&quot;. But their chosen date coincides with Earth Hour, which has been held on the last Saturday in March since the first of the annual events in Sydney in 2007. The fixture clash has left the authorities and organisers in a quandary. China&apos;s government, which has set impressive goals on renewable energy and pollution control in recent years, does not want to be seen as an outsider in the global fight against climate change. Environmental NGOs, which have struggled for recognition in the one-party state, do not want to have their campaigns caught up with the divisive subject of Tibet. According to local journalists, students and NGOs, the compromise is an awkward mish-mash. CCTV, the state broadcaster, has been ordered to scale back plans for day-long coverage of the switch-off around the world, but it will transmit highlights. At Beijing University, the authorities have forbidden students from overtly participating in Earth Hour. Instead they will organise a &quot;star-gazing&quot; evening that will require them to turn off the lights to see the heavens more clearly. A director from the university&apos;s environment education centre said more extensive plans to highlight energy concerns and protect the environment would be postponed until 22 April, which is Earth Day. He said &quot;lack of preparation&quot; had prompted the change. Other sources said the ban was imposed because some people in the university considered the WWF a &quot;suspicious organisation&quot;. But outside the conservative bases of CCTV, Beijing University and the Propaganda Department, there will be a higher level of participation. The Shanghai government has fully endorsed the event. Visitors to the Bund waterfront on Saturday will see the neon skyline across the river darken as the iconic Pearl Insurance Tower switches off along with the Jin Mao building and International Trade Centre. Illuminations will also be cut at Hong Kong&apos;s Victoria Harbour, Baoding, Dalian, Nanjing and several technical universities. The switch-off is supported by world-renowned pianist Lang Lang, actress Li Bingbing and television host Yang Lan, and has corporate backing on the mainland from Nokia, Ikea and Coca-Cola. The most striking display in Beijing is expected to be the dimming of lights on the Olympic Bird&apos;s Nest stadium. Considering it has the biggest population and the most carbon emissions in the world, China accounts for a relatively low share of the more than 3,000 cities that have signed up for involvement worldwide. But organisers said momentum was building towards greater Chinese participation next year, when Earth Hour will fall on a different date from Serf Emancipation Day. &quot;Earth Hour aims to highlight the overwhelming support for people around the world for action on climate change, and has no relationship to any other event,&quot; said Dermot O&apos;Gorman, WWF China representative. &quot;Given what we&apos;ve seen in major urban areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong this year, we expect more people will participate in Earth Hour to take action on climate change in the years to come.&quot; The scope for higher levels of public awareness was evident at Beijing University yesterday, where a supposedly &quot;unplugged&quot; campus concert arranged as part of the countdown to Earth Hour proved as high-voltage as the average CCTV variety show with dazzling stage lights, huge amplifiers and numerous TV cameras. Students from more than a dozen top universities took part in the spectacular, in which many of the performers&apos; songs emphasised the bright future awaiting &quot;the glorious children of heaven&quot; as elite students are known. Of six audience members interviewed by the Guardian, only one expressed a sense of urgency about the global environment. &quot;As the people of the Earth we face the same problem. It is the 11th hour. We must do more,&quot; said Wang Zhenxiang, a business student. Most felt their generation was more privileged and money-orientated than their predecessors. &quot;We are more fashionable, more commercial. We can have big homes, drive a big car and travel to other countries just like foreigners do,&quot; said Zhang Minneg, a financial services student from Shanghai.", "tags": ["Earth Hour", "Climate change", "Environment", "China", "World news", "Tibet", "Dalai Lama", "WWF", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-27T13:55:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/28/fred-goodwin-bonuses-protests", "sentences": ["The golden geese will fly away to Dubai, Mumbai, Shanghai?"], "title": "Polly Toynbee: A furious public demands political anger management", "article": "Sometimes the sound of breaking glass resonates with meaning, however strong one&apos;s abhorrence of violence. Such a moment came with the bricks lobbed through the windows of Sir Fred Goodwin&apos;s empty Edinburgh property.  People are angry. Every public and political voice calling on him to give back his ill-gotten gains was met with arrogant obduracy. When the law says nothing can be done, a hurled brick has an extra gust of public opinion behind it. Maybe there is something Coriolanus-heroic about his defiance of the mob, refusing to join the banker penitents in the dock of the Treasury select committee. But his broken windows are an emblem, just as a random violent episode among mainly peaceful poll tax protests stays frozen in history - one hurled scaffolding pole replayed over and over, a totem of a public mood. For all the fright talk, today&apos;s Put People First demonstration will be a respectable array of big charities, churches and unions, urged on by the Bishop of London. Things may get livelier on 1 April when street theatre happenings promise pithier protests, with the four horsemen of the apocalypse descending on the Bank of England. Police tend to inflate the threat with warnings to bankers to stay away, dress down, don&apos;t wear tell-tale chinos and loafers. But &quot;Eat the Bankers&quot; signs do not portend a spit-roasting in Canary Wharf: police risk fomenting a fight by predicting one. Let&apos;s hope for nothing worse than a few broken windows, though the world&apos;s press is eager for pictures of violence. Twas ever thus. Demos at G8 summits - Seattle 1999, Genoa 2001 - were irrelevant to most voters. Not this time. Some say this protest is hopelessly inchoate, yet the impulse behind it chimes with the public. You don&apos;t have to be &quot;anti-capitalist&quot; to join the burst of public opinion against mountainous taxpayers&apos; sums being sunk into bottomless banks that should have been nationalised. People see the banking culture has not changed a jot when the man brought in to &quot;save&quot; our RBS is himself paid \u00a3750,000 a year, plus a \u00a31.5m bonus for a part-time job. The US is being tougher, prompted by headlines such as &quot;Not so fast you greedy bastards&quot; in the New York Post.  Marching on the Bank of England is a fair gesture when Mervyn King puts the national debt above the terrifying social debt that deep unemployment will cause. Paying off borrowing will be hard, but easier than mending a lost generation. Let&apos;s remember: King is the man who called this crisis so wrong he made it worse with high interest rates. Yet he has the presumption to torpedo a Keynesian budget - and Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling seem too craven to defy him. Even the Germans, despite doubts, have a bigger job-saving fiscal stimulus than Britain.  With 100,000 a week losing jobs - and more on short time, taking pay cuts - most fear for the livelihood of a relative or friend. Yet from Westminster, voters hear precious little that echoes their shock at this sudden vulnerability, at lost pensions, at 600,000 young people leaving school this summer with nowhere to go while local shops close. Figures from the Office for National Statistics this week show the poorest hit disproportionately hard by steep price rises for bread, meat, vegetables and energy, while petrol and luxury goods fell. The poorest fare worst. Yet from parliament they hear empty bickering - who-is-to-blame sniping, synthetic partisan indignation. Never mind apologies for the past, where are the new policies now? Labour should simply announce an emergency cap on top pay. Anything over the prime minister&apos;s \u00a3200,000 should be temporarily taxed at 90%. No bonuses, no fiddles. The golden geese will fly away to Dubai, Mumbai, Shanghai? Unlikely, but if a few go, who cares? No one in the public sector should get more than \u00a3150,000: in the present mood, all wise public bodies should rapidly cut their own top pay, before vengeful mobs vote in the Tories to mince public services. The money should be hypothecated for an emergency national job-creation plan - David Blanchflower to be job tsar.  At a Cass Business School discussion on the bonus culture I took part in this week, a shocked City headhunter told of public outrage on a phone-in: &quot;They kicked the shit out of me!&quot; A Tory MP from the Treasury select committee said people in the City hadn&apos;t yet realised the anger: &quot;Better pretend to be an estate agent or a child molester than admit being a banker - or an MP with expenses.&quot; Peter York, that astute ear-to-the-ground social commentator, warned those in power: &quot;People once thought just a few toffs and celebs earned this kind of money. They didn&apos;t realise it was a large class of previously invisible people, rich for no good reason.&quot; Now they see these bankers&apos; &quot;skills&quot; are worthless and dangerous. Now they realise these high rollers are so out of touch as to be clueless about how ordinary people live. Class is back, in a new guise. So is bankers&apos; fever over? Not at all: near-bust UBS cut top pay but finds other banks picking off their top people. That&apos;s why government has to call time on pay for all, to end the greed game where every silverback demands to be in the top quartile. Despite a dab of penitential ash on its brow, the City still sees nothing much wrong with how things were. Wait for it to blow over, but for God&apos;s sake don&apos;t let the politicians ruin things with regulation!  They need not worry unduly. Little Labour or other parties suggest begins to match public fury. Things could turn nasty if no one channels it into something purposeful? If the Tories are the answer to anti-establishment rage, everything is upside down. An inert cabinet fails to find words to capture how things feel, wasting political capital on dross. Prime ministers used to address the nation on TV in a crisis. What a political lacuna this reveals.  So this week there will be anger on the streets with antics and theatrics to challenge the moribund political system. What&apos;s the point? What can mere protest do? Rouse the listless, alarm the powerful, alert MPs to the possibility that radicalism might be popular. Even if it feels infantile and powerless as spitting in the global wind, doing nothing is no answer either.

About the only simple way to inflation-proof your savings is National Savings &amp; Investments&apos; index-linked savings certificates. These government-backed products pay a return linked to the retail prices index (RPI). You can choose three- or five-year certificates which pay RPI plus an average of 1% tax free \u2013 good news for higher-rate taxpayers. If you put \u00a3100 in today, and RPI remains at 3% over the term, you would get \u00a3112.35 after three years. If you believe the government&apos;s cash printing presses will spark an inflation surge, take the five-year bonds and enjoy the ride. If RPI rises to 10%, you&apos;ll get close to 11% per year, tax free. You can invest between \u00a3100 and \u00a315,000 in each certificate. Mortgages Buy A five-year fixed rate at 3.99%, or a 15-year fix at 5.94% High inflation often spells high interest rates, so borrowers may want to lock into ultra-low rates with a longer-term fix. Britannia building society has a 15-year fix which allows you to jump ship every three years. The flexibility is appealing but not the rates \u2013 the best on this deal is 5.94% and, for that, you need a 40% deposit. David Hollingworth at London &amp; Country believes three- to five-year fixed rates will grow in popularity. One of the best deals is HSBC&apos;s five-year fix at 3.99%, but a 40%-plus deposit is required. Woolwich has a four-year fix with the same rate (also 60% maximum LTV; purchase only). &quot;The upside of higher inflation is that it erodes debt quicker,&quot; says Hollingworth. But that doesn&apos;t mean you should super-size your borrowing for the sake of it. Investments Buy Gold, property, index-linked gilts, emerging markets Anyone who took out a mortgage in the inflationary 1970s saw it shrivel to a tiny real sum by the mid-1990s. So is investing in property long term the way to protect yourself? Now prices have fallen it&apos;s tempting. But (a) banks are not lending much and (b) you&apos;ll have the short-term pain of high interest costs when the Bank of England raises rates to combat rising prices. Investment folklore suggests the only way to truly protect yourself against inflation is by buying gold. It leaped from below $150 an ounce in 1976 to $750 in the early 1980s, then began a long decline until the start of this decade. Oddly enough, it has reacted little to the economic gloom encircling the globe since 2007. Swiss bank UBS says gold could hit $2,500 within five years. It used to be an esoteric market for the rich, but buying gold today is much easier through an exchange-traded fund from \u00a350. Equities are seen as a long-term hedge against inflation, but investment adviser Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown warns against expecting them to offer much short or medium-term protection. &quot;If you have inflation, no asset class likes the transitionary period. It&apos;s painful for everything, as it means interest rates have to go up.&quot; Over the shorter term, he says index-linked gilts \u2013 government bonds that shield investors from inflation \u2013 may offer more protection. You can buy these from the government&apos;s Debt Management Office, from \u00a31,000. The other opportunity is to look east. The bullish are pointing to the 30% rise in the Shanghai composite index this year. The way in is via a global emerging markets fund; top trusts include funds from First State, Baring, Aberdeen, JP Morgan and Templeton. Pensions Buy Index-linked products Pensioners lose most from inflation. It hits the real value of savings, while pensions fail to keep up with prices. You can try to protect savings with National Savings index-linked certificates. You can also buy a degree of inflation protection for your pension annuity. But it&apos;s expensive. For example, a couple both aged 65 with \u00a3100,000 savings will be offered a fixed annual income of \u00a36,818 from the current best provider, according to the Annuity Bureau. If they want their income to go up in line with RPI, they will be offered an initial annual \u00a34,115. Pensions analyst Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown says: &quot;Investors should inflation-proof some pension income; splitting a pension between a level annuity, a 3%-escalating annuity and an RPI-linked annuity is one way. Drawdown is a solution for those with larger pots. Whatever they do they shouldn&apos;t ignore the inflation risk.&quot; If you are younger and just starting to save in a pension, inflation is less of a worry. It will be invested in a range of equities that should, over the very long term, at least rise in line with prices. \u2022 If you think deflation is on the way \u2026 Savings Buy Nationwide five-year bonds, 4.15% If you believe the UK economy is set for Japanese-style long-term deflation, locking away savings in fixed-rate bonds is the way to go. Nationwide offers a fixed 4.15% return on its five-year bonds, a good rate in the current climate but which might prove a fabulous one. If inflation falls to -3% and stays there for several years, the decision to save at such a rate would fall into a &quot;greatest financial decisions&quot; category. However, if you believe we are due a shorter period of deflation, and a big jump in interest rates when inflation returns, a different strategy is required. ICICI Bank will let you lock away your money for one year at 3.9% or two years at 4.1%. The India-owned bank is 100% protected by the UK&apos;s financial compensation scheme up to \u00a350,000. If you have a minimum \u00a310,000 cash, Close Brothers this week launched a two-year, fixed-rate bond paying 4.3%. Anyone riding out two years of falling prices, and the zero interest rates that would surely follow, would be very happy as their savings earned more than 4% \u2013 particularly if rates start rising quickly from 2011, allowing them to then jump ship and redeploy their significantly enhanced reserves. Mortgages Buy First Direct tracker, at 2.39% above Bank of England base rate If deflation takes hold, interest rates will probably remain ultra low, so you don&apos;t want to fix at a high rate. Instead, those looking for a new home loan might want a deal that tracks the Bank of England base rate. First Direct has one of the best tracker mortgages on the market at 2.39% above Bank of England base rate for life, giving a current pay rate of 2.89%. But, as London &amp; Country&apos;s David Hollingworth points out, while that might look like a brilliant rate right now it&apos;s not going to look so good if the base rate is 5%. That deal&apos;s pay rate would be 7.39%. Investments Buy M&amp;G Gilt and Fixed Interest, Allianz Pimco Gilt Yield The winners from deflation will be government bonds, assuming the government does not default on payments, or the bonds of top-quality, recession-proof companies. These pay a set interest, which will be worth more at a time when prices are falling. You can buy gilts direct or through a fund, such as Allianz Pimco Gilt Yield (up 14.5% over the past year) or M&amp;G Gilt and Fixed Interest (up 11%). Investment adviser David Kauders of Kauders Portfolio Management has for years warned about an impending bear market, and believes it has far to go. Capital destruction in stock markets, falling house prices and job losses will knock inflation on the head, and the only place to preserve your capital is in gilts, he says. &quot;The world has changed. Yet most economic advice, and financial and investment advice, assumes inflation is here for ever. Everyone needs to accept that deflation matters more than inflation. If you plan for deflation, you won&apos;t be caught out. Deflation makes fixed-income more valuable. If you plan, instead, for inflation, you will be disappointed. Only gilts do well in a deflationary environment,&quot; he adds. Property won&apos;t bail you out. Huge mortgages will remain a growing burden on those who took them out, particularly as companies impose pay freezes. Meanwhile, prospective buyers will defer purchases in anticipation of lower prices, which will in itself hasten the deflationary spiral. Pensions Buy State pension, AVCs Pensioners dependent on state handouts could be the unlikely winners from deflation. State pensions change at the start of each tax year on 6 April, and the increase is based on the RPI the previous September. Last year, that was at a relatively high 5% rather than this week&apos;s zero rate. So the basic state pension will rise from \u00a390.70 to \u00a395.25 for a single person. Even if deflation continues, and prices start falling year in, year out, pensioners are protected. The government is committed to increasing the state pension by RPI or 2.5% a year, whichever is higher. So if prices remain static over the coming year, and most workers suffer pay freezes or pay cuts, pensioners will enjoy an increase in the basic state pension from \u00a395.25 to around \u00a397.65 in 2010. But those who took inflation-linked annuities could find their income falling if inflation turns negative. Annuities from Prudential and Standard Life could fall, while those from Norwich Union and L&amp;G will not decrease, but then will not rise until RPI has reached its previous level. AXA policies are under review. Many people with final-salary pensions are protected from deflation. Most schemes were set up in the days when inflation was common and offer annual minimum increases in benefits, often 3%, regardless of RPI. But for younger workers saving into a pension, deflation is likely to be bad news. It tends to hurt equities, in which pensions are invested. Not only might workers suffer pay cuts, they may also be asked to pay more into their pension via additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) - with no guarantees as to how much they will pay out.", "tags": ["Savings", "Mortgages", "Investments", "Pensions", "Deflation", "Inflation", "Consumer affairs", "BP", "Money", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-28T00:05:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/27/earth-hour-climate-change-wwf", "sentences": ["Making us all more aware of the energy we use is a critical first step in making lasting changes to our lifestyles.&quot; The Eiffel Tower, Shanghai&apos;s Hong Kong New World Tower, the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Sydney&apos;s Opera House and Table Mountain in Cape Town will all take part."], "title": "Big Ben and Houses of Parliament to switch off the lights for Earth Hour", "article": "At 8:30pm today the luminous face of Big Ben will go dark. Next door, the houses of parliament will switch off all its lights too, along with thousands of landmarks, buildings and people around the world in a global gesture of solidarity in the fight against climate change. From the international dateline, Earth Hour starts in New Zealand&apos;s Chatham Islands and will conclude in Honolulu. Passed like a baton around the planet, cities including Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Moscow, Istanbul, Dubai, Cape Town and Las Vegas will be darkened for an hour at 8:30pm local time to mark Earth Hour, the single biggest mass event to mark public concern over global warming. More than 3,200 cities across 88 countries have signed up and the event has received support from international leaders including Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. Environment campaign group WWF, which is co-ordinating the global event, expects hundreds of millions of people around the world to take part in turning out their lights for an hour, in the hope of sending a direct message to world leaders that their voters want urgent action to save the planet from rising temperatures. &quot;Earth Hour is shaping up to be an impressive symbolic response to our planet in peril,&quot; said the climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, who is supporting the event. &quot;Popular pressure like this will leave little doubt around the negotiating table in Copenhagen this December that a meaningful global carbon deal must be delivered. Making us all more aware of the energy we use is a critical first step in making lasting changes to our lifestyles.&quot; The Eiffel Tower, Shanghai&apos;s Hong Kong New World Tower, the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Sydney&apos;s Opera House and Table Mountain in Cape Town will all take part. In London, Nelson&apos;s Column, City Hall, the National Gallery and the National Theatre will switch off their lights. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol, the Belfast Wheel and Scotland&apos;s Forth rail bridge and Edinburgh castle will all go dark. Over 1,200 schools in the UK have also been active in the run-up to Earth Hour, with pupils receiving lessons on the challenges faced by climate change. WWF&apos;s head of campaigns, Colin Butfield, said the idea was that children would then go home and pester their parents to turn out lights . Members of the Women&apos;s Institute have also been encouraged to support the event at home. Almost 400 British businesses are also taking part. Furniture retailer Ikea will turn off the lights outside its stores while Coca-Cola will switch off its advertising screen at Piccadilly Circus, only the third time it has been extinguished since the second world war. &quot;We hope it communicates the importance of everybody being involved in this and hopefully this will increase awareness that everybody needs to do their part, that includes governments, NGOs and individuals,&quot; said Coca-Cola&apos;s Euan Wilmshurst. Green electricity company, Good Energy, has written to its 25,000 customers, encouraging them to turn out their lamps and light candles for an hour instead. Founder and chief executive Juliet Davenport encouraged people at home to play candle-lit board games and said that mass events such as Earth Hour allowed people to see how small actions, of the kind needed to tackle climate change at an individual level, could add up to something influential on a global scale. The idea for Earth Hour grew out of a similar campaign held by WWF&apos;s Australian campaigners in 2007. For the global version, the campaign group chose 2009 because of the negotiations in Copenhagen to set climate targets after the Kyoto protocol runs out in 2012. Campaigners have not calculated the amount of energy that might be saved by the combined action around the world, arguing that Earth Hour is more symbolic than a direct attempt to save carbon emissions. &quot;When global leaders meet at the UN conference in Copenhagen later this year, they are going to determine how the world will work together to tackle climate change in future. We need them to know that the eyes of the world will be upon them,&quot; said Butfield. &quot;Earth Hour is a simple way for people all over the world to make sure our leaders really understand that people are looking to them to do what is right and that the time for action is now.&quot; Not everyone is so positive, however. Organisers had hoped for the participation from the Forbidden City in Beijing but Chinese government officials have told their citizens to hold back because Earth hour clashes with Serf Liberation Day in Tibet, a new holiday to commemorate the ousting of the Dalai Lama from the province. George Marshall, of the charity Climate Outreach and Information Network, questioned whether darkness was the right symbol. &quot;This action offers darkness, regression and the threat of less. Light has always been a symbol of progress, civilisation, intelligence, truth. Turning off lights has always been a symbol of collapse \u2011 the Dark Ages.&quot; But Andy Ridley, of WWF in Australia, said: &quot;For the people who take part, we hope there is a sense of empowerment, the knowledge that however small or big the actions you can effect in your life, whether you are a CEO or doing your GCSEs you can make a difference when these actions are brought together.&quot;", "tags": ["Earth Hour", "Climate change", "Energy", "World news", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-28T00:05:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/29/earth-hour-climate-change-lights-out", "sentences": ["In Shanghai, government buildings were dimmed."], "title": "Earth Hour: when the world put out the lights", "article": "   Sydney Harbour Bridge just before, and during Earth Hour.

At Scott Base in Antarctica, the winter team from New Zealand reduced their lighting to minimum safety lamps and switched off all appliances and computers. In Beijing, officials turned out lights at the Olympic Bird&apos;s Nest Stadium and Water Cube venues. In Shanghai, government buildings were dimmed. WWF, the environment campaign group which was co-ord\u00adinating the global event, expected millions of people to turn out lights in the hope of sending a message to world leaders that their voters want urgent action to save the planet. Andy Riley of WWF Australia, who co-ordinated the global event, said: &quot;We need massive change; one hour in terms of change is not that much. We want people to think about what they can do to lower their carbon footprint, and ideally take that beyond the hour.&quot; The idea for Earth Hour grew out of a similar WWF Australia campaign in 2007. For the global version, the group chose 2009 because of the negotiations scheduled in Copenhagen later this year to set climate targets for when the Kyoto protocol runs out in 2012. Colin Butfield, head of campaigns at WWF UK, said: &quot;Earth Hour is a simple way to make sure that our leaders really understand that people are looking to them to do what is right and that the time for action is now.&quot;", "tags": ["Earth Hour", "Energy", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-29T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/29/world-snooker-championship-2009-sheffield", "sentences": ["Another danger is Chester-born Ricky Walden, 26, making his Crucible debut but last autumn beat O&apos;Sullivan in the final of the Shanghai Masters to win his first ranking tournament."], "title": "The briefing: The World Snooker Championship, 18 April-4 May, Sheffield", "article": "It is no longer associated with heavy smoking, whispering Ted Lowe or finishes in the early hours, but the World Snooker Championship retains an affectionate place in the hearts of the British sporting public.

The Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, a cramped, forbidding arena, has become a venue where reputations have been made and destroyed since it first staged the championship in 1977. The standard of play on show this year will dwarf anything seen in the sport&apos;s 80s heyday. The Hurricanes and Whirlwinds of days gone by have blown away and been replaced by frighteningly skilful cueists, 32 of whom will do battle for the \u00a3250,000 first prize. The favourite, once again, is Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan. But this is his 17th World Championship and he is looking for only his fourth title, so he has experienced more than his fair share of disappointment and, at 33, is considered something of a veteran. This title is invariably won by players in their twenties. It is also almost always won by a British player, although the Chinese are coming and will be guaranteed a player through to the second round because Ding Junhui and Liang Wenbo have drawn each other. Two of the legends of the sport, six-time champion Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry, a seven-time winner, have each played 80 matches at the Crucible. Davis, at 51 the circuit&apos;s oldest player, beat his first round opponent - Australian Neil Robertson - in last October&apos;s Glasgow Grand Prix. Hendry, 40, has the toughest possible first-round draw in the shape of two-time winner Mark Williams. To win the World Championship you need many things: to be mentally and, yes, physically fit; to play your best snooker; to have little bits of luck. What you need most of all is 73 frames over 17 days, and so many things can shake a player&apos;s confidence. This is a marathon of the mind, and many have cracked under the unique pressure the Crucible creates. There is no cheering, chanting mob here, only the reverential hush of a crowd transfixed by the artists of the green baize. Baize of glory: The four main contenders  Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan(No 1 seed) O&apos;Sullivan was simply awesome last year in winning his third world title and enhancing his reputation as the game&apos;s dominant force. He has won three titles so far this season and, though the doubts will always remain about his fractious mental state, he relishes playing at the Crucible. Stephen Maguire(No 2 seed) Maguire, 28, is yet to win the world title but has vowed to do so by the time he is 30. Fiercely determined, he broke a wall tile backstage last year by banging his fist into it after missing out on a 147. His temperament could be his main problem in what looks to be a favourable draw. Mark Selby(No 4 seed) Selby was runner-up two years ago and has since developed into one of snooker&apos;s most accomplished all-rounders, combining heavy scoring with deadly tactical play. He has quickened up but is still adept at toughing it out in long safety duels, a rare quality among the younger players. Ali Carter(No 7 seed) Since losing 18-8 to O&apos;Sullivan in last year&apos;s final, Carter has come on leaps and bounds, winning his first major title - the Welsh Open - and appearing in three ranking-event semi-finals. With his confidence soaring, this qualified pilot has the game to go one better this year. The outsiders to watch Nobody goes for more outlandish pots than China&apos;s 22-year-old Liang Wenbo, above, who reached the quarter-finals on his Crucible debut last year, losing to Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan. Seemingly oblivious to pressure, the left-hander is one player the elite will want to avoid. Another danger is Chester-born Ricky Walden, 26, making his Crucible debut but last autumn beat O&apos;Sullivan in the final of the Shanghai Masters to win his first ranking tournament. 175 The total number of players to have competed at the Crucible in Sheffield since it first staged the World Championship, in 1977. \u2022 The World Snooker Championship will be shown on BBC and Eurosport", "tags": ["World Snooker Championship", "Snooker", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-29T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/29/cool-britannia-g20-blair-brown", "sentences": ["But internationally the places that are most alluring to young Indians are Shanghai and Dubai.", "I think India&apos;s such a fascinating place that once you&apos;ve lived here it&apos;s difficult to leave.The place to be Shanghai or Dubai  Detmar Blow, art dealer  The 90s were like the 60s."], "title": "This time I've come to bury Cool Britannia", "article": "A few days before Barack Obama&apos;s inauguration I was sitting in a BBC studio in west London, a tiny microphone clipped to my lapel, and waiting to go on-air. On one of the TV monitors there were scenes of exultation as Americans flocked to a pre-inaugural event that formed part of the Passion play surrounding the ascension of the 44th President of the United States of America. One of the BBC presenters leaned over to me and said: &quot;We just don&apos;t do hope here, do we?&quot; I thought about that afterwards. Actually, we did do hope here, and it wasn&apos;t that long ago. True, it feels now like another era. The time was 1997. John Major was on the way out, along with 18 years of Conservative rule. Tony Blair was on the way in. It was the age, as hundreds of headlines proclaimed, of &quot;Cool Britannia&quot;. We look back - after Iraq, after all the disappointments - and what we mostly remember, cynically, is this bright, shiny, smiling young man crossing the threshold at 10 Downing Street amid a throng of Labour faithful and party-issue flags. But the moment was, to be fair, much richer than that. Blair didn&apos;t just represent the end of Tory dominance; he represented the beginning of something, too. The electorate, especially perhaps those middle Englanders who voted Labour for the first time, saw him as their skywalker, the man who would lead post-imperial Britain, post-Thatcher Britain, into the uncharted 21st century. It was, all in all, a good time. How different everything is today. Optimism is a thing of the past (&quot;We just don&apos;t do hope here, do we?&quot;). Blair, in the popular imagination at least, is an ex-statesman out making speeches and cashing in on his Downing Street years; Gordon Brown is a well-meaning technocrat incapable of steering Britain through these depressed and complicated times; and Brown&apos;s likely replacement, David Cameron, is a nice guy, and getting nicer, but a guy who, again in the public perception at least, lacks the grit, savvy and blockbuster ideas to navigate us through this perilous economic barrier reef. Having been there at the creation of the &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; phenomenon, I must in all good conscience preside over its demise. In a few days, as the leaders of the world&apos;s 19 largest economies and the president of the European Union gather for the G20 Summit, London will once again, and if only for a few hours, be in the spotlight. The London they and the world see will be, if not unrecognisable from the London of the mid-1990s, then a very different place from the London of those days when hope and optimism reigned. I first came to this country as a visitor in the early 1980s. The London I saw was the maligned metropolis of tiresome clich\u00e9s: a drab place with great history, poor heating and worse food. By the time I returned to live and work here in 1996, London had been transformed. And I did a story about it. In the breathless language of an American news magazine, London was not only cool but &quot;the coolest city on the planet&quot;. &quot;London Rules,&quot; said the Newsweek cover, which featured a sleek female model wearing a striking Philip Treacy hat in the shape of the union flag. I never used the words &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; but, as you can imagine, my story nonetheless launched a thousand &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; ships. This was no mere confection on my part. London was in fact stunning to behold. If loss of empire was once a drag on the spirit of the British people, the immigration that resulted in part from that loss had by the mid-1990s become a major driving force behind the richly multicultural London blossoming before our eyes. It was a heady time, and even Thatcherism could be seen in an appealing light: as detested as it was by so many, Thatcherism had worked a kind of alchemy on British society, effecting a multitude of changes, from the economy to the arts, some of which were not intended by the Iron Lady herself. Thatcher&apos;s Big Bang revolutionised the City. A new generation of masters of the universe (the ones we used to envy and now loathe) replaced the less inventive and less aggressive pinstriped stockbrokers and bankers of old. London was the centre of this revolution in British life. We now scorn the world of finance. But the City was perhaps the single greatest driver behind the prosperity and laissez-faire gumption that cascaded across the country. During my early years here the number of foreign banks in London grew from 73 in the mid-1980s to 479, including 10 American banks that alone employed 21,000 people. Think back to the sheer energy that crackled through the Square Mile, part of a financial and related business-services industry that makes up roughly a quarter of the British economy. In a show of confidence, even defiance, property developers planned massive buildings in and around sites in the City that had been bombed by the IRA just four years earlier. As London prospered it drew closer and closer to New York. Money, people and ideas flowed back and forth between the two great world cities. Wall Street salaries, bonuses and even dress codes began to shape City life: in some instances London law firms had to double what they paid newly qualified lawyers because of pressure from the New York competition; City boys began wearing chinos and shirts open at the neck. It was not uncommon for those who could afford it to own homes in both cities. Then, as now, more money was churning through London and New York than through all the rest of the world&apos;s financial centres combined. Out of all this grew NY-LON, a single city separated by an ocean. The phenomenal changes reshaping London didn&apos;t stop at the world of finance. By the mid-1990s London had become a hotspot for art and design. Some London art dealers and collectors, such as Jay Jopling and Charles Saatchi, were more famous than their artists - and some artists were more famous than their art. For years the London architect Richard Rogers was known mainly for having designed the Pompidou Centre in Paris in the 1970s; now, finally, he had more work than he could handle in his home town, including the proposed new Terminal 5 at Heathrow. The week before my story came out, plans were announced for a glorious Ferris wheel on the Thames - what would become the London Eye, one of the UK&apos;s most popular paid-entry tourist attractions. In the fashion world, Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design was the place to learn the trade. The Paris fashion houses Givenchy and Dior installed two of its graduates, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, as their top couturiers. Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan and Tommy Hilfiger were all putting stores in Bond Street. Eurostar had brought the continent right into the heart of London. Arriving in droves, young advertising creative types were coming to London to hone their skills and soak up its by then famous nightlife. Clubs such as the Ministry of Sound, then edgy and fresh, were pulling in young people from Europe and beyond. Immigrants from around the world pumped new skills, innovation, enthusiasm and just plain hard work into a labour-hungry, creatively starved economy. My &quot;London Rules&quot; story was a media sensation. One day not long after it hit the newsstands I got a call from the research department at Conservative Central Office, asking for copies. Within days there stood John Major at the Lord Mayor of London&apos;s banquet, embracing &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; and boasting that &quot;our theatres give the lead to Broadway, our pop culture rules the airwaves, our country has taken over the fashion catwalks of Paris&quot;. Not that it did Major much good. It was Tony Blair who benefited from the changes that were sweeping through London and Britain a dozen years ago. For a while at least, somewhat like Obama today in America, Blair was for many Britons that breath of political fresh air that comes along once in a great while and defines an era. Though his life story and political career are no match for the drama and historical significance of America&apos;s first black president, the man who marched up Downing Street with his family on 2 May 1997 inspired hope and optimism in a nation yearning to push off from the past and sail around the coming millennium into a new century. Like the country that was coming into its own in those years, Blair was unstuffy, unembarrassed by wealth, newly confident. He was also relatively young - just 43 when he took office. His wife not only worked; she earned much more than he did. There would be children again at 10 Downing Street. The language of class warfare would fade, replaced by talk of &quot;community&quot;, which sounded good even if not everybody could figure out what it meant. New Labour, New Britain, as the Labour party slogan said. Onward and upward. The Blair era is long gone, and so too is the national spirit, the hope and the optimism, that reigned in those days. Gordon Brown, though he seems invigorated by economic catastrophe, suffers from the grey, been-there-too-long aura that wreathed Major in the aftermath of Thatcher. As if that weren&apos;t bad enough, Brown suffers by comparison to Obama. Obama - with a Baedeker background that took him from Jakarta to Honolulu, to Africa in search of his roots and self, with his unmistakable self-assurance, with his curiosity and intellect, not to mention his inability to live without his BlackBerry - is very 21st century. However unfairly, Brown, who turned 58 in February and is not that much older than the 47-year-old president, seems trapped in the 20th. Psychologically and physically, Brown resembles the new presidential limo built for Obama: fitted with military-grade armour eight inches thick, wheels equipped with run-flat tires, and bullet-proof windows with glass so thick they block out much natural light. He does himself no favours by seeking to ingratiate himself with the American leader - an exercise in what the historian Timothy Garton Ash calls &quot;the Jeeves school of diplomacy&quot; that will surely be on display at the London Summit on Thursday. Although the US and the UK are both racked by economic chaos, America feels like a country on the move and Britain a country at a standstill. The thriving, dynamic Britain of the 1990s has not quite turned into the &quot;Iceland-on-Thames&quot; of the Observer columnist Will Hutton&apos;s fears, and London is not Reykjavik. But as we sink deeper into recession and the number of unemployed multiplies around us, what many of us saw as strengths a decade ago now loom as weaknesses. At times of economic stress, immigration typically falls into disfavour and becomes a hot-button issue; so it is no surprise that the government has decided to impose a \u00a350 &quot;migrant tax&quot; on would-be workers and students coming into the UK from outside of the EU. Glitzy restaurants and cutting-edge fashion that used to be signs of welcome creativity reek of excess in a time of belt-tightening. Heavily mortgaged homes that looked like brilliant retirement nest eggs when property prices were soaring year after year now just look like basket cases. Construction sites and street works that once raised expectations of things to come now seem like major inconveniences. Damien Hirst&apos;s diamond-encrusted skull from two years ago now looks like the perfect artefact to draw the line between the excess of the recent past and the frightful times coming our way.  As for the City of London, the cut and thrust of entrepreneurship that looked smart just a few years ago now looks reckless. The great engine room of British prosperity now feels like an anchor - a drag on Britain&apos;s recovery and one among several explanations behind the International Monetary Fund&apos;s assessment that the UK&apos;s economic slump will be worse than that of any other advanced economy. This past week, Britain slipped into deflation - a decline in general price levels - for the first time in 50 years. Meanwhile unemployment has passed the 2 million mark, possibly headed for a devastating 3 million. With gloom spreading, bankers are fearful of revealing their occupation in pubs, politicians are under fire for padding their expense accounts, the gigantic new Westfield London mall on the edge of Shepherd&apos;s Bush Green - one of the largest shopping centres in Europe - is eerily quiet, and neither VAT tax cuts nor stimulus programmes can coax consumers into spending more.  In this climate an undercurrent of defeatism threatens to revive what Blair once called &quot;post-Empire malaise&quot;. He used the phrase more than 10 years ago, at a time when he felt Britain was emerging from that syndrome, but the disease&apos;s symptoms are appearing now - a lack of confidence, an unsettled sense of identity. Blair saw Britain&apos;s so-called special relationship with America as a way forward. Britain, he reckoned, could use US economic ties to strengthen the British economy and maintain London&apos;s status as a world-class financial centre. By joining forces with Washington on the global stage, Britain could punch above its weight. Through the war in Kosovo and 9/11, Blair&apos;s strategy seemed to work. But his alliance with George Bush in Iraq backfired, and Britons soured on what they saw as a grossly unequal relationship. Brown had his own prescription for dealing with post-Empire malaise. Two years ago he launched a now all-but-forgotten &quot;Britishness&quot; campaign. Cynics saw it as a crass political ploy to counter his Scottishness. But it was more than that. If he didn&apos;t see the financial meltdown coming, he did see the social pressures that were building that would threaten the country&apos;s cohesion. At the time Britain was struggling to absorb the greatest wave of immigration in its history: in 2004 and 2005 alone more than 600,000 immigrants poured in, mostly from eastern Europe. In 2005, the 7/7 London bombings, carried out as they were by home-grown radicals, delivered a grim message to an anxious society: terrorism is being nurtured on British soil. Brown&apos;s Britishness campaign looks to be all but shelved but a darkening economic mood threatens to revive British insecurities. Staving off a collective sinking feeling will not be easy. Some of the pillars that British identity once rested upon are long gone or substantially weakened: empire, the country&apos;s great industrial base, the monarchy and the Church of England. Even the English language suffers in its birthplace: it may dominate the globe but, according to a recent Home Office study, only 26% of the 1.3 million British residents of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent are fluent in it. By choice as much as by accident of geography and history, Britain has become an outlier among world powers, an island in more ways than one. Unlike France or Germany, Britain&apos;s place in Europe does not help give it a settled identity; Britons are even less pro-European today than they were in the mid-1990s. If the Europhile Blair saw Britain as a bridge between America and the continent, Brown seems disinclined to pursue a pro-European agenda (could electoral politics have anything to do with that?) and quite happy to push the British Isles even closer to the United States, especially if, with a general election due before the summer of 2010, he can somehow bask in Obama&apos;s glow. That would perhaps help Brown politically (or it could backfire) but retreating into the special relationship will do nothing to strengthen Britain&apos;s identity.  Surely looking inward, not outward and across the Atlantic, would provide a better path to national identity. For one thing, America is increasingly looking in other directions, to the east (China and Japan are the largest holders of US debt) and to the south (Mexico is the greatest single source of US immigration). More importantly, there&apos;s no reason for Britons to define themselves in American terms. The great strength of London a decade ago was its uniqueness, and if Britannia was cool, it was because it was different. This country - which is my country, too, as a dual US-UK citizen - will do hope again some day. In search of optimism, it&apos;s worth revisiting that erstwhile emblem of New Britain, the Millennium Dome. After its grand (and widely panned) opening as the Millennium Experience on 31 December, 1999, the \u00a3789m project was all but abandoned, much like the disused east London gas works upon which it was built. Not a few people considered its mishandled opening on that chilly, rainy New Year&apos;s Eve to be the beginning of the end of Cool Britannia. Sure enough, the Dome went through any number of disappointing incarnations, from homeless shelter to funfair to the scene of a failed diamond heist. But now, improbably, it&apos;s back - as the successful O2 arena. It&apos;s a comeback worth recalling as we trudge through the coming months of recession and recrimination. \u2022 Stryker McGuire was Newsweek&apos;s London Bureau Chief from 1996 to 2008.

But Gordon Brown does not have Blair&apos;s celebrity cachet. Now it is all about Barack Obama, and New York and Los Angeles are both on bended knee to Washington. To be in New York after the collapse of Wall Street does not feel cool at all. All the newness - and newness is the essence of cool - is in DC.  It doesn&apos;t help that Barack is just not that interested in Britain. He has none of that lingering WASP snobbery about it that Reagan and George Bush Sr had. He has no desire to meet the Queen. His priorities are the American domestic economy and China, China, China.  Another cool place now is Mumbai thanks to Slumdog Millionaire and the emergence of India both culturally and economically as a world force. The place to be Washington DC and Mumbai Julian Gough, British-born author living in Berlin Britain got culturally less interesting the richer it got over the last decade. Oasis, Blur and the YBAs came out of the dole culture of the Thatcher years; they did all their learning in poverty and then New Labour got into office and essentially took the credit for Thatcher&apos;s cultural revolution. For the past few years Berlin has been the underground cultural capital of Europe; economically it has been on it&apos;s knees for most of the century but apparently it has more artists per capita than any other city in the world. Because it&apos;s so cheap here the cost of failure seems much lower and that&apos;s important for creativity. The place to be  Berlin, especially around Warschauer Strasse. Aravind Adiga, 208 Booker Prize winning novelist Mumbai is a lot less cool than it was when I was a kid: now, young well-off Indians would prefer to live in Bangalore, or even Calcutta, which is going through a real renaissance. But internationally the places that are most alluring to young Indians are Shanghai and Dubai. In the midst of the recession they still seem to be growing. I used to live in New York but when I go back I have absolutely no desire to live there. I think India&apos;s such a fascinating place that once you&apos;ve lived here it&apos;s difficult to leave.The place to be Shanghai or Dubai  Detmar Blow, art dealer  The 90s were like the 60s. Everyone felt it was an important cultural decade, and I definitely felt a sense of history. But periods like that come around irregularly, they don&apos;t come every decade. When Issy&apos;s [his late wife Isabella Blow] career took off in the 90s she discovered Philip [Treacy] and then Alexander [McQueen] coming up in &apos;92. So that was happening in fashion, and you had the YBAs in art, and then you had the music coming through with Britpop. It all came together.  One of my friends said: &quot;The music&apos;s going to stop Detmar, but no one knows when.&quot; And now London&apos;s collapsed, like every other city.  In the art world, New York is definitely worse. I think Germany&apos;s doing quite well, and Portugal&apos;s doing well because it&apos;s a small country.The place to be Lisbon 21st-century cool: London still rules Sophia Kokosalaki, fashion designer Britain is still incredibly cool, a world leader in every cultural field. I came here from Greece in 1996 at the height of &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; and I remember the Downing Street party and all the fuss. Just because we are not throwing the same parties does not mean exciting stuff is not happening. And one of the coolest things is that it is a truly multicultural society. People can come here from anywhere in the world and feel they belong.The place to be Hackney Vesna Maric, author Growing up in Bosnia I dreamt about going to London; for me it&apos;s always been the place for music, fashion, youth culture. Because of the credit crunch there&apos;s a lot of talk about British society being too individualistic, but that&apos;s partly why there&apos;s so much innovation and creativity here - you can be who you want to be.The place to be Dalston, especially Cafe Oto, or Hackney Wick, particularly the Schwartz Gallery Gavin Turk, artist When Sarah Lucas, Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin started to appear on the front of magazines and newspapers in the 90s it felt like something was really happening; the idea that artists could actually help sell a magazine was incredible. And, culturally, London is still vital. It&apos;s producing great new bands, advertising, media, films, TV comedy and there&apos;s an avant garde of sorts that is still working. London&apos;s biggest problem is that it&apos;s become impossible to travel around unless you cycle everywhere. The place to be Vyner Street and Broadway Market, Hackney; Dalston Toby Young, author of How To Lose Friends and Alienate People Is Britannia still cool? I think these kinds of designations are meaningless. Vanity Fair&apos;s &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; issue was my idea and I effectively edited that issue of the magazine. Persuading the editors - and the reading public - that Britain was cool was simply a question of asserting this to be the case as emphatically as possible until they believed it. It does not surprise me one bit that Stryker has changed his mind. The place to be Shepherd&apos;s Bush Green Miquita Oliver, television presenter My walk to school went past Damon Albarn&apos;s house: it was such a big deal. That &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; thing was around for about five years whereas now things happen for two weeks; stuff that&apos;s meant to be under-the-radar is quickly brought into the mainstream. I read [Blur&apos;s] Alex James&apos;s book recently and I was thinking, &quot;God, we&apos;re not doing anything half as interesting as all that lot were doing.&quot; London&apos;s still got it though - you&apos;ve just got to look in the right places.

Since claiming victory in the first race of the season for the newly renamed Brawn GP, however, Button has been plagued by a different and more unfamiliar kind of pressure \u2013 one of expectation \u2013 and he is relishing it. &quot;I think about things too much and that made it very difficult last season and especially this winter [when Honda quit],&quot; Button said. &quot;There have been hard times on the way here. Times when I wondered whether I could go on. But I never lost faith in myself. Never. I have been working hard in training and I am glad I have a passion for another sport, triathlon. That has kept my mind away from , &apos;This could be it, this could be the end of my career in F1.&apos; &quot;In those dark moments it&apos;s not good to be on your own. That&apos;s why Jessica has helped me so much. She&apos;s taken my mind off things when it&apos;s been needed and, to be honest, when it&apos;s not been.&quot; Button said he was surprisingly comfortable in the sudden interest generated in him by his coup in the Australian grand prix. &quot;I know that this kind of attention comes with winning, so it&apos;s not a problem,&quot; he said. &quot;Actually I wouldn&apos;t swap it for anything on earth. I&apos;m sure that a brilliant season lies ahead and I am determined to make it count. &quot;If I&apos;d had this car in 2002, I might have had a chance of winning the title but I wouldn&apos;t have been the complete driver I am now,&quot; he added. &quot;Compared to some in F1 I might be too old. Compared to the guy who won last year&apos;s world championship I am just five years older. I have 10 years&apos; experience \u2013 it is the best position to be in. Fitness-wise I don&apos;t have to worry and my reactions are still bloody good.&quot; Yet Button&apos;s victory, for all its remarkable merit, \u00adcontinues to be overshadowed by a court of appeal questioning the \u00adlegality of his car. The case will not be heard until after the Malaysian grand prix this weekend, continuing the bad feeling the new season could do without. Life for Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, will become even tougher in Malaysia despite his fortunate third place in the season-opening race. That was the stark warning yesterday from Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team principal, who nonetheless insisted they would do every\u00adthing possible to get Hamilton&apos;s world championship defence back on track. &quot;Frankly I think Malaysia will be very tough for this season,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we will improve the car but I think it is a high-speed, technical circuit. We are lacking in downforce at the moment and therefore it is going to be tough. &quot;We have an aggressive development strategy; we have to pick up the performance of the car. We will have new parts at all of the next races and we have to keep pushing until we are quick enough to \u00adreliably score points.&quot; However, Hamilton doubts he will be able to claim another third place since his McLaren will remain more or less unchanged and he believes the Brawns of Button and his team-mate, Rubens \u00adBarrichello, will be out in front again . &quot;There will probably be a bigger difference between us and the Brawn car,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;I expect that we will be a little bit further behind because Sepang has quite a few fast and flowing corners and that&apos;s where we struggled in \u00adMelbourne. I couldn&apos;t keep up with cars such as the Toyota, so this race will be a bit of a test for us. &quot;But we have some development parts for the third round in Shanghai so, hopefully, we will have started to close the gap a bit. Finishing third in Melbourne was the result we needed to keep everyone motivated.

The siblings have what could be called an up-and-down relationship but will take the stage in Seoul on Wednesday night on the latest leg of their world tour. However the battling brothers have nothing on the fraternal fun and games going on at the same time just a few miles up the Olympic Expressway, as South Korea host North Korea in a match that will go a long way to deciding if they appear on the world stage together in 2010. In the past, most would have expected that could happen only as part of a united team. Token suggestions were made upon recent South Korean qualifications that a few northern lads (it is not just England that has only 1966 to celebrate and not just Middlesbrough fans that miss Ayresome Park) should go along for the sake of peninsular peace. It never happened. Now though, North Korea are top of their group in the final stage of qualification with 10 points with five of the eight games played. South Korea, with a game in hand over everyone, are second with two points fewer and traditional Asian giants Iran and Saudi Arabia are struggling a little in third and fourth. With the top two qualifying automatically, the media, in the south at least, is getting excited. It is hard to tell in the north \u2013 the newsreader who usually appears may be Kim Jong-il&apos;s favourite but she doesn&apos;t seem the football type. Not so the commentators of Seoul&apos;s SBS TV, who could almost have been watching South Korea, so excited did they get last Saturday when DPRK downed UAE. Excitement off the pitch is welcome, although you don&apos;t want too much between two heavily armed neighbours that are still technically at war. Recent games between the two have been duller than the recent general election in the north \u2013 but without the clear winner. After just two friendly meetings between 1993 and 2008, Wednesday&apos;s clash will be the fifth in 14 months and the previous four all ended all square. This is a little different \u2013 and not only because South Africa is so close. Relations between the two countries are as bad as they have been for years. As of March, of all the planes that enter and depart the busy Incheon International Airport, only Chinese and Russian craft still cut through North Korean airspace. All other carriers have switched after Pyongyang announced it could no longer guarantee their safety. This comes amid an expected missile/satellite (depending on who you believe) launch expected to happen between 4-8 April that has the region and the US on tenterhooks. Air-raid sirens were sounded in Seoul on 16 March, a drill that was common in the past but less so these days and came just after northern threats following joint US-Korean army manoeuvres. The language used by papers and portals in Seoul is warmer towards the players than it is to Kim Jong Il. The likes of Hong Yong Jo, Mun In Guk, who looked baffled when presented with his man of the match award against Saudi Arabia \u2013 a phone made by Samsung, the epitome of southern capitalism and one that he can&apos;t use at home - and especially Jong Tae Se are stars south of the border. North Korea are improving as the campaign progresses. After the &apos;Great Leader&apos; Kim Il Sung withdrew the team from international competition following a dismal attempt to reach USA 1994, the Chollima virtually disappeared until the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. Since then, they have been known for defending in numbers and counter-attacking at speed. Their last two victories at home to Saudi Arabia and UAE, however, were examples of intelligent and patient possession football, punctuated by great goals. It makes one wonder how good the team would be if they had the advantages of the south. &quot;South Korea continuously qualify for World Cups,&quot; midfielder An Yong Hak told me last year. &quot;They play lots of friendly games against good teams. North Korea don&apos;t have that kind of experience. We don&apos;t play many games against strong teams from Europe or South America.&quot; There is a difference in facilities, too. If the members of the People&apos;s Army guarding the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone that separates the two nations trained their binoculars just a couple of miles to the south, they might make out South Korea training at the Paju National Football Centre, a pristine get-away-from-it-all complex of accommodation and football pitches nestling in the mountains 30 miles north of Seoul. It was Hiddink who pushed for Paju and, while the semi-finals may not beckon in the immediate future, the long-term outlook is bright. Of the 2002 heroes, Park Ji-sung is the only outfield player still sure of a summons these days, although goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae is hanging on. Park, just turned 28, is the mentor to budding stars such as talented midfielders Ki Sung-yung and Lee Chung-yung, both eight years his junior but now almost as established in the national team and on the radar of big European clubs. They are more welcome than North Korea missiles but whatever happens later in the week, Wednesday night will be all about two teams doing battle with the World Cup as a prize.", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "South Korea", "Football", "Sport", "North Korea", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-31T09:26:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/31/china-open-snooker-stephen-maguire", "sentences": ["Walden, the 2008 Roewe Shanghai Masters Champion, made it eight consecutive wins in China with the victory and will now take on the winner of Stephen Hendry&apos;s match with Robert Milkins."], "title": "Stephen Maguire crashes out of China Open in first round", "article": "Defending champion and world number two Stephen Maguire was sent crashing out of the China Open at the first hurdle today by Dave Harold, ranked 28th in the world.

Unfortunately, relations soured because of the previous US administration&apos;s plans \u2013 specifically, deployment of the US global missile defence system in Eastern Europe, efforts to push Nato&apos;s borders eastward and refusal to ratify the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. All of these positions undermined Russia&apos;s interests and, if implemented, would inevitably require a response on our part. I believe that removing such obstacles to good relations would be beneficial to our countries \u2013 essentially removing &quot;toxic assets&quot; to make good a negative balance sheet \u2013 and beneficial to the world.  This will require joint efforts. The exchange of letters between myself and President Obama this year showed mutual readiness to build mature bilateral relations in a pragmatic and businesslike manner. For that we have a &quot;road map&quot; \u2013 the Strategic Framework Declaration our countries signed in Sochi in 2008. It is essential that the positive ideas in that declaration be brought to life. We are ready for that.  Possible areas of cooperation abound. For instance, I agree with President Obama that resuming the disarmament process should become our immediate priority. The wish to ensure absolute security in a unilateral way is a dangerous illusion. I am encouraged that our new partners in Washington realise this.  It also appears that we all understand the need to search for collective solutions to the problems facing Afghanistan, with the involvement of all influential players. In this spirit, Moscow hosted a broad-based conference on Afghanistan under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. We welcome the US initiative to convene a United Nations conference in the Netherlands. It is critical that Russia and the United States view these conferences as mutually reinforcing rather than competitive.  Neither Russia nor the United States can tolerate drift and indifference in our relations. I spoke in Washington last November about the need to put an end to the crisis of confidence. To begin with, we should agree that overcoming our common negative legacy is possible only by ensuring equality and mutual benefit and by taking into account our mutual interests. I am ready for such work with President Obama on the basis of these principles, and I hope to begin as early as tomorrow at our first meeting in London before the G20 summit.  The state of the global economy is a great concern to all. We can ensure the sustainability of the global financial system only by making its architecture mutually complementary and reliant on a diversified system of regional reserve currencies and financial centres. During the summit, Russia and the United States can help lead the effort to establish universal rules and disciplines that would apply to all parties without exception. We should also think together of whether it might be expedient to introduce a world supranational reserve currency, potentially under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund.  In bilateral relations, we need to see more successful investment projects, joint research and development by companies and increased trade in high-tech products.  The end of the cold war and subsequent globalisation fundamentally altered the geopolitical context of our relations and vastly increased the importance of leadership. Today, effective leadership must be collective, based on the desire and ability to find common denominators for the interests of the international community and major groups of states. The G20 summits are a major step toward this. I am convinced that Russia and the United States can offer much to the world while maintaining our special responsibility in world affairs. These opportunities are most visible on the issues of strategic stability and nuclear security. The nature of the Russian-US relationship to a large extent determines transatlantic politics, which could use trilateral cooperation among the European Union, Russia and the United States as its pillar.  The need to restart our cooperation is prompted in part by the history of our relations, which includes a number of highly emotional moments \u2013 diplomatic support provided by Russia to the United States at critical points of America&apos;s development, our joint fight against fascism and the era of d\u00e9tente.  In his inaugural address, President Obama explicitly expressed his understanding that the United States needed to change together with the rest of the world. His speech deeply impressed me with its unbiased assessment of America&apos;s problems. I agree that greatness is never a given. It must be earned.  Long ago, Alexis de Tocqueville predicted a great future for our two nations. So far, each country has tried to prove the truth of those words to itself and the world by acting on its own. I firmly believe that at this turn of history, we should work together. The world expects Russia and the United States to take energetic steps to establish a climate of trust and goodwill in global politics, not to languish in inaction and disengagement. We cannot fail to meet those expectations.

Shot in the Carpathian mountains, among the Sz\u00e9kely (ethnic Hungarian) communities of Romania, this rape-revenge tragedy with a difference felt like the latest discovery from eastern Europe. And in a way, it was - except that the director, Peter Strickland, comes from Reading. None of the British film people that I talked to before Berlin had heard of Strickland. And the director&apos;s filmography, as printed in the Berlinale catalogue, was scarcely more forthcoming: four short films between 1992 and 1996, then a 13-year silence. Well, not quite silence: the catalogue also informed us that &quot;in 1996, Strickland and some friends founded The Sonic Catering Band, which made a name for itself with body pop, sound poetry and other entomological-acoustic excursions&quot;. Considering one of our lads was in competition - with a tasty, testing, original film that made a refreshing change from the usual Britfilm genres - the UK press corps dedicated surprisingly little space to Strickland. Google his name and Katalin Varga and the only British media report in the first 10 hits is a report from BBC Berkshire, with the deliciously Berk-centric lead &quot;A Reading director&apos;s independent budget film is up against Reading actress Kate Winslet&apos;s Hollywood blockbuster at the Berlin International Film festival&quot;. More illuminating, in terms of the sacrifices many UK film-makers are forced into to get out-of-the-box projects made, is an interview with Strickland in a Hungarian film magazine, which reveals that having despaired of making the film through the usual funding channels, the director financed it by selling a house he inherited from a tax-inspector uncle - but &quot;the money quickly dried up after editing, and I lost my job&quot;.  Taunton-born Conrad Clark, who studied film and anthropology at the School of African and Oriental Studies, also chose to work outside the UK system to make his first feature, Soul Carriage, which picked up the New Directors prize at San Sebastian in 2007 and has been touring festivals ever since. As with Katalin Varga, if it weren&apos;t for the director&apos;s name on the credits, you would naturally take this for a film from the territory it&apos;s set in - which in Clark&apos;s case is China. Telling the story - in laconic, slow-burn style - of a Shanghai construction worker who is asked by his boss to take the corpse of a fellow worker back to his family in a distant rural province, Soul Carriage comes across as a sixth-generation Chinese film in the spirit of early Jia Zhangke.  Clark&apos;s next move was to head to Abu Dhabi to produce a film by Emirati national Saleh Karamah - the writer of the short story Soul Carriage was based on. When I emailed him to ask whether these global wanderings were part of a strategy, the director replied: &quot;It was partly chance through the people I met studying film, and partly the production and financing opportunities of working abroad \u2026 I have gained incredible experience by working on two feature films before I&apos;m 30, and I don&apos;t think I could have achieved this by going through the traditional routes here in the UK.&quot; Both of these illustrious debuts show, rather depressingly, that upcoming British directors who choose to work outside of the UK&apos;s production, media and publicity system will be largely ignored at home - unless, of course, they go to Hollywood. There&apos;s some reassuring news, however. Strickland&apos;s next feature is being produced by arthouse veterans Simon Field and Keith Griffiths, so he won&apos;t have to stake an inheritance this time round. And Clark is back in the UK, working on his second feature as director. Unsurprisingly - for someone who made his feature debut directing a guerrilla-shot Mandarin-language film in China at the age of 27 - he says he&apos;s &quot;determined to remain fringe to the main industry&quot;. I also asked Clark whether anyone in the UK had asked to programme Soul Carriage in the year and a half since its San Sebastian award. His answer was short but eloquent: &quot;No.&quot;", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-01T13:12:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/apr/01/nato-us-iran-russia-afghanistan", "sentences": ["Yet in a welcome sign, the Kremlin invited the United States to observe security talks at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a largely toothless alliance often touted as a bulwark to Nato in Central Asia."], "title": "Lionel Beehner: Nato must build stronger alliances with outsiders like Russia and Iran", "article": "Be wary of 60-year-old acronyms. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation&apos;s \u2013 aka Nato&apos;s \u2013 birthday party this week will be marked by celebrating but also soul-searching. That is because nobody knows what the alliance should stand for anymore, which explains all the studies floating around Washington with sexy names like &quot;Revitalising the Alliance&quot; and &quot;Renewing the Transatlantic Partnership&quot;. The trouble with Nato is that it is too easily distracted. Too much attention is paid to whether or not to expand the alliance&apos;s membership and mandate, and take on new tasks further from continental Europe \u2013 from chasing down pirates to fighting climate change.  Yet when a company is struggling to stay afloat, it does not pick up new acquisitions or tackle projects outside its purview. Instead, it looks for partners. Same goes for security alliances.  The biggest challenge facing Nato is Afghanistan, where it is in desperate need of more resources, both financial and military. Yet Europe appears unlikely to pony up enough forces to make a tangible difference there. And the two countries that can lessen the alliance&apos;s burden there \u2013 Russia and Iran \u2013 are also what keep the alliance&apos;s top brass up at night.  Nato is correct to be reaching out to Russia and Iran, but more needs to be done. Rather than just hold side talks with the Iranians \u2013 the first such conversations in 30 years \u2013 and treating Tehran as just one of several participants invited to the Netherlands to observe (when everyone knows they are the elephant in the room), Nato should include Iran at the table. Maybe even establish a Nato-Iran Council, not unlike the joint framework the alliance has with Russia, given our areas of overlapping concerns there.  Recall how instrumental Iran was in our efforts after 9/11 to rebuild post-war Afghanistan, even if the relationship turned sour by 2003. A failed state, especially one under the Taliban&apos;s thumb, would be  bad news for Tehran. There are already millions of Afghan refugees streaming into Iran. Much of Afghanistan&apos;s opium gets smuggled across Iran&apos;s border, resulting in more drug users and higher HIV infection rates among younger Iranians.  Which is why Nato and Iran should work more closely to secure the border. Nato should also put a muzzle on some of its commanders, including the leader of Nato&apos;s Airborne Early Warning and Control Force, Major-General Axel T\u00fcttelmann, who told reporters: &quot;We would be the first to be called up if the Nato council decided we should be [striking Iran].&quot; And they should drop plans to dump Afghanistan&apos;s president in favour of someone nominally more pro-America. Russia, too, appears to seek more cooperation with Nato on Afghanistan, despite its misgivings about the alliance and even as it continues to flex its muscle in the region. That much was clear after Moscow persuaded (or rather bought off) the Kyrgyz to give America the heave-ho from its airbase there. Yet in a welcome sign, the Kremlin invited the United States to observe security talks at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a largely toothless alliance often touted as a bulwark to Nato in Central Asia.  There remains confusion as to where Russia fits into the &quot;new European security architecture&quot;. Yes, Russia can relax now that the new administration has put on hold plans to build a missile defence shield in Central Europe, and political paralysis in Ukraine and Georgia has put the kibosh on either of them ever joining Nato anytime soon. And recent disarmament breakthroughs are a positive sign. But Nato and Russia should be working in closer cahoots on Afghanistan.  That said, let&apos;s be realistic: this is not the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Despite all the lovey-dovey talk in recent news, neither Russia nor Iran wants Nato to establish too comfy a foothold in South Asia. Nor should Washington kid itself that cooperation with Moscow and Tehran on Afghanistan will necessarily yield breakthroughs on other fronts, namely stalled efforts to dismantle Iran&apos;s nuclear programme.  But for Nato to succeed in places like Afghanistan, it needs to project itself as a kinder, gentler alliance, one willing to work with countries whose democratic ideals may not stand up to the Nato charter. That is not easy for a security bloc burdened by prejudices from a bygone era, a group of democracies \u2013 some old, some fledgling \u2013 for which there are divergent opinions on how to tackle terrorism and treat bogeymen like Russia and Iran.  Nato, a military alliance, has been a given a formidable task \u2013 preventing Afghanistan from re-emerging as a terrorist den \u2013 whose solutions are primarily non-military. While it is good at dropping bombs on dictatorships, the alliance is less effective at repairing roads, promoting good governance and winning hearts and minds. In that regard, Nato is like the ageing typewriter repairman trying to teach himself HTML code. Instead of blindly expanding its roster of members and reach, Nato should be building stronger alliances with outsiders like Russia and Iran. Otherwise it will not survive to see another 60 years \u2013 nor should it.", "tags": ["Nato", "US news", "World news", "Afghanistan", "Iran", "Russia", "US foreign policy", "US politics", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-01T20:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/apr/02/west-end-girl-zac-efron", "sentences": ["Andrew Lloyd Webber had mooted the possibility of simultaneous premieres in the UK, Shanghai and Toronto, but appears to have scaled down his ambitions; the Adelphi will be the first host."], "title": "West End girl: Zac Efron pulls out of Footloose remake", "article": "No need for Brits to travel to Broadway for the best new American musicals \u2013 Notes from New York have come all the way to London&apos;s West End.

But such is the explosive growth of China&apos;s car market and thirst for petrol that the two goals are likely to become ever more synonymous. The E6 plug-in is currently under wraps at the company&apos;s sprawling industrial complex in Shenzhen, but it will soon be at the vanguard of a company&apos;s \u2013 and a nation&apos;s \u2013 plans to dominate the global market for &quot;clean-transport&quot;. Senior government leaders have initiated a major push for hybrid and electric vehicles in a bid to bypass car makers overseas and avoid an environmental meltdown at home. The consultancy McKinsey estimates that China&apos;s car market will grow tenfold between 2005 and 2030, which will drive up demand for diesel and petrol from 110 million tonnes to 500 million tonnes. That will mean a sharp rise in carbon emissions from a country that has already overtaken the US as the world&apos;s biggest source of greenhouse gases. Hybrid, electric and fuel cell vehicles could ease the burden, but they will not solve the problem because at the moment more than 70% of China&apos;s electricity is powered by coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Even if there is a large scale take up of the new technologies, which could cut emissions by 19%, McKinsey estimates that the combined emissions from road transport would still increase more than fourfold within the next two decades. Faced by this nightmare, the authorities recently announced plans for 50,000 yuan rebates for electric and hybrid cars, encouraged city taxi fleets to buy vehicles with the new technology, and prompted state and regional grids to set up charging stations. BYD is likely to be a major beneficiary. The initials stand for Build Your Dreams, which prompted snickers when the company debuted in US car shows last year, as did the soaring ambitions of the founder Wang Chuanfu, who has stated that BYD will be the biggest carmaker in China by 2015 and the biggest in the world by 2025. Despite it making a third of the world&apos;s mobile phone batteries, until recently few people outside of China had heard of BYD. But the company exploded into the international consciousness late last year by beating Toyota and General Motors to launch the world&apos;s first mass-produced plug-in hybrid. At the company&apos;s sprawling headquarters in Guangdong province, there is little outward sign that BYD is a world beater. Apart from the golden pillars at the entrance, the company&apos;s offices are as grimly utilitarian as any other factory in the workshop of the world. But style is not the point. The company has built an empire by offering cheap, high-quality batteries and now it aims to do the same for cars. In February, just six years after its was formed, the firm sold 28,000 gasoline and diesel cars in China, more than any foreign or domestic rival. Its 10,000 research engineers have also designed the ferrous battery technology of the E6, which will be released before mass-produced electric cars from Honda and Nissan. The plug-in five-seater will reportedly be able to travel 400km on a single charge and reach a top speed of 160km/h. &quot;We are trying to make an electric car that people can use like a normal car,&quot; says Henry Li, the head of BYD Auto&apos;s export and trade division, as we drive around the company&apos;s car park in the BYD&apos;s other new breakthrough vehicle, the F3DM. Like the company, the hybrid starts out so quietly you barely notice it moving. At low speeds, the battery-powered engine makes only a fraction more noise than the tyres on the road. But put your foot on the pedal and the vehicle roars to life as the gas kicks in. Acceleration from 0-60km/h in 10.5 seconds will not win any Formula One races. Neither will the hybrid&apos;s current sales scare rivals. The company says orders are only in the &quot;several hundred&quot; range, mostly from the Shenzhen local governments and BYD&apos;s main bank. Analysts are withholding judgment on whether BYD can achieves its ambitious targets. &quot;BYD&apos;s battery technology is good and that is important, but cars are more complicated than that,&quot; says Zhao Junhua of CSM Worldwide in Shanghai. &quot;BYD will need more experience. Chinese firms are still behind Japanese rivals like Toyota, Honda and Nissan.&quot; There are also many questions about the environmental benefits of electric cars, given China&apos;s reliance on coal.Electric vehicles drive down carbon emissions best if they are charged at night with wind or other forms of renewable energy, but this is not currently possible in China. But they do use energy more efficiently than both petrol and diesel driven cars, and environment groups says electric vehicles can at least reduce the huge negative impact from the spread of car culture in China. &quot;Electric cars would be a big step forward,&quot; said Greenpeace executive director Gerd Leipold on a visit to Beijing this week. &quot;Hybrid cars have a better reputation than their ecological performance merits.&quot; BYD may lead the pack in China, but the government is encouraging others to move into clean transport manufacturing \u2013 an area where it hopes domestic companies can overtake bigger foreign rivals. At an exhibition of clean energy technology in Beijing last week, the science and technology minister, Wan Gang, said the country aimed to come out of the economic downturn greener and more advanced than it went in. &quot;Accompanying every financial crisis is a revolution in technology that serves as an engine for economic development. This time, new energy technology will probably be the new driving force.&quot; Every few weeks there is fresh news that China is upgrading its transport and energy infrastructure. Last month, Chery Auto unveiled a battery electric vehicle \u2013 the S18EV \u2013 that it says has a range of 150km on a single charge. Shortly before that, Xinri Electric Vehicle started building an industrial park capable of producing five million electric scooters and bicycles per year. And Tianjin-Qingyuan has recently announced that it may precede BYD with the autumn release of a fully battery-powered Saibao sedan. More than a dozen other firms have begun manufacturing electric buses. However, the gusto with which many Chinese people have embraced the idea of clean energy was most evident however in a display of a sanlunche \u2013 the boxed three-wheel scooters that are a familiar sight in Beijing&apos;s alleyways \u2013 fitted with wing-like solar panels. But, so far, none have gone as far as BYD. Li says it is simply a matter of business. &quot;We are not trying to save the world, we are making money. Our strategy aims to give value to shareholders. If we can help the planet at the same time, all the better.&quot;", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "China", "Motoring", "Technology", "Environment", "World news", "Energy", "Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-02T15:05:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/apr/04/exhibition-art-johannes-zits", "sentences": ["Created during a two-month residency in Shanghai, Zits&apos;s figurative scenarios emerge from an elaborate collision of good and bad taste, of comic art and traditional decoration.", "Naked male protagonists are tattooed with Shanghai patternings in a spaced-out intermix of sensuousness and hallucinatory alarm."], "title": "Exhibition preview: Johannes Zits: The Skin You're In, Manchester", "article": "Artist Heidi Schaefer continues her intrepid gallery project of staging shows in the converted front room of a terraced Manchester house, now presenting the textile-based collages of Canadian artist Johannes Zits.

We&apos;re sitting around her dining room table and she&apos;s recounting Inca legends. She is speaking in Spanish, and there are lots of long Quechua names, yet somehow I manage to follow. With tales of ancient battles, thwarted love and lost gold, I feel like I&apos;ve stepped into Inca Jackanory. Sonia is my homestay host in Ollantaytambo, a historic town in southern Peru&apos;s Sacred Valley, known for its cobbled streets and mountainside ruins of 15th-century storehouses and agricultural terraces. Sonia&apos;s house is a traditional, stone-built Inca structure, with an open courtyard that looks straight up at some of the most dramatic ruins. It&apos;s been in her family for generations and is decorated with all manner of Peruvian artefacts, from mythological ceramic bulls to Quechua festival masks. I&apos;ve found Sonia through Leap Local (leaplocal.org), a website that allows travellers to recommend local guides and services. It&apos;s not dissimilar to TripAdvisor, but the aim is to draw attention to smaller outfits and ensure money goes to communities. It&apos;s part of an emerging crop of online communities whose focus is specifically local. These sites range from blogs written by a network of local &quot;spotters&quot; around the world (see spottedbylocals.com) to virtual marketplaces where the tiniest of enterprises - even individual chefs or guides - are given an online presence.  I&apos;m giving hotels, tour operators and even Machu Picchu a backseat and basing my entire trip around Leap Local. Staying with Sonia, her husband Ferdinand, daughter Coralee, 10, and baby Rio Ferdinand (yes, really) is a wonderful start. They are listed as offering bed and full board for \u00a37.50 a night, and for no extra charge, they&apos;ll adopt you as one of their own. I join them on an outing to a local festival and get an education in Inca legends. Sonia used to be a cook on the Inca Trail, and a small restaurant she ran in her front room was a favourite hangout of Leap Local&apos;s co-founder, Louise Norton. Louise, a 29-year-old Cambridge graduate, came to Peru six years ago and decided to stay after falling in love with a local named Arturo. She recognised a gap in the market for a networking site that helps distribute tourism money more fairly among people who need it most. Louise is still based in Ollantaytambo, where she runs the Cactus Bar with Arturo. When I pop in, she draws me maps and recommends guides from the site. It&apos;s a pity every location can&apos;t have an in-situ co-ordinator. It&apos;s through her recommendations that I find my second contact, Jose Sotelo, a freelance guide who speaks English. I check out his site listing where one traveller describes him as &quot;a very flexible, easy-going, experienced guide&quot;. I email him, and in no time we&apos;ve created a bespoke three-day tour, based on the Lares trek, which is an Inca Trail alternative with hot springs en route. Via Jose, I also arrange a night&apos;s camping, a Leap-sourced homestay in Patakancha and a day&apos;s mountain biking. Jose&apos;s language skills make things straightforward, but at some point wires still get crossed. &quot;I thought you were bringing the tent,&quot; says Jose when we meet outside Calca market at 7am. My face falls. &quot;OK,&quot; he assures me. &quot;I have a friend we can stay with.&quot; Our first day of trekking is fairly leisurely. We pass jagged peaks and sweet-smelling eucalyptus. The absence of tourists makes it a far cry from the Inca Trail, a route that is trekked by up to 2,000 people a day. Just as the temperature begins to drop, we arrive at the small, mountain-top village of Wacawasi. Here Jose finds a last-minute alternative to the tent: a one-roomed stone hut that is home to Antonio, the oldest man in the village. Inside it is pitch black and filled with smoke, and the host seems slightly drunk. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d find this one on TripAdvisor. Yet I sleep surprisingly well in the cubby-hole bed in the corner.  Antonio mumbles away in Quechua, and although he isn&apos;t much of a conversationalist, I&apos;m still touched that he&apos;s welcomed us into his home. I&apos;d be happy to pay over the odds, but Jose insists I stick to local rates. I hand over the suggested 20 soles (\u00a34) and Antonio&apos;s eyes light up. &quot;See. It&apos;s important not to get carried away,&quot; says Jose. &quot;Otherwise it raises expectations.&quot; Day two brings a much tougher five-hour trek, past lakes and green hills that rise to a punishing 4,000m. Our end point - Patakancha, a weaving community - doesn&apos;t come a minute too soon. Compared with the previous day, my homestay here, in a clay-brick house, seems like luxury. Rooms are homely, and they&apos;ve even installed a shower and toilet. Food and board costs 40 soles (\u00a38) a night for the two of us. The only down side is that owner Juan Yupanki is away on the Inca Trail, where he works as a cook. As former president of the local campesinos court (where country workers settle disputes among themselves), he could have been an interesting character. In his absence, his younger brother, Americano, steps in to show us around, and whips up a hearty vegetable soup.  Next morning, mountain bikes are hired and delivered from Ollantaytambo (price \u00a314) and we end the tour whizzing downhill, passing stone villages where women sit outside weaving while men churn the fields. Jose charges me US$40 a day. Later, I see a four-day Lares trek being advertised through a tour company for US$250. Presumably they wouldn&apos;t have forgotten the tent, but neither would the tour have been so special.      Florencio with his wife and daughter    Aside from allowing you to save money and gain a more personal experience, Leap Local lets normally voiceless players in the industry take a more active role. My third contact, Florencio, usually works as a porter on the Inca Trail, carrying bags for a few dollars a day. But via Leap Local, he also offers tourists the chance to stay with his family and experience life in their lakeside village of Umasbamba. Unable to get through to him in advance, I just turn up. It&apos;s a tiny village so I soon find him in a nearby potato field. A small, jovial fellow, he says he&apos;d be more than happy for me to stay and can guide me to the nearby Inca ruins of Huchuy Qosqo, said to be a &quot;mini Machu Picchu&quot; without the crowds. I&apos;ll just have to wait for him to finish sowing his crop. Before long, I&apos;ve got my own potato-laden sling strapped to my front. As the sun dips behind the perfectly still Lake Piuray, we head back to the family home. It&apos;s quite big for these parts - two storeys with a mud courtyard, an outdoor, hole-in-the-ground toilet and a kitchen, where a wood stove chugs out black smoke, and guinea pigs run underfoot. Florencio brings me coca tea, while his wife makes dinner of potato soup, followed by rice, fried potatoes, egg and cheese. The next day we set off early for the ruins. We walk for five hours past creeks, cactus and yellow gorse. Finally, Huchuy Qosqo comes into view. Spread before me are its ancient terraces and roofless buildings. Looking closer I see all the hallmarks of Inca workmanship - walls that fit together like perfect puzzles, the seemingly impossible sharp angles of the square windows. It&apos;s smaller than Machu Picchu, but still impressive. The setting is beautiful, with a snow-capped mountain behind it in the distance, and best of all, we have it to ourselves. Florencio has offered an insight into Peruvian country life that I don&apos;t think I would have found alone. It&apos;s just a pity that, not recognising the potential for peer-to-peer recommendation, he ends up overcharging me. Granted it&apos;s not much - just \u00a340 for the tour and accommodation - but it is quite a jump from the \u00a37-a-day site suggestion. I try to query it, but Florencio sticks to his guns and I can&apos;t haggle over a few quid. It&apos;s an awkward situation, but it could have been easily avoided. I committed a schoolgirl error by not agreeing a price before setting off. &quot;I have briefed him on prices and suggested rates,&quot; Louise tells me later, but she admits that it is impossible to keep track of everyone and the prices on the site can only ever be a guideline. All in all, Leap Local has been a hugely rewarding experience, but at some points, it has demanded extra effort and patience. How many people will be motivated enough to forgo the ease of an organised tour? I put the question to another Leap Local guide, Mario Tapia Meza, over a post-trek beer. Having already racked up 10 glowing references, he insists the site has changed his life, allowing him to build his own freelance business. He also believes that the scope is wider than people imagine. &quot;I get a real mix of people,&quot; he says. &quot;I was contacted by a couple in a five-star hotel.&quot;  Regular tourists looking for not-so-regular experiences?

Ourexplorer.com Launched last year, Ourexplorer is another portal for travellers trying to find professional guides around the world, in partnership with the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations. It allows you to contact prospective guides in advance and work out possible itineraries - most of them post their specialist areas and rates on the site and usually tailor their tours around your needs.

The enormous growth of UK financial services has enthralled and alarmed the country ever since Margaret Thatcher deregulated the sector in the 1980s, but the old buzz is now hard to find. Wine bars are subdued and offices stand empty after the collapse of banking giants such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. &quot;The Square Mile has lost its swagger, and not a bit too soon,&quot; says a former Lehman employee who has found a new life in teaching. &quot;It was getting a bit unreal and the peer pressure to succeed was almost unbearable.&quot; But where is the City heading? The glamour of free markets has soured after one crisis after another, starting with the developing nations&apos; debt crisis of the 1980s through to the Asian debacle of 1997, the dotcom bust of 2001 and now the worst slump in living memory. More regulation, fewer hedge funds, lower pay and slimmer profits are a given. London will also have its work cut out to ensure it does not lose its position as a pre-eminent financial centre to the new fleshpots of Asia and the Middle East. &quot;We take nothing for granted, although my belief is that we can more than fight our corner,&quot; says Stuart Fraser of the Corporation of London. But many in high places fear that the Germans and French are manoeuvring to promote Paris and Frankfurt as alternatives to London, while the Europeans themselves worry that the centre of gravity is turning east. It was instructive that as the G20 struggled to agree a joint communique last week, French president Nicolas Sarkozy let slip that he feared there would be no agreement on scrutinising tax havens because of Chinese opposition. He suspected that Beijing was trying to protect &quot;the interests of Hong Kong and Macau&quot;, new financial centres that were taking off and could pose a threat to western interests. Andrew Clare, a professor at Cass Business School, says that beyond the credit crisis the world is witnessing a shift in the balance of economic power to Asia, with potentially damaging consequences for the City: &quot;There is no reason why activities that have traditionally been the mainstay of London, such as bond issuance and stock market flotations, cannot be done in Shanghai or Hong Kong.&quot; He adds that &quot;people chase the money&quot; and it is China, with its trade surplus, growth prospects and massive foreign reserves, that is bound to attract foreign capital in the future. &quot;You can see the beginnings of the demise of Britain from 1850, but it took nearly 100 years for the British to realise that the world had moved on. China&apos;s ascent is happening in just a few decades. The consequences are unpredictable.&quot; In London, Boris Johnson has asked a team of investment bankers led by former Merrill Lynch boss Bob Wigley to come up with a plan to secure the capital&apos;s future. The stakes could not be higher when you consider the statistics: London-based financial services may have contributed only 8% to British GDP, but the sector contributed 15% of the corporation tax take in 2007/2008 and \u00a342bn in overall taxation. That is more than the NHS wage bill and bigger than the education budget. Peter Mandelson, the business secretary, is pushing for Britain to develop new industries in manufacturing and green technologies, but that will take time, assuming the country can make the transition. The City has already shrunk, with more than 60,000 people losing their jobs since early 2008. The economic crisis has gone from bad to worse, with banks implementing a brutal jobs cull and staff being asked to clear their desks without notice amid a climate of fear. Outside financial circles, the penchant for baiting bankers has become a national sport. But that shouldn&apos;t obscure how the wind has changed since the onset of the credit crunch. It seems an eternity since Michael Douglas&apos;s Gordon Gekko was proclaiming that &quot;greed is good&quot; in Oliver Stone&apos;s Wall Street, epitomising the self-interested era of 20 years ago. &quot;I think the City has lost its self-confidence and it could take a long time before it&apos;s restored,&quot; says financial public relations boss Tim Bell, head of Chime Communications. But he is cautious about writing off London too quickly: &quot;Capitalism isn&apos;t going to disappear. Besides, the City has a knack for reinventing itself.&quot; However, most agree that the party that was London circa 1997-2007 has been washed away by the financial tsunami that crashed ashore after the US sub-prime bubble burst. Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the City will lessen in importance as hedge funds, private equity and investment banks lick their wounds after a year of steep profit falls: &quot;I think the sector will be smaller, albeit more efficient, and make less of a contribution to economic growth.&quot; The mania for mergers and acquisitions seems a thing of yesteryear, with deals down 30% compared to 18 months ago; scores of hedge funds have gone out of business. &quot;I don&apos;t think that the financial exuberance that was the hallmark of the Tony Blair era will come back for a long time,&quot; says one observer. If the outcome of the rise of China is difficult to forecast, so too is the effect of more regulation on London&apos;s financial services industry, assuming that the authorities keep their promise and clamp down on everything from mortgages and executive pay to derivatives and capital adequacy. But the recent report by FSA boss Lord Turner illustrated the authorities&apos; appetite for tighter, stricter regulation. The Turner report has yet to be written into new rules or regulations, but it showed which way the things are going because at its core was a definitive break with the &quot;light-touch&quot; approach of the past 15 years. Turner plans to curb banks&apos; ability to take excessive risks by forcing them to hold more capital and increase their holdings of liquid assets and cash, and pledged to scrutinise any institution that could threaten the stability of the financial system. Turner stressed that the FSA was not planning to act alone and that his report reflected international consensus. He even supported calls for a pan-European regulatory body to oversee banking across the EU, sounding alarm bells among Euro-sceptics. But veteran dealmaker David Mayhew, head of broker JP Morgan Cazenove, says: &quot;I doubt that the City is going to be regulated out of existence.&quot; Like others at the forefront of British finance, Mayhew reckons that the City will simply do things differently, and that London, conveniently situated between Asian and American time zones, has the skills, financial wherewithal and entrepreneurial nous to stay ahead of the game. But Labour MPs and unions are concerned that the authorities are not going far enough and that when the storm abates, the City will be back to its old tricks of tax avoidance, awarding big pay packets and exploiting the system for all its worth. Last week, TUC general secretary Brendan Barber warned there should be no return to laissez-faire capitalism. &quot;There is no question of going back to business as usual,&quot; he said.  Other critics of the system, such as multimillionaire investor and author George Soros, have been warning for years that financial services have grown too big for the nation&apos;s good. He recently said: &quot;The size of the financial sector is out of proportion to the rest of the economy. It has been growing excessively, ending in this super-bubble of the last 25 years.&quot; Last week, former chancellor Nigel Lawson and trade secretary Cecil Parkinson suggested to the Wall Street Journal that the banks had been allowed to get too big to be supervised properly. &quot;The notion that banks would get as big and bloated as they did was totally unexpected,&quot; said Lawson. They said they favoured breaking up the banks by introducing a version of the US Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act. That legislation created a wall between commercial banks, which take deposits and loans, and securities firms, which take bigger risks with investors&apos; money by gambling on the markets.  By making sure that commercial banks do not become too entangled with the high-risk investment side, supervisors could keep troubles at the latter from infecting and destabilising the former - or at least that&apos;s the argument. A Glass-Steagall law, though, wouldn&apos;t shield us from another similar crisis, as this one was caused as much by dubious lending as a propensity for banks to take on risky investments in exotic and arcane financial products. While more rules are to be expected, it remains to be seen whether they will be effective. As one observer says: &quot;The regulators knew what was happening at Northern Rock, the business plan was readily available, but nobody understood the risks involved. Regulators need to wake up and smell the coffee.&quot; Another issue is how quickly Britain can adapt to the changed economic landscape by producing hi-tech services and goods for a new, low-carbon world. Clare says that students applying for finance courses at Cass this year are at record numbers, despite the collapse of major banks. &quot;There is no sign that undergraduates are displaying renewed interest in science or engineering in the wake of the crunch,&quot; he adds.  But there is no doubt that City is shrinking. Charles Davis at the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) said staffing levels in London&apos;s financial sector (excluding accountancy and law) will be down to 290,000 in 2009 against a peak of 360,000 in early 2008. &quot;There is a danger of the numbers contracting further to around the 200,000 clocked up in 2003/4,&quot; he adds. High-fliers are already being paid less. According to Davis, City economists are being offered \u00a3160,000 a year against \u00a3900,000 or more, during the boom. But how far will regulators go with regard to pay? They want to draw up a code to ensure that bonuses do not act as incentives for irresponsible deal-making, but that might be tricky to enforce without legislation. Some financial areas could do well, however - once the green shoots take hold. Analysts say there will be more cross-border mergers and acquisitions as western companies seek out the growing prosperity of the developing world, while Asian and Latin American groups will look to acquire the expertise of more developed economies by investing overseas. &quot;Globalisation isn&apos;t going to stop, even though the goalposts might be moved,&quot; said one expert. Doug McWilliams at CEBR says the money management industry will grow in importance as people save more to pay for their retirement and old age at a time of uncertainty. &quot;Fund management will be an increasingly important feature, although managers will have to cut their fees as a result of competitive and possibly regulatory pressure,&quot; he says. McWilliams also believes that there will be a place for hedge funds because interest rates will remain low, spurring some investors to look for higher returns elsewhere. Private equity is not going to disappear either as many funds are awash with cash and are looking for opportunities in a depressed market. But the expectation is that venture capitalists will be forced to offer more equity and less debt as lending banks will boycott highly leveraged deals, with backing from more muscular regulators. In the end, politicians hold the key to the City&apos;s future, says Philip Augur, a former banker and author of a new book, Chasing Alpha, which looks at the reasons behind the slump: &quot;It was market capitalism that did for us all, not to mention an obsession with shareholder value that helped to obscure whether much of what went on in the boom was really in the public interest.&quot; Augur adds, however, that the financial services industry can take comfort from the probability that the free-market philosophies on which it depends are likely to be modified rather than dumped. &quot;And the City&apos;s recovery powers may surprise,&quot; he says.

Thanks to far-reaching technical changes for 2009, the cars run less downforce, which means less grip, evidenced by the way they slide more and call on greater car control from the drivers. Throw in tactical decisions and the need to gamble on the outcome of the weather and you had further changes to the leaderboard as some drivers found themselves on the right tyres at crucial moments. Jenson Button and the Brawn team made the correct choices but it is also true to say that the Englishman won this race when the track was dry. Button hammered home a succession of fast laps immediately after the leading Toyota of Jarno Trulli had made his first scheduled stop for fuel and tyres. Button emerged in the lead after his stop a few laps later, the result of keeping a cool head despite a poor start from pole position. Button was still in front and declared the winner when the rain, which had been gentle at first, became torrential and brought the race to a halt. For the second time in as many weeks, Button won a race but without having the pleasure of sweeping across the line to take the chequered flag in the conventional manner. In Australia, he was at least on the move when the safety car led the field towards the conclusion of the last lap. In Malaysia, Button was sitting, helmet off, in his car on the grid, waiting for a decision from officials on whether a restart would be possible, or at least, whether there would enough running to allow the race to reach three-quarters distance, the marker which must be reached before full points can be awarded. In the end Button and the first eight finishers each receive half points because only 31 of the 58 laps had been completed. While there was little the officials could do about heavy rain endemic to this region, questions must be asked about running the race a couple of hours later than usual in order to suit more sociable viewing hours in Europe. Darkness, which closes in rapidly in the Far East, was exacerbated by the cloudy conditions as the passing rain clouds slowly disbursed. Had the same weather conditions occurred if the race had been run to the same timetable used during the past 10 years, then the second round of the championship could at least have been restarted behind the safety car until the track conditions were deemed safe. While the pedestrian finish in Australia was caused by an accident which could occur at any time on any track, only Bernie Ecclestone, F1&apos;s commercial rights holder, will know if the additional viewing figures have merited such an unsatisfactory and anti-climatic finish in Malaysia. Whatever the timing, the weather had no effect on the welcome and continuing shake up of the old order as the clean sheet of paper necessary in the design departments has brought Brawn, Toyota and Williams to the fore while Ferrari and McLaren, the leading contenders for the past two years, continue to struggle. Meanwhile, despite the excellence of the on-track respite, politics will return before the next round in China as an appeal court decides on claims that the leading three teams are running illegal cars. The FIA has also said it is not yet finished with McLaren and their appalling handling of the post-Australian race enquiry.

Wall Street was crippled by clumsy regulation, Frankfurt was a provincial bore and investors too afraid to put money directly into the booming economies of Asia would come via the trusted City gents instead. The growth of foreign stockmarket listings meant London&apos;s stock exchange would thrive even if the British economy was in the doldrums. That was the theory at least. The drying up of international capital has put a dampener on all but emergency fundraising for the moment. But what happens when the tap is turned on again? Will London be able to recapture its prime spot? The smell of rot lingering around many of the first generation of foreign listings suggests damage to the City&apos;s reputation may prove a permanent stain. Take Sibir for example: once a darling of London&apos;s Alternative Investment Market, this Russian oil producer was yesterday forced to take its own management to the high court to recoup $400m (\u00a3270m) that allegedly disappeared into the forests of Siberia.  Given that Aim (a junior offshoot of the LSE) is stuffed with similar foreign mining companies, it is hard to imagine more scandals won&apos;t emerge, especially as Aim&apos;s system of self-regulation has proved so woefully inadequate. There have been scandals everywhere - Bernie Madoff hasn&apos;t done much for Wall Street&apos;s reputation either - but if investors form the view that one market is as risky as the next, they might as well stay close to home.  Rich Middle East investors will invest money through the Middle East. Chinese and Russian companies will raise funds in Shanghai or Moscow. Without a sizeable pool of domestic investment capital or new British companies to invest in, what good is a City that no one trusts? Surplus bankers  If our bankers are not going to be servicing international clients, what about those left here? The Royal Bank of Scotland chose yesterday to remind us of the fate that awaits much of the financial services industry. On the same day it confirmed its abject failure to raise rescue funds from anyone other than Her Majesty&apos;s Government, RBS announced 9,000 jobs cuts in the latest of what are likely to be several waves of cost reduction. At a time of few employment alternatives, every redundancy is a human tragedy, but the relative ease of this first big axe-wielding session says much about the bloated nature of British finance. These 9,000 people were not serving customers directly, but in back-office divisions euphemistically dubbed &quot;group manufacturing&quot;.  Sir Fred Goodwin picked up the nickname Fred the Shred for his apparent cost-cutting prowess, but his replacement, Stephen Hester, has clearly taken the view that a sizeable chunk of Fred&apos;s 170,000-strong workforce are surplus to requirements. The truth is that an economy less dependent on trading and debt needs fewer bankers. RBS might have called this activity &quot;manufacturing&quot;, but it was nothing of the sort.  With luck, the armies of well-educated, well-meaning employees in finance will find more productive employment in more sustainable branches of the economy.  The great rebalancing has begun.  Trading mystery  One of the other great mysteries of the banking boom was how profit margins appeared to stay so high for so long. In what looked like a fiercely competitive market, the grand investment banks of London and New York kept making more and more money. We now know that much of their investment profit was illusory, but trading commissions were real - and stubbornly high. The cheerleaders would have you believe this was because finance was constantly innovating. Many products were so sophisticated they couldn&apos;t possibly be traded out in the open where people could see the size of the commissions; they were best kept &quot;Over the Counter&quot; - or, more accurately, under the counter.  The collapse of confidence in OTC markets is now being addressed by moving to more transparent exchanges - a major recommendation of G20 government reformers. The interesting question is whether the profit margins will ever recover. If finance is to prove its worth to the rest of the economy again it desperately needs to find ways of offering reliable and low-cost methods of investing.  dan.roberts@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Financial crisis", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-07T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/apr/11/bowel-cancer-soya", "sentences": ["Researchers who studied the diet and health of 68,412 women aged 40-70 in Shanghai concluded: &quot;After adjustment for age, birth calendar year and total energy intake, consumption of soy foods was significantly associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer."], "title": "Bowel cancer risk in older women could be reduced by more soya in diet", "article": "Women who drink soya lattes, eat tofu sausages and prefer soy to cows&apos; milk may be helping to reduce their risk of getting bowel cancer, new research suggests.  Those, especially over-50s, who consume a lot of soy can &quot;significantly&quot; cut their risk of developing the disease, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.  Researchers who studied the diet and health of 68,412 women aged 40-70 in Shanghai concluded: &quot;After adjustment for age, birth calendar year and total energy intake, consumption of soy foods was significantly associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer. We found that risk of colorectal cancer decreased with increasing soy food intake, primarily among postmenopausal women.  &quot;The risk decreased more than 30% among women who were in the top tertile [third] of soy food intake compared with women in the bottom tertile of soy food intake,&quot; said the authors, from the Vanderbilt University school of medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, led by Gong Yang.  Bowel cancer is the second most lethal form of the disease affecting women in the UK after breast cancer, killing 16,600 each year and accounting for just over one in 10 of all cases of cancer among females, according to Cancer Research UK figures.  The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), global experts in preventing the disease, said the results were exciting. Dr Panagiota Mitrou, its science programme manager, said: &quot;These findings are exciting because this is a well designed study carried out where a lot of soy food is eaten and it is consumed at different levels. This means it is a good place to find out how soy affects cancer risk. The study shows that the risk of bowel cancer is decreased with increasing soy intake and this is especially the case for postmenopausal women.&quot;  The findings may help explain why many fewer people in countries such as China and Japan, where soy is a staple part of the diet, develop bowel cancer compared with Western countries, where soy consumption is low. Soybeans are eaten whole boiled with salt, while soya is widely used, for example as an alternative to dairy produce in products such as milk, yogurt and cream cheese. There is also a niche market in soy supplements for those convinced of its healthy properties. It has also been credited with helping to reduce levels of cholesterol.  However, the WCRF would like to see the findings repeated among non-Asian women, who have a different genetic background and different lifestyles from those in the study, before it could give any public health advice based on the new research, added Mitrou. &quot;If we were able to repeat these findings in this country, it would mean that including things like tofu and soya beans in their diet would be something positive that women could do to reduce their risk of bowel cancer.&quot;  The best ways to prevent cancer were to eat a plant-based diet without much salt or alcohol, be physically active and maintain a healthy weight, she added.  Separate research last week, in the journal Nutrition and Metabolism, suggested that soybean chemicals called soy aglycons of isoflavone may help reduce the effects of the menopause. The researchers, from Taiwan, said dietary soy supplementation could ultimately prove to be an effective alternative to hormone replacement therapy, which has been linked to increased cancer risk.", "tags": ["Cancer research", "Bowel cancer", "Health", "Food & drink", "Science", "Life and style", "UK news", "Cancer"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-10T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/12/roger-federer-temper-tantrums-tennis", "sentences": ["Also, since he won the Masters Cup in Shanghai in November 2007, he has failed to win a single title in 11 Masters events and has reached only one final, losing to Rafael Nadal in Monte Carlo a year ago \u2013 the tournament at which most of the top players will start their 2009 clay court campaigns this week."], "title": "Roger Federer loses cool in the heat of the big matches", "article": "Roger Federer \u2013 the super-cool, fiercely focused, unbeatable-in-big-matches Roger Federer \u2013 has been behaving strangely. Like losing his cool, losing his focus, and like losing big matches as facilely as he once won them. In fact, his behaviour has become as retro as those knitted cardies, long whites and blazers that he has taken to wearing at Wimbledon, harking back as it does to the days when he did obnoxious as well as anyone; when in his own words: &quot;I was throwing my racket like you can&apos;t imagine \u2026 I mean, I was getting kicked out of practice sessions when I was 16. I used to talk much more, too, and scream on court.&quot; The tennis world is talking and asking why it is that, while still in (the latter end of) his prime at 27, he has been successful in only one of the five grand slams since the start of last year, having won 12 of the previous 18. Also, since he won the Masters Cup in Shanghai in November 2007, he has failed to win a single title in 11 Masters events and has reached only one final, losing to Rafael Nadal in Monte Carlo a year ago \u2013 the tournament at which most of the top players will start their 2009 clay court campaigns this week. In particular, they have been talking in America, where Federer has just pulled up short in the Masters events in Indian Wells and Miami and headed home with the extraordinary statement: &quot;Thank God the hard court season is over.&quot; When arguably the greatest hard court performer of the Open era says this \u2013 especially as he makes for European clay, the surface on which Nadal has dealt so brutally with him in the past four years \u2013 the idea that all is not right with His Swiss Eminence is compelling. Pete Sampras, the great American whose record number of 14 grand slam titles Federer is one away from equalling, says he has been surprised by Federer&apos;s emotional fragility, most obviously his uncontrollable sobs after losing to Nadal in the Australian Open final on 1 February. &quot;After a loss you just keep it together,&quot; Sampras says. &quot;It hurt him more than I&apos;d have thought.&quot; Peter Bodo, a senior editor of the US magazine Tennis, thinks too much has been made of the emotional side and has admonished his colleagues of the tennis press for dwelling on Federer&apos;s bad behaviour, particularly a racket-mangling incident as he lost to Novak Djokovic in Miami nine days ago. Instead, says Bodo, they should be addressing the crisis from which this conduct emanates. &quot;One thing I&apos;m sure of is that it&apos;s not about the racket,&quot; he says. &quot;That done broke already.&quot; L Jon Wertheim, of Sports Illustrated, gets to the crux in an open letter \u2013 written in the guise of a crisis management consultant \u2013 that he has just addressed to Federer in which he says: &quot;Yes, you&apos;re a veteran in this business and you&apos;ve spent the fresh energy that characterises a startup. And that pesky Spanish competitor represents the kind of curveball every successful enterprise must face at some point. But my analysis suggests that you&apos;ve got plenty of room to manoeuvre and a lot you can accomplish in the next few years.&quot; Wertheim then refers, indirectly, to a small omission from Federer&apos;s personal profile in the 2009 official men&apos;s tour guide when he writes: &quot;End the hiring freeze and add staff. You can afford it.&quot; Whereas the personal profiles of Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray end &quot;coached by\u2026&quot;, Federer&apos;s omits any mention of the word coach. He has none, even is he does profess that the Swiss Davis Cup captain, Severin Luthi, fulfils that function. Really, though, Luthi is little more than a travelling companion and hitting partner. The lack of a proper coach shows up every passing failure and every little emotional convulsion, be it a smashed racket, recourse to tears or despondent press conference. In Miami, says Bodo, Federer &quot;thrust his chin so deep into the cowl neck of his white tracksuit that I feared he would disappear&quot;. He sacked Peter Lundgren as his coach in 2003 and then, two years ago, dispensed with the astute Australian Tony Roche. Earlier this year, he worked briefly with Andre Agassi&apos;s former coach Darren Cahill before ending the experiment. Of course no one can tell Federer how to play a tennis stroke, but what a top coach brings is an overview and a more objective voice than the one that is seemingly talking in Federer&apos;s head. A coach recognises when one aspect of a player&apos;s game may be in need of greater attention than he or she is giving it. Without experienced guidance Federer&apos;s game has not so much deteriorated as stood still and been overtaken by the skill and effervescence of Nadal&apos;s play and the multi-faceted game that Murray is developing. Federer&apos;s backhand is no better than it was some years ago and his volleying has not come on as much as it should have done. Lacking qualified help, Federer has fallen back on those parts of his game that he feels he can rely on. He has done little to expand his repertoire. He revels in the friendship of Tiger Woods, but what he needs from the great golfer is a lesson in attending to his game. It has been an increasingly sorry sight \u2013 unedifyingly so in the case of Federer&apos;s behaviour.", "tags": ["Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-11T23:05:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/12/jenson-button-lewis-hamilton-malaysia-australia-diffusers", "sentences": ["The long straights of Sepang encouraged the use of Kers in last Sunday&apos;s race and a similar track layout at Shanghai next weekend will allow teams such as Renault and McLaren to maximise the energy retention system&apos;s power boost to induce overtaking."], "title": "Maurice Hamilton: It's not just McLaren's reputation that is at risk this season", "article": "If Formula One is to follow the familiar habit of shooting itself spectacularly in the foot then the sport&apos;s appeal court, sitting in Paris on Tuesday, will declare the winning car from the first two grands prix to be illegal. Brawn, along with Williams and Toyota, have been challenged by rival teams who did not appear to be so crafty when reading the 2009 technical regulations and failed to spot a design loophole exploited by, it is no coincidence, the three teams that have set the early pace. Since the defendants have already received tacit approval of the controversial but clever diffusers at the rear of their cars, it would be a surprise if the FIA went against their own officials. If they did, it would be another disaster heaped upon a sport in danger of suffocating from a surfeit of drama and nonsense that has little to do with the actual racing. But, while Jenson Button&apos;s wins in Australia and Malaysia are likely to stand, there is every chance that the FIA World Motor Sport Council may emerge from a subsequent meeting on 29 April with smoke curling from both barrels after splattering McLaren&apos;s reputation around the governing body&apos;s grand surroundings in Place de la Concorde. It is irrelevant now that McLaren&apos;s initial indiscretion had its beginnings in the sort of quiet subterfuge likely to be enacted this weekend in any stewards&apos; office from Brands Hatch to the Buckmore Park go-kart track. The self-righteous bellowing of the FIA will drown out questions about their stewards in Australia speaking to participants with vested interests rather than trackside officials who could have presented unbiased and accurate accounts of what had gone on, thus avoiding the embarrassment of penalising Jarno Trulli for deliberately overtaking Lewis Hamilton when the Toyota driver had been given no alternative. But, once that point had been reached, Hamilton and his race director, Dave Ryan, appear to have dug a massive hole with unnecessary denials, the incident gathering a momentum out of proportion with the original crime. Ryan has since been dismissed after 34 years of unwavering dedication to the company and the sport, a curious decision by a team that previously claimed there was no blame culture within its perfect walls. It could be that Ryan, either voluntarily or through persuasion, has broken all ties with McLaren, thus making him a private individual beyond the demands of the FIA to appear before them. Either way, the FIA&apos;s charge sheet focuses entirely on the team; a sign that Hamilton will escape censure, particularly after the hand-wringing displayed at an FIA-approved press conference in Malaysia. While it is perhaps understandable that Hamilton should blindly follow team instructions when his mind was still in a whirl immediately after the race, it is less easy to comprehend how an apparently virtuous and mature 24-year-old should allow himself to be coerced four days later and then, along with the team, hang a decent man out to dry. McLaren may have a lot of explaining to do to the court, but justification of their behaviour is also owed to the world at large. Were the charges laid against them not so serious, McLaren might be forgiven for happily accepting that the drama away from the track has diverted attention from their lack of success on it. The FIA can be congratulated on formulating new rules that have shaken up the established order to such an extent that Ferrari and McLaren, the teams to beat during the past two years, are languishing near the bottom of the table. Both are suffering from the absence of the contentious diffuser and a nod of approval on Tuesday will set them back even further as they redesign the rear of the cars, a job McLaren, Ferrari and the five remaining teams will have already started as a precaution. It will allow Brawn and the rest to continue to break free next weekend in China and the week after in Bahrain before the teams return to base after their four-race tour outside Europe. McLaren and Ferrari can justify their shortfall in performance thanks to the distraction created by fighting for the championship until the last race of the 2008 season. It is true that Brawn (then Honda) had the luxury of focusing entirely on the future since their 2008 car was a write-off from the start. But Toyota and Red Bull, while not in the forefront, managed to put themselves in a position where their first grand prix win may be forthcoming within the next few months. The long straights of Sepang encouraged the use of Kers in last Sunday&apos;s race and a similar track layout at Shanghai next weekend will allow teams such as Renault and McLaren to maximise the energy retention system&apos;s power boost to induce overtaking. There were spectacular wheel-to-wheel battles in Malaysia before rain stopped play. This regional foible was to be expected at that hour, which questions the decision by Bernie Ecclestone to stage the race late in the day in order to match social viewing times in Europe.

If the procedure can be made to work in humans, it could lead to treatments that extend fertility beyond the menopause and help younger women who are unable to conceive because their eggs have been damaged by cancer therapies or disease. The controversial research challenges the long-held belief that most female mammals are born with a fixed number of eggs and are unable to make more throughout their lives. The study, which appears in the journal Nature Cell Biology, was received with caution, with some experts emphasising that the findings are tentative and need to be confirmed by other researchers. In the study, scientists led by Ji Wu at Shanghai Jiao Tong University extracted what they believe to be stem cells from the ovaries of adult and five-day-old mice. These were grown into a large stock of cells, which the researchers call female germline stem cells (FGSCs). Germline cells are the only cells in the body that grow into sperm or eggs. While sperm-making stem cells have been found in male testes, no one has ever found incontrovertible evidence for similar cells that make eggs in ovaries. To test whether the extracted cells could make eggs, the researchers sterilised a group of female mice using busulphan, a chemotherapy drug. They then injected 10,000 stem cells into both ovaries of each mouse. The cells had been frozen and thawed out before being used, to simulate the conditions they would be kept in if stored for human patients. A few months after leaving the mice to mate naturally, 18 out of 22 that received stem cell transplants from newborn mice gave birth to pups. A further 12 out of 15 females injected with stem cells from adult mice also gave birth. All of the offspring appeared to be healthy. In their journal report, the team write that the work suggests eggs &quot;can be regenerated in sterile recipient females by transplantation of FGSCs&quot;. If scientists can find stem cells in women&apos;s ovaries, the Shanghai team&apos;s study shows it might be possible to use them to create stocks of cells for women, which could be stored in a deep freeze until they are needed. &quot;This paper will stimulate lots of activity in the scientific community, as happens when any dogma is challenged,&quot; said Robin Lovell-Badge, a researcher into stem cells at the MRC National Institute For Medical Research in London. &quot;But what would be unfortunate is if this paper is hyped as a cure for female infertility. A lot more work is needed to understand what these new cells really are, and to verify the findings and the claims,&quot; he added. Lovell-Badge points out that some of the mice may not have been completely sterilised before being treated, making it impossible to know whether their offspring came from surviving or regenerated eggs. &quot;If true, and especially if applicable also to humans, then this is very important. It could provide a means to restore fertility to women who have few eggs or who have had to undergo cancer treatments,&quot; he added.", "tags": ["Reproduction", "Medical research", "China", "Science", "Fertility problems", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-12T17:50:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/13/formula-one-diffusers-appeal-jenson-button", "sentences": ["In the event of the appeal being upheld it is expected that the maximum penalty will be a requirement that the cars are modified before next Sunday&apos;s Chinese grand prix in Shanghai."], "title": "Diffusers appeal unlikely to cost Jenson Button his formula one wins in Australia and Malaysia", "article": "Jenson Button is unlikely to have his victories in the Australian and Malaysian grands prix thrown into question, even if tomorrow&apos;s tomorrow&apos;s meeting of the FIA court of appeal bans the aerodynamic diffuser used by his Brawn-Mercedes and the Williams and Toyota teams. The FIA court will convene in Paris, where an appeal will be heard over the decision by the stewards at the Australian grand prix to reject protests against the legality of the diffuser design used by these three cars. In the event of the appeal being upheld it is expected that the maximum penalty will be a requirement that the cars are modified before next Sunday&apos;s Chinese grand prix in Shanghai. Protests against these diffuser designs were lodged at Melbourne by Ferrari, Red Bull and Renault, since when BMW Sauber and McLaren have indicated they will be attending the hearing. The effect of the revised diffusers, under-car devices that channel the flow of air from the front to rear help create greater downforce, is to offer more grip to the cars concerned, improving their traction particularly out of tight corners. Ferrari design consultant Rory Byrne, who was a close friend and colleague of Ross Brawn during their time together working for the famous Italian team, feels that the three teams concerned have broken with a 15-year protocol over how the aerodynamic rules are interpreted. &quot;Ross Brawn and I remain good friends,&quot; Byrne told the autosport.com website. &quot;But one thing is personal relationships, another is the professional aspect \u2013 and I work for Ferrari.&quot; However, Patrick Head, the director and co-owner of the Williams formula one team, said he was absolutely satisfied that the interpretation permitting the so-called &quot;double diffuser&quot; was consistent with both the intention of the regulations and the meaning of the wording. Brawn is confident ahead of the court ruling court. &quot;The stewards have said it is legal,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s the International Court of Appeal that is going to hear whether the stewards have made an incorrect decision. Some teams are unhappy with that decision, but it [the diffuser] is in line with our understanding. You have to see how these things go, but even if they decide there is a different interpretation, I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll wipe out what went before because we&apos;ve been told our car is legal.&quot; One of the main complaints centres around cost because if Brawn&apos;s rivals do lose, they will be forced into a radical re-design of their cars as the diffuser affects a number of areas. &quot;I think some teams will be able to do it very quickly, but for other teams it will be more difficult because of their suspension configuration or other elements of the car,&quot; added Brawn. &quot;Some teams will have this concept by the European season if not before. There are cars able to accommodate it quite easily. But that is why it has become such a strong point; that it is a conceptual thing, the way you do the gearbox, the suspension, and some teams have realised that it&apos;s quite difficult to do. I&apos;ve heard several of them complaining about the cost of doing that, and they shouldn&apos;t have to have that cost.

His decision not to travel to China for this weekend&apos;s race was thought to be simply for the launch of the company&apos;s road car; instead he is believed to be also addressing staff at their Woking headquarters to inform them of his decision. Dennis, who is 61, stepped down as McLaren&apos;s team principal on 1 March, in favour of Martin Whitmarsh, with his long-standing prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Lewis Hamilton the world champion. Since then little has gone right for a team who have won 10 of their 12 formula one drivers&apos; championships since Dennis&apos;s arrival in 1980. Their 2009 car has proved slower than those of many of their rivals, especially Jenson Button&apos;s Brawn team, who yesterday won their appeal over the controversial diffusers that have contributed to their driver&apos;s victories in the season&apos;s first two races. Against the odds Hamilton crossed the line in the opening first race in fourth and was subsequently promoted to join Button in the first three in Melbourne when Jarno Trulli was docked 25 seconds for overtaking while the safety car was on the track. However, tapes of conversations with the pit lane revealed that Hamilton had been instructed to allow Trulli past; an investigation concluded that McLaren had provided &quot;evidence deliberately misleading to the stewards&quot; and as a result Hamilton was disqualified. The driver has since claimed that he was told not to tell the stewards of the instructions by Dave Ryan, the team&apos;s sporting director, who was subsequently sacked. The FIA, the sport&apos;s governing body, is continuing its investigations into the affair, with McLaren due to face a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 29 April. Further sanctions are likely. Dennis, who was in the pit lane in Melbourne, owns 15% of the company and will not be ending his association with McLaren entirely. Instead he will say that he is concentrating on the road car. However, the announcement will conclude a career in formula one that began in 1966, when he first worked for the Cooper formula one team as an 18-year-old. Meanwhile Button&apos;s chances of extending his lead in the drivers&apos; championship this weekend were enhanced when an FIA appeal court confirmed that his car is legal. Brawn, along with Toyota and Williams, were given the all-clear after an eight-hour hearing on Tuesday examined claims by Ferrari, BMW Sauber and Red Bull that the aerodynamic diffusers on the rear of the three cars in question broke the rules. The decision by the FIA means that other teams will now have to incorporate the &quot;double-deck&quot; diffuser as quickly as possible, a task that is particularly difficult for Ferrari and Red Bull given the construction of their cars. All five will have made some small adjustments by the time practice begins on Friday for the third round of the championship but none, at this early stage, will have been able to claw back the performance advantage enjoyed by the appellants, particularly Brawn. That said, their car relies on more ingenious thought for its superior handling and grip than just the diffuser, which creates downforce by the way air is extracted and expelled from beneath the rear of the car. The verdict was no surprise given that the FIA&apos;s scrutineers, more conversant with the technical rules than any appeal court, had passed the cars in Australia and Malaysia. Yet Ross Brawn, the man behind the car bearing his name, endured criticism from Nigel Tozzi, Ferrari&apos;s lawyer. Tozzi described Brawn, who helped Ferrari win six straight constructors&apos; titles, as a &quot;person of supreme arrogance&quot;. Brawn was not drawn in by the attack any more than the five judges were swayed by it. &quot;We are pleased with the decision reached by the International Court of Appeal today,&quot; Brawn said. &quot;We respect the right of our competitors to query any design or concept used on our cars through the channels available to them. The FIA technical department, the stewards at the Australian and Malaysian grands prix and now five judges at the International Court of Appeal have confirmed our belief that our cars have always strictly complied with the 2009 technical regulations.&quot; &quot;The decision of the International Court of Appeal brings this matter to a conclusion and we look forward to continuing on the track the challenge of what has been a very exciting start to the world championship.&quot; Brawn&apos;s views were echoed by Toyota and Williams and underlined a verdict for common sense even if the FIA&apos;s curious methods of governance allowed the matter to drag on and create yet another negative image for the sport. While Button and Brawn are likely to revel in their technical advantage at the Chinese grand prix this weekend in Shanghai \u2013 a circuit with similar demands to Sepang \u2013the judgment is another blow for Ferrari and McLaren, who have struggled to make their cars work with or without the contentious diffuser. Renault are less badly affected but still at a disadvantage. &quot;It would be possible to have something done to our car by the first race in Europe, the Spanish grand prix on 10 May,&quot; said Pat Symonds, their director of engineering. &quot;That could find us maybe three tenths of a second. But to find the other two or three tenths necessary to put us on a par with the three cars carrying what I believed to be an illegal diffuser will require a substantial reworking of the rear of the car. Ironically, the three would have had a much easier job converting the other way.&quot;", "tags": ["McLaren", "Lewis Hamilton", "Brawn", "Jenson Button", "Williams", "Ferrari", "Toyota", "Sauber", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-15T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/16/jenson-button-brawn-diffuser-shanghai-chinese-grand-prix-felipe-massa-ferrari", "sentences": ["Jenson Button is looking to secure his second success in the space of a week in Shanghai on Sunday after the controversial design of his Brawn car was yesterday ruled legal.", "And after a two-week break, coupled with having the weight of yesterday&apos;s ruling off his shoulders, Button admits he is looking forward to getting back in the car at the Shanghai International Circuit this weekend.", "&quot;Looking ahead to the weekend, the Shanghai International Circuit is an enjoyable one for the drivers and a good technical challenge to find the right set-up."], "title": "Jenson Button primed for third win in Shanghai after ruling says Brawn diffuser is legal", "article": "Jenson Button is looking to secure his second success in the space of a week in Shanghai on Sunday after the controversial design of his Brawn car was yesterday ruled legal.

However, Button has had to endure a nervous two days after the FIA&apos;s International Court of Appeal considered a claim from Ferrari, Renault, Red Bull and BMW Sauber that the aerodynamic diffuser used by Brawn, Toyota and Williams is illegal. But ICA judges yesterday agreed with race stewards in Melbourne and Sepang that the car is legal and Button is now looking forward to maintaining his stunning start to the season. &quot;I am understandably delighted with how our season has begun, however we are only two races in and everyone at the team is aware that our competitors will not stand still,&quot; he said. &quot;We fully expect a tough fight from here if we want to continue our early successes.&quot; Last year&apos;s Chinese grand prix was the penultimate race of the season and while Lewis Hamilton of McLaren and Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa tussled at the front in pursuit of the drivers&apos; championship, Button&apos;s frustrating year continued as he finished 16th. However, he is unlikely to find himself battling at the back this time round as he pursues a third successive victory to maintain his place at the top of the drivers&apos; standings. And after a two-week break, coupled with having the weight of yesterday&apos;s ruling off his shoulders, Button admits he is looking forward to getting back in the car at the Shanghai International Circuit this weekend. &quot;After the excitement of the first two races, it has been great to have the chance to relax and reflect for a few days since the dramatic race in Malaysia,&quot; he added. &quot;Looking ahead to the weekend, the Shanghai International Circuit is an enjoyable one for the drivers and a good technical challenge to find the right set-up. I particularly enjoy the high-speed sections and the overtaking opportunities going into the tight right-hander at turn five and at the end of the back straight.&quot; Meanwhile, Massa feels the tough times he endured at Sauber are helping him through his current rough patch with Ferrari. For the second successive season, Massa is without a point to his name after the opening two grands prix in Australia and Malaysia. But, as the Brazilian rightfully recognises, this year&apos;s Ferrari is far from a race winner compared to last year&apos;s car. The team&apos;s woes were compounded by yesterday&apos;s diffuser ruling. It means Ferrari, who spearheaded the four-team protest, are now playing catch-up before Brawn potentially disappear out of sight. At least Massa can draw on his three years of struggle with Sauber, with whom he scored just 27 points from 52 races before his switch to Ferrari in 2006. &quot;Before I joined Ferrari I drove for a team not used to winning,&quot; said Massa. &quot;Many people at the Scuderia have only known successful times, so maybe I can understand better than them what it means to struggle. But I think a top team having a difficult season is better equipped to recover, so I am hopeful we can put this bad start to the year behind us and get back on the right road.&quot; After a disastrous race in Malaysia 11 days ago when a number of critical mistakes were made, an inquest was rightly conducted. The outcome has been the formation of a new working party designed to speed through the design and implementation on the Ferrari of new improvements. &quot;After the race in Malaysia where we again failed to score points, I said it was not a case of everyone at Ferrari becoming stupid or forgetting how to do their jobs which caused us to have a bad weekend,&quot; added Massa. &quot;Instead, we need to be cool and calm now in how we take decisions at the track. If you are too emotional, most of the time you do the wrong thing. &quot;We need to get on the right path to taking better decisions and, since Sepang, we have discussed ways of improving the organisation of the race team, while also improving the car, of course. At the moment, we are not very good in many aspects of what we are doing, but it is also true we have very good people within the race team and back in Maranello, so we know we can react, improve and change some details. &quot;But it is important we do not try and change everything because if you change too much, you can make matters even worse. We know what areas we need to work on, and everyone in the team is really motivated to improve, which is the most important thing.&quot;", "tags": ["Formula One", "Jenson Button", "Brawn", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-16T04:01:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/16/chinese-economy-slows-global-recession", "sentences": ["The Shanghai stockmarket was barely positive, up 0.08% at 2534.134."], "title": "Chinese economy shows slowest growth on record", "article": "China&apos;s economy has slowed to its weakest growth rate on record after another sharp fall in exports. The world&apos;s third-largest economy grew at an annual rate of 6.1% in the first three months of this year, down from 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008, official figures showed today. It was the slowest expansion since quarterly records began in 1992. But there were also signs that the worst could be over for the Chinese economy. Industrial production jumped 8.3% in March from a year ago as the government poured money into state-owned companies. Investment in factories and other fixed assets soared 28.6%. Overall growth &quot;is below expectations but positive signs are emerging that the economy possibly is bottoming out,&quot; said Credit Suisse economist Dong Tao.

However, the development of the economy still has some existing problems and difficulties,&quot; said Li Xiaochao, a spokesman for the statistics office. Exports tumbled 17% in March as world trade collapsed, the fifth monthly decline. But the fall was smaller than February&apos;s 25.7% plunge. Li said falling exports were eroding corporate profits, reducing government revenues and making it harder to create jobs. The slump in exports was offset by a surge in lending in the first quarter, spurred by the government&apos;s 4tn yuan stimulus package. Beijing worries that rising unemployment will fuel unrest and is focused on creating jobs through a vast public works programme which includes building new highways. Some analysts say China&apos;s official target of 8% growth this year is the minimum needed to create enough employment. Amongst other positive signs, car sales hit a monthly high in March.

With the export sector stifled by the weakness of overseas markets, output grew only 6.1% in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the same period a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. While most countries would be delighted with this figure, it is sickly by the standards of a nation that has grown used to double-digit expansion for most of the past three decades. The headline figure represents a worsening of China&apos;s economic performance after the 6.8% growth announced by the authorities in the last three months of 2008. The collapse of corporate profits and the closure of factories in the industrial heartlands of Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang has forced an estimated 20\u00a0million migrants to return to their rural homes and left 5 million graduates searching for jobs. But there are signs that the government&apos;s 4tn yuan (\u00a3393bn) fiscal injection has started to kick in and could lift the economy into stronger territory during the current quarter. Public spending on urban fixed assets \u2013 the main measure of infrastructure investment \u2013 surged 28.6% between 1 January and the end of March, compared with the same period last year. The precipitous decline in foreign direct investment has also slowed, from 32% in January to 9.5% in March. Together with an increase in bank lending, this was sufficient upbeat news to dampen expectations of a new stimulus package. &quot;The overall national economy showed positive changes, with better performance than expected,&quot; said Li Xiaochao, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics. But he conceded that government revenues had fallen along with corporate income. &quot;The national economy is confronted with the pressure of a slowdown,&quot; he said. The government insists it can still achieve a growth target of 8% this year, deemed the minimum needed to ensure social stability and absorb the demands for work of a growing adult population. But the continued fragility of the economy suggests further pump-priming measures cannot be ruled out. Last year&apos;s inflation fears have been replaced by concern about deflation.

The number of correspondents in China and the space they get in serious newspapers and broadcasting stations has increased in recent years, not to mention the flood of magazine features and analytical pieces, and plenty of books by correspondents distilling their experiences.  Of course Chinese officials do not like a lot of what is written about their country, but there is nothing new about that; complaints that foreign correspondents are insufficiently &quot;understanding&quot; or &quot;objective&quot; have been par for the course for many years. The Communist party&apos;s control of the domestic media and the difficulty of unearthing information deemed to be in any way sensitive cramp reporting by correspondents who draw on Chinese sources as the starting point for their work - not to mention travel restrictions to places like Tibet. But that has not stopped reporters covering everything from economic and social trends to farm reform and the revival of Confucianism. The economics of the news business - or rather the perception by editors and management of where their best commercial interests lie - may have closed down a lot of foreign reporting, but US and UK newspapers keep bureaux, sometimes with several staffers, in Beijing and Shanghai.

Over the years, the enigmatic world No1 has profited layers and frustrated bettors. And despite the usual question marks surrounding his game and attitude, the Rocket is again the market leader, at 9-4 (general), by some distance going into this year&apos;s tournament, which begins at the Crucible tomorrow. O&apos;Sullivan claimed a third world title 12 months ago when he was available ante-post at 7\u20132. A year on, it is hard to see how his form can justify a much shorter quote. Last season he had won the UK Champ\u00adionship and the Premier League, this term he can boast success in the Northern Ireland Trophy, the Masters and the Premier League. In terms of ranking points, the 2007-08 campaign earned O&apos;Sullivan more going into the world championship. Admittedly, his win at the Masters in January was nothing short of incredible. A self-smashed cue in the run-up to the event meant O&apos;Sullivan had to use a new one at Wembley (some players use the same one for practically an entire career) and he has since switched again. It is questionable, though, just how long he can go on defying conventional wisdom and although there have been some lumpy bets on him, such as a \u00a33,000 bet at 2\u20131 stood by extrabet.com, at current odds he is poor value. Stephen Maguire is the joint second favourite, with 8\u20131 freely available. The No2 seed meets Jamie Burnett in the first round, a draw that embarrassed snooker officials as the pair&apos;s UK Championship meeting was still under investigation by the gambling commission following match-fixing suspicions. Maguire peaked too soon last year, looking in imperious form in the early rounds before going out to Joe Perry in the quarter-final, while in 2007 he should have defeated the eventual winner John Higgins in the semi-final. So there are, perhaps, question marks about whether Maguire has the ability to produce his best snooker at the right time. Mark Selby, also at 8\u20131 (general), looks a better bet but, as the Leicester man is in the same half of the draw as O&apos;Sullivan, back him instead at 15\u20138 (Paddy Power and Sky Bet) to win his quarter. Selby is not in the same sort of form as last year, when he entered the world championship off the back of wins in the Masters and the Welsh Open, but there looked little wrong with his game when he finished runner-up to O&apos;Sullivan in the Premier League final. Those seeking an each-way interest should look to the bottom half of the draw, where Ali Carter (12\u20131, Betfred and extrabet.com) and Shaun Murphy (14\u20131, general) lurk. Carter, who finally broke his duck at a ranking tournament in the Welsh Open this year, has some heavy support (Paddy Power reports a \u00a31,700 bet at 12\u20131) and has made the highest break in the past two years at the Crucible (he is 14\u20131, generally, to do so again). But the preference is for the 2005 champion Murphy, who won this season&apos;s UK Championship. Back him with Sky Bet which, along with Boylesports, offers each-way terms of a fifth of the odds for the first four players. Intriguingly, extrabet.com has reported buyers of total tournament centuries at 69 (the biggest at \u00a3500 per century). The highest number of century breaks made in the past has been 68 (twice) but with the tables set to be reclothed twice this year (instead of once) punters are predicting truer surfaces for longer and therefore a higher number of big scores. This, of course, will help all players and extrabet.com may well have under\u00adestimated Jamie Cope&apos;s break-building capability, quoting a spread of 116\u2013118 about the Stoke professional&apos;s highest tournament score.

His team-mate, Heikki \u00adKovalainen, has yet to complete a circuit. That has led Dennis, who yesterday confirmed he had left \u00admotor sport altogether, to believe his team is suffering for its efforts in landing the title last year, a tussle with Ferrari that went to the final race.

Now Dennis, who stood down as team principal in favour of Martin Whitmarsh earlier this year, fears the title is already out of \u00adHamilton&apos;s reach. &quot;After all that&apos;s happened this season people seem to be forgetting that we&apos;ve got the numbers one and two on our cars,&quot; Dennis said. &quot;They might not be next year, but we will do everything we can to make it happen again in two years. &quot;I&apos;m absolutely distraught about the lack of performance of our grand prix cars.

Brawn will win a lot of races because of the competition having to focus on \u00adwinning the championship last year.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s frustrations with his team&apos;s performance this season extend beyond the sluggishness of his car. Tensions between Dennis and Anthony Hamilton, the driver&apos;s father and agent, grew when the world champion was found to have lied to stewards at the Melbourne grand prix under \u00adorders from Dave Ryan, who has since been sacked as sporting director. But despite that friction, which has led to reports linking Hamilton with a move to Ferrari, Dennis yesterday backed the 24-year-old to win more world titles with McLaren. &quot;Lewis has a contract and it&apos;s a long contract,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s been very fortunate always to be in a competitive McLaren. This is motor racing. Sometimes companies give you a competitive racing car, sometimes they don&apos;t.&quot; Dennis&apos;s departure has certainly strengthened the position of Whitmarsh, who yesterday admitted for the first time that he had offered his resignation as team principal immediately after the Malaysian grand prix, on the back of the &quot;Liargate&quot; scandal.

Crown Matrimonial, his 1972 abdication drama, was a surprise, almost anachronistic, success at the Theatre Royal, Hay-market, and was widely performed all over the world as well as being filmed for television with Wendy Hiller and Peter Barkworth repeating their stage roles as the old Queen Mary and her son King Edward VIII. Ryton was an old-school traditionalist with a surprising streak of libertarianism, a conflict that lay at the heart of all he wrote. Queen Mary represented the virtues of duty and loyalty that he admired, but he also felt that affairs of the heart should be free. He respected them, whatever their manifestation, and Edward&apos;s love for Wallis Simpson created a well-written volatility for his play, set in Marlborough House, the queen&apos;s Pall Mall mansion, in 1936.  Four years after Crown Matrimonial, he represented another old queen on the stage, this time an alcoholic, old-fashioned repertory actor, Terry Jenkins, a role Ryton played himself opposite another, much younger, out-of-work actor, posing as a lorry driver, whom Jenkins picks up in a local public lavatory. The play, The Other Side of the Swamp, was a touching gay drama that proved, despite Joan Kemp-Welch&apos;s beautifully controlled production at the King&apos;s Head in Islington, too explicitly outr\u00e9 for the general taste of the time, and it never transferred to the West End.  As Terry, Ryton screeched and flounced around the stage in a performance one critic summed up as &quot;a fine amalgam of neurosis, pathos and gaiety&quot;. He appeared repulsive and grotesque, but also carried off moments of almost unbearable self-exposure in confessing a dependency on drink and pills that had brought him to the brink of bankruptcy.  Ryton was a burly man, with a mass of orange, curly hair. He was devoted to his family - he was married to the actor Morar Kennedy (Ludovic&apos;s sister) - and was incorrigibly camp in manner. His daughter admits that he had the most appalling taste in clothes, often wearing lots of red with plenty of glitter and frills. For much of the year, he went around looking like a Christmas tree but, like Quentin Crisp, he couldn&apos;t care less. He spoke in clipped, aphoristic sentences, a style he carried through in his work. Like Oscar Wilde, he was always &quot;on&quot; in public, and like N\u00f6el Coward, whom he admired inordinately, he was given to a lot of finger-wagging, both on and off stage.  He spent his early years in Shanghai, where his father was a motor car engineer. The family returned to Britain in the late 1920s, living in Worthing and Brighton on the south coast. Ryton was educated at Lancing college, West Sussex, where his taste for theatre blossomed. After serving with the Royal Navy in the Far East during the second world war - an experience about which he said very little - he attended the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London and embarked on a moderately successful career in rep.  The first plays he wrote were performed mostly in Germany, through the offices of his then agent Suzanne Czech, a German. These were comedies with titles such as The Painted Face, Penguins Can&apos;t and Make Believe. But his passion for history led him towards the royal families of Russia as well as of England. The Anastasia File (1978), for the Cambridge Theatre Company, was a witty investigation into the possibility that the eponymous princess might not have been murdered with the Romanovs, while Her Royal Highness...? (1981), co-written with Ray Cooney, suggested that Lady Diana Spencer flunked out of her marriage ceremony and was replaced by a stand-in. Ryton appeared in the West End in 1978 in his own murder comedy, The Unvarnished Truth, at the Phoenix Theatre, alongside Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor. Bernard Levin, writing in the Sunday Times, had long adopted him as an exemplary playwright with whom to strike blows at the leftwing cabal, as he saw them, at the Royal Court and on the fringe. He was certainly unfashionable, no bad thing necessarily, but his final West End hurrah, The Royal Baccarat Scandal (1989), again at the Haymarket, looked just that: a creaky, Victorian costume and courtroom drama starring Keith Michell, Fiona Fullerton and Gerald Harper, about an aristocratic card cheat who might also have been a dastardly philanderer. The play was not a success: &quot;perfectly harmless, perfectly brainless,&quot; said one critic. The family lived in Somerset and Edinburgh, camping and caravanning on holidays in the 1960s, but the success of Crown Matrimonial changed all that and they moved back to London. The play was revived last year in a touring production, starring Patricia Routledge as Queen Mary, but the expected West End transfer never happened.  Ryton suffered for many years with diabetes. He is survived by his wife, his daughter Charlotte and a stepson from Morar&apos;s first marriage, Roderick Orr-Ewing. \u2022 Royce Thomas Carlisle Ryton, actor and playwright, born 16 September 1924; died 14 April 2009", "tags": ["Film"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-17T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/18/brothers-yu-hua-review", "sentences": ["Set in Liu Town, a coastal backwater near Shanghai, the novel relates the lives of two survivors of Maoist China - Baldy Li and his stepbrother Song Gang."], "title": "Review: Brothers by Yu Hua", "article": "If you&apos;re the sort of person who&apos;s going to like Brothers, you&apos;ll know it by the 11th of its 641 pages.

Gilded lavatories and cloacal voyeurism might be your thing; if they&apos;re not, then read no more, because things are only going to get worse. Set in Liu Town, a coastal backwater near Shanghai, the novel relates the lives of two survivors of Maoist China - Baldy Li and his stepbrother Song Gang.

After the madness of Mao&apos;s last revolution ebbs, the two orphaned teenagers begin to make their way through the entrepreneurial landscapes of the Deng Xiaoping era. The honest, gentle Song Gang clings to the iron rice-bowl of a job in a state-owned factory; the flamboyantly boorish Baldy Li turns private businessman. The brothers&apos; fierce loyalty to each other breaks down when both fall for the same woman, the local beauty Lin Hong. Somehow repulsed by Baldy Li&apos;s lack of romantic finesse (he hires a gang of street urchins to serenade her with the mating call &quot;Baldy Li wants to have intercourse with you&quot;), she opts instead for Song Gang. Alienated from his one relatively normal human relationship, Baldy Li goes on to become one of the wealthiest men in China, making a huge fortune out of reclaimed scrap, which enables him to indulge his dubious sexual appetites (in particular, a fixation with virgins). Song Gang, by contrast, ruins his health in a series of dead-end jobs. Eventually, in a desperate attempt to support Lin Hong, he goes south with a conman specialising in fake cosmetic medicines, who - in order to prove to potential consumers the efficacy of his bust-enlarging cream - persuades Song Gang to get breast implants. Meanwhile, back in Liu, the lonely Lin Hong submits to the faithless Baldy Li. On returning to Liu 30,000 yuan richer, and minus (thanks to a very rough operation) his implants, Song Gang learns of the affair and throws himself in front of a train. The guilt-stricken adulterers never see each other again: Lin Hong reinvents herself as a high-class madam, while Baldy Li decides to retrain as an astronaut. Yu Hua&apos;s ambition here is to create an epic of China&apos;s last four decades: a portrait of the country&apos;s transformation from political thuggery to money worship. In the interests of achieving a faithful likeness, he has discarded the cool, sparing voice that made his name as a serious novelist between the 1980s and 1990s, and opted for crudeness in almost every respect: in the freakish protagonists and plot twists; in the repetitions and expletives; in the fountains of body fluids.  Contemporary China, Yu Hua has reasoned, &quot;is so sick that a writer can&apos;t pretend to be a doctor. Instead, the best one can do is admit that one is ill and try to describe the symptoms.&quot; His decision to make his art imitate life works best in the first third of the book, set in the cultural revolution. Here, the coarseness of the language is well-matched to the horror of the violence, while the novel&apos;s two most sympathetic characters - the brothers&apos; parents - are drawn skilfully enough for the reader to flinch at the tragedy of their lives. As you trudge through the long post-Mao sections, though, the author&apos;s refusal to process the raw material of the contemporary People&apos;s Republic grows tiring. Yu Hua owes his immense literary fame in mainland China to a series of dark, highly controlled narratives about the moral disintegration of post-1949 society. In Brothers, he has taken the crafted restraint out of his nastiness, leaving plain nastiness. A few images are arresting enough to give you pause; the rest of the text bludgeons with exaggeration or facetious use of clich\u00e9. The novel is supposed to be funny, but mostly fails to be, because its tone and plot are so relentlessly hyperbolic that no punchline can properly stand out. Yu Hua is too busy jumping from one grotesquerie to another to give us a moment to contemplate their absurdity. The book, it&apos;s probably worth pointing out, suffers from the misogyny that sours a good deal of contemporary Chinese fiction by men. The women of Liu enjoy a handful of unappealing life choices: to have their bottoms peeped at; to be groped or penetrated, with or without consent; to be left behind; or to die. If they turn a profit comparable with any of the town&apos;s male entrepreneurs, as Lin Hong does with her brothel, it&apos;s only through exploiting other women&apos;s bodies. So women, basically, are prostitutes. This is an old story, Yu Hua; tell us one we haven&apos;t heard a hundred times before. So contemporary China is in crass, chaotic meltdown between communism and capitalism; again, tell us something we don&apos;t already know. \u2022 Julia Lovell&apos;s translation of Lu Xun, The Real Story of Ah-Q and Other Tales of China, will be published by Penguin Classics later this year.

Chowringhee has that essential quality of a good novel: the capacity to escape, and help the reader escape, time. You want to turn the pages, but you do not want the pages to end. The words are fresh, and the world of the novel is completely alive, despite being written over 40 years ago.  First published in Bengali in 1962, the novel became a bestseller and was translated into a number of Indian languages and made into a film and a play. But it has taken until now for it to be published in English outside India. Below the radar when Salman Rushdie surveyed the scene for his 1997 anthology, The Vintage Book of Indian Writing, it did not surface even for Amit Chaudhuri&apos;s later Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature, which begins with a large section on Bengali writing. Perhaps Sankar was too popular to be noted, even though two of his other books, Seemabaddha (Company Limited) and Jana Aranya (The Middleman) had the accolade of being filmed by the legendary Satyajit Ray.  In a recent interview Sankar explains how he discovered Chowringhee, Calcutta&apos;s glittering esplanade and the world of his novel. From being a street hawker and a typewriter cleaner, by luck he became a clerk to India&apos;s last British lawyer, Noel Barwell. &quot;I was 17 and in constant awe of Noel. But he treated me like a friend and exposed me to the &apos;high life&apos; of the rich and famous. I used to stay at [the hotel] Shahjahan&apos;s servants&apos; quarters as his employee. I had a greenroom view of cabaret dancers, the private lives of celebrities ... &quot; After Barwell died, Mani Sankar Mukherji became Sankar the writer.  The book is a banquet of stories served by a wide-eyed narrator, rather confusingly named Shankar and shaped by the hotel he comes to work in, the same Shahjahan. Although one of the characters tells us, &quot;At least a dozen novels about hotels are written in this country every year,&quot; I am not aware of another. There ought to be hundreds of them. The Shahjahan has cousins scattered around the world: the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, Raffles in Singapore, the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, Reid&apos;s Palace in Madeira - hotels that nurture history and the memories of their guests and slowly develop a character of their own. You would expect them to loom large in modern fiction, given the number of writers who have stayed in them, but Shahjahan does seem to be surprisingly alone. &quot;It wasn&apos;t so much a hotel as a framed picture. In the alluring curves was not the arrogance of modern skyscrapers but the stamp of ancient aristocracy. Like a beautiful bride&apos;s bracelet, the neon light glinted in the darkness. It had three bands - green at the extremities and red in the middle; the flirtatious winking was limited to the green, while the red was like the unblinking eye ... &quot; Shankar is also refreshingly different. He begins as a babu who &quot;revelled in the role ... the lawyer&apos;s clerk&quot;. He&apos;s happy to salute Curzon, &quot;the English Lord, much maligned by history&quot;, on the first page and, at the end of the novel, quote Kipling in another ancient Calcutta hotel, railing against the sham of life. In between he quotes lines from other poets who are not identified but were perhaps obvious, as were the real-life models for some of the characters, to Calcutta readers in the 1960s. But other than a tendency to hyperbole in the early pages, Shankar does not inflict babu speech on the reader. Although many of the conversations take place in English there are none of the distractions of clever linguistics and forced humour with which babu characters so often burst the bubble of fiction and hurl us out of a story. Perhaps this is an unexpected consequence of the book having been written in Bengali. The early history of modern Bengali literary writing is said to have been a negotiation between a formal high style and the liveliness of everyday speech. Buddhadeb Bose, writing in 1948 on the impact of Tagore and Pramatha Chaudhuri, identifies the &quot;War of Words&quot;, a &quot;battle that raged over the new style of prose&quot;. Everyday spoken Bengali, which both these writers promoted, was regarded as too lightweight by the establishment of the time. But by the mid-century, Bose writes, &quot;The quality and quantity of our recent spoken-tongue prose indicate that though Pramatha Chaudhuri broke the ice, Rabindranath set the stream flowing.&quot; Chowringhee is perhaps a part of that flow. The writing is natural and uncluttered. The translation is transparent and one questions it only rarely over the odd phrase or image. Shankar is despondent on the death of his English employer. Then he stumbles into a job behind the reception desk of the Shahjahan, thanks to the help of a magnanimous but failing detective, Byron, whose client is the hotel manager Marco Polo (first seen in a &quot;sleeveless vest and tiny red briefs&quot;). Immediately we get an inkling that we are stepping into a Calcutta that offers rather more than the standard dal and masala fare. As it turns out, dal barely gets a mention in 400 pages, and that&apos;s after tutti frutti ice-cream - a delight in itself.  Shankar&apos;s first task is to type out 50 breakfast menu cards. Jimmy, the steward, &quot;a veritable Mount Vesuvius&quot;, barks out the list: &quot;Strange words, some of which I had never heard before, assailed my ears: chilled pineapple juice, rice crisps, eggs - boiled, fried, poached, scrambled. The man stopped for a while, gulped, and then continued yelling in the manner of reciting a multiplication table: omelette - prawns, cheese, tomato ... and so on. Words came tumbling out of his mouth like gunfire as he came to a halt with &apos;coffee&apos;.&quot; Jimmy, like Marco Polo, is European, but in the cosmopolitan world of 1950s Calcutta, this is an unimportant detail that we discover late in the book, when the new Indian owners of the Shahjahan decide to keep the management foreign but modernise the hotel. In the end, the old Goan musician Gomez, with his love of Beethoven and Mozart, has to make way for a &quot;more cheerful&quot; band, and Shankar&apos;s contract is terminated because &quot;they&apos;re going to have only girls at the counter&quot;. But between those first breakfast menu cards and the farewell banquet we waltz into a world of Moscow mules and Manhattans, honeymoon soup and sharkskin suits. We meet Connie, a stripper from Scotland via Persia, whose dance ends with her clothed only in bursting balloons; Karabi, a hostess who services suite number 2, permanently booked for corporate hospitality; Sutherland, the WHO expert with a secret past; as well as tycoons, politicians and conscience-stricken bartenders. Karabi&apos;s dilemma of having to choose between old and new values is one that most of the characters face at some point in their time at Shahjahan, including Marco Polo and Bose-da, his right-hand man, the fount of Shahjahan lore and fixer of high-society liaisons. Shankar learns to become the trusted servant of them all.  The servant&apos;s tale, from Canterbury to Calcutta, Bangalore to Bath, often veers between anger and loss. Shankar&apos;s story in the end is one of loss: &quot;When I had checked in here, it was filled with known and familiar faces. Some left after breakfast; a few disappeared after lunch; others went away after tea. Now it was time for dinner, and no one was left ... I, the patriarch, seemed to have sat down at an empty table.&quot; Not quite true for his creator. Sankar, the writer, at the end, has Chowringhee: a lovely, charming book brimming with life and full of the unexpectedness of a closely observed world. Everything comes to the old hotel, either to the sumptuous guest rooms or to the terrace where the staff live. Love and death are never far away. Sankar writes of both simply and movingly. There will be many grateful readers at his table.  \u2022 Romesh Gunesekera&apos;s most recent novel is The Match (Bloomsbury)", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-17T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/18/long-budget-holidays", "sentences": ["Instead of the more obvious Shanghai or Beijing, Tianjin, China&apos;s sixth biggest city, is more unusual and cheaper, but within easy reach of Beijing, with a very laid-back attitude and welcoming locals."], "title": "Six-month breaks for the price of a two-week holiday", "article": "While there were never enough hours in my days in London, here in rural Portugal the time passes languorously. Once or twice a week we&apos;ll make the trek to the village of S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s de Alportel but, for the most part, we relish the solitude: planting tomatoes and peppers, trekking down to the valley to draw water from the well, reading and doing chores around the house. When we arrived a few weeks ago we were dismayed at the lack of internet up here but the absence of it has given us a greater excuse to cut ourselves off, for a while, from the bustling world beyond. News from the outside world trickles slowly up into these hills. Despite the present economic woes, there&apos;s never been a better time to get away from it all. Long-haul flights are astonishingly cheap, the pound still goes a fair distance in certain countries, and the prospect of escaping gloomy headlines has never been so appealing. But if, like me, you don&apos;t see the logic in blowing your savings on a mere fortnight in the sun, this may be the time to take more drastic action. With some careful planning, you can stretch your holiday budget to three, or even six months, leaving you recharged, and ready to return to the fray with an entirely new perspective. This kind of extended budget holiday has become a speciality of mine over the last 10 years. I&apos;ve found voluntary work on organic farms in Italy, where I got food and accommodation in exchange for only a few hours work a day. But, for the most part, I&apos;ve found places where the pounds I&apos;ve worked hard for can work for me, and lived simply and cheaply for as long as possible. In doing so, I&apos;ve stayed in India, Sri Lanka, and South America, and had some of the most enriching times of my life. I&apos;ve also seen my money put to excellent use in these places, reinforcing my belief that sustainable tourism is one of the world&apos;s truly benevolent industries. To those that may feel uneasy about living off the pound in a weaker currency, I&apos;ll point out that it&apos;s gratefully received by communities for whom tourism is a lifeblood. Handing over the rent to a local family is entirely more satisfying than handing it to a travel agent, and one can see the good that it does. Perhaps the most memorable of these trips I took was several years ago when, with scarcely \u00a3500 in my pocket, I managed to survive for almost seven months in a Keralan fishing village in India. Varkala is now a popular stop on the backpacker trail, with a handful of thriving restaurants and boarding houses set along its cliff top. By walking inland for 15 minutes, however, I found a room for a quarter of the going rate. And by agreeing to stay long term I negotiated a good rate: with the prospect of a six-month tenant on his hands, my soon-to-be landlord Duikar dropped his prices again, to around \u00a335 a month. For another two pounds a day, he threw in two vegetarian meals at the family table, and as much chai as I could drink. Both of us felt contented with the deal. With a hammock outside my room, food and miles of jungle to explore, I wanted for very little. This spring I&apos;m once again living simply, and trying to spread my money as far as it can go. With redundancies snapping up her co-workers, my wife opted to leave her job at a London art gallery, and we&apos;ve moved to a cottage in the rural Algarve to live out the credit crunch. We&apos;ve rented out our house in London, we don&apos;t have children, and I&apos;m a writer, so it is comparatively easy for us. Our rent here is around \u20ac400 a month, with the car our only other major expense. Cheaper rents are possible, but we liked this place for its orchard and the chance to grow our own vegetables.  Calling this a holiday isn&apos;t actually the right word. This experience entails a certain frugality, and the ability to do without some of the luxuries we all take for granted. But I can&apos;t complain. We get good olive oil, eggs and cheese from the village, and cheaper than the mass produced versions back home. Yesterday, we were invited to help ourselves to the broad beans that grow beyond our garden wall, and then there were the beautifully painted eggs given as an Easter present last week. If it&apos;s cocktails and swimming pools you want, your money won&apos;t go far here. But, if you live as the villagers do, eat seasonally, and keep your eyes peeled, it&apos;s amazing how little you need to spend. I&apos;ve already spotted wild fig trees to harvest in a month or two, as well as almonds and pine nuts along the brow of the hill. Like many rural places in Europe, the countryside here has emptied in recent years as the young flee to the cities. Perhaps it&apos;s a delight in seeing people move back here that makes the villagers so welcoming towards us. Or perhaps it&apos;s the satisfaction in seeing their own habits adopted by outsiders, who seem to appreciate the quiet returns of a country life. Either way, our adventure may last until the promised boom times come again. Then again, who knows. Taganga, Colombia Budget Around \u00a310 per day.     Colombia tip ... visit Tayrona Park. Photograph: Dennis Drenner/Aurora Creative/Getty Images    Why here Taganga, on Colombia&apos;s Caribbean coast, is an atmospheric fishing port surrounded by mountains. You can arrange diving trips of a few days staying on a remote beach for about \u00a315 per day. A PADI open water course for beginners costs around \u00a3150 for four days. Your life for the next six months Buy exotic fruit juices you&apos;ve never heard of, such as vanilla-ish zapote, for 50p each from the beachside stalls. Head to Maria&apos;s Baguette for a foot-long chicken curry and salad sandwich for \u00a31, or a menu of the day that includes san choche soup (vegetable and meat or chicken in broth), rice, beans, meat and avocado, as well as a dessert, all for \u00a31-\u00a31.50. &quot;Although Taganga has a wonderful friendly atmosphere, the beach isn&apos;t great so take a bus into Santa Marta, around 10-15 minutes away, from where buses go to dozens of gorgeous more classically Caribbean beaches,&quot; says Andy Hewitt, 28, a teacher from Manchester, who lived there for a few months on an extended trip to Colombia last year and who is planning an imminent return. &quot;Santa Marta has a few clubs and bars, or back in Taganga the Garage club plays reggaeton and salsa.&quot;  Rent From \u00a36 per night for a room at La Casa de Felipe (www.lacasadefelipe.com), one of the main hostels set back from beach, which makes it cheaper. It&apos;s only a short walk up the hill and there&apos;s lush gardens and a nice veranda with hammocks.  Typical food &amp; drink food \u00a33, beers \u00a31. Extras Diving \u00a315 per dive. Insider&apos;s tip Visit Tayrona national park, which looks like the set of Lost, with beaches backed by jungle and mountains, and weird rock formations for a few nights, taking a bus from Santa Marta. Take your own food, rent a hammock for \u00a34-\u00a35 a night, or pitch a tent for \u00a33 per night. Manta, Ecuador  Budget \u00a320 per day. Why here Ecuador is currently the in place for westerners looking for a long-term stay on the cheap in South America. Manta is a chilled out beach town and Ecuador&apos;s kite-surfing capital. Cheap Spanish lessons, bars, salsa clubs and a fishing port. Your life for the next six months &quot;Manta is quiet with hardly anyone who speaks English, so it&apos;s a great place to learn Spanish,&quot; says Steven Thomas, 34, from north Wales, who is there for three months after leaving the UK because he couldn&apos;t find a job. &quot;I&apos;m staying at the Ecuador Kite Surf school, whose owners Alice and Rob will take you down to the beach, lend you a surf board or, for another \u00a33, surf with you and give you some tips. You can also get Spanish lessons there.&quot; Rent Stay at the Ecuador Kite Surf School (ecuadorkitesurf.com) for \u00a36.70 per night for a room with air con.

Insider&apos;s tip There&apos;s a giant, open-air swimming pool, entry 50p, or take a truck to Santa Marianita beach 12km away, for 50p. Cusco, Peru Budget \u00a315-\u00a320 per day.     Find great markets in Cuzco. Photograph: Oliviero Olivieri//Robert Harding World Imagery/Getty Images    Why here It&apos;s a lively, fascinating place with great markets, winding streets and makes a good base for explorations into the mountains. It&apos;s a friendly city, with clean air and an amazing setting. Peru is cheaper than Chile, Brazil and Argentina, so this is a good budget alternative to Buenos Aires or Rio. Your life for the next six months &quot;I liked to get up early and walk around the cobbled streets taking photographs, chasing the light around and searching for amazing scenes,&quot; says Freya Zinovieff, 31, an artist from Cambridge who lived in Cusco for two months a couple of years ago. &quot;Women sell coca leaves and weavings and other amazing things on the pavements, and 80% of local people wear traditional dress. I sat in cafes on little plazas, drinking a lot of coffee and hot chocolate. There&apos;s a big backpacker scene and you can book bar crawls where cocktails cost \u00a31.50, but for a more authentic night out visit the witches&apos; herbalist market.&quot; Rent \u00a310 per night for a double room and use of kitchen and laundry in Tumi 1 (0084 244 413, Siete Cuartones 245), a 16-room colonial house. Typical food &amp; drink Hot chocolate 80p, Peruvian stew with potatoes and rice \u00a31.50. Extras Bus trip to mountains, \u00a35. Horse-riding trips cost \u00a310. Insider&apos;s tip: DVDs for 10p each in the markets to watch in your hotel at night. Gokarna Karnataka, India Budget \u00a35 per day. Why here Great cheap food, gorgeous beaches, a rich and fascinating culture mean this part of India is perfect for chilling out for months without ever getting bored. Gokarna, south of Goa, is a holy Hindu town with a barely developed 6km beach and has far fewer backpackers than Goa and Kerala. Your life for the next six months &quot;After so many years&apos; experience as a professional bum I have found it takes six weeks minimum to really relax,&quot; says Andrew Barber, 42, who has been travelling and working all over the world since he was 18, and has lived for months at a time in Gokarna. &quot;If the following scenario sounds familiar, then you are on the right track. Get up, have a chai and breakfast, sit for two hours with new found friends in the restaurant, spend an hour or so walking to the near-deserted Om Beach along the coast, have a swim, collect shells, snorkel. On your way back, visit the fresh water spring at the temple to fill up a few bottles. As the sun sets meander back, perhaps splurge on a cold beer, then meet friends for a two-hour dinner next to the ocean.&quot; Rent \u00a31 per night at the Sunset Cafe (just turn up) for a room with a fan, mosquito net, shared bathroom but private balcony. Typical food &amp; drink Chai 10p, breakfast of yoghurt and muesli 50p, ice cream 50p (try Prema&apos;s in Gokarna), all you can eat thali or marsala dosa 50p (try Pai&apos;s in Gokarna), \u00a31 for fried fish (at Shastri&apos;s on Om Beach), beer \u00a31. Insider&apos;s tip To make your budget go even further, walk everywhere, get a room without air-con and hot water, borrow, swap or rent books instead of buying them, cut down on drinking soft drinks and alcohol.  Tianjin, north-east China  Budget \u00a310 per day.     Noodles can cost just 30p. Photograph: Antonio Mo/Getty Images    Why here To live somewhere mind-bogglingly different. Instead of the more obvious Shanghai or Beijing, Tianjin, China&apos;s sixth biggest city, is more unusual and cheaper, but within easy reach of Beijing, with a very laid-back attitude and welcoming locals. There&apos;s a fun expat community who have English-speaking Chinese friends. &quot;You have to study the language but you pick up a lot hanging out in the bars, and once you know the numbers, how to order food and make a bit of chit chat life gets much easier,&quot; says Cassia Baldock, 30, from the Wirral, who lived in Tianjin last year for nine months after leaving a marketing job in London. &quot;It&apos;s such a chilled out place with a great atmosphere.&quot; Your life for the next six months Start the day with a massive breakfast pancake, which comes with an egg, coriander and chilli sauce for 20p. Take a taxi across town (around 50p a journey; a bus is 7p but you need to know where you&apos;re going) to the markets and traditional shops. Shops often don&apos;t have signs on the front so you have to go inside to find out what they sell. Or splash out on a posh restaurant for \u00a33 a head. Make a big deal out of lunch and meet friends for a few hours. Vegetable noodles cost 20p-30p, steamed buns with meat and vegetables 10p or pick up a takeaway with sweet and sour pork and rice for \u00a31. In the afternoon you might chill out by the massive pond at Remin park or go to the gym - you can join one for \u00a330 for two months. &quot;We lived in an area called Heping which is a bit scruffy and dusty but full of fun people, bars and cheap cafes,&quot; says Cassia. Rent Apartments can cost around \u00a380 a month (see tianjin.locanto.cn, sublet.com). Typical food &amp; drink Breakfast 20p, lunch \u00a31, dinner \u00a33, beers 50p. Extras Taxi \u00a31, gym 50p per day.

It prompted one hack to murmur that Ron Dennis would not know how to plug in a kettle, never mind think about looking after any member of the Fourth Estate passing through the McLaren camp. It was typical of Brawn&apos;s lack of pretension even though his hastily-revamped team is currently dominating the world championship. It also helps explain why Brawn commands respect from a workforce that had been badly knocked under Honda. Brawn has been able to call upon 30 years&apos; experience culminating in seven successive wins in the constructors&apos; championship for Ferrari and the same number of driver&apos;s titles for Michael Schumacher at Benetton and Ferrari. The Brawn workforce has been reduced in recent weeks from 700 to fewer than 500 in line with cost savings and a reduction of technical sophistication on the cars. Even so, that is almost 50 times more than the colleagues Brawn could count when he joined the fledgling Williams team in 1977. &quot;I had been working for a year as a mechanic in formula three,&quot; Brawn says. &quot;Whilst I was doing that Frank [Williams] and Patrick [Head] called and asked if I would come and work for them. I \u00adremember walking into the canteen and looked around. There were 11 of us, including Frank and Patrick. &quot;It was a very good experience. We had wonderful times. I was a machinist, but I did a bit of everything, from acting as a mechanic to making the pieces and fitting them to the car. I even remember driving the truck, even though I didn&apos;t have a proper licence. It&apos;s a shame that this sort of thing doesn&apos;t happen any more because motorsport is so structured in many ways youngsters don&apos;t get such a wide range of experience.&quot; Brawn stayed with Williams for seven yearsand . A period as technical chief with the Arrows team led to a switch to Jaguar, where he redefined sports-car racing by introducing F1 thinking with the world championship-winning Jaguar XJR-14. When Tom Walkinshaw, owner of the Jaguar team, bought Benetton, he took Brawn with him. Here Brawn met two key people: the designer Rory Byrne and a young driver by the name of Michael Schumacher. The combination was so successful with back-to-back championships that Schumacher, when lured to Ferrari, persuaded Brawn and Byrne to join him. Uprooting his wife and two daughters to Italy would prove the easy part for Brawn. Ferrari were in chaos, a perpetual problem that many felt the lugubrious Brawn, with his spectacles, fashionably large at the time, and owl-like expression, would have difficulty overcoming. In fact, the necessary restructuring of Ferrari would provide the Englishman with the perfect vehicle for his managerial skills. His pastime of fishing would be perfect background for the patience necessary when dealing with the expectations of an entire country desperate to see what amounted to the national team winning the drivers&apos; title for the first time since 1979. Brawn&apos;s talent lies with organising and extracting the best from the many specialist areas in a team. That includes the drivers and it is no coincidence that Brawn should have won over Eddie Irvine during the cynical Ulsterman&apos;s four seasons and four victories with Ferrari. &quot;He&apos;s one of the best guys I&apos;ve worked with,&quot; Irvine says. &quot;There&apos;s no bullshit; just common sense. Ross has the ability to discount the unimportant, which is an extremely difficult thing to do with so much going on and so much information flying around. He&apos;s as soft as putty on the surface and as hard as nails just below.&quot; Irvine was replaced by Rubens Barrichello in 2000, the Brazilian staying for six years. &quot;Ross manages to simplify things,&quot; Barrichello says. &quot;If a driver, when trying to describe what the car is doing, says it under-steers, the engineer needs to know more than that. Ross will ask you to break it down. He will ask: &apos;How bad is the under-steer on a scale of one to five?&apos; It makes you think about the problem, but in an easy and consistent way. It sounds simple, and it is. People tend to complicate things too much in motor racing, and formula one in particular, but Ross doesn&apos;t do that. He just asks the driver to explain in a straightforward way and then he does the rest.&quot; Brawn made a perfect combination with Schumacher as he controlled the strategy from the pit wall, the trust between the two being implicit. If Brawn told Schumacher that he needed to find one second a lap over a 15-lap period in order to emerge in front after a pit stop, then he would not only dig deep and find the extra pace, but he would also do it without question. When Schumacher retired at the end of 2006, Brawn took a sabbatical and went on a round-the-world fishing tour. But the challenge of turning around the Honda team proved difficult to resist. &quot;When Ross arrived, some of us feared the worst,&quot; a team insider says. &quot;We thought he would throw out half the workforce and bring in Ferrari people, but he did nothing of the sort. He left everything as it was and sized up everyone&apos;s strengths and weaknesses, bringing out the best in everyone. He&apos;s a quiet, big guy but he has a presence when he walks into the room; a rare thing for a technical person in motor sport.&quot; One area that Brawn could not control was the influence of Honda and a cumbersome, corporate management structure that had no place in a sport requiring instant, pragmatic decisions. It may have been a devastating blow when Honda withdrew from formula one on 5 December last year, but it seems that the motor giant may have done Brawn a favour, leaving the way clear for a management buyout. The car currently leading the championship was not actually designed by Brawn any more than the Ferraris were the work of his pen, but the fact that car carries his name on the nose is an appropriate signature for a brilliant technical manager and strategist accustomed to leading from the front and taking charge of afternoon tea.", "tags": ["Brawn", "Formula One", "Ferrari", "Williams", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-17T23:05:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/18/vettel-poll-chinese-grand-prix", "sentences": ["A stunning late lap from Sebastian Vettel secured Red Bull Racing their first ever pole position ahead of tomorrow&apos;s Chinese grand prix in Shanghai."], "title": "Sebastian Vettel springs Shanghai surprise by taking poll in Chinese grand prix", "article": "A stunning late lap from Sebastian Vettel secured Red Bull Racing their first ever pole position ahead of tomorrow&apos;s Chinese grand prix in Shanghai. The German sat out most of the final two stages of qualifying due to concerns over the reliability of the car but nevertheless stormed to the top of the order with a time of one minute 36.184 seconds. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso also enjoyed an superb qualifying session for Renault to line up alongside Vettel on the front row, while Mark Webber completed a fine day for Red Bull by claiming third. &quot;I am very, very happy,&quot; said Vettel. &quot;It is unbelievable that we made it to pole position in the end. This morning we had a problem with the car. The mechanics did a very good job and fixed the car. Basically it is all down to them. We have the best position for tomorrow but no points yet.

Webber&apos;s third place, meanwhile, capped a fine day for the Red Bull squad. &quot;There is no question this team has taken a big step forward since last year in terms of performance,&quot; said the Australian. &quot;Now we need to realise that beginning this Sunday afternoon. It is a big credit for the team with what they have done from Brazil [the final race of last year] to now.&quot; Brawn GP&apos;s Jenson Button will have to make his bid for a third successive victory from fifth on the grid after managing a time of 1:36.532secs while world champion Lewis Hamilton will start in ninth in his revamped McLaren. Button was out-qualified for the first time this season by team-mate Rubens Barrichello, who secured fourth place, while Toyota&apos;s Jarno Trulli will start sixth. &quot;Of course we would rather be on the front row of the grid but we will give it our best shot in the race tomorrow and see what happens,&quot; said Button Qualifying positions in full 1 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 1min 36.184secs 2 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Renault 1:36.381 3 Mark Webber (Aus) Red Bull 1:36.466 4 Rubens Barrichello (Bra) Brawn GP 1:36.493 5 Jenson Button (Gbr) Brawn GP 1:36.532 6 Jarno Trulli (Ita) Toyota 1:36.835 7 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Williams 1:37.397 8 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:38.089 9 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) McLaren 1:38.595 10 Sebastien Buemi (Swi) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:39.321 11 Nick Heidfeld (Ger) BMW Sauber 1:35.975 12 Heikki Kovalainen (Fin) McLaren 1:36.032 13 Felipe Massa (Bra) Ferrari 1:36.033 14 Timo Glock (Ger) Toyota 1:36.066 15 Kazuki Nakajima (Jpn) Williams 1:36.193 16 Sebastien Bourdais (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:36.906 17 Nelson Piquet Jr. (Bra) Renault 1:36.908 18 Robert Kubica (Pol) BMW Sauber 1:36.966 19 Adrian Sutil (Ger) Force India 1:37.669 20 Giancarlo Fisichella (Ita) Force India 1:37.672", "tags": ["Formula One", "Jenson Button", "Sport", "Lewis Hamilton", "Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-18T09:13:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/18/chinese-grand-prix-qualifying-jenson-button-formula-one", "sentences": ["If Jenson Button had qualified fifth on his last visit to China, he would have done back-flips in the Shanghai \u00adpaddock."], "title": "Jenson Button focuses on threat from Red Bull and Renault ahead of Chinese Grand Prix", "article": "If Jenson Button had qualified fifth on his last visit to China, he would have done back-flips in the Shanghai \u00adpaddock. Six months ago, the Englishman \u00adqualified 18th but such has been the dramatic change in status for the leader of the world championship that fifth place on the grid for the Chinese Grand Prix brought a furrowed brow as Button contemplated his worst qualifying position of the season. Button&apos;s best lap had not been perfect for minor reasons which he clearly understood, his main concern being the drivers ahead of him on the grid. &quot;Our car feels good here, but there were a few cars quicker than we expected,&quot; he said. &quot;You could see that the Red Bulls were very strong in the high-speed corners and we knew we would have a fight on our hands. It&apos;s going to be interesting to see how the different strategies work out in the race. We would rather be on the front row of the grid, but we will give it our best shot.&quot; Button had always maintained that his team-mate, Rubens Barrichello, would be his main competition and, for the first time in 2009, the Brazilian lived up to it by being the fastest Brawn GP driver, qualifying in fourth place. Button also expected the Red Bulls to be a force; again, it would not have been surprising when Sebastian Vettel took an outstanding pole position, with Mark Webber third. But, confounding all predictions, Fernando Alonso squeezed his Renault on to the front row by eight-hundredths of a second. The immediate assumption that Alonso was running with less fuel in order to give the team a publicity boost \u2013 later proved correct when the Renault weighed in 22kg lighter than the Brawn \u2013 was offset by unease over how Alonso might interfere with Button&apos;s race following Friday&apos;s bitter remarks directed at the Brawn drivers by Flavio Briatore. Referring to Button as a &quot;concrete post&quot; was the more colourful of the Renault boss&apos;s jibes, born of frustration over his cars not having the controversial diffuser fitted to the rear of the Brawn. Briatore was made to look even more foolish by the performance of the Red Bulls \u2013 cars which do not have the \u00addiffuser but, even more embarrassingly, the same engine as the Renaults. Part of Renault&apos;s improvement came from an all-night session on Friday when the mechanics fitted a revised floor and the first stage of a new diffuser hastily prepared at the team&apos;s headquarters in Oxfordshire following Tuesday&apos;s appeal court decision approving the controversial design. But that would not have eased Button&apos;s fears over Alonso doing his best to halt the advance of a car which Briatore continues to feel is not within the spirit of the regulations. The ongoing technical debate did not detract from a powerful nomination for the qualifying performance of the year. Following the failure of a driveshaft on each car during morning practice, Red Bull limited Vettel to one lap in the second and third qualifying sessions. It placed a huge responsibility on the \u00adshoulders of the 21-year-old German as he sat helplessly in the garage and watched the opposition get their eye in. Leaving it until the last minute, Vettel produced a perfect lap to underline the latent promise of one of the smartest and cleverest cars on the grid. The only concern this morning will be a repeat of the driveshaft&apos;s inability to deliver the Renault engine&apos;s 740bhp to the Red Bull&apos;s rear wheels for 56 laps. &quot;I&apos;m very, very happy,&quot; said Vettel, an understatement from the driver with the biggest smile in Formula One. &quot;It was a bit last-minute. I only had one run but, as you can see, you don&apos;t need more. It wasn&apos;t easy. The car was really quick, but, when you only have one lap, you can&apos;t make any mistakes.&quot; Lewis Hamilton&apos;s progress was the inverse of Button&apos;s as his McLaren moved forward from the back-half of the grid and qualified ninth behind Kimi Raikkonen, of the equally troubled Ferrari team. A new front wing and modifications to the floor had improved the performance of the McLaren, but not enough to prevent Hamilton having to drive on and sometimes beyond the limit during his best lap. &quot;They were pretty hardcore laps,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;Step by step we are moving forward. Thanks to all the guys back at the factory for doing such a fantastic job and for churning away on all the new parts. There&apos;s still a long way to go, but this definitely feels like the start of the road to recovery.&quot; Hamilton needs a good result to divert attention from the spectre of the FIA World Council hearing on 29 April into alleged deceit over an incident during the Australian Grand Prix. The burning \u00adquestion is whether McLaren&apos;s major \u00adsacrifices \u2013 the harsh dismissal of Dave Ryan, their race director, the hurried removal of Ron Dennis from all involvement with the team and the public apology by Hamilton \u2013 will be enough to appease the FIA and its president, Max Mosley. McLaren will be racing in China and next weekend in Bahrain in the hope that their efforts will not be wiped out by removal from the championship or a punishment similar to the $100m fine for their involvement in the Ferrari scandal in 2007.", "tags": ["Formula One", "Jenson Button", "Brawn", "Red Bull", "Renault", "Motor sport", "Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-18T20:32:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/19/formulaone-motorsports", "sentences": ["Oh, and here&apos;s the grid: 1 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 1min 36.184secs2 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Renault 1:36.3813 Mark Webber (Aus) Red Bull 1:36.4664 Rubens Barrichello (Bra) Brawn GP 1:36.4935 Jenson Button (Gbr) Brawn GP 1:36.5326 Jarno Trulli (Ita) Toyota 1:36.8357 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Williams 1:37.3978 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:38.0899 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) McLaren 1:38.59510 Sebastien Buemi (Swi) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:39.32111 Nick Heidfeld (Ger) BMW Sauber 1:35.97512 Heikki Kovalainen (Fin) McLaren 1:36.03213 Felipe Massa (Bra) Ferrari 1:36.03314 Timo Glock (Ger) Toyota 1:36.06615 Kazuki Nakajima (Jpn) Williams 1:36.19316 Sebastien Bourdais (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:36.90617 Nelson Piquet Jr. (Bra) Renault 1:36.90818 Robert Kubica (Pol) BMW Sauber 1:36.96619 Adrian Sutil (Ger) Force India 1:37.66920 Giancarlo Fisichella (Ita) Force India 1:37.672  Rain, rain, rainy rain It&apos;s cat-n-dogging in Shanghai, so they&apos;ll be starting behind a safety car.", "around the Shanghai International Circuit."], "title": "Formula one: Chinese grand prix - as it happened", "article": " Preamble Welcome to the early hours of Sunday morning and the Chinese grand prix. Jenson Button has won the first two races of the season, but he&apos;s fifth on the grid here and has a couple of Red Bulls between him and top spot. Sebastian Vettel had wings in final qualifying yesterday, so he&apos;s the man on pole ... but why not read Maurice Hamilton&apos;s report for a more considered preview. Oh, and here&apos;s the grid: 1 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 1min 36.184secs2 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Renault 1:36.3813 Mark Webber (Aus) Red Bull 1:36.4664 Rubens Barrichello (Bra) Brawn GP 1:36.4935 Jenson Button (Gbr) Brawn GP 1:36.5326 Jarno Trulli (Ita) Toyota 1:36.8357 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Williams 1:37.3978 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:38.0899 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) McLaren 1:38.59510 Sebastien Buemi (Swi) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:39.32111 Nick Heidfeld (Ger) BMW Sauber 1:35.97512 Heikki Kovalainen (Fin) McLaren 1:36.03213 Felipe Massa (Bra) Ferrari 1:36.03314 Timo Glock (Ger) Toyota 1:36.06615 Kazuki Nakajima (Jpn) Williams 1:36.19316 Sebastien Bourdais (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:36.90617 Nelson Piquet Jr. (Bra) Renault 1:36.90818 Robert Kubica (Pol) BMW Sauber 1:36.96619 Adrian Sutil (Ger) Force India 1:37.66920 Giancarlo Fisichella (Ita) Force India 1:37.672  Rain, rain, rainy rain It&apos;s cat-n-dogging in Shanghai, so they&apos;ll be starting behind a safety car.  And we&apos;re off! To the complete absence of squealing tyres and roaring engines, away we&apos;ve tootled with the entire field parading along behind the safety car. Timo Glock and Giancarlo Fisichella are starting from the pit lane. Fifty-six laps of full-throttle fun starts here, people ...  Lap one: So, no changes to report. It&apos;s not exaclty tipping it down, but no one wants to start aquaplaning at 200mph, I suppose. Gary Naylor&apos;s on the mic: &quot;Has Bernie designed this season&apos;s schedule to advance the argument that global warming is a myth?&quot; China was the penultimate race in the 2008 calendar, but third this time round. Get me.  Lap two: Anyway, let&apos;s get onto the real issue of the weekend \u2013 how much like a concrete post does Jenson Button look? In my opinion, no self-respecting concrete post would sport the kind of facial accoutrements that Button&apos;s known for. But what other roadside objects do this season&apos;s drivers look like...? I&apos;ll start the bidding with Sebastian Vettel = belisha beacon.  Lap three: Strategy all important in such conditions then. No grand standing from the safety car as yet, he&apos;s just cooly heading up the field, making good use of his indicators, and breaking in plenty of time. Pro.  Lap four: More wisdom from Mr Naylor ... &quot;There was a time when F1 drivers looked like film stars: the BBC&apos;s run-through the grid shows that more look like geeks these days. Which seems apt. With wet tyres perfectly capable of dealing with the surface, can&apos;t all those brains and all that money develop a helmet visor that clears the rain?&quot; Yes, what&apos;s a billionaire playboy sport without a few whizzy gadgets?  Lap six: At this speed, they&apos;ll be racing for another 1hr 41mins, apparently. My gran could do this circuit quicker than that. I mentioned strategy earlier, but to be honest, you could write what I know about F1 tactics on the back of one of Lewis Hamilton&apos;s tiny and ineffectual diffusers. All contributions to my knowledge bank welcome though (hint: email in, show how clever you are, get namecheck on award-winning theguardian.com site).  Lap seven: Still Vettel out in front, but I believe Fernando Alonso may have gone in to the pits to stock up on jaffa cakes. Safety car&apos;s going off at the end of this lap. Vroom vroom!  Lap eight: Now we&apos;re really motoring, then. I&apos;ve shifted my typing up a gear, so get ready with that refresh key. Two Red Bulls lead the charge (the Beeb have already made a &apos;bull in China&apos; gag. For shame) ... and Hamilton&apos;s made a move on Raikonnen! Up to seventh, I think.  Lap 10: Nick Heidfeld&apos;s gone for a little trip along the grass verge, but he&apos;s back on the track. Hamilton&apos;s flexing his muscles in the rain, like the glistening F1 god that he is ... and I keep confusing Toro Rossos for Red Bulls. Still the latter out in front.  Lap 11: Mark Webber has set the fastest lap, Button&apos;s up to the third \u2013 not sure when that happened, maybe Barichello let him through \u2013 and Hamilton&apos;s made a mistake, moments after I cursed him with obsequious praise. He span off, did a little 360\u00ba, and is now down the field.  Lap 13: Doh, Heidfeld&apos;s done it again, this time clipping Timo Glock and spinning to a stop. Gary Naylor has a suggestion for our looky-likey competition: &quot;Nico Rosberg looks like an expensive au pair waiting to cross the Fulham Road.&quot;  Lap 14: Hamilton and Raikkonen both take Trulli, while Vettel and Webber both pit. Alonso is some 50 seconds off the pace, struggling after reloading with fuel. Here&apos;s Bharath Rajagopalan: &quot;I see that Buemi is challenging Raikkonen. If he does overtake, can we just assume that the season is over for Ferrari and quite possibly, F1 is over for Kimi?&quot; Truth be told, I think Buemi might have gone past the Finn ... so, obituary-time for him and Ferrari?  Lap 16: With the Red Bulls having gone in, Button is now leading from Barichello. Vettel is third, Buemi \u2013 henceforth known as Raikkonen-slayer \u2013 is in fourth; our Lewis is down in eighth, just ahead of team-mate Kovalainen, who&apos;s just passed Trulli. Having a bit of a nightmare, the Toyota-driving Italian.  Lap 18: Yes, yes, yes, it&apos;s all very well, all this racing, but where&apos;s the safety car got to? Huzzah, he&apos;s back out! Yes, there&apos;s debris on the track \u2013 Robert Kubica clipped slow-moving obstacle Trulli \u2013 so the safety&apos;s out again.  Lap 19: Brawn have brought Barichello in, I think, although it could have been Button \u2013 they both look largely the same (concrete-postey). This relaxed pace is much more to my style, I have to say ... It doesn&apos;t seem to suit that impetuous young buck Buemi, though, who&apos;s decided to drive into Vettel&apos;s arse. No lasting damage to either, but Buemi&apos;s paid with a few places in the field.  Lap 20: Ferrari and McLaren are among the teams still not to have called either driver in ... And it looks like Massa&apos;s so cheesed off, he&apos;s just decided to park on the side of the track. That or his car&apos;s stopped.  Lap 21: Yup, Massa&apos;s car just died on him. So, still no points for last year&apos;s runner-up. Bharath is hitting back for Blighty&apos;s best-loved roadside marker: &quot;Does anyone else think that Flavio Briatore looks like Susan Boyle in drag?&quot; That&apos;s for you, Jenson.  Lap 22: Hamilton is now fifth, although he hasn&apos;t stopped yet, and the safety car has left the track. Barichello seems to be slipping down the field \u2013 Kovalainen has taken him now. Vettel is back in first, after the pit merri-go-round, from Button and Webber.  Lap 23: Vettel has gone off like a Red Bull-crazed youth in a corner shop (like that?), putting four seconds between him and Button in the lap since the safety car came off. Something to report from earlier: Trulli has retired after that prang with Kubica.  Lap 24: Vettel; Button; Webber; Hamilton; Raikkonen; Kovalainen; Barichello; Buemi; Alonso; that&apos;s it for now.  Lap 26: So, they&apos;re all going vroom-vroom wheeeee! around the Shanghai International Circuit. Vettel has eight seconds on Button now, but apparently some of this is down to the &apos;fuel effect&apos;. Again, all help much appreciated ... Anyway, here&apos;s Bharath again, sticking it to some more Italians: &quot;Massa&apos;s Ferrari just lost power, while driving under a safety car, and stopped. Is there a stronger indication that 2009 is over for Ferrari, as it&apos;s drivers and constructor championship total looks like a nice tyre.&quot; That&apos;s a bit fat zero, in case you were wondering.  Lap 27: Raikkonen&apos;s finally gone in, while Nelson Piquet has gone vroom-vroom wheeeee! a bit too much, and knocked the nose off his car. Looks like he&apos;s going to carry on regardless though.  Lap 28: Halfway through. Ferrari look like they&apos;re going for a one-stop strategy with Raikkonen, but that&apos;s left him well down, in 15th, and with a heavy load. And Webber&apos;s in second...! Button, like the bollard he undoubtedly is, went wide on a corner, and it&apos;s Red Bull one and two again.  Lap 30: More good stuff from Naylor: &quot;Bernie and his wife look like a kid and his mother on their way to an expensive prep school in Chelsea.&quot; Does Bernie still have a wife/mother? I certainly thought he&apos;d lost the former. But let&apos;s get more inanimate with these comparisons \u2013 how about Rubens Barichello, with that Coulthard-esque lantern jaw, as a set of traffic lights?  Lap 31: Button goes past Webber, only for Webber to retake him. Hamilton&apos;s playing another blinder in the wet, although he&apos;s some way off third still. Vettel looking good up top.  Lap 33: Hamilton pits for the first time, so he&apos;s on a one-stopper as well. No pressure on Raikkonen: if he doesn&apos;t score a point today, it&apos;ll be Ferrari&apos;s worst start in 27 years. What were you saying, Bharath?  Lap 34: Mark Webber sets another fastest lap, but Vettel is something like 17 seconds clear. Just the two retirements so far, despite the conditions.  Lap 35: Kubica and Heidfeld are duking it out for 10th. Alonso, who&apos;d got himself up to fifth, rejoins in ninth after pitting for a second time. The Spaniard has never finished lower than fourth here ...  Lap 36: Bourdais wants a go on the grass. Trouble is, like the swings, once you&apos;re on, it&apos;s so difficult to get off. Naylor nails a bit of German stereotyping to the mast: &quot;Michael Schumacher looks like a very officious traffic warden.&quot; Take that, world&apos;s greatest driver.  Lap 38: It&apos;s now Webber, from Button, followed by Vettel, Barichello. Vettel&apos;s been in, and has a bit of racing to do now.  Lap 39: Webber pits, dropping to third, putting Button up to first, but Vettel is snorting, grunting and pawing behind him, setting another fastest lap. The word from the pit is that Button will have to stop again, so Vettel&apos;s absence from first may be short-lived ...  Lap 40: Still a bit slidey out there, and with the cars all pitting out of order there&apos;s plenty to drive for. Here&apos;s another zinger from Gary Naylor: &quot;Ferrari&apos;s performance is so embarrassing that their team look like lots of traffic lights stopped on red.&quot; Boom boom! More please.  Lap 41: Vettel, as the branding on his car would suggest, is flying, and he&apos;s eaten up Button like one of the Cadbury&apos;s variety. Way down, Alonso goes past Raikkonen for 11th. Woe is Ferrari ...  Lap 42: Button pits and returns in fourth now, behind the Bulls of Vettel and Webber, and his team-mate Barichello. Buemi leads Hamilton in fifth, while Adrian Sutil&apos;s Force India is currently in the points in eighth. Not looking good for Button, with most of the stopping out of the way now.  Lap 43: Barichello goes in for what seems like the umpteenth time, but I assume is actually his third. He rejoins in fifth ahead of Hamilton. Kovalainen&apos;s McLaren is the other car in the top eight, just ahead of Sutil.  Lap 44: Button sets his fastest lap of the race, but he&apos;s some 16 seconds off Webber. Has Ross Brawn got some magic up his sleeve, I wonder?  Lap 45: Now I like this, from Tim Robbins (of Team America/FAG fame?): &quot;Ferrari ... prancing horse? More like prancing hearse.&quot; Hey, hey...?  Lap 46: They really do need that helmet visor-wiper gizmo (see lap four) out there, it&apos;s like driving through a sea of Ferrari&apos;s tears. Full race order when I next get it...  Lap 47: Kovalainen has passed Hamilton, into fifth. Time to pull rank, I think. &quot;Now, now, Heikki, move over old chap ...&quot; Bharath has more on Ferrari&apos;s tribulations: &quot;Being a Ferrari fan is like being a New York Yankees fan. Big, rich teams with cult-like followings and highly paid dudes who never fail to fail. And they all have their legacy if criticised. Does the UK have any such team?&quot;  Lap 49: Vettel, Webber, Button, Barichello, Kovalainen, Hamilton, Sutil, Heidfeld, Glock, Buemi, Alonso, Bourdais, Raikkonen, Kubica, Piquet, Nakajima ... now swap Hamilton and Sutil, because the reigning champ has had another wee spin.  Lap 50: My word, was that a tyre falling from the sky?! Adrian Sutil, very much on for Force India&apos;s first F1 points, has aquaplaned into a barrier. He&apos;s not going to go very far without two fronts wheels, I know that ...  Lap 52: Just four laps to go, and Red Bull are within sight of a momentous first win. Now, as far as I knew, Red Bull were a joke team set up to keep David Coulthard&apos;s sex panther world tour running ... but like I said, I&apos;m no expert. Glock&apos;s up to seventh, Hamilton still in sixth.  Lap 53: It&apos;ll be a Red Bull one-two, no less. I wonder, will it be magnums of a certain energy drink on the podium? Brawn can&apos;t be too disappointed with third and fourth, though. Can they?  Lap 54: Unless something drastic happens (ie. in the Sutil vein), it&apos;s staying like this: Vettel; Webber; Button; Barichello; Kovalainen; Hamilton; Glock; Heidfeld.  Lap 55: As you were on the penultimate lap ...  Lap 56: That&apos;s it, Vettel gets Red Bull&apos;s first victory in F1. The two Bulls negotiate the puddles on the final straight and get the chequered flag, Vettel from Webber, and what a day for the British team. Button and Barichello slope over in third and fourth \u2013 where was that diffuser, eh? Maybe it doesn&apos;t work in the wet. McLaren pick up some valuable points with Kovalainen and Hamilton coming home fifth and sixth. Full classification in just a mo ...  Tum-tee-tum [German national anthem plays] So that&apos;s Vettel&apos;s second victory, after a win in similar conditions at Monza last year.

Current leader of the standings, Jenson Button, had to settle for third, while Lewis Hamilton came home in sixth for McLaren. The result leaves Button with 21 championship points, six ahead of fellow Brawn driver Rubens Barichello, who finished fourth. Vettel&apos;s win sees him join Timo Glock on 10 points. Meanwhile there was more misery for Ferrari, who remain without a point after Kimi Raikkonen finished 10th and Felipe Massa retired. With the weather forcing the gird to start behind the safety car, the race came down to a tactical battle between Red Bull and this season&apos;s pace-setters Brawn. Although both Barichello and Button had been quicker in qualifying once fuel load was taken into account, Vettel in particular tore around the circuit as the teams played cat and mouse through successive pit stops. Button briefly led, but Vettel soon regained the front when the British driver went in for refuelling, and never looked like relinquishing the lead as he and Webber built a commanding advantage over the rest of the field. Lewis Hamilton fought his way up after starting down in ninth, but span on more than one occassion to allow McLaren team-mate Heikki Kovalainen to eventually take fifth. The point-scorers were completed by Timo Glock&apos;s Toyota and the Toro Rosso of Sebastien Buemi. Button conceded Brawn GP were simply outpaced. His hopes were dealt a blow when clouds gathered for the first time this weekend before rain fell steadily a few hours before the race. Consequently, organisers decided to start the grand prix behind the safety car. That left Webber and Button vying for second. &quot;They seemed to be very strong from the word go,&quot; said Button. &quot;It was a very difficult race today and I am so pleased that we got both cars to the end of 56 laps and scored as many points as possible. &quot;The conditions were pretty crazy with rivers of water all over the circuit which changed every time you encountered them. Mark Webber and I had a good fight for a few laps but I just couldn&apos;t stay with him. However to finish the race today is an achievement in itself and to be on the podium is fantastic. We couldn&apos;t have beaten the Red Bulls and congratulations to Sebastian and Mark on a great result.&quot; Brawn GP had been unable to do any testing in the wet prior to the start of the season and the struggle with the car&apos;s tyres in the conditions today is a cause for concern for Button. &quot;I don&apos;t know if anyone else struggled but Rubens and myself struggled quite a bit,&quot; he added. &quot;I don&apos;t know what reason for that is. Obviously the car is working in a different way, but we will solve those problems I hope in the future because we can&apos;t have these guys that far in front. We just couldn&apos;t challenge these two guys [Vettel and Webber] today, who were immensely quick. But it is great to score six points and that&apos;s important so that we can keep the consistency.&quot; Lewis Hamilton meanwhile was left to rue what he saw as one of his worst ever drives in the wet. The 24-year-old traditionally thrives in wet conditions but struggled in Shanghai, coming off the circuit five times on his way to sixth at the chequered flag. &quot;I love racing in the wet and I would say that was one of my worst wet performances,&quot; he said. &quot;I generally have good wet races but this was incredibly tough. I didn&apos;t have any downforce on this car and it was a real struggle but I am glad I got some points for the team.&quot; &quot;All weekend I have been pushing that car beyond its limits but today just proved that I wasn&apos;t able to avoid the oversteer moments. It was a little bit fun at the beginning when I had some grip but as always I don&apos;t know if it is my driving style or my car, but I seem to destroy my tyres early on.&quot; Final race order 1 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 1hr 57mins 43.485secs 2 Mark Webber (Aus) Red Bull 1:57:54.455 3 Jenson Button (Gbr) Brawn GP 1:58:28.460 4 Rubens Barrichello (Bra) Brawn GP 1:58:47.189 5 Heikki Kovalainen (Fin) McLaren 1:58:48.587 6 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) McLaren 1:58:55.351 7 Timo Glock (Ger) Toyota 1:58:57.961 8 Sebastien Buemi (Swi) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:58:59.924 9 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Renault 1:59:07.794 10 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:59:15.235 11 Sebastien Bourdais (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:59:17.641 12 Nick Heidfeld (Ger) BMW Sauber 1:59:19.319 13 Robert Kubica (Pol) BMW Sauber 1:59:30.338 14 Giancarlo Fisichella (Ita) Force India +1 lap 15 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Williams +1 lap 16 Nelson Piquet Jr. (Bra) Renault +2 laps 17 Adrian Sutil (Ger) Force India +6 laps Not Classified: 18 Kazuki Nakajima (Jpn) Williams +13 laps 19 Felipe Massa (Bra) Ferrari +36 laps 20 Jarno Trulli (Ita) Toyota +38 laps Championship standings Jenson Button (Gbr) Brawn GP 21pts Rubens Barrichello (Bra) Brawn GP 15 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 10 Timo Glock (Ger) Toyota 10 Mark Webber (Aus) Red Bull 9.5 Jarno Trulli (Ita) Toyota 8.5 Nick Heidfeld (Ger) BMW Sauber 4 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Renault 4 Heikki Kovalainen (Fin) McLaren 4 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) McLaren 4 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Williams 3.5 Sebastien Buemi (Swi) Scuderia Toro Rosso 3 Sebastien Bourdais (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1", "tags": ["Formula One", "Red Bull", "Brawn", "McLaren", "Jenson Button", "Lewis Hamilton", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-19T09:17:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/19/brawn-briatore-formula-one", "sentences": ["I&apos;d rather not talk about it.&quot; Brawn failed to win for the first time this season as Red Bull secured their first ever formula one victory in the rain-affected Chinese grand prix in Shanghai today."], "title": "Formula one: Ross Brawn unruffled by Flavio Briatore outburst on television money", "article": "Ross Brawn has declined to be drawn into conflict with Flavio Briatore after the Renault team principal called for Brawn GP to be denied their share of the 2009 Formula One television rights money.

In fact, he was one of the most strikingly original English writers of the past half-century. Esteemed for his wayward imagination and his ability to create a distinctively Ballardian world, his fiction moved through various phases while remaining instantly recognisable. Although best known for his 1984 bestseller Empire of the Sun, his first fame, in the early 1960s, was as a science fiction writer, hailed by slightly older peers such as Kingsley Amis and Brian Aldiss. But within a decade or so his reputation had modulated into that of an avant garde provocateur, admired by visual artists and punk rockers. Another decade on and he reemerged as a great novelist of the second world war experience with Empire of the Sun, shortlisted for the Booker prize and winning his widest-ever public. Yet another decade on and he seemed to redefine himself as a special kind of crime writer \u2013 one with a peculiar, sinister vision of late 20th-century modernity that appealed particularly to the younger end of Britain&apos;s literary and arts scene. And yet the &quot;serene ordinariness&quot; that he claimed for himself was manifest in his personal life and modest circumstances: he lived in the same small, semi-detached house in Shepperton, Surrey, for nearly half a century; he rarely travelled in his later decades, and he very seldom participated in literary festivals or jamborees. Jimmy Ballard was the eldest child of James and Edna Ballard, who had emigrated in 1929 from Manchester to Shanghai, where he was born. His father rose to be managing director of a British-owned textile factory there, and the young Ballard grew up in the upper middle-class, quasi-colonial style of a large house in Amherst Avenue, tended by Chinese servants and Russian governesses. A younger sister, Margaret, was born in 1937, the same year that Japan invaded China. The family, like most European expatriates, were able to carry on a normal, prosperous existence, despite shells occasionally whizzing over their house in the International Settlement. This endured until December 1941 when, immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces entered the settlement. After a year of uncertainty, in early 1943 all &quot;enemy civilians&quot; were interned in camps which surrounded the city. The Ballards were confined to Lunghua civilian assembly centre where they remained until August 1945. The young Ballard grew from a naive 12-year-old to a perhaps prematurely wise 14-year-old during his time in the camp. He was never separated from his parents and sister, and the physical privations were not especially severe. Nevertheless, the contrast with their previous lifestyle was extreme, awakening in the boy a lifelong sensitivity to dislocations, sudden reversals, paradoxes, and ironies. A few months after the Japanese surrender, he was repatriated to England, a country he had never seen, together with his mother and sister (his father did not finally return to the west until after the Communist takeover of China in 1949). From early in 1946 he was a boarder at The Leys school, Cambridge, where, when he entered the sixth form, he concentrated on scientific subjects. While there, he won an essay prize but did not contribute to the school magazine. In 1949 he moved up the road to King&apos;s College, Cambridge, where he read medicine for two years but left without taking a degree. However, the experience of dissecting cadavers left its mark on his imagination. His reason for dropping out was the desire to become a writer. In May 1951 he was co-winner, with a piece called The Violent Noon, of a short story competition held by Varsity, the Cambridge student newspaper. (The other winner was DS Birley \u2014 later to become Sir Derek Birley, eminent educationalist and author of some classic cricket books.) Ballard&apos;s father suggested that if he wanted to be a writer, he should resume his higher education at the University of London, reading English. This he did, but again he dropped out, after just one year. As he strove to become a writer, submitting stories unsuccessfully to literary magazines, he earned a living by various short-term jobs: Covent Garden flower market porter, advertising copywriter, door-to-door encyclopedia salesman. Then, in 1954, he volunteered to join the RAF as a trainee pilot, despite being exempt from national service. It was a romantic impulse that sustained him for just one year, largely spent at a frozen airfield in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The experience of flying (aircraft had been an obsession since boyhood) fed his imagination, but perhaps the most significant aspect of his time in Canada was his discovery, in the servicemen&apos;s canteen, of American science fiction magazines. Back home in 1955, awaiting discharge from the RAF, he wrote his first sci-fi story, Passport to Eternity, in emulation of US writer Jack Vance. It was eventually published in 1962. Also in 1955 he married Mary Matthews, whom Ballard declared to be a great-niece of Cecil Rhodes. Their first child, a son, was born the following year, soon followed by two daughters. The family moved from digs in Notting Hill, west London, to a flat in Chiswick and then on to Shepperton, where they had settled by 1960. Ballard worked as a librarian and as a scriptwriter for a scientific film company. His newfound enthusiasm for science fiction \u2013 particularly of the American, Galaxy magazine school \u2013 fed into his writing, and soon he was selling short stories to British sci-fi magazines. The first to appear was Prima Belladonna in Science Fantasy (1956). At the same time, Ballard developed a strong interest in the visual arts, especially surrealism and the nascent pop art represented by the This is Tomorrow exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery, which he visited shortly after it opened in 1956. The editor of New Worlds, Ted Carnell, who was to become his literary agent for the first 10 years of his career, helped him obtain a new job, as assistant editor of The Baker, from which he soon moved on to the assistant editorship of a weekly science journal, Chemistry and Industry. For four or five years, Ballard was a short story writer, a period that climaxed in 1960 with the publication of his remarkable tale, The Voices of Time. Set amid desert landscapes, in a moodily-depicted near-future world situated in a larger, declining universe, it introduced its readers to what Amis was later to call &quot;the inner reaches of Ballard-land&quot;. After more than 20 magazine short stories, his first four books arrived in a burst in 1962 \u2013 The Wind from Nowhere and The Drowned World, and the collections The Voices of Time and Billenium, all published as 50 cent paperbacks by Berkley Books of New York. The Drowned World appeared as a hardback in Britain early in 1963 to wide acclaim, along with the two follow-up collections issued by Gollancz, especially The Terminal Beach (1964). On the strength of this, and as the stories continued to spill out, Ballard became a full-time writer. Then tragedy struck. On a family holiday in Spain in September 1964, his wife contracted an infection and swiftly died of galloping pneumonia. As Aldiss was later to say: &quot;It unhinged Jimmy for some while.&quot; He wrote nothing for about six months and drank too much. Nevertheless, resisting suggestions that he farm them out, he continued to care for his three children. &quot;It was an extremely happy childhood,&quot; his daughter Fay said later. &quot;Daddy sacrificed everything to bring us up. We had a lady who came in to change and wash the sheets every Friday, but apart from that he did everything, and he did it brilliantly. Our home was a nest, a lovely, warm family nest.&quot; Gradually emerging from that nest in 1965-66, Ballard joined in the swinging 60s. His novels The Drought and The Crystal World appeared (both largely written before his wife&apos;s death); he became prose editor of the poetry magazine Ambit; and his friendship with the new, young editor of New Worlds, Michael Moorcock, led to fashionable parties, occasional drugs and new women friends. He was encouraged to experiment in his writing, beginning a &quot;non-linear&quot; phase with his story You and Me and the Continuum. He became something of a guru to a circle of younger sci-fi writers, some of them visiting Americans such as Thomas M Disch and Pamela Zoline. One of Moorcock&apos;s editorials was entitled Ballard: The Voice. Stories appeared in Encounter, The Transatlantic Review and various small magazines. But no new novel would appear for seven years. His next significant book was The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), a collection of the nine so-called condensed novels plus half a dozen brief prose satires (the latter included his most infamous title, &quot;Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan&quot;). His next novel, Crash (1973), was written in a state of what he later described as &quot;willed madness&quot;. Enlarging on a theme first broached in the preceding book \u2013 the psycho-sexual role of the motor car in all our lives \u2013 it was to be his most extreme work, a Jean Genet-like rhapsody on all the conceivable erotic overtones of the car crash. (It was written as a motorway extension was being built past the end of his street in Shepperton.) A fortnight after he delivered the manuscript, in February 1972, Ballard experienced his first car crash while coming home late one night from central London \u2013 &quot;a case of life imitating art,&quot; as he said later. Fortunately, he was not badly hurt (and no one else was involved), but he was banned from driving for a year, during which he was inspired by this event and its aftermath to write another car crash novel, Concrete Island (1974). Crash itself received poor reviews in the British press but was acclaimed abroad and more than two decades later, it formed the basis of a provocative film directed by David Cronenberg. Life seemed to quieten down for Ballard from the mid-1970s. He saw his children through school and university. He did not remarry, although he had a long-lasting relationship with Claire Churchill Walsh, whom he had first met in the late 1960s. His novels, High-Rise (1975), The Unlimited Dream Company (1979), and Hello America (1981), were well received, as were the short stories he had resumed writing. But none of this prepared his readers for the surprise that was to come in 1984 when he published his largest novel to date, Empire of the Sun. It became a UK bestseller, gained him a new readership, and won the Guardian fiction prize. It failed to win the Booker prize, despite being the bookies&apos; (and reviewers&apos;) favourite. A heavily fictionalised version of his childhood in Shanghai, it was hailed as a major war novel and it is likely to be the book upon which much of his reputation will rest. Ballard revisited North America for the first time since his RAF days to attend the Los Angeles premiere of the Steven Spielberg film of the novel in December 1987. A quasi-sequel followed, The Kindness of Women (1991) \u2013 more of a sequence of short stories than a novel, based on his life story from 1937 to 1987. Like Empire of the Sun, it represented a fantastication of his autobiography and was a powerful and moving book, gaining high praise from British critics. To promote its launch, and at the behest of the BBC, he undertook another of his rare travels, his first visit to Shanghai since childhood, where interviews with him were shot for a memorable BBC Four Bookmark programme in 2004 entitled Shanghai Jim. Other late novels included The Day of Creation (1987), a psychological fantasy set in an imaginary Africa; Rushing to Paradise (1994), a not entirely successful satire-cum-horror story set in the South Seas; Cocaine Nights (1996), the first of his crime and detection stories, set in the south of Spain; and Super-Cannes (2000), a crime novel set in a huge business park on the Riviera. The last was the best \u2013 sly, witty and extraordinarily inventive in its attack on eve-of-millennium complacency. His Complete Short Stories appeared as a 1,200-page volume in 2001 and must rank as one of his greatest books. Had he never written a novel, this would still make Ballard a major writer. But there were to be no more short stories after the mid-1990s, and his last two novels, Millennium People (2003) and Kingdom Come (2006), showed failing powers. His last book, the short but intensely moving memoir Miracles of Life: Shanghai to Shepperton (2008) \u2013 in which he revealed the news of his terminal illness to the world \u2013 was received with acclaim. \u2022 James Graham Ballard, novelist, born November 15 1930, died 19 April 2009", "tags": ["JG Ballard", "Books", "Culture", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-19T19:53:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/19/jg-ballard-author-dies-aged-78", "sentences": ["In 1984, Ballard reached a new level of public recognition with Empire of the Sun, a straightforwardly realist novelisation of his detention as a teenager in a Japanese camp for civilians in Shanghai.", "The novel follows a young English boy who, like many of Ballard&apos;s narrators, shares the author&apos;s name, during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai.", "I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on, but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games all the time!&quot; Born in Shanghai in 1930, Ballard came to England with his parents after the war, where he became a boarder at the Leys school in Cambridge; stepping, as he put it, &quot;out of one institution, into another.&quot; After studying medicine at Cambridge, which he dismissed as an &quot;academic theme park&quot;, he studied English at the University of London, before taking on a succession of jobs and writing short fiction in his spare time."], "title": "Crash author JG Ballard, 'a giant on the world literary scene', dies aged 78", "article": "The novelist JG Ballard, who conjured up a bleak vision of modern life in a series of powerful novels and short stories published over more than 50 years, died today after a long battle with cancer.

Novels of disaster and experimentation, including 1962&apos;s The Drowned World and 1973&apos;s Crash, later made into a film by David Cronenberg, garnered him a growing reputation as an anti-establishment avant garde writer. Crash, in which a couple become sexually aroused through car crashes, was written as a motorway extension was being built past the end of his street in Shepperton, Surrey. In 1984, Ballard reached a new level of public recognition with Empire of the Sun, a straightforwardly realist novelisation of his detention as a teenager in a Japanese camp for civilians in Shanghai. It had taken him 40 years to prepare himself to tackle this formative period of his life \u2013 &quot;20 years to forget, and then 20 years to remember,&quot; as he later put it. The novel follows a young English boy who, like many of Ballard&apos;s narrators, shares the author&apos;s name, during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Separated from his parents, Jim at first survives on abandoned packets of food in the deserted mansions of the international settlement, before being picked up by the Japanese and interned in the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre, where he relishes his unaccustomed freedom amid hunger, disease and death. Ballard said of his childhood: &quot;I have \u2013 I won&apos;t say happy \u2013 not unpleasant memories of the camp. I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on, but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games all the time!&quot; Born in Shanghai in 1930, Ballard came to England with his parents after the war, where he became a boarder at the Leys school in Cambridge; stepping, as he put it, &quot;out of one institution, into another.&quot; After studying medicine at Cambridge, which he dismissed as an &quot;academic theme park&quot;, he studied English at the University of London, before taking on a succession of jobs and writing short fiction in his spare time. His first published story, a tale of singing plants called Prima Belladonna, appeared in the magazine Science Fantasy in 1956, the same year as an exhibition at the Whitechapel gallery which marked the birth of pop art. In this and the work of the surrealists such as Max Ernst, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Salvador Dali and Paul Delvaux he found the inspiration for what he later called a &quot;fiction for the present day&quot;. The young science fiction author &quot;wasn&apos;t interested in the far future, spaceships and all that&quot;, he explained; rather he was interested in &quot;the evolving world, the world of hidden persuaders, of the communications landscape developing, of mass tourism, of the vast conformist suburbs dominated by television \u2013 that was a form of science fiction, and it was already here&quot;. The sudden death of his wife, Mary, while on holiday in 1964 left him to bring up three children single-handedly, but the domesticity of his life in Shepperton let Ballard&apos;s imagination break free, with his work moving towards an unsettling experimental realism which pushed at the boundaries of 1960s Britain. His later work continued to subject modern life to its own extremes, with a sinister corporate dystopia in 2000&apos;s Super Cannes, a middle-class revolution in 2003&apos;s Millennium People and a descent into consumerist fascism in 2006&apos;s Kingdom Come. But the label of science fiction writer still stuck, much to Ballard&apos;s irritation, partly as a way of &quot;defusing the threat&quot;. &quot;By calling a novel like Crash science fiction, you isolate the book and you don&apos;t think about what it is,&quot; he explained. He kept the literary world at arm&apos;s length, and refused a CBE in 2003, pouring scorn on the honours system as a &quot;Ruritanian charade that helps to prop up our top-heavy monarchy&quot;. He is survived by his partner Claire Walsh and three children, James, Fay and Beatrice. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 21 April 2009.

But he insists: &quot;There&apos;s something inside me.&quot; That something helped him turn a 7\u20135 deficit into a 10\u20137 win over Mark Williams, another former world champion who is trying to regain past glories here. &quot;It&apos;s all in my head,&quot; Hendry said recently of the disparity between his practice form and his performances in the arena, and perhaps an early break to allow Williams to carry out repairs to his cue provided Hendry with an \u00adopportunity to regather his momentum and his composure. He returned to close out the match by taking the following five frames. &quot;I was pretty devastated to be 5\u20134 down [on Saturday night] from 4\u20131 up and I didn&apos;t feel confident tonight,&quot; said the seven-times champion, who beat Williams to claim this title in 1999. But neither, Hendry added, had he suffered &quot;so many flukes and bad rubs of the ball against me and still won&quot;. Hendry acknowledged that his recovery was assisted by Williams&apos; cue malfunction and his opponent said: &quot;I had to put a new tip on. You need to play it in for a couple of days but, brand new, I was \u00adstruggling with it.&quot; &quot;Something switched on inside me,&quot; said Hendry of the 51 clearance which enabled him to snatch the next frame on the black. He equalised with a run of 83, prevailed in another black-ball finish after Williams had missed first chance at it and added two more frames for his victory. Graeme Dott, another former world champion who has been in the doldrums, also scored a heartening win by putting out Barry Hawkins 10\u20138 in a high-quality contest which produced a break of at least 60 in every frame but three. Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s 10\u20135 first-day defeat of Stuart Bingham, featuring a clearance of 140, two more centuries, two 90s and four more breaks over 60 has still given the defending champion cause for concern. Once he is in around the pink and black, O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s touch, control and shot \u00adselection tends to make the game look absurdly easy, but the long pots that can be needed to initiate such contributions have been failing. &quot;I was missing the long ones badly,&quot; said O&apos;Sullivan, who has likened such failures to a tennis player losing his serve. &quot;When you start to do that, you beat yourself.&quot; This may well be a legacy of breaking his cue in disillusionment with how the game was being run on the eve of \u00adJanuary&apos;s \u00adMasters. To have gone on to win the \u00adtournament with an unfamiliar \u00adimplement had the game&apos;s old hands shaking their heads in wonderment. That cue did not feel right, though, and he has changed again. Each cue behaves slightly \u00addifferently on long pots and those \u00adrequiring sidespin and adjustment tends to take time. It is just as well for O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s chances of a fourth world title this year that the most fluent break-maker snooker has ever seen also has a superb safety and tactical game. Mark Allen, Northern Ireland&apos;s finest prospect since the days of Alex Higgins and Dennis Taylor, resumes this morning with a 7\u20132 lead over Martin Gould and seems certain to be O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s next opponent, with a quarter-final place at stake. Mark Selby, the runner-up here two years ago, took a 6\u20133 overnight lead over Ricky \u00adWalden, the Shanghai Masters champion and the most dangerous of this\u00a0year&apos;s four \u00a0tournament debutants.

The last such was between 1931 and 1945, and marked the end of Britain&apos;s financial ascendancy and its replacement by that of the United States. It might be argued that the cold war represented a similar period, but that is a fallacy: the cold war was an ideological struggle between two powers that were always hopelessly ill-matched. This new period is marked by the rise of China and the decline of the US. Arguably the process started around a decade ago, but at that stage it was barely noticed, such was the west&apos;s preoccupation with 9/11 and its after-effects. Indeed, the Bush administration was thinking in exactly the opposite terms: that the world was entering a golden age of American global power. It is more appropriate, however, to date the beginning of the new era from 2008. First, the election of Barack Obama signalled a recognition by the US of the limitations of its own power and the need for it to co-operate with other nations. Second, China has reached a point where it is now clearly prepared, on the basis of the advances of the last three decades, to assume a more active global role. And third, the onset of the global financial crisis provides the context for the decline of American economic power and illustrates the extent to which it has become dependent on China for the continuation of its global financial hegemony.  Such periods of transition are profoundly unstable, deeply uncertain and fraught with danger. The world is fortunate - for the time being, at least - that it has an American president in Obama who is prepared to take a conciliatory and concessive attitude towards America&apos;s decline and that it has a Chinese leadership which has been extremely cautious about expressing an opinion, let alone flexing its muscles.  The picture, however, is changing rapidly; indeed, this year has already witnessed a marked change in Chinese attitudes. Ever since Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese approach has been based on taoguang yanghui - hide one&apos;s capabilities and bide one&apos;s time. But a succession of statements and initiatives suggest that Chinese policy has now entered a new phase. Premier Wen Jiabo expressed a strong confidence at the Boao Forum in Hainan on Saturday that China was successfully weathering the effects of the global economic crisis. During his visit to Europe for the Davos meeting, he made clear that reckless western economic policy, especially by the US, was responsible for the crisis. He also declared that China would not give funds to the IMF unless the latter was subject to major reform.  Later he expressed strong concern about US financial policy and its impact on the dollar, seeking reassurance that the value of China&apos;s US treasury bonds would not be prejudiced. In a carefully staged run-up to the G20 summit, Vice-premier Wang Qishan set out a vision of a new monetary order while, most dramatically of all, the central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, called for a new global currency based on using the IMF&apos;s special drawing rights, an idea immediately rejected by the US. Meanwhile, a meeting of the finance ministers and central bank chiefs from China, India, Russia and Brazil that preceded the G20 summit called for greater voting rights for developing countries in international financial organisations. This new assertiveness is finding other forms of expression in Chinese society. A new book by five nationalistic authors, Unhappy China, argues that China has no choice but to become a superpower: published in March, it immediately shot to the top of the bestsellers list. There has also been an intense public debate about whether the country should continue purchasing US treasury bonds, especially given their extremely low interest rate. It is now abundantly clear that China is prepared to take an active and interventionist role in international financial affairs. Given that the global financial crisis is at the top of every agenda and that reform of the existing global financial order is now irresistible, this has far-reaching implications: China will be a central player in whatever new architecture emerges from the present crisis. This represents an extraordinary change even compared with two years ago, let alone five years ago, when China was not even included in discussions on such matters. But it also has a much wider significance.  The rise of China and the decline of the US will, at least during this period, be enacted overwhelmingly on the financial and economic stage. And China has now demonstrated that it intends to be a full-hearted participant in this process. It is not difficult to predict some of the likely consequences: the G20 will in effect replace the G8 and the IMF and the World Bank will be subject to reform, with the developing countries acquiring a greater say. The most audacious proposal that has so far emanated from Beijing, almost completely unforeseen, is the suggestion for a new global currency which might, in time, replace the role of the dollar as the world&apos;s reserve currency. Whether or not such a proposal would ever see the light of day, or indeed work, given that reserve currencies have always depended on a powerful sovereign state, it nonetheless provides us with an insight into the strategic financial thinking that now informs the Chinese government&apos;s approach. Clearly they recognise that the days of the dollar as the dominant global currency are numbered. This would also, incidentally, signal the end of New York as the global financial centre.  But this is only one side of the picture. On the other side is the growing role of China&apos;s currency, the yuan, which has so far attracted little attention. Although the yuan remains non-convertible, it is evident that the Chinese are seeking to progressively internationalise its role. The Chinese government recently concluded a number of currency swaps with major trading partners, including South Korea, Argentina and Indonesia, thereby widening the use of the renminbi outside its own borders. It is also in the process of taking steps to increase the yuan&apos;s role in Hong Kong. This is significant because of the latter&apos;s international position. In addition, the government has announced its intention of making Shanghai a global financial centre by 2020. The likely longer-run trends, then, are perhaps not so difficult to decipher; the short term, however, in the context of a highly volatile financial climate, certainly is. The dollar&apos;s strength over the past couple of years remains something of an anomaly, given the catastrophic state of the US financial system. It would be a brave person who bet on the dollar&apos;s strength continuing; it is much more likely, in fact, that at some point its value will plummet. Should that happen, then the dollar&apos;s global position could rapidly be undermined and the need for more fundamental global financial reforms made more urgent. All of this would only serve to accelerate the decline of the US and the rise of China. \u2022 Martin Jacques&apos;s book, When China Rules the World: the Rise of the Middle Kingdom and the End of the Western World, is published in June  martinjacques1@aol.com", "tags": ["China", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-19T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/20/hey-whats-that-sound-pipa", "sentences": ["There&apos;s a Liu Fang YouTube tutorial, but serious musicologists should seek John Lawrence Witzleben&apos;s book, Silk and Bamboo Music in Shanghai, for information on the intricate playing styles of the pipa."], "title": "Hey, what's that sound: Pipa", "article": "What is it? A kind of Chinese lute. Although the design has changed throughout the centuries, the modern pipa is generally four-stringed with 16 frets and a pear-shaped wooden body. Who uses it? Wu Man is generally regarded as being the hottest pipa player in the world. Other notable players include Jie Ma (who mixes the pipa with free jazz) and Liu Fang. There&apos;s at least one Chinese rock band \u2013 Cold Fairyland \u2013 who anchor their sound around the pipa, and even pretty boy alt-metallers Incubus are known to doodle around with one. How does it work? There&apos;s a Liu Fang YouTube tutorial, but serious musicologists should seek John Lawrence Witzleben&apos;s book, Silk and Bamboo Music in Shanghai, for information on the intricate playing styles of the pipa. Generally, though, it requires virtuosic technique, with complicated-looking five-fingered tremolos, rapid slides and cascades of rolling notes. The instrument is played almost upright, and the strings are plucked, with the player wearing false nails made of plastic or tortoise-shell. Where does it come from? Two early versions of the instrument date back to the Qin Dynasty, and as well as the modern pipa (which began to accommodate 12-tone western harmony in the 20th century), these instruments also evolved into Asian lute-like instruments such as the biwa (Japan), the d\u00e0n ti b\u00e0 (Vietnam), and bipa (Korea). There are some similarities with Middle Eastern lutes like the barbat, too. Why is it classic? The pipa is something of a totem of Chinese culture. Pipa-playing warriors feature in ancient sculptures and artwork, and it is often rhapsodised in classic Chinese literature. What&apos;s the best ever pipa song? Westerners are more likely to start with contemporary, minimalist works for the instrument. The Cusp of Magic, released last year, was a work commissioned for Terry Riley&apos;s 70th birthday by the Kronos Quartet and features Wu Man. From there, check out Philip Glass&apos;s similarly Wu-boasting Orion, commissioned for the 2004 Olympics.            Five facts and things! Although usually referred to as &quot;the Chinese lute&quot;, the Qin Dynasty origins of the pipa place the silk-stringed instrument&apos;s birth at something like 221 BC. Whereas, the lute itself wasn&apos;t even called a &quot;lute&quot; before the 20th century. The classical Chinese pipa canon is built around 10 main technique-testing pieces. These include Ambush from Ten Sides, Dragon Boat, Dance of the Yi People and Moonlight Spring in River. A fitting description of the instrument&apos;s delicate tonality can be found in a poem by the Tang Dynasty&apos;s Bai Juyi: &quot;The bold strings rattled like splatters of sudden rain. The fine instruments hummed like lovers&apos; whispers. Chattering and pattering, pattering and chattering. As pearls, large and small, on a jade plate fell.&quot; Ah. A key player in the resurgence of the pipa was Lin Shicheng, who taught the best of the modern pipa players \u2013 Liu Dehai, Liu Guilian, Gao Hong and, naturally, Wu Man. Shicheng&apos;s 1996 album with Hong, Hunting Eagles Catching Swans, is regarded as a modern classic.

Perhaps searching for a \u00adBallardian cinema in ordinary terms is obtuse: we should be looking instead at CCTV footage taken from any shopping-mall security camera, or the Big Brother daytime live feed, or one of the direct-impact 9/11 World Trade Centre plane-crash shots \u2013 avidly consumed on YouTube, but now considered too brutal for television. Ballard was a poet of the occult fear, the subliminal horror. His work explored the unexpressed, anarchic \u00adeuphoria lurking in the interstices of modern, rational civilisation, the longing to smash things up. If there is a \u00adBallardian presence in the cinema, it is Lee Harvey Oswald, sitting in a darkened Dallas movie theatre in 1963, watching the Audie Murphy picture War Is Hell, waiting for the cops to pick\u00a0him up. It is a great irony that the film-maker who brought Ballard fame, and indeed fortune, was Steven Spielberg, with his muscular account of \u00adBallard&apos;s most conventional book. The \u00adautobiographical Empire of the Sun told the wartime story of how, as a boy, Ballard found a painful yet thrilling freedom in a Shanghai \u00adcivilian internment camp. Spielberg would have found Ballard&apos;s more typical novels uncongenial, and yet his \u00adcasting of Christian Bale as the troubled teenage boy is interesting: Bale grew up to star in American Psycho and \u00adBatman, and has a very Ballardian \u00adintensity, even in that early film. The other movie with which Ballard is associated is David Cronenberg&apos;s \u00adfeeble version of Crash: a novel about the erotic possibilities of the car crash. Cronenberg&apos;s adaptation was the \u00adsubject of a now long-\u00adforgotten fuss about explicit movies; in fact, \u00adcynics might now feel that the film \u00aditself is the car crash, and not a very sexy one. And yet Cronenberg himself has some claim to be a Ballardian film-maker, \u00adparticularly for his satisfyingly creepy and nasty Dead Ringers, with Jeremy Irons giving a disquieting \u00addouble \u00adperformance as gynaecologist twins. As for other film-makers, David Lynch may also have inhaled some of the troubling, invigorating fumes that Ballard&apos;s book released into the atmosphere. Gus van Sant&apos;s \u00adElephant, his eerily detached film about the Columbine killings, has a Ballardian sheen; Michael Haneke&apos;s surveillance nightmare Hidden owes something to his cool, forensic detachment. Ballard himself had a lively interest in the cinema as a neurotic activity, whose truths are happening, as it were, behind the audience&apos;s back. His late masterpiece, Super-Cannes (2000), was about the technological utopia \u00adbeing built in the hills above the Cote d&apos;Azur, with its retail units and apartment buildings: a world apparently perfect and yet also an unexploded bomb of irrational human self-\u00addestruction and malice. The Cannes film festival, as exemplified by its gleaming new Palais building, is a part of this covert dysfunction: it exemplifies a film business that has become the conduit for crime, cupidity and rage \u2013 emotions that have nothing to do with the generic storylines being officially rolled out on the screen. It was 9/11 that finally proved \u00adBallard&apos;s relevance and modernity. As the author of High-Rise and Crash, he intuited the catastrophe to come, a catastrophe that wasn&apos;t entirely \u00adaccounted for by the conscious \u00admotivations of its perpetrators. The great Ballardian film on this subject has\u00a0yet to be made. Architecture: Deyan Sudjic Of course, JG Ballard didn&apos;t build the hallucinogenic skyline of \u00adShanghai&apos;s Bund, with its surreal mix of \u00adVictorian Liverpool, Chicago art deco, tropical heat, Chairman Mao and a dusting of neon. But it was his city, and his \u00adevocation of its mood in his \u00adwriting gave a generation of architects \u00adpermission to explore the darker side of the modern metropolis. The Shanghai of Ballard&apos;s childhood was a city that belonged to nobody. At one point, you needed three different driving licences, issued by three different national authorities, to cross it. The police force had British officers; the jail was run by the Americans; the trams were driven by Sikhs; and out in the estuary there was a whole armada of White Russian ships, kept quarantined and offshore until they were hurriedly invited on land in the mid-1920s, to help see off an onslaught by \u00admarauding warlords. For an \u00adarchitectural \u00adprofession bounded in the 1950s by Harlow New Town and the Festival of Britain, Ballard&apos;s eruption on the \u00adimagination was a liberation. More important, Ballard didn&apos;t get stuck in the 1940s, and neither did Shanghai. After Mao, Shanghai&apos;s mayors set about building an entirely different city, of highrises and freeways, of caviar bars and Australian chefs serving fusion cuisine \u2013 an urban mix that could have come directly from Ballard&apos;s pages. His was a much more powerful insight into the nature of urban life than the squeaky-clean, sunlit \u00adutopian promises that had gone so sour by the 1960s, the period when Ballard \u00addeveloped his extraordinary vision. The future, he knew, was going to be nothing like what we expected it to be. He showed that it would be \u00adbetter for it to be dangerous, rather than a \u00addisappointment; it wouldn&apos;t be \u00adcomfortable, but the alternative would be a sell-out. Ballard was fascinated by dreams of ultra high density, by &quot;edge cities&quot; or endlessly sprawling suburbs, by freeways. He had an eye for \u00adunderstanding how places really worked, and he looked at the places in between, where the notion of tradition is absurd. He \u00adexplored business parks, airports and malls, the backlands and the badlands of the modern world. He managed to touch the imagination of architects as diverse as Nigel Coates and Rem \u00adKoolhaas, who shared his interest in \u00addystopia. He ushered architects who saw themselves as modernists out of the innocence of hi-tech \u2013 as personified by Dan Dare \u2013 into a much stranger but more poetic vision of the future. Pop: Dave Simpson JG Ballard&apos;s influence on pop was \u00adfar-reaching: he inspired artists from Joy Division to the Sisters of Mercy to Radiohead \u2013 even Madonna, the title of whose 2001 song The Drowned World is taken from a Ballard novel. Manic Street \u00adPreachers&apos; darkest album, 1996&apos;s The Holy Bible, featured a recorded sample of the author speaking \u2013 &quot;I wanted to rub the human face in its own vomit. I wanted to force it to look in the \u00admirror&quot; \u2013 a \u00adsentiment that could sum up the band&apos;s oeuvre. More recently, new \u00adravers the Klaxons&apos; Mercury prize-winning debut album Myths of the Near Future took its title from Ballard; hip Australian electronic duo Empires of the Sun stole a name from him, too. Of course, a literary reference has always been an easy route to instant credibility. But the early British \u00adelectronic period threw up a particular glut of Ballard fans, inspired by his ability to see what was strange about everyday, urban landscapes: songs by Ultravox&apos;s John Foxx (Underpass, No One Driving), The Normal (Warm \u00adLeatherette, as covered by Grace Jones) and Gary Numan (Down in the Park) reeked of Ballardian dystopia. Famously, Ballard made a large impression on Joy \u00adDivision&apos;s Ian \u00adCurtis. In her memoir \u00adTouching from a \u00adDistance, Curtis&apos;s wife \u00adDeborah recalled how he would retreat into a room full of his \u00adfavourite books, in search of \u00adinspiration. Unknown \u00adPleasures, from 1979, was influenced by William Burroughs; 1980&apos;s Closer was clearly inspired by \u00adBallard. \u00adCurtis \u00adacknowledged this in the track Atrocity \u00adExhibition, which describes the \u00ad&quot;entertainment&quot; of an execution, and took its title from Ballard&apos;s 1970 \u00adcollection of short\u00a0stories. Ballard&apos;s \u00adobsessions \u2013 the collision of \u00adsexuality and technology, the human \u00adstruggle within a \u00adconsumerist \u00adlandscape \u2013 have preoccupied songwriters from Thom Yorke to Andrew Eldritch. Perhaps the oddest pop connection lies in garage rocker Dan Melchior&apos;s 2002 song Me and JG Ballard, which describes a fantasy encounter between the two Shepperton residents in the unlikely venue of their local supermarket: the writer beats the singer to the last packet of frozen peas. Did Ballard admire any of his own fans? Although he admitted to \u00adoccasionally reading his daughters&apos; \u00adcopies of NME in the 1970s, and once called punk &quot;beautiful and \u00addangerous&quot;, he told an interviewer that rock music gave him a headache. He preferred instead repeated listening to his \u00adfavourite song: the not exactly dark-\u00adterror-fantasy world of Teddy Bear&apos;s Picnic. Visual art: Iain Sinclair The standard late Ballard newspaper portrait is against that famous Paul Delvaux painting, as if somehow high art could operate as a blast-deflecting shield, screening the sensibilities of \u00adcasual readers from the reality of the modest Shepperton house that became, over the years, a major installation piece: a pebbledash exhibit that was also a form of autobiography. I read many accounts by journalists who made the journey out there: to the upstream Edwardian pleasure colony, the river crossing for the invading Martians from The War of the Worlds. Will Self reported back and later became a friend. Chris Petit, whose novel Robinson is ripe with Ballardian echoes, gained access to shoot a short film essay. When I went, Ballard met me at the station with his car, and we adjourned to a Thames pub. What we discovered was a home that was also a set, a record of the author&apos;s influences. Those interested in enquiring further should locate a copy of Re/Search: JG Ballard (1984), a collage of text and image which is as much about film, art, advertising, as about literature. Operators as subterranean as Genesis P-Orridge have been intrigued by the warp of his world. More recently, Bill Drummond \u00ad(formerly of the KLF) has driven around the M25, loop after loop in a shamanic daze, \u00addedicated to the master. Tacita Dean forged an architecture of threat from hints in books such as The Atrocity Exhibition. All this before the books themselves, symbols of eco-\u00addisaster, appeared in Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster&apos;s \u00adcurrent installation in Tate Modern&apos;s Turbine\u00a0Hall. Of course, the Delvaux was a replica. And better for it, Ballard reckoned. &quot;The concept of replicas is so bizarre,&quot; he once said, though he was talking about handguns. The bizarre, the uncanny, the telling detail: this was what interested him most. Magritte, Delvaux, De Chirico \u2013 their perverse geometry contained in brilliantly lit dreamscapes. Ballard&apos;s elegant fictions are painted as much as written, frozen frames flickering into a narrative of their own volition. An author portrait by Jerry Bauer features something else from Ballard&apos;s Shepperton collection: an Eduardo Paolozzi print. Paolozzi was a friend from the 1960s. In 1956, \u00adBallard had \u00advisited the This Is Tomorrow \u00adexhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery, a show he considered, he said, &quot;the most \u00adimportant event in the visual arts in Britain until the opening of Tate \u00adModern&quot;. He was provoked to create his own collages, \u00adfeaturing his partner Claire Walsh and cut-ups from obscure gun-club magazines. And, most significantly, his 1970 exhibition of crashed cars at the New Arts Laboratory in London, which anticipated both the book, Crash, and David Cronenberg film. Privately, I think, Ballard would have preferred to be a painter rather than a writer, but the confrontation of his \u00adparticular demons demanded the unyielding disciple of putting words down in the right order. It&apos;s an \u00adinevitable conclusion to his long career that the flotsam that caught his attention, the images that make up the Ballardian catalogue \u2013 perimeter fences, \u00admotorway slip roads, multistorey car parks, \u00adsurveillance monitors \u2013 now feed so voraciously on the host body. Television: Mark Lawson Two short stories \u2013 Thirteen to \u00adCentaurus and Home \u2013 were the only Ballard works officially adapted for television. His major books were either too expensive (Empire of the Sun) or too sexually and politically subversive (Crash and most of the others) for the broadcasting authorities. As a medium and a metaphor, TV enthralled and appalled the \u00adauthor. As a young widower \u00adconfined to home with children, he had watched far more \u00adtele\u00advision than most men of his \u00adgeneration: many of the images that recurred in his work \u2013 \u00adVietnam, the moon landings, \u00adskyscrapers \u2013 were first \u00adtransmitted to him in his Shepperton \u00adliving room. His daughter, Beatrice, became an influential TV producer; he was fascinated by her \u00addispatches from this world. Reflections from the screen appear throughout Ballard&apos;s work. Vaughan, the villainous visionary of Crash, is inspired by American TV evangelists; in his final novel, Kingdom Come, the &quot;TV host&quot; is an exemplar of the kind of leader modern voters want; and, in 2003&apos;s Millennium People, middle-class anarchists try to lay siege to Broadcasting House. In his 1981 novel Hello America, one\u00a0of the defining aspects of the \u00adfuturistic dystopia is the sudden \u00adabsence of \u00adtele\u00advision&apos;s narcotic grip on the population. Ballard had clearly learned from George Orwell, a former radio producer who quickly grasped the \u00addangerous possibilities of a screen inside the home; but he seized on TV as a governing characteristic of the slice of time that he was given as a writer. He also lived to see a culture in which Big Brother was the jokey title of\u00a0a game show. The fact that so many commentators seized on the word &quot;Ballardian&quot; to \u00addescribe that programme is a tribute to how well his books foresaw the possible corruptions of broadcasting. The \u00adadjective derived from his name was also invoked, understandably, in \u00adrelation to other small-screen freak-shows of his era: the trial of OJ Simpson, and\u00a0the mourning of Princess Diana. \u00adBallard acutely understood the \u00adblurring between reporting and entertainment that became the dominant genre of the turn of the millennium. The urban paranoia and surreality of many modern dramas \u2013 Spooks and Life On Mars, for instance \u2013 feel \u00adindebted to his example. What is most Ballardian about TV today is the common \u00admodern experience of switching on, and being uncertain whether we are watching news or entertainment, or some \u00adhalf-life hybrid. In predicting and analysing this slippage, Ballard was\u00a0a true televisionary.", "tags": ["JG Ballard", "Books", "Film", "Music", "Architecture", "Art", "Television", "Television & radio"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-20T18:05:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/21/snooker-mark-selby-world-championship", "sentences": ["Mark Selby, runner-up two years ago and seeded to meet Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan in the semi-finals, survived a testing opening challenge in the World Championship by beating Ricky Walden, winner of September&apos;s Shanghai Masters and the most dangerous of the four debutants this year, 10-6."], "title": "Mark Selby revs up and leaves Ricky Walden in his wake", "article": "Mark Selby, runner-up two years ago and seeded to meet Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan in the semi-finals, survived a testing opening challenge in the World Championship by beating Ricky Walden, winner of September&apos;s Shanghai Masters and the most dangerous of the four debutants this year, 10-6.

The film is about a man called James Ballard, an unfeeling, alienated sort of guy played by James Spader, who has cold sex with his wife; the relationship only comes to life when they start talking about other people they&apos;ve been having sex with. These are thick-skinned people \u2013 they can only communicate on an emotional level by hurting each other. Cronenberg fits them into a hard-edged suburban landscape \u2013 your eye is drawn to concrete and metal and bad architecture. There are car parks and underpasses and windscreens and tyres and chunky metal doors. And then Spader is involved in a crash. He drives into another car, killing the passenger. In hospital, he meets the person he didn&apos;t kill \u2013 the other driver, played by Holly Hunter. She, too, is emotionally half-dead. But the fact that they have almost destroyed each other as drivers makes them sexually attracted to each other as human beings.  This, you might say, is perfect Cronenberg territory, and Spader is very good here \u2013 the emptiness we saw before turns into a kind of hungry vulnerability. He is quiet, sinister, and needy. He finds a community of people who are also turned on sexually by car crashes, and later becomes obsessed by a woman, played by Rosanna Arquette, whose legs have been smashed up. There&apos;s a pervy bit when he has sex with a wound in Arquette&apos;s leg. Yes, really.  What was Ballard trying to tell us? And why? Well, just look at his life. He grew up as an expat in Shanghai in the 1930s \u2013 for a while a privileged outsider in a foreign country. Then his suburban family had to move into the city because they were being bombed by the Japanese. Later during the war, Ballard and his family were interned; later still, he was sent to board at an English public school. When he got married and had a family, he settled down in outer north London. Then his wife died suddenly, of pneumonia, leaving Ballard and their three children in the suburbs. One can only imagine how bleak and lonely that place must have felt. Ballard wrote Crash a few years after this, while a trunk road was being built close to his house. In Crash, he seemed to be making the point that human beings hurtle around, each of us hidden behind a thick carapace, and the only time we take any notice of other human beings is when we smash into each other, and our carapace is cracked \u2013 only then can we see anything of the vulnerable person inside. Nice metaphor, in a twisted sort of way. When asked why he wrote it, Ballard said, &quot;I wanted to rub the human face in its own vomit.&quot; If you think about it, Ballard&apos;s characters are always imprisoned \u2013 in Empire of the Sun, they are stuck in the Japanese compound, and in his later work, such as Cocaine Nights and Super-Cannes, his people live in wealthy gated communities which look functional and even happy from the outside, but are really full of dark and perverted secrets.  What he wanted to tell us, I think, is that we humans are in a terrible fix \u2013 so vulnerable and prone to tragedy that we must hide ourselves behind walls, both real and metaphorical. But it&apos;s only when those walls are battered and smashed \u2013 when we are really threatened, in other words - that we feel truly alive.  I think Super-Cannes might make a great film \u2013 better, in any case, than Spielberg&apos;s thoroughly non-Ballardian adventure film of Empire of the Sun. It&apos;s the sort of thing Sam Mendes would do very well, with Spader as the haunted hero and Kate Winslet as his doctor wife. I think the best treatment of his work has yet to happen.

And his writing was steeped in what he had done before he put a finger to a typewriter in anger. Before he had even got his first short story published in the late 1950s, Ballard had survived the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, been separated from his parents, been interned in a prisoner of war camp where he lived off weevils, joined the RAF and served in Canada, been an encyclopedia salesman and even worked as a porter in Covent Garden market. Ballard had a life experience that few modern writers can hope to match. To generalise wildly, the career path of most young (successful) writers goes something like this. Go to university \u2013 preferably Oxford or Cambridge \u2013 and read English. While there, start writing novel and get a few pieces published in the university magazine. Move to London after graduation, start a creative writing postgraduate degree and pick up some work reviewing books for the literary supplements while tidying up the fourth draft of your novel. You then get your novel published, which gets a few kind reviews thanks to the contacts you&apos;ve made and sells precisely 317 copies.  But someone, somewhere offers you a contract to write a second novel and your career is up and running. From then on you have a meta life. You write because you write, not because you necessarily have anything interesting to say. You probably actually write quite well, but you are trading on style, not substance, because you&apos;ve never actually done anything much beyond writing.  The point about Ballard is that he had style and substance. Like writers such as Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut, Ballard had paid his dues in the real world and his writing had a psychological and experiential depth because of it.

Shanghai, one of the fastest growing megacities on the planet, was setting aside a giant island in the Yangtze river to create an eco-city for half a million people. British eco-engineers and green-minded architects and town planners were designing the renewably powered, car-free, water-recycling city of Dongtan as a model for the world. And its first 25,000 citizens would be living the good life there in time for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010, at which it would be by far the largest exhibit, reached by a new tunnel and bridge. Well, it is now exactly a year until the start of the Expo. The tunnel and bridge are about to open. But of the eco-city there is nothing except half a dozen wind turbines and an organic farm. No houses, no water taxis, no sewage-recycling plant, no energy park. Nothing. And all mentioned of it has disappeared from the Expo website (slogan: &quot;Better city; better life&quot;). This week, Peter Head, the man behind the project at the London-based consulting engineers Arup, who drew up the master plan, told me his clients at the city&apos;s Shanghai Industrial Investment Company had &quot;gone quiet. We just don&apos;t know if anything will happen or when. The project office is shut.&quot; There is a persistent rumour that the project has been a casualty of the political fallout from the conviction of the city boss Chen Liangyu, jailed last year for corruption. Not so, says Head. The problems are more fundamental. &quot;China does everything by the rules handed down from the top. There is a rule for everything. The width of roads, everything. That is how they have developed so fast, by being totally prescriptive. We wanted to change the rules in Dongtan, to do everything different. But when it comes to it, China cannot deliver that.&quot; It&apos;s a bit like greening the planet. Lots of grand promises, but in the end the old entrenched ways mean little happens. Greenwash, in other words. Shanghai milked the media well during the heyday of the planning. Searching for Dongtan on Google, there are around 177,000 hits. Almost all of them are built on a fiction: that the city fathers in Shanghai actually intended to do things differently on Chongming Island. That they really saw Arup&apos;s expensively produced Dongtan masterplan as a blueprint for a more sustainable future. They didn&apos;t. Not when it came to it. Tony Blair signed the deal to design and build Dongtan with Chinese president Hu Jin-tao. His deputy, John Prescott, went there twice. So did Britain&apos;s top urban planner, Peter Hall, and the London mayor Ken Livingstone, who wanted ideas for greening his urban landscape. British academics carried out energy audits aimed at giving Dongtan&apos;s future citizens an ecological footprint a quarter that of other Shanghai citizens. But they and Arup were hoodwinked as much as anyone. People like Head, whose commitment to the project was total, could have been planning other things that might have got off the drawing board. Their time was wasted. The SIIC director, Ma Cheng Liang, the man in charge of the project, told me in early 2006: &quot;We need to reduce our ecological footprint. Dongtan is very significant for Shanghai and the nation.&quot; He explained how, the Dongtan blueprint would prevent urban sprawling taking over the 100-kilometre long Chongming Island after the bridge was finished. &quot;We want to skip traditional industrialisation in favour of ecological modernism. Dongtan is a chance to develop new ways of living.&quot; Did he ever mean it? I don&apos;t know. Is it all over? Probably. With the new bridge providing easy access to Shanghai&apos;s Pudong business district, the island&apos;s western end, where Dongtan was planned, will soon be taken over by high-rise, high-footprint apartments. The first are already under construction. We all wasted our time; burned carbon flying to Shanghai to relay a false prospectus to the world. If I sound bitter, I am.

He was a friend of my father&apos;s, and my father championed his early work, calling him &quot;the brightest star in postwar SF&quot; (all purists call science fiction SF, and have nothing but contempt for &quot;sci fi&quot;). Ballard was a beautiful man, with a marvellously full, resonant face and hot eyes, and talked in the cadences of extreme sarcasm with very heavy stresses - he wasn&apos;t being sarcastic, merely expressive. The friendship between the two did not survive Ballard&apos;s increasing interest in experimentalism, which my father always characterised as &quot;buggering about with the reader&quot;. But I was always delighted to see Jim later on. Funnily enough, he was an unusually lovable man, despite the extraordinary weirdness of his imagination. His imagination was formed by his wartime experience in Shanghai, where he was interned by the Japanese. He was 13 at the time and took to the life in the camp as he would &quot;to a huge slum family&quot;. But it wasn&apos;t just the camp that formed him - it was the very low value attached to human life, something he saw throughout his childhood. He told me that he&apos;d seen coolies beaten to death at a distance of five yards from where he was standing, and every morning as he was driven to school in an American limousine there were always fresh bodies lying in the street. Then came the Japanese. He said &quot;people in the social democracies have no idea of the daily brutality of parts of the east. No they don&apos;t, actually. And it&apos;s as well that they don&apos;t.&quot; It is interesting that his two most famous novels were both filmed: Empire of the Sun by Steven Spielberg (an essentially optimistic artist who is never afraid of dark historical themes), and Crash by David Cronenberg (a much darker artist himself, and one who specialises in filming unfilmable novels). Crash is the more typical of Ballard&apos;s novels. It is animated by an obsession with the sexuality of the road accident and reminds you that the word obsession derives from the Latin obsidere, which means &quot;to lay siege to&quot;. Ballard is beleaguered by his obsessions. Mood and setting are identical in him. He had very little interest in human beings in the conventional sense (and no ear for dialogue); he is remorselessly visual. Empire of the Sun - his greatest success - came as a kind of blow to his faithful admirers. This novel, which is utterly realistic, despite the bizarre settings and incidents, seemed a betrayal of the Ballard cult. The cultists felt that Empire (as he used to call it) showed how Ballard&apos;s imagination had been warped into such a funny shape. The novel was a naturalistic explanation of how his imagination got that way. For the cultists (not very logically), again, it was like the witch doctor revealing how he faked his magic. Ballard began as a hardcore SF writer. His very early short stories, on familiar themes such as overpopulation, societal decay and so on, are as good as anything in the genre. But the genre couldn&apos;t hold him. There followed four novels of glazed apocalypse - The Wind from Nowhere (1961), The Drowned World (1962), The Drought (1964), The Crystal World (1966) - where the world was destroyed by wind, by water, by heat and by mineralisation. Then came his brutalist period, beginning in 1970 with The Atrocity Exhibition. Two stories from that book give the tone of the collection: &quot;The Facelift of Princess Margaret&quot; and &quot;Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan&quot;. Then the concrete-and-steel period extends itself with Crash (1973), Concrete Island (1974) and High-Rise (1975). The next period can again be evoked by another title: Myths of the Near Future (1982). He was still in this period when he died (despite the moving and beautiful memoir Miracles of Life, published last year). The last novels - including Cocaine Nights and Super Cannes - were about the violent atavism of corporate and ultra-priviledged enclaves in a different kind of near future.  Ballard brought to this all his shamanistic skills. He kept asking: what effect does the modern setting have on our psyches - the motion sculpture of the highways, the airport architecture, the culture of the shopping mall, pornography and technology? The answer to that question is a perversity that takes various mental forms, all of them extreme. When he broke away from rigid SF, Ballard said that he was rejecting outer space for &quot;inner space&quot;. This has always been his arena. Ballard will be remembered as the most original English writer of the last century. He used to like saying that writers were &quot;one-man teams&quot; and needed the encouragement of the crowd (ie, their readers). But he will also be remembered as a one-man genre; no one else is remotely like him. He was a talisman. Very few Ballardians (who are almost all male) were foolish enough to emulate him. He was sui generis. What was influential, though, was the marvellous creaminess of his prose, and the weird and sudden expansions of his imagery. Ballard was a great exponent of the Flaubertian line - that writers should be orderly and predictable in their lives, so that they can be savage and sinister in their work. He lived in a semi-detached in Shepperton, which might as well have been called &quot;Dunroamin&quot;, and there was the tomato-red Ford Escort parked in its slot in the front garden. When I wrote a long profile of him in 1984, I arrived at 11 in the morning and his first words were &quot;Whisky! Gin! Vodka!&quot; He told me that &quot;Crash freaks&quot; from, say, the Sorbonne would visit him expecting to find a miasma of lysergic-acid and child abuse. But, in fact, what they found was a robustly rounded and amazingly cheerful, positively sunny - suburbanite. In 1964 his wife Mary died suddenly, on a family holiday, so Ballard raised their three children himself. To begin with he could only manage to do this by drinking a scotch every hour, starting at nine in the morning. It took him quite a while to push this back to six o&apos;clock in the evening. I asked him was that difficult, and he said: &quot;Difficult? It was like the Battle of Stalingrad.&quot; But everything suggests that he was an impeccable and adoring father.  The last time I saw Ballard, three or four years ago, was when my wife and I, together with Will Self and Deborah Orr, had dinner with him and his partner of 40 years, Claire Walsh. He revealed in the restaurant that he probably had &quot;about two years to live&quot;. This was said with instinctive courage, but with all the melancholy to be expected from a man who loved life so passionately.", "tags": ["JG Ballard", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Science fiction"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-24T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/26/jg-ballard-appreciation-claire-walsh", "sentences": ["The years that Ballard spent as a child in the Lunghua internment camp in Shanghai during the war, recalled in the book and film Empire of the Sun."], "title": "An appreciation of JG Ballard: 1930-2009", "article": "About a year before he died, last Sunday at the age of 78, JG Ballard finally moved in with his partner, Claire Walsh, and she looked after him in her flat above a boarded-up newsagent&apos;s near Shepherd&apos;s Bush Green in west London. They had thought of themselves as a couple, by then, for nearly 40 years. In his recent autobiography, Miracles of Life, written on a portable typewriter while he received treatment for prostate cancer, Ballard described Walsh as &quot;my inspiration and life companion&quot; and suggested that after all of their travels together &quot;there is scarcely a city, museum or beach in Europe that I don&apos;t associate with Claire&quot;.  On Thursday morning, I sat with Claire Walsh in her flat, surrounded by the flowers and cards of condolence, and, while the traffic went by outside, she talked about the man she had loved and the curious relationship that had sustained them both. Memories of Ballard, of course, tumbled over each other. Up until quite recently, in weeks when his appetite was buoyed by steroids, he would take her up the road to Kristof&apos;s, a regular haunt, and insist she had oysters while he had his favourite devilled kidneys, and they would make hopeless plans for the future. Ballard never lost a sense of adventure. &quot;We always had this fantasy when we drove back from the Brackenbury, another of our restaurants,&quot; Walsh says. &quot;It was: why don&apos;t we just keep driving, keep going west to Oxford and beyond. He never lost that sense of the excitement of open roads.&quot; Walsh thinks of Ballard as two distinct personalities: there was Jimmy, the man who sat on her sofa reading the papers, playing with her cats, and there was JG, the novelist, who would sometimes retreat into himself. &quot;Most of the time with Jimmy you weren&apos;t going all that deep, but he set aside times for JG, as it were. He stopped watching television a long time ago, he never listened to the radio, and he didn&apos;t like music. He liked quiet. In those moments if I asked him what was on his mind, he would just say: I am thinking about my life.&quot; The trajectory of that life - which informed one of the most singular literary imaginations of our time - has this week become once again familiar from the obituaries. The years that Ballard spent as a child in the Lunghua internment camp in Shanghai during the war, recalled in the book and film Empire of the Sun. The young married life with three children that was cut short by the sudden death of his wife, Mary, of pneumonia, while they holidayed in Spain. The tortured books that followed, The Atrocity Exhibition and Crash, obsessed with a consumer society&apos;s machine dreams and violent desires; and the subsequent extraordinarily productive years of writing, as the wayward prophet of Shepperton, that make-believe London suburb that Ballard made his own. In all of these tributes, Ballard&apos;s life with Claire Walsh has hardly figured, but it was the thing, you guess, that kept him close to sane, and that, along with his children and grandchildren, gave him purpose. They first met in 1969, five years after Ballard&apos;s wife had died, introduced by Ballard&apos;s closest friend, the writer Michael Moorcock. &quot;I knew it was a blind date,&quot; Walsh recalls, &quot;but Jimmy didn&apos;t.&quot; To begin with it was electricity. &quot;We were so excited by each other; for a long time in Shepperton, he didn&apos;t like it if I left the room even. After that, in those first years, it was always very up and down, volatile. And then it just happened that little by little we melded into a terrific contentment.&quot; They talked often of moving in together, of getting a place in central London, or perhaps in Antibes, where they spent several summers, but when it came to it Ballard could never leave his semi in Shepperton, which he had hardly altered since he bought it with his wife, and in which he had raised his children, &quot;trying to write while tying their shoelaces&quot;.  &quot;I would have loved to have settled down, of course,&quot; Walsh says now. She looks round her small living room, piled high with books and photographs. &quot;I have been here for more than 40 years. I came here first with a small child and a suitcase running away from my husband - I had my daughter when I was 17. We had one room then, and we didn&apos;t have a bath until Jenny was 14, just a tin tub we filled. I often thought it would be wonderful to live with Jimmy, but it did not happen for one reason or another.&quot;  The great thing about the alternative arrangement that developed, Walsh suggests - which involved speaking to Ballard every day on the phone, meeting up at weekends and for holidays - was that it was like being on a permanent date. &quot;He would drive up on a Friday and even after all these years I couldn&apos;t help waiting at the window, and going out to meet his car in the street. And whenever he went back to Shepperton, we would always part as if we were leaving each other for a very long time - and then he would be back again along the Westway the week after.&quot; Walsh was Ballard&apos;s researcher - navigating the internet for him, discovering with him some of the strange dystopias that inspired his fiction, Sophia Antipolis in France or the nascent Millennium Dome. She was also his muse. As Ballard admitted once, Catherine, the fantasy emerging from the car wrecks of Crash, was entirely based on an idea of Walsh. &quot;She was even originally called Claire in the book,&quot; Walsh recalls. &quot;And had I really been a cross between Mother Teresa and Marilyn Monroe, as the portrait suggested, I might have been keen for that to go ahead. But I persuaded him to change the name in the end. He would use other things, too. I almost drowned once going into the sea after a rock concert wearing a long dress and wellington boots. That cropped up.&quot; Walsh suggests that Ballard&apos;s fictionalised memoirs Empire of the Sun and The Kindness of Women acted very much as a form of self-therapy and helped him to come to terms with the traumas of his early life. &quot;He became calmer. He exorcised a lot of his past with those books.&quot; What he never lost, however, was his profound distrust of society and &quot;progress&quot;. When they first met, Walsh was politically engaged on the left. &quot;My contribution to the women&apos;s movement was to try to organise trade unions at publishing companies where I worked to get women better paid. I lost my job over that and was blacklisted.&quot; Among other things she now edits a magazine for merchant navy officers. &quot;I was always starry-eyed about the world becoming a better place,&quot; Walsh says. &quot;But Jimmy never shifted in his belief that it was essentially cruel.&quot;  One of the remarkable things about his last book, Miracles of Life, I suggest, was that he seemed to find a way around that. It was in parts an expression of simple joy.  &quot;This may sound a bit pretentious,&quot; Walsh says, smiling a bit, &quot;but I always thought of Miracles of Life as his Tempest. You know, he had broken his wand and he had forgiven the human race.&quot;  One of the most distressing aspects of Ballard&apos;s cancer was that it brought back some of his childhood fears from internment in Japan. For a six-week period he was in hospital, for the first time in his life. It was at times terrifyingly Ballardian. &quot;He had that strange sense in the hospital of it being a living organism, draining and feeding patients, the day staff going and the night staff arriving and all these machines winking and blinking. He was feverish and still trying to make sense of it,&quot; Walsh says, &quot;as he had always done. The best thing I did was get him back here to home.&quot; Even toward the end, in her flat, the novelist never stopped looking. He would be fascinated by the street outside, the comings and goings at the primary school opposite, and he would dwell on strange stories, like the spread of parakeets in west London. He would say to her, that if he had had his time again he might have liked to have been a painter rather than a writer.  Before I go, I wonder of all the memories, how she imagines she will picture him most often. Two things, she says. &quot;During the illness he developed a taste for very good vanilla ice cream, and we would sit in bed next to each other and eat the ice cream with mint tea and talk. It was lovely. But mostly I think I will think of us going away. I would always wait for him in the terminal at Heathrow. He liked me to be there first because he would worry. And seeing him arrive with his suitcase, always smiling, ready for anything, that was wonderful.&quot; She imagines the scene. &quot;Jimmy was very special in that way.&quot; The prophet of Shepperton: JG Ballard&apos;s wisdom &quot;I think the enemy of creativity in the world today is that so much thinking is done for you.&quot; &quot;Success, an even more demanding challenge than failure.&quot; &quot;People want to save the whale and the seal because they know that sooner or later the human being is probably going to be next on the list.&quot; &quot;My advice to anyone in any field is to be faithful to your obsessions. Identify them and be faithful to them, let them guide you like a sleepwalker.&quot; &quot;Sex times technology equals the future.&quot; &quot;The most prudent and effective method of dealing with the world around us is to assume that it is a complete fiction.&quot; &quot;You can do all the housework in five minutes if you don&apos;t make a fetish of it.&quot; &quot;Women have always been suppressed, and never given the chance to flourish intellectually. When the first female Darwin or Freud appears it will have an astonishingly liberating force, and could change the world in an almost religious way. Perhaps this is the messiah we&apos;re unconsciously waiting for.&quot; &quot;Two subjects have always fascinated me: women and the bizarre.&quot;", "tags": ["JG Ballard", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Science fiction"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-25T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/28/brawn-jenson-button-formula-one", "sentences": ["The second row was not the ideal starting place for a car that needed to be running in clear air as the ambient temperature reached 38C.&quot;After Shanghai, where I finished third, I wanted to get back on the top step of the podium again,&quot; said Button."], "title": "Brawn desperate to use break to bring car back up to speed", "article": "It was one thing for the Brawn team to turn up at the last minute for the start of the season in Australia on 29 March and quite another to finish a punishing five-week Asian tour on top of the championship.

The Brawn-Mercedes may have been untouchable in Melbourne but the ferocious pace of evolution in formula one means the opposition will be hot on their heels and, in the case of Red Bull, poised to overtake thanks to a fine win for Sebastian Vettel in China. &quot;We have had no upgrades for the first four races because there was nothing there,&quot; said Brawn. &quot;Getting to the first race was as much as we could manage and there was nothing in the cupboard. Australia was perhaps one we could only throw away, whereas Bahrain was one we had to win. &quot;My worry was the engine because in qualifying it was running too hot. Because it all got thrown together at the last minute, we had underestimated the water cooling. The conditions were so hot in Bahrain that it was compromising the car. During practice, the drivers could only do one fast lap and then they had to cool the car down. When Jenson qualified fourth and Rubens sixth, it wasn&apos;t looking good, to be honest.&quot; All 10 teams will be flat out between now and the Spanish grand prix on 10 May to improve their cars but if Brawn can provide Button with the right upgrades at the Circuit de Catalunya the odds on the 29-year-old becoming champion will dramatically shorten. &quot;I&apos;ve got no doubts about Jenson&apos;s ability to win,&quot; said Brawn. &quot;The way he is driving, that part is taken care of. It&apos;s up to us to produce the performance in the car, do the strategies, and make sure the car is reliable.&quot; Button also admitted that he had been worried about the car&apos;s ability to withstand the heat in Bahrain. The second row was not the ideal starting place for a car that needed to be running in clear air as the ambient temperature reached 38C.&quot;After Shanghai, where I finished third, I wanted to get back on the top step of the podium again,&quot; said Button. &quot;We thought we would have a good car in \u00adBahrain, but it didn&apos;t seem to be working out that way. We&apos;d lost some of our pace. We were worried about our temperatures to the point where I thought: &apos;If I&apos;m in \u00adtraffic in the race, we&apos;re screwed. We won&apos;t be able to run it at the pace we want, we&apos;re going to have to back off.&apos; &quot;Luckily, more people didn&apos;t get past me at the start when I had clutch slip. My main worry was Vettel but I managed to get past him at the first corner. I was chuffed to bits with that move. I had to conserve the engine in the last stint because it was getting very, very hot \u2013 and that was with no traffic in front. &quot;This win was very sweet because, after qualifying, we didn&apos;t expect it. Everybody seems to have caught up and Red Bull have actually overtaken us. The parts on the car are getting very old now (in racing terms). We need to get back to base and freshen everything up and hopefully make another step forward.&quot; McLaren, following Lewis Hamilton&apos;s encouraging fourth place on Sunday, can only hope they remain a part of it following the outcome of tomorrow&apos;s investigation into allegations over the team&apos;s dishonest conduct in Australia.

More often, my bric-a-brac of preference has been an unspecific, laid-back accumulation of sepia photographs and dog-eared magazines. The other day I happened upon an 80-year-old copy of The Cricketer. The spring annual of 1929 was a 127-page A4-size mag costing 2s 6d (just over 12p today) brimful with a stream of advertisements mostly extolling the warm pleasures of alcohol, tobacco and pleasure-cruising across the seven seas. Two separate full-page ads had the England team endorsing both &quot;Our&quot; Player&apos;s Navy Cut cigarettes a brand called Greys (a packet of 10 for sixpence in &quot;old&quot; money), &quot;which are Mild, not Strong nor Harsh, yet which Wholly Gratify&quot;. In 1929 you could sail return to New York for \u00a328 &quot;tourist class de luxe&quot; by White Star, \u00a338 by Cunard, or take a fortnight&apos;s cruise on the P&amp;O Viceroy of India, calling at Gib and Tangier, for just \u00a320. The hot-off-the-press 1929 Wisden would be mailed to you for free for 5s 6d; and a brand new Sykes &quot;Roy Kilner&quot; bat cost 26s 6d, a &quot;Maurice Leyland&quot; 30s and a pair of JB Hobbs &quot;mock buck&quot; pads 35s. That spring, the England side were freshly returned from their triumphant Ashes-retaining 1928-29 tour of Australia in which 25-year old Wally Hammond averaged 113 in the five Test matches (and 91 in 18 other first-class innings on the tour). With pride and fervour The Cricketer hailed Hammond as cricket&apos;s irresistible new emperor: &quot;Best in the world! Fortes vix ere ante Agamemnon goes the saying. There is no reason why our champion \u2013 for he must be dubbed such \u2013 should not carry on for another 20 years.&quot; Complacency? Hubris? Farther back, on page 88, hark the tucked-away &quot;Notes from Australia&quot; filed, anon, by &apos;A Local Third Man&apos;: &quot;To restore her fortunes, Australia must invest in young players of the right type. Some smiled when I named D Bradman in The Cricketer&apos;s last issue as a strong possibility for the 1st XI. Footwork, and plenty of it, is his basis. He knows the value of getting his feet near the bat when making strokes, and leaves the crease fearlessly to destroy length. He is aged 20 and shows no trace of nerves.&quot; And so, soon, it came to pass. Just a summer later, of course, Australia came to England. In the five Test matches, home &quot;champion&quot; Hammond scored 306 runs with a single century; the boy Bradman scored 974 with one century, two doubles, a world-record triple, and the world was never again the same. No Indian Premier Leagues then. No Stanford circus. No Dubai HQs. No Twenty20 slogathons. No Delhi Daredevils. In 1929, as England ruled the Empire, so English cricket ruled the world. Eighty years ago, with no flicker of a raised eyebrow, The Cricketer carried baronet-journo Sir Home Gordon&apos;s unshakeable precept: &quot;The universal respect in which MCC is held all over the world proves how perfectly its authorities conduct the direction of cricket. &quot;Cricket is the stalwart Goliath striding across the Empire, the MCC its devoted wife anxious only to further his best interests. Cricket and MCC will never be divorced.

Thirteen countries around the world have reported confirmed cases, including Denmark, which also announced its first case today. The Hong Kong government&apos;s chief executive, Donald Tsang, told reporters a Mexican citizen who had flown to the territory with a stopover in Shanghai had developed a fever after arriving yesterday. The patient has been isolated in a hospital and is in a stable condition. Tests by Hong Kong&apos;s department of health and the University of Hong Kong confirmed the diagnosis, Tsang added. Mexico has confirmed 156 cases and nine deaths, although authorities suspect the actual death toll is closer to 180. The US has 109 cases and one death, a 23-month-old boy from Mexico who died in Texas. There are confirmed cases in Canada, Spain, Britain, New Zealand, Germany, Israel, Austria, the Netherlands and Switzerland. However, the WHO figure of 331 confirmed cases, up from 257 yesterday, does not include all the most recent figures from various governments and disease control agencies. The US says it has 132 confirmed cases; Mexico says it has 300. The Mexican government has ordered most of the economy to be shut down and for people to stay indoors for five days. The nation of 111 million people will grind to a halt until 5 May in an effort to stifle the spread of swine flu, which is on the brink of becoming a global pandemic. &quot;There is no safer place than your own home to avoid being infected with the flu virus,&quot; Felipe Calder\u00f3n, Mexico&apos;s president, said in a television address. Transport, policing, supermarkets and hospitals will continue but otherwise the country will largely come to a standstill. It is already operating at half-strength since earlier this week when schools, cinemas, restaurants, gyms and other services were closed or access to them was heavily restricted. Celebrations for Dia del Nino, Day of the Child, have been cancelled today. The shutdown will be painful for Mexico&apos;s economy, which is already suffering from recession and a bloody drug war. Central bank analysts suggest the economy may have shrunk by as much as 8% in the first three months of the year, compared to the same period in 2008. Tourism, worth 8% of Mexico&apos;s GDP, has evaporated. Several countries in the region have cut or restricted flights to and from Mexico, and Canc\u00fan airport has been flooded by tourists trying to get out. The state of Quintana Roo, where Canc\u00fan is located, has yet to report cases of swine flu but several tourists were found to be infected after returning home. Archaeological sites have been shut.

The foreign ministry recommends avoiding travelling to China until these measures are corrected.&quot; Her remarks came as China suspended flights from Mexico due to the flu outbreak. The Chinese authorities, who have described their measures as &quot;justified and lawful&quot;, say they have isolated 113 passengers and 13 crew members who were on last Thursday&apos;s Mexico City to Shanghai flight, with a 25-year-old Mexican man now being treated for the virus. To date, his is the only known case in China. They have also traced passengers on his subsequent flight to Hong Kong. About 300 guests and staff were also being held in quarantine at a hotel in Hong Kong. According to the Xinhua news agency, the man developed flu symptoms shortly after checking into the Metropark hotel in Wanchai. It is not clear if officials had any specific reason to isolate the Mexican citizens arriving in China from the US and Canada. The Sars outbreak in 2002/3 and cases of avian flu have made Chinese officials particularly anxious about controlling the spread of swine flu. The sheer size of the population and the patchy health system also increase the risks of a serious outbreak. The Chinese foreign ministry did not comment directly on the quarantined Mexicans, but said that all relevant policies could be seen on government websites.

The foreign ministry recommends avoiding travelling to China until these measures are corrected.&quot; Hostility towards Mexicans spread to the United States where talkshows referred to &quot;fajita flu&quot; and &quot;infected illegal aliens&quot;, injecting fresh rancour into the immigration debate. Colombia and Chile denied the use of stadiums to two Mexican football teams for the Copa Libertadores de America, a regional tournament. A Mexican team that was allowed to play in Chile complained it was treated &quot;like lepers&quot;. One player, Hector Reynoso, responded to apparent taunts by coughing and blowing mucus at an opposing player and shouting: &quot;Now I have infected you with swine flu.&quot; He later apologised. Peru, Argentina, Cuba and Ecuador have restricted flights to Mexico, prompting complaints by Espinosa. &quot;We&apos;re surprised by the adoption of unjustified measures,&quot; the minister said. Health officials said Mexico&apos;s epidemic appeared to be ebbing after a national shutdown. The death toll remained at 19 and the number of confirmed cases increased slightly to 506, including the dead. &quot;The evolution of the epidemic is now in its declining phase,&quot; said Jose Angel Cordova, the health minister.

All but two had caught the infection in this country. Apart from one adult in the West Midlands, the other sufferers are all from London. The update brings the overall tally of confirmed cases in the UK to 27, with more than 1,000 people infected worldwide. The latest school to be shut down is Alleyn&apos;s, in Dulwich. A pupil at the fee-paying school who visited the US during the Easter holidays had already been diagnosed with swine flu. Now five more pupils, off sick on Friday, have been confirmed as having contracted the virus. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said the school would be closed for at least seven days. &quot;Those who are still unwell are receiving antiviral treatment and are recovering at home,&quot; a spokesman said. The school has arranged for all pupils and staff to be offered antiviral treatment tonight or tomorrow morning. A statement posted today on the school&apos;s website by the headmaster, Colin Diggory, said he was aware the closure would cause &quot;particular concern&quot; to students due to take exams this week. Some of the tests may be rescheduled. Alleyn&apos;s is the fourth UK school to be closed as a result of swine flu. Yesterday health officials announced that South Hampstead high school would be closed until Thursday on advice from the HPA. The infected pupil, a 14-year-old from \u00adBarnet, had come into contact with someone recently returned from Mexico. North of the border, the Scottish health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said that another &quot;probable&quot; swine flu case had emerged. A woman from Fife is thought to have contracted the H1N1 virus in Las Vegas before flying home on 30 April, and is now under voluntary quarantine and taking antiviral drugs. A close relative of the first Britons to catch the virus has been flown home from a North Sea oil rig as a precaution. The oil industry is distributing treatment kits, including antiviral drugs, to North Sea installations in case of an outbreak on a platform. In New York the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, insisted that the World Health Organisation did not plan to raise its pandemic alert to the highest level, six, if the current outbreak of a deadly new strain of flu continued at its present level. Addressing an informal session of the UN General Assembly, Ban said the World Health Organisation chief, Margaret Chan, had told him that &quot;if the situation remains as it is, WHO has no plan to raise the alert level to six at this moment&quot;. Chan, addressing the conference by videolink from Geneva, said the number of confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza reported to the WHO had risen to 1,003 from 20 countries. But she said there was &quot;no indication that we are facing a situation similar to that in 1918&quot;, when a flu pandemic killed tens of millions. Six is the highest level on the WHO&apos;s scale for the spread of a pandemic. Earlier the environment secretary, Hilary Benn, had said that swine flu appears to be &quot;relatively small and relatively mild&quot; and responds well to treatment. Urging the health authorities to remain vigilant, he remarked: &quot;It&apos;s best to play safe. We are still not absolutely sure what it is that we are dealing with.&quot; The biggest worry was that the H1N1 virus could mutate, Benn said, and that a second wave of infections in the autumn could be more severe. Alan Johnson, the health secretary, said the spread of the H1N1 virus had largely been contained in the UK, though this might only last until the autumn. &quot;Our evidence from all previous pandemics is that you get two phases,&quot; he said. &quot;You get a first wave that is often very mild and then you get a much more serious wave that comes along in the autumn and the winter.&quot; There are 331 people currently undergoing tests for the virus across the UK. The officially confirmed global death toll deaths remain low at 26. It includes include 25 in Mexico and one, a 21-month-old boy, in Texas. Hong Kong, criticised for delaying quarantine measures during the outbreak of Sars in 2003, has sealed the central Metropark hotel, quarantining 350 guests and employees, after a Mexican tourist fell ill. The 25-year-old man had arrived in the territory on Thursday afternoon after a stopover in Shanghai and was said to be in a stable condition yesterday. Staff inside hung pieces of cloth in lobby windows, covering the pieces of paper reporters had stuck to the glass outside urging those inside to call them. Thomas Tsang, controller of Hong Kong&apos;s centre for health protection, said all those at the hotel were healthy. A British couple, Eddie and Terry Sweeney, who are quarantined inside the building, had only planned to stay in Hong Kong for two nights on the return journey from a visit to see their daughter, Sharon, who is a teacher in New Zealand. The couple, who have been married for 38 years, are stuck in their room for most of the day although they are allowed downstairs to collect meals. &quot;It could be a test of the marriage,&quot; joked Mr Sweeney, 62, a retired Metropolitan Police officer from Hazlemere, Buckinghamshire. &quot;When you look out of the window and see the weather \u2013 which is fantastic \u2013 you think you should be on a beach.&quot;", "tags": ["Swine flu", "Health", "Society", "UK news", "Flu", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-04T09:22:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/may/04/scarlett-johansson-emmanuel-benbihy", "sentences": ["Benbihy has Shanghai, I Love You in the works and also \u2013 yikes \u2013 Jerusalem, I Love You, which promises to be a festival of well-intentioned tales on the Romeo and Juliet theme of love transcending religious boundaries, in the spirit of Israel&apos;s unhappy Eurovision entry There Has to Be Another Way by the Jewish/Palestinian duo Achinoam Nini and Mira Awad."], "title": "Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut is lost in production, says Peter Bradshaw", "article": "Cinephiles who cherish tales of lost directorial works - from Erich Von Stroheim&apos;s original Greed, to Jerry Lewis&apos;s The Day the Clown Cried - may have something new to chew on. The short film that was to have been the directorial debut of Scarlett Johansson has been unceremoniously dumped from the forthcoming portmanteau film New York, I Love You. It&apos;s a development that E! Entertainment Online has reported using the cruel headline: &quot;ScarJo \u2013 Oh Helm No!&quot; It isn&apos;t clear when or if Johansson&apos;s film will ever see the light of day, or indeed precisely what the problem was.  This was supposed to form part of a series of love stories set in New York by a range of different directors, including Fatih Akin and actor Natalie Portman. But producer Emmanuel Benbihy has said: &quot;The story did not specifically involve an interpersonal relationship, and it was conceptualised to be filmed in black-and-white \u2013 both of which were extreme departures from the other films. Scarlett presented me with an extremely compelling, albeit unconventional narrative that appeared as though it would not necessarily conform to the overall approach of the entire collective.&quot; Not necessarily, no. But if the film really is as pretentious and terrible as Benbihy makes it sound, then my hunch is that it would have &quot;conformed&quot; only too well to the kind of film he is going to produce. Because Benbihy is already the producer of the treacly cine-short-story collection Paris Je t&apos;Aime, from 2006, a mostly intolerable collection of coy, self-regarding doodles from people who ought to know better: a series of stories about love in or for Paris, like a chocolate boxy set of micro-Amelies.  And it looks as if it is going to turn into a vast international franchise. Benbihy has Shanghai, I Love You in the works and also \u2013 yikes \u2013 Jerusalem, I Love You, which promises to be a festival of well-intentioned tales on the Romeo and Juliet theme of love transcending religious boundaries, in the spirit of Israel&apos;s unhappy Eurovision entry There Has to Be Another Way by the Jewish/Palestinian duo Achinoam Nini and Mira Awad.  Johansson is well out of it, I reckon. If, as seems possible, she was encouraged down a self-indulgent path by her recent association with Woody Allen (himself the contributor to the 1989 portmanteau film New York Stories) then inscrutable fate could be exercising a little tough love by evicting Johansson from the most unappetising movie smorgasbord. But it could also be that her short film would have been far superior to everything \u2013 who knows? Either way, speaking as a Johansson fan, I am uneasy about hiccups in her career, and I&apos;m still slightly unhappy at the backlash that followed her excellent performance in that excellent film Lost in Translation \u2013 an indulgence, yes, but a very enjoyable one. Either way, I am waiting for her to be in another really brilliant film, like Lost in Translation or The Man Who Wasn&apos;t There. Or just a halfway decent one.

Its efforts to do so had been complicated because commercial flights between the two countries were suspended on Saturday. The diplomatic row over Beijing&apos;s \u00adhandling of the disease came as Mexico said it would allow the reopening of cafes and restaurants and the resumption of most economic activity from tomorrow. The decision came after a fall in the number of recorded new cases. However, the World Health Organisation said it was too early to say that the worst was over and voiced concern that the virus could spread into the southern hemisphere as winter set in. &quot;We&apos;re not quite certain how it will evolve,&quot; Dr Keiji Fukuda, the WHO&apos;s top flu expert, said. The head of the organisation, Margaret Chan, yesterday suggested that the pandemic alert would eventually move to level six \u2011 its highest level \u2011 which would mean a global pandemic was in full effect. &quot;Level six does not mean, in any way, that we are facing the end of the world,&quot; Chan told Spain&apos;s El Pa\u00eds newspaper. &quot;It is important to make this clear because [otherwise] when we announce level six it will cause unnecessary panic.&quot;", "tags": ["Swine flu", "China", "Mexico", "World news", "Travel", "Health", "Flu", "Life and style", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-05T07:01:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/may/05/swine-flu-travel-advice-update", "sentences": ["China has sent a plane to Mexico to collect Chinese nationals, while a plane chartered by the Mexican government arrived in Shanghai today to bring home more than 70 Mexicans who have been held in a hotel since last week despite not showing any symptoms of swine flu."], "title": "Update: swine flu travel advice", "article": "Latest statistics Since The World Health Organisation raised its swine flu pandemic alert to level five on 29 April, the outbreak has affected 41 countries. According to the latest figures from the WHO, 21 countries have officially reported 1,124 cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection. The worst affected are; \u2022 Mexico: 101 estimated deaths (25 confirmed), 590 confirmed cases. \u2022 US: 2 deaths, 279 confirmed cases. \u2022 Canada: 140 confirmed cases. \u2022 Spain: 57 confirmed cases. \u2022 UK: 32 confirmed cases.  \u2022 Germany: 9 confirmed cases. \u2022 New Zealand: 6 confirmed cases. Is it safe to travel? Despite the European Union&apos;s health commissioner Androulla Vassiliou&apos;s comments on 27 April urging people to avoid travelling to Mexico or the US as the first suspected cases of swine flu were reported in Europe, the WHO has not changed its advice with regard to international travel: &quot;WHO does not recommend restricting international travel.&quot; In a statement on 1 May, the WHO said: &quot;Limiting travel and imposing travel restrictions would have very little effect on stopping the virus from spreading, but would be highly disruptive to the global community.&quot; &quot;Regarding the risk of being infected by an influenza virus, travellers are advised, whenever possible, to avoid crowded enclosed spaces and close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. Hand-washing after direct contact with ill persons or their environment may reduce the risk of illness. Ill persons should be encouraged to practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, wash hands).&quot; Despite this, France called for an EU flights ban on 30 April after the first swine flu death outside Mexico. Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) changed its advisory at 11pm on 27 April advising against all but essential travel to Mexico.  In response to this, Thomson and First Choice Holidays cancelled all holidays to Canc\u00fan and Cozumel on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula until 8 May, as did Thomas Cook. Thomson and First Choice put on an extra flight last Thursday to collect 200 holidaymakers who chose to cut short their holidays in the beach resorts. They have now extended the cancellation of holidays to Mexico until 18 May while Thomas Cook has cancelled holidays to Canc\u00fan uuntil 22 May. British Airways is still operating four flights a week to Mexico City, but is offering its customers the option of making amendments (a change of dates or an alternative destination up to the same value) without incurring an administration fee on bookings while the FCO advisory against travel to Mexico remains. Worst hit countries MexicoOn 1 May, Mexico began an unprecedented nationwide shutdown in a bid to contain the spread of the virus and Mexicans were told to stay at home for five days. Today, President Felipe Calderon announced a return to &quot;normalcy&quot;, with people going back to work tomorrow, cafes and restaurants reopening, and universities and schools opening their doors on Thursday. USCases grew to at least 279 in 36 states, and on Tuesday 28 April, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced a widespread state of emergency in response to the H1N1 &quot;swine flu&quot; outbreak. His official proclamation mentions &quot;conditions of extreme peril to the safety of person and property&quot;. However, California has ostensibly been going about its business as usual. Latest events in Asia Asia is reacting vigorously to the new global threat, following the outbreak of SARS in 2003, which killed 800 people.  ChinaChina suspended flights from Mexico on 2 May; the day after the first confirmed case of swine flu in Asia was found in Hong Kong. At the Metropark Hotel, where the infected Mexican was staying, 274 guests and 100 workers have been quarantined and confined to the premises for a week. The city has been put on its highest health alert. The American Embassy in Beijing says four US citizens are now or have been quarantined in China due to swine flu fears. China has sent a plane to Mexico to collect Chinese nationals, while a plane chartered by the Mexican government arrived in Shanghai today to bring home more than 70 Mexicans who have been held in a hotel since last week despite not showing any symptoms of swine flu. JapanJapan has no confirmed cases of swine flu, but has opened fever clinics across the country. Planes arriving from North America are being boarded by health inspectors in surgical gowns, goggles and masks, and armed with thermographic guns. Passengers are not allowed to leave the plane until they have filled in a government Health Status questionnaire, and flight attendants are handing out masks. ThailandA health department team has been stationed along the Malaysia-Thailand border to screen travellers entering the country through Pengkalan Hulu.  And finally... In Egypt, even before there is a single suspected case of the H1N1 virus in the country, either among humans or pigs, President Mubarak ordered 300,000-400,000 pigs to be killed.

But I did experience a twinge of sympathy this week when agent-to-the-stars Andrew Chandler announced that the England cricketers in his care might be better off without central contracts. These are, after all, the same contracts that allow Michael Vaughan, one of Chandler&apos;s clients, to claim a six-figure salary from a team that he hasn&apos;t played a Test match for in 10 months. Central contracts were the ECB&apos;s most radical move in a decade, introduced for the express benefit of elite players and their international careers. Now we&apos;re told by Chandler that his players \u2013 big earners like Flintoff and Harmison \u2013 will be better off as free agents, because England contracts might restrict the earnings they can make from other, non\u2011international tournaments, such as the IPL. In future, he says, his clients could be more selective about the England series they are available for so as not to miss out on the goodies on offer elsewhere. There are no details on how this pick&apos;n&apos;mix would work, perhaps like this: &quot;I can do you an Ashes series and a tour to India, and I&apos;ll throw in a Twenty20 in Barbados for free \u2026 &quot; So playing for your country is not the &quot;ultimate honour&quot; it once was. It is now only a part of a sportsman&apos;s career portfolio, and often the least financially rewarding one. Today patriotism is more of a marketing tool than a motivator. After all, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button might be honoured to be part of a great tradition of British racing drivers, but neither of them is quite proud enough of his country to live here. For those with talent, international boundaries can dissolve pretty quickly, whether you&apos;re an All Black with a Scottish grandmother, or a Kenyan with a big family to feed and a Qatari sheikh making eyes at you over the Special K. No case has spoken more clearly than Kevin Pietersen&apos;s \u2013 a man who, lest we forget, said of his place of birth: &quot;I love [South Africa] \u2026 The exchange rate is magnificent.&quot; KP&apos;s reasons for coming to England might have seemed dubious, but the moment he scored an Ashes century he was ours. As long as you can entertain the crowd and beat the Aussies, it really doesn&apos;t matter whether you know the words to the national anthem or can name the regulars in the Rovers Return. That&apos;s probably as it should be. In these days of the &quot;global village&quot;, we&apos;re happy to claim Madonna \u2013 an Italian-American with a Malawian child \u2013 as an honorary Brit. We can hardly, then, be mealy-mouthed about sportspeople looking to make the most of their time-limited physical powers. I&apos;ve tried to get upset about the idea of Manuel Almunia playing for England, but my heart&apos;s just not in it. I have this endearing image of him as a lonely kid roaming the streets with his ball, looking for someone to play with. Globalisation has shrunk the world so suddenly that the whole ideology behind international competition has been caught short. Even the concept that we are pitting the best against the very best is debatable. Can a disparate bunch of guys thrown together for a few days before a friendly ever be as good as a well-drilled and highly rewarded club team, drawn from the deepest talent pools on earth? Answer: watch the Champions League or Heineken Cup. Sportsmen nowadays like to think of themselves as citizens of the world, especially those of them with tax addresses in Dubai. When your name is a multinational brand, why should you confine yourself to belonging to only one country? In his campaign to woo China last year, Michael Phelps stopped just short of donning red trunks and propositioning Hu Jintao in the middle of Tiananmen Square. Presumably the swimmer is even now ransacking the family tree for a distant relative from Shanghai to earn him a dual passport. So maybe it&apos;s time to treat these athletes as the global properties they are, and find them a more meaningful form of representative competition. Apparently Barack Obama is looking for a new space programme for Nasa, now that everyone seems agreed that Mars is never going to live up to its chocolate namesake. How about an interstellar probe to find new worlds we can play sport against? Admittedly it&apos;s an expensive business. But if any industry can afford to spend money on intergalactic missions it&apos;s our one. Since Fifa can commit \u00a399m to new offices, and the ICC can pay millions to a Zimbabwe cricket regime that isn&apos;t actually allowed to participate in tournaments, they must have plenty left in their coffers for important stuff like this. And if the probe does find us a set of opponents for Team Earth, I&apos;m sure Britain would be happy to host the visitors.

He immediately wrote to his friend to re-congratulate him on a work of steely fury: &quot;What power, what incisiveness and what passion drove you to work in those days. That was a time when you were never worried by academic scholarly reservations! Those were the days when you made the reader feel that your theories would become hard facts if not tomorrow then at any rate on the day after.&quot;  Today, the power, incisiveness and passion of Engels&apos;s polemic remain undiminished. Far more so than Charles Dickens&apos;s Hard Times, Benjamin Disraeli&apos;s Sybil, or Thomas Carlyle&apos;s Past and Present, Engels&apos;s The Condition of the Working Class is the defining text of the British industrial experience.  And, 150 years on, it speaks to our age with painful prescience - not only in its critique of the instability of the free market and the structural inequalities of British society, but in its unrivalled depiction of the inhumanity of capitalism. With Brazil, Russia, India and China experiencing just the kind of breakneck economic growth that transformed British society in the 1800s - villages turning into cities, peasants swapping fields for factories, and mass exploitation grinding out higher GDP - Engels&apos;s polemic resonates with terrifying force.  The young Engels had in fact been sent to Manchester in 1842 precisely to rid him of radical sentiments. His father, a conservative textile manufacturer from the Rhineland, had been increasingly concerned about the circle of Young Hegelians Engels had been associating with in Berlin. Instead of dutifully performing his military service, he had succumbed to the beer rooms and lecture halls of Berlin University where the philosophies of Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach and David Strauss were debated with boozy gusto. All of which led him to abandon his Protestant faith for Feuerbach&apos;s religion of humanity, before then falling in with the &quot;communist rabbi&quot; Moses Hess who taught him that modern capitalism was just as dehumanising a force as Christianity. The solution, Hess suggested, was socialism: the abolition of private property and an end to the alienating effects of the money economy. And in the march toward socialism, England - where the industrial revolution had left a deep chasm between rich and poor and where the proletariat was most advanced - would provide the social kindling of revolution. Engels looked to use his two years in the north-west to marshal the material evidence he needed for his emergent communism.  From 1842-44, he worked during the day at the Ermen &amp; Engels mill in Salford, before plunging after hours into the Manchester underworld. &quot;I forsook the company and the dinner-parties, the port-wine and champagne of the middle classes, and devoted my leisure-hours almost exclusively to intercourse with plain working men,&quot; he explained. He visited Owenite Halls of Science, spent time with Chartists, watched a brickmakers&apos; riot, and with his Irish lover Mary Burns sought out the human detritus of capitalist society.  He found it on the south side of the city, just off Oxford Road, where some of Manchester&apos;s 40,000 Irish immigrants huddled. Burns&apos;s confreres were the most exploited, lowly paid and abused of all the city&apos;s residents: &quot;The race that lives in these ruinous cottages, behind broken windows, mended with oilskin, sprung doors, and rotten door-posts, or in dark, wet cellars, in measureless filth and stench, in this atmosphere penned in as if with a purpose, this race must really have reached the lowest stage of humanity.&quot; Engels was relentless in charting the &quot;social war&quot; waged by the middle class on the operatives of the industrial city. Workplaces - mills, mines, factories, farms - resembled crime scenes. &quot;Women made unfit for childbearing, children deformed, men enfeebled, limbs crushed, whole generations wrecked, afflicted with disease and infirmity, purely to fill the purses of the bourgeoisie.&quot;  He was inflamed by the Manchester middle classes. &quot;I once went into Manchester with a bourgeois, and spoke to him of ... the frightful condition of the working people&apos;s quarters, and asserted that I had never seen so ill-built a city. The man listened quietly to the end, and said at the corner where we parted: &apos;And yet there is a great deal of money made here; good morning, sir.&apos;&quot; Behind Manchester&apos;s &quot;planless, knotted chaos of houses&quot; there was a brutal logic to the urban form: &quot;Cottonopolis&quot; was zoned along class lines to ensure that the rich never caught sight of what they had done to the poor. Manchester&apos;s &quot;money aristocracy&quot; lived in the &quot;breezy heights&quot; of Cheetham Hill and Broughton and travelled along Deansgate into town &quot;without ever seeing that they are in the midst of the grimy misery that lurks to the right and the left.&quot; Engels understood that the city&apos;s spatial dynamics - its streets, houses, factories, and warehouses - were expressions of social and political power. The struggle between bourgeois and proletariat was tangible in street design, transport system and planning process. Engels wrote Condition of the Working Class back home in Barmen, under the stern glare of his parents; it was first published in Leipzig in 1845. As such it formed part of a broader continental literature detailing the effects of advanced industrial growth on social conditions. Engels aimed the work at the Prussian bourgeoisie in the hope that such a stark depiction would lead them to choose socialism rather than Manchester&apos;s free-market fundamentalism. The book&apos;s initial reception was lukewarm with a few grudging reviews in the bourgeois press. It took another 40 years for an English language translation to appear, first of all in the US in 1886 and then, in 1892, in England with Engels hoping the book might save British socialism from what he considered its misdirection by William Morris and the Fabians. Yet in contrast to many of Engels&apos;s other works - notably, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific - its immediate influence was limited. Yet the book now takes on a dimension beyond its obvious historical importance as a work of Victorian reportage and insight into the genesis of Marxism. In one of the largest mass migrations in history, some 120 million Chinese peasants have, since 1980, made their way from the country to the city, and to read accounts of contemporary urban China is to be thrown straight back into the cityscape of Engels. Cancer rates soar along polluted waterways; rivers turn black with industrial effluent; water is unsafe to drink; acid rain strips forests; some 300,000 die prematurely each year from air pollution; a generation of children is being brought up with high levels of lead poisoning. As China assumes the mantel of &quot;workshop of the world&quot;, the special economic zones of Guangdong and Shanghai appear eerily reminiscent of 1840s Manchester and Glasgow. Compare and contrast, as the scholar Ching Kwan Lee has done, Engels&apos;s account of employment conditions in 1840s Manchester - &quot;In the cotton and flax spinning mills there are many rooms in which the air is filled with fluff and dust ... The usual consequences of inhaling factory dust are the spitting of blood, heavy, noisy breathing, pains in the chest, coughing and sleeplessness ... Accidents occur to operatives who work in rooms crammed full of machinery&quot; - with an account of working life by a Chinese migrant worker in Shenzhen in 2000: &quot;There is no fixed work schedule. A 12-hour workday is minimum. Our legs are always hurting. There is no place to sit on the shop floor. The machines do not stop during our lunch breaks. Three workers in a group will just take turns eating, one at a time ... The shop floor is filled with thick dust. Our bodies become black working day and night indoors. When I get off from work and spit, it&apos;s all black.&quot; In discussions of the modern city the voice of Engels resounds equally powerfully. Perhaps his most faithful acolyte today is Mike Davis, whose 2006 book, Planet of Slums, constitutes a searing update of The Condition. Davis recounts with equal vituperation the sanitary state of the modern mass conurbations (&quot;Today&apos;s poor megacities - Nairobi, Lagos, Bombay, Dhaka and so on - are stinking mountains of shit that would appal even the most hardened Victorians&quot;), and points to the power relationships underpinning spatial inequality. A chapter entitled &quot;Haussmann in the Tropics&quot;, investigating squatter and working-class clearances in contemporary Africa, China and central America, is pure Engels. &quot;Urban segregation is not a frozen status quo, but rather a ceaseless social war in which the state intervenes regularly in the name of &apos;progress&apos;, &apos;beautification&apos;, and even &apos;social justice for the poor&apos; to redraw spatial boundaries to the advantage of landowners, foreign investors, elite homeowners, and middle-class commuters.&quot; In the sprawling, slum and suburb conurbations of India, the main axis of social separation has reverted from race back to class as economic inequality now defines the nature of urban exclusion from Chenai to Mumbai. Behind this process of economic segregation, in Davis&apos;s template, are the forces of modern international capitalism - the IMF and World Bank - determined to carve out islands of &quot;cyber-modernity&quot; amid unmet urban needs and underdevelopment.  Similarly, in the developed world, much of Engels&apos;s analysis of the urban form reads as a telling critique of the gentrification programmes which entail the demolition of working-class neighbourhoods and curtailing the informal space of the city. Of course, the language has changed: policy-makers talk now of &quot;sink estates&quot; rather than &quot;slums&quot;, of &quot;worklessness&quot; rather than &quot;the residuum&quot; and in Britain the forces of progress come in the guise of &quot;New Deal for Communities&quot; or &quot;Housing Market Renewal Funds&quot;. Even Engels&apos;s adopted city has not been unaffected. While Manchester&apos;s revitalised city-centre glistens, Moss Side and Garton have somehow failed to prosper.  The Condition of the Working Class in England is far more than the work of an angry young man confronting the iniquities of industrial capitalism. It is a brilliant polemic by a sensationally gifted 24-year-old applying German philosophy to existing conditions with a sure eye on the revolution to come. As the experiment of 20th-century state communism recedes into memory, like Marx we can at last return to The Condition of the Working Class and appreciate the work on its own terms. To do so is to discover in its economic critique of unfettered markets, condemnation of capitalism&apos;s social injustices, angry reportage, and analysis of politics, poverty, feminism and urbanism all the power, passion and incisiveness which Marx rightly heralded. \u2022 Tristram Hunt introduces The Condition of the Working Class in a new Penguin Classics edition.", "tags": ["Politics", "Philosophy", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-08T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/10/classical-review-don-carlos-igorfest", "sentences": ["A savvy education programme extends from Bridlington to Shanghai."], "title": "Classical review: Don Carlos/Paradise Moscow and IgorFest/CBSO", "article": "Don Carlos/Paradise Moscow  Grand Theater, LeadsIgorFest/CBSO Symphony Hall, Birmingham Less than a month before curtain-up on a new Cos\u00ec fan tutte, English National Opera lost its Iranian director, film-maker Abbas Kiarostami, who withdrew last week after visa wrangles. A blow, but a calculated decision since his Cos\u00ec was first seen in Aix last year and, with the essentials in place, associate director Elaine Tyler-Hall will take over. ENO, together with all our musical institutions, now has a doubly bleak landscape to negotiate: as well as endemic financial drought, there&apos;s Border Agency red tape to cut through. If Kiarostami&apos;s high-profile exit puts this escalating problem to the top of the diplomatic agenda, we can thank him. Visa botch-ups are not a reason to turn xenophobic when it comes to choosing directors, but Opera North, announcing its forthcoming season, must be counting its blessings. Its five new productions have British directors. The repertoire mix, alert to box-office peril yet not cowed by it, includes the rare (Jan\u00e1cek&apos;s The Adventures of Mr Broucek), the novel (the premiere of Jonathan Dove&apos;s Swanhunter) and the popular (Gilbert and Sullivan&apos;s Ruddigore). As this line-up shows, Opera North has flair. This is not intended comparatively. All our regional companies have qualities. Yet a recent teenage crush on musicals notwithstanding, the Leeds-based outfit seems to play to its strengths. The renovated Grand Theatre, a triumph of Victorian opulence, is an ideal size, now with the bonus of the Howard Assembly Room, a studio space under the same roof. The in-house orchestra regularly plays concerts out of the pit, which keeps musical discipline tight. A savvy education programme extends from Bridlington to Shanghai.  The company&apos;s leadership under Richard Mantle is clear and assured, its musical director (Richard Farnes) inspired. It nurtures and attracts top artists and has a sensible policy on singing in English: yes, when it sees fit, as with the current revival of Verdi&apos;s Don Carlos in Tim Albery&apos;s 1993 production, delivered in Andrew Porter&apos;s fluent, audible translation. I&apos;d expected to regret the loss of the Italian original (there is also a five-act French version), now lazily assuming surtitles are always the answer. Wrong and wrong again. The work came alive as never before, its passionate exchanges between king, son, stepmother and loyal friend all the more incandescent, an endorsement for the Peter Moores Foundation &quot;Opera in English&quot; series on Chandos, who will record this Don Carlos for future release. Any staging of Verdi&apos;s dark, magnificent and convoluted score is an event. Albery&apos;s staging juxtaposes ancient and modern to potent effect, with Nicky Gillibrand&apos;s black-velvet period costumes and Hildegard Bechtler&apos;s abstract sets still looking imposing. It has its lumbering moments, and the gaps between acts are long enough to make you wish you&apos;d brought a book. The auto-da-fe scene gets lost in confusing butchery, but the arrival of Clive Bayley as the Grand Inquisitor restores the mood of Counter-Reformation terror. Since this production was new, Schiller&apos;s play on which the opera is based has been brilliantly rehabilitated by Michael Grandage&apos;s staging, first in Sheffield, then in the West End. No one who saw it will forget Derek Jacobi&apos;s nervily intransigent King Philip II. In Leeds, Brindley Sherratt captured the king&apos;s lonely, depressive side with compassion, though his tenderly rugged bass timbre suits introspection better than tyranny. Julian Gavin, invincible in steely top notes, coped well with the cussed character of Don Carlos, in love with his stepmother Elisabeth, the classy Janice Watson. A lyrical, sympathetic William Dazeley shone as Posa. Richard Farnes paced this long work beautifully and orchestral solos, for cello especially, were well executed. The previous night, Shostakovich&apos;s musical satire Paradise Moscow, a revival of David Pountney&apos;s 2001 production, overstayed its welcome. This 1957 period-piece operetta takes a skittish look at Khrushchev&apos;s plans for a high-rise Soviet Utopia in which everyone has their own bathroom and doorbell. Unfortunately, this was the full kitchen-sink version plus gadgetry, including a ballet for food mixer, which fatally weakened an already fragile enterprise, best kept short. The cast split into those who could sing - the evergreen little&apos;n&apos;large pair Richard Suart and Richard Angas - and those who could dance: Summer Strallen and Eaton James. Robert Innes Hopkins&apos;s 1950s designs look bright and energetic moments raised a weak smile but the audience remained bemused. The same year Shostakovich embraced feather-duster comedy, Stravinsky - crazily mixed up when it came to religion - was leafing through the Bible. Wednesday&apos;s penultimate concert in the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra&apos;s marathon IgorFest was devoted to rarely heard biblical settings, conducted by Sakari Oramo with fine soloists including baritone Roderick Williams and Samuel West as narrator. These strange, unsettling pieces, hieratic, spiky and raw, show Stravinsky at his most arresting. Threni (1958), a choral setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, makes joy out of sparse ritual.

Ballard proposes a futuristic business park built in the hills above Cannes, a rational technopolis which, far from having &quot;designed out&quot; crime, has secretly designed in rage, anarchy and despair. There are some tart remarks about the festival, and the new Palais building \u2013 opened in 1983, in fact \u2013 and their faintly sinister aspect, gesturing at the unexamined neurotic dimension of cinema. Ballard&apos;s book offered cinephiles and francophiles a new, uncliched way of looking at the rackety side of Cannes, the endlessly rehearsed serious/trashy paradox and the seamy side of the business. (See the Grant and Scriven books below.) 4. Sadi Grant, Folly at Cannes: A Novel (1902) I discovered this cheerfully trashy and utterly forgotten little potboiler in the Humanities I section of the British Library. It celebrates &quot;naughty&quot; Cannes as a playground for Britain&apos;s smart and wealthy sophisticates \u2013 a 20th-century reputation which probably went some way to making it an appropriate place to site an international film festival. A rector&apos;s daughter is taken to Cannes where she has adventures: the opening of Daphne du Maurier&apos;s Rebecca was to play on similar themes in Monte Carlo. (Its heir is Wendy Holden&apos;s outrageously named chick-lit romp Azur Like It: Cannes Life Be This Nice? (2003), which crams three puns into one title.) 5. Marcus Scriven, Splendour and Squalor (2009) Journalist and travel writer Marcus Scriven&apos;s forthcoming book on the decline of the British blue blood gives some lively accounts of the aristocrats who loved Cannes, which was effectively &quot;discovered&quot; as a playground for the wealthy classes by Lord Brougham in 1834. Edward Fitzgerald, seventh Duke of Leinster, was in Cannes after the war, with the third of his four wives, where he met the Duchess of Windsor, and experienced what was described as her &quot;Shanghai grip&quot;. Victor Hervey, sixth Marquess of Bristol, made a fortune selling arms to both sides in the Spanish civil war, deals negotiated in a Cannes bar. The dissolute 10th Earl of Shaftesbury, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, was murdered by his wife&apos;s lover in his apartment overlooking the Cannes bay in 2004.  6. Kieron Corless and Chris Darke, Cannes: Inside the World&apos;s Premier Film Festival (2007) Arguably the best and most serious recent history of Cannes. Corless and Darke&apos;s tremendous book is far more than just self-indulgence: they use their history to make a case for the rehabilitation of auteur film-makers once celebrated at Cannes, but now neglected, such as Turkey&apos;s Yilmaz G\u00fcney and the Philippines&apos; Lino Brocka. (However, I can&apos;t agree with their contention that giving the 2004 Palme d&apos;Or to Michael Moore&apos;s Fahrenheit 9/11 was just liberal posturing. The Iraq war was our generation&apos;s Vietnam, and at a time when anti-war protest in the cinema was conspicuous only by its absence, Moore boldly and brashly made a case which has now become the received wisdom among precisely those media classes who once pooh-poohed him.) Corless and Darke&apos;s bibliography is far more systematic and scholarly than this list \u2013 it includes two books I haven&apos;t been able to get my hands on: S\u00e9verine Caneele&apos;s Aux Marches Du Palais, her account of winning the best actress prize in Cannes in 1999 for Bruno Dumont&apos;s L&apos;Humanit\u00e9, and Emmanuel Ethis&apos;s intriguing-sounding Aux Marches Du Palais: Le Festival De Cannes Sous Le Regard Des Sciences Sociales.  7. Roger Ebert, Two Weeks in the Midday Sun: A Cannes Notebook (1988) The great Roger Ebert is not a great Cannes presence these days, but here is an amiable, conversational memoir of what appears to have been a very agreeable sojourn in the south of France. Engagingly, it includes Ebert&apos;s own line drawings.  8. Iain Johnstone, Cannes: The Novel (1991) The Cannes film festival novel is a weird, minor but distinct genre. Critic and author Iain Johnstone wrote what at the time was a tongue-in-cheek futurist nightmare, imagining the festival in 1997, as Hong Kong is about to be handed back to China \u2013 with triad terrorists holding the event to ransom. There is also Sara Voorhees&apos;s The Lumiere Affair: A Novel of Cannes (2007), Robert S Hopkins&apos;s Riviera: A Novel About the Cannes Film Festival (2008). 9. Wes Herschensohn, Resurrection in Cannes: The Making of The Picasso Summer (1979) Herschensohn worked on the now very dimly remembered Albert Finney movie The Picasso Summer, and here is his very long, voluble, excitable history of how he personally journeyed to the south of France, on a mission to meet Picasso himself and enlist his help in inducing Warner Brothers to make the film. A curiosity \u2013 the readability factor is low. 10. William Goldman, Hype and Glory (1990) The renowned Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman gives his account of being the only person to have judged the Cannes film festival and the Miss America pageant in the same year (1988), a bizarre appraisal combo he accepted as a distraction from the heartbreak of divorce. It is rather padded out with irrelevant autobiographical flashbacks, but there are startling touches: Goldman claims to have literally screamed with delight in the final moments of the eventual Palme d&apos;Or winner, Bille August&apos;s Pelle the Conqueror. There are interesting insights on what it is like to serve on an international jury: the lingua franca for their deliberations is French; each English-speaking juror has a translator whispering into his or her ear; the system works in reverse for French jurors while English is being spoken and jurors who speak a language other than French or English have to provide their own translator, whose announcements are then translated.

China, the country that has based its development strategy on becoming the low-cost workshop for the world, was feeling the impact of an implosion in global trade caused by the financial crisis. Across Asia, empty container ships lay idly at anchor as consumer demand collapsed and stocks of manufactured products were run down. China had always expected \u2013 indeed, had planned \u2013 a slowdown in its economy once the 2008 Beijing Olympics finished, but it was not ready for the global collapse that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers last September. Suggestions that China might be able to decouple itself from the problems that originated in the US housing market proved fanciful. Having caught the flood tide of globalisation for a decade and a half, the world&apos;s most populous country was inevitably affected as the tide went out. Yet everything is relative. Beijing expects China&apos;s economy to expand by 8% this year \u2013 down on the explosive double-digit pace since the turn of the millennium, but a growth rate to die for if you are Gordon Brown, Barack Obama or Angela Merkel. Already there are signs that the government&apos;s fiscal boost \u2013 worth 16% of gross domestic product over two years \u2013 is having an impact. A country that for three decades has been a curious mix of Karl Marx and Adam Smith has now turned to John Maynard Keynes to speed its way out of the global downturn. &quot;Because of China&apos;s structure, the government has direct levers to spend money quickly,&quot; said Prof Peter Williamson, of the Judge Institute of Management in Cambridge. &quot;Whereas in Britain it can take years to get an infrastructure project going, in China things can happen immediately.&quot; Much of the stimulus package is planned investment that has been fast-tracked rather than new money, but Gerard Lyons, the chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, says it will make a difference. &quot;The reality is that Beijing has announced a lot of new measures and they have started to push these measures through. They have pulled out all the stops.&quot; Political structure The real issue for China, however, is not whether the state can push the growth rate back above 10% next year; the consensus among economists is that it certainly can. Periods of rapid growth are by no means exceptional in Asia: Taiwan grew at 9.4% a year for more than a quarter of a century after 1962; Singapore expanded at much the same pace between 1967 and 1993; Japan&apos;s purple patch was the period between 1960 and 1973, when its average growth rate was 10%-plus. But China faces three sets of challenges that will shape the way it \u2013 and the global economy \u2013 evolves over the next half century. At the root of everything lies the question of whether the country&apos;s political structure is conducive to sustained growth. In the west, the classic pattern of development has been for economic change to stimulate demands for political reform and greater democracy. Despite the arrival of designer labels to the glitzy shopping malls of Shanghai, China remains a one-party state and there is little evidence that the ruling Communist party has any intention of loosening its grip. Anxiety that rapidly rising unemployment, particularly among disaffected graduates, might put millions on the streets this summer demanding change, helps explain both the scale and the speed of China&apos;s economic stimulus. Memories of Tiananmen Square are still vivid for the policy elite in Beijing. But some economists believe the fear of political change will hold China back. Prof Andrew Tylecote, of Sheffield University, believes the top-down fiscal package exacerbated the fundamental weakness of the economy \u2013 its lack of a thriving private sector. &quot;You tell state-owned banks to lend more money and they will do so. You tell state-owned enterprises to take on more staff and borrow more money and they will do so. If you throw money at anything remotely shovel-ready in terms of infrastructure, you will have an impact. &quot;But what they are not doing is beefing up the private sector. The dynamism ought to be coming from the private sector, which has been hammered by the crisis yet is not being looked after by the stimulus or by the boosting of credit. The stimulus is going to produce a more top heavy, muscle-bound economy full of rather expensive, poorly-utilised equipment.&quot; China, though, is the country that pioneered paper, the compass, steel, the wheelbarrow, gunpowder, canals and a host of other innovations while western Europe was still struggling to emerge from the Dark Ages.  New challenges In more recent years, Chinese expats have taken their entrepreneurial skills around the world, and in the domestic market Chinese companies are about to overhaul western multinationals in patent filing for the first time. &quot;There is a lot of innovation,&quot; says Williamson. &quot;The really interesting companies are hybrids, which are 30% state owned and which get the best of both worlds \u2013 autonomy but support from the state. The idea that there is a Soviet Russia-style state sector is completely incorrect.&quot; Every bit of that innovation will be needed as China grapples with its next set of challenges, all of which \u2013 according to Lyons \u2013 relate to significant imbalances. These are the gap between living standards in the cities and in the countryside; the comparison between the wealth of the coastal strip and the poverty of the inland regions; the mismatch between the country&apos;s projected growth rate and its energy needs; the rudimentary social safety net which encourages the population to save rather than spend; and the way that lack of domestic consumption exacerbates tensions in the global economy between those countries that export too much and those that export too little. None of these challenges will be solved quickly or easily. China&apos;s energy needs are enormous, and it has started to channel part of its export earnings into sovereign wealth funds, which are now taking advantage of the global recession to buy up assets at knockdown prices. &quot;Cash-rich Chinese concerns are taking advantage of depressed asset prices and debt deleveraging in the resources sector to lock in future energy and resources needed for continued growth&quot;, said Jan Randolph, of IHS Global Insight. Recent coups have been &quot;loan-for-oil&quot; deals with Russia, Brazil and Kazakhstan; in Africa, China has helped build roads, railways and ports to secure access to the raw materials it needs to sustain its high growth rate. These needs are \u2013 and will remain \u2013 substantial. China is undergoing the most rapid urbanisation the world has ever seen and has 221 cities with a population of more than 1 million. To put that in perspective, Europe has 35. The gap in living standards between those living in the cities and the rural population is large and growing: China&apos;s development has been accompanied by a widening of income inequality. Welfare state costs Yet because it is unusual in experiencing the problems of both a developing and developed country \u2013 high growth and an ageing population \u2013 the government is worried about the cost of a western European-style welfare state. Rudimentary healthcare and the cost of a decent education means that families save far more heavily than in the west, leaving them with less money left over at the end of the month to spend in the shops. Unless that changes, the imbalances in the global economy that were at the root of the crisis will remain a threat. In the longer term, Beijing has to decide how to use China&apos;s growing economic clout on the global stage. China has allowed Americans to live beyond their means for years by using its export earnings to buy US Treasury bonds; the fear in Washington is that Beijing will pull the plug once it is ready to challenge US hegemony. According to Tylecote, China&apos;s geopolitical objectives are far more limited. &quot;Taiwan is clearly a massive issue and China does not want to be told it cannot reclaim the motherland because an American fleet is sitting in the Taiwan Strait. It wants to challenge US hegemony in its own sea lanes. But I don&apos;t think policy makers have a 30-40 year time horizon; they are much more focused on short-term issues.&quot; One of these issues \u2013 which runs through decision making in the short, medium and long term \u2013 is how to make China&apos;s growth environmentally sustainable. Jeffrey Sachs, the US economist, believes that by 2050 China and America will have economies of a similar size, yet if China operated at the same level of resource use and energy intensity as the US it would require four planets to support its 1.5 billion people. &quot;Pollution is a really serious issue,&quot; said Williamson. &quot;But it is only partially being addressed. The government is looking at nuclear power, solar power, and renewables in an attempt to improve efficiency but in some cities there is a dash for growth and the environment is low on the priority list.&quot; China&apos;s stance at December&apos;s climate change summit in Copenhagen is seen as crucial in piecing together a successor to the 1997 Kyoto agreement. Western diplomats say they detect a softening in Beijing&apos;s approach, but China will not be pushed around. Its growth rate means it will get the one thing its policymakers want more than anything else: respect.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Global economy", "Global recession", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-17T21:17:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/michael-ballack-chelsea-germany-fa-cup", "sentences": ["Ballack is set to feature for his club in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 30 May, but Germany travel to China on 26 May to play the national side in Shanghai on Friday 29 May."], "title": "Germany's tour of Asia makes Michael Ballack a doubt for FA Cup final", "article": "The German national coach Joachim L\u00f6w says that he expects Michael Ballack to take part in Germany&apos;s Far East tour later this month, which could spark a club-versus-country row with Chelsea.

In fact, L\u00f6w expressed no such intention. Our story drew on remarks from the coach supplied by a news agency \u2013 but two quite separate L\u00f6w quotes had been juxtaposed when the agency distilled its story from the primary (though unmentioned) source: a German press report. This juxtaposition made L\u00f6w appear to be saying something he did not say.   Chelsea will resist Germany&apos;s optimistic attempts to take Michael Ballack on their tour of China and Dubai this month, a selection which would have ruled him out of the FA Cup final, despite suggestions from the head coach, Joachim L\u00f6w, that the midfielder would be expected to fulfil his commitments to the national team. L\u00f6w stated that Ballack, with whom he has endured a fractious relationship in recent times, was due to join up with the national squad ahead of their end-of-season friendlies against China and the United Arab Emirates. Germany play the first of those in Shanghai on 29 May, the day before Chelsea take on Everton at Wembley, with L\u00f6w intent upon selecting Ballack for the fixture. &quot;Michael is our leader,&quot; said the national coach. &quot;He can integrate young players, bring them together and give them hints.

We decided this trip [to China and Dubai] last year and it was agreed with both the Bundesliga and the German Football League because the Chinese market is important for economic reasons.&quot; Yet Chelsea have reacted with incredulity to those suggestions and reiterated that Ballack, who was ruled out of Sunday&apos;s victory over Blackburn \u00adRovers suffering from flu, will remain with the club until they complete their domestic season against Everton. Because the \u00adGerman tour falls outside the agreed international calendar, the national federation has no means of forcing the issue. Ballack is expected to return to the Chelsea first team for Sunday&apos;s trip to Sunderland before the Cup final, which will be Guus Hiddink&apos;s last game in charge of the team.

Milan would, though, resist any attempt by Ancelotti to bring his backroom staff. The Italian prime minister, undertaking a public walkabout with his children in the Sicilian resort of Taormina, told reporters that he intended to hold further talks with Ancelotti after the end of the \u00adItalian domestic campaign \u2013 at the end of the month \u2013 before any announcement would be made. &quot;Carlo is one of the family and has won a lot for us,&quot; said Berlusconi. &quot;We will find a solution that is good for him and us. If ever we were to separate, and I repeat that as of today nothing has been decided, we would concentrate on recruiting a young, emerging coach as a replacement.&quot; The most likely candidate appears to be the former Milan striker Marco van Basten, who resigned at Ajax this month. &quot;Marco is like a son to me,&quot; added the club president. &quot;He is a part of the history of Milan. There are many young coaches out there with shoulders broad enough to take over at a big club.&quot; Van Basten, who was in Italy last weekend to play golf, was spotted in a restaurant with the club&apos;s assistant manager, Filippo Galli. &quot;Something was said about the possibility of him coaching Milan but we mainly talked about his experience at Ajax,&quot; Galli said. Frank Rijkaard, another potential candidate for Chelsea, would also be considered by the Rossoneri with the Dutchman revealing yesterday that he is ready to return to management after a year-long sabbatical. &quot;I can&apos;t say exactly where I will end up,&quot; said Rijkaard. &quot;I can&apos;t talk about that now. Maybe in the next few weeks. I respect all the coaches in the game, I can&apos;t say I want to go to that particular club because, at the moment, that particular club might have a manager and I have respect for fellow coaches.

Many centuries later, on Christmas Day 1941, as Hong Kong surrendered after a bitter 18-day battle, another band of fighters broke through the Japanese lines and marched for four days across the bandit-infested hills of occupied China to freedom. This gang numbered just 68 and was mostly British. But the two Chinese men who led it were so impressed by its swashbuckling spirit that they declared: &quot;Our number has grown to 108.&quot; Henry Hsu, who has died aged 96, was one of those leaders. An athlete before the second world war, he later became a leading businessman and politician in Taiwan, and a\u00a0member of the International Olympic Committee from 1970 to 1988. Shortly before his death, he was approached by a group of the escapers&apos; descendants who are planning to re-enact the journey. He agreed to be their &quot;commander-in-chief&quot;, hoping to be able to wave them off from Hong Kong next Christmas. As a young officer in the Chinese navy, Hsu was to play a crucial role in the success of the escape. When the Japanese invaded Hong Kong, hours after Pearl Harbor, Hsu was based in the city as the aide-de-camp of Admiral Chan Chak, a one-legged ex-warlord and southern president of the Kuomintang (Nationalist party of China). The pair were soon in the thick of the action, helping to eliminate Chinese fifth columnists and liaising with British intelligence to combat Japanese efforts to buy off the local triads. When the colony finally fell, Britain felt honour-bound to help Chan and Hsu escape and duly promised them places on the last motor torpedo boat leaving Hong Kong. So began a sequence straight out of a Boy&apos;s Own annual. As Japanese troops poured into the city centre, Hsu bundled the admiral into the front seat of his car with assorted British officers in the back and drove off at high speed for the fishing village of Aberdeen. The promised boat gone, they borrowed an abandoned launch, coming under fierce fire as they left the harbour. With their boat shot up and at least two dead, the group took to the water. As the admiral removed his wooden leg (in\u00a0which he had stashed HK$200,000), a bullet entered his wrist. He was pulled to a\u00a0small island by Hsu, who left his boss bleeding behind a rock and scampered off to find a small flotilla of motor torpedo boats waiting in the bay behind. The group sailed through the night to Mirs Bay and the coast of the mainland. There, Hsu contacted local guerrillas to help fend off Japanese patrols. He then plotted the route that the group would take and, during the 80-mile trek into free China, arranged food in villages and lodging on temple floors. The leadership skills and determination that marked his later careers shine through in the many diaries that survive of the escape. Heng Hsu - known as Henry - was born in Guangdong province, in southern China, and went to Whampoa military academy before studying law in Shanghai. A versatile athlete, he competed in the 10th Far East games, in Manila in 1934, winning medals in football and volleyball. After the war he became a successful businessman in Hong Kong, and later moved to Taiwan where he served as an MP and presidential adviser. He owned a string of hotels in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US. Hsu was appointed OBE in 1942. He is survived by his son and two daughters. His wife, Amy, predeceased him.

It led to Judd being seriously considered for the role of James Bond in Dr No (1962), the first of the endless series. However, the career of the well-built, square-jawed British actor, who had worked consistently in films and television since the age of 16, failed to\u00a0ignite in the way he expected. In fact, Judd&apos;s role as an out-of-luck reporter suffering the trauma of divorce, writer&apos;s block and alcoholism, who comes across the scoop of the century in The Day the Earth Caught Fire, was not only his first substantial part but probably his best. However, some years later, Val Guest, the director, recalled Judd&apos;s &quot;difficult&quot; behaviour during the shooting, which he put down to feelings of inferiority in his first big role. In the film, Judd discovers that because the Soviets and the west detonated nuclear tests simultaneously, the earth has been knocked off its axis and is moving closer to the sun. Judd is particularly effective at delivering some witty lines, and the scene where he and Janet Munro strip down to their underwear because of the rapidly rising temperature is surprisingly sexy. Judd was born to expatriate English parents in Shanghai. On their return to\u00a0England during the second world war, he got a small role as a public schoolboy in Roy Boulting&apos;s The Guinea Pig (1948). He continued to get parts, often uncredited, in British films in the 1950s: a boxer in The Good Die Young (1954), a soldier in X: The Unknown (1956), a\u00a0policeman in The Man Upstairs (1958), a naval officer in Sink The Bismarck! and\u00a0a warder in The Criminal (both\u00a01960). After his break in The Day the Earth Caught Fire, Judd was given the lead as a rather dour commander of a German submarine manned by a British crew to confuse the enemy in Mystery Submarine (1963). In the same year, he played opposite Susan Hayward in Stolen Hours, a feeble British remake of the Bette Davis melodrama Dark Victory. Poor Hayward is dying of an unspecified disease and Judd is her dashing, racing-driver boyfriend who knows that he could be killed at any time, but says: &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t want to be told you&apos;re going to get yours in the 10th lap.&quot; The following year, Judd was a brawny Viking called Sven in the Anglo-Yugoslav production of The Long Ships, starring Richard Widmark. First Men in the Moon (1964), an enjoyable adaptation of the HG Wells novel, co-starred Judd and Martha Hyer, managing to keep straight faces while being captured by Selenites (men in insect suits) and threatened by a giant caterpillar. Naturally, he was billed below Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida in Strange Bedfellows (1965), but was visible enough as a London gent who becomes involved with La Lollo. In\u00a0contrast, playing a scientist, he had to avoid getting caught in the tentacles of slithery creatures that live on bone marrow in Island of Terror (1966).

He is foolhardy enough to accompany her to an ancient lost city. Parallel to his film career, Judd appeared regularly on television, from the 1950s series The Adventures of Sir Lancelot, and later in Emmerdale Farm, The New Avengers, The Professionals and The Sweeney. He was also in Flambards, a mini-series for Yorkshire TV, as the arrogant and bullying disabled owner of the eponymous mansion. But his association with Hammer and sub-Hammer horrors continued, with parts in The Vault of Horror (1973); The Hound of the Baskervilles (1983), as the sinister servant Barrymore; and as a police inspector in Jack the Ripper (1988). But there were periods of\u00a0unemployment, due in part to his heavy drinking. Judd was married twice, both times to actors. His first wife, Gene Anderson, died in 1965.

Beijing rarely criticises Pyongyang in public. But the foreign ministry statement, which added that North Korea had acted in defiance of the international community and its own commitments, was more muted than the response to the first nuclear test in 2006. Then, China accused the regime of a &quot;flagrant and brazen&quot; violation of international opinion.

He had devised a way of powering a vehicle using a dynamo and a motor, much like today&apos;s hybrid cars. It&apos;s a memory that gives him confidence in &quot;the naive thought&quot; as he likes to call it. &quot;There are some remarkably sophisticated things that blow our minds,&quot; he says. &quot;But there are some really simple ones as well.&quot; Heatherwick is showing me around his new London studio, a large space somewhere between a showroom, a car park and Q&apos;s lab in the Bond films. Test models, prototypes and finished items abound: some of them bold ideas that never happened (a tunnel made of road cones); some of them intriguing ideas yet to happen (a bridge made of little silver discs); and some strictly under wraps (&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t show you those yet&quot;). There are also banks of designers working at computers and - Heatherwick&apos;s pride and joy - a workshop filled with lathes, bandsaws and even a sunken metalworking area.      Thomas Heatherwick. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe    &quot;Fifteen years ago,&quot; he says, &quot;if you&apos;d come to my studio, I&apos;d have had to make sure I&apos;d made my bed and cleaned the breadcrumbs off the table - to pretend I didn&apos;t live there.&quot; That continuing belief in &quot;the naive thought&quot; has taken Heatherwick a long way. Equal parts sculptor, product designer, engineer and inventor, he has turned his hand to everything from handbags to shopping malls, and running through everything is that same striking execution of a simple idea, usually into something elegant, practical and ingenious. The handbag is Longchamp&apos;s Zip Bag, which has a continuous zip coiling around it; undo it and the bag doubles in size. His Rolling Bridge in Paddington lifts up and curls into a free-standing circular sculpture. It is now raised once a week whether a boat is passing or not, since so many people come just to see it. The list could go on. Heatherwick is no longer the precocious, up-and-coming talent. He has arrived. Heatherwick&apos;s career is now entering a new phase, though. So far it&apos;s been a rapid progression, from know-it-all London schoolkid to brilliant student (he was handpicked by Terence Conran to design for him before he&apos;d even graduated) to young studio founder. But now, at the age of 39 and head of a 26-person operation, Heatherwick is encountering problems. In particular, one of his best-known works, The B of the Bang, has been attracting the wrong kind of publicity. This huge public sculpture, taller than the Angel of the North, was erected in Manchester in 2005 to commemorate the city hosting the Commonwealth games. It&apos;s an impressive creation: a cluster of 180 steel spikes that seem to emanate from a single point in mid-air. It perfectly fits its explosive title (Linford Christie&apos;s phrase to describe the point at which he aims to leave the starting blocks), even if locals called it &quot;kerplunk&quot;. The trouble was that the tips of the spikes began to drop off, presenting a potentially lethal threat to passersby.  Despite attempts to fix the problem, the sculpture has had to be dismantled. The council began legal proceedings, and an out-of-court settlement was reached whereby Heatherwick&apos;s team paid them \u00a31.7m - slightly more than the project&apos;s original cost. Under the terms of the settlement, Heatherwick is unable to explain what happened, although reports have suggested it&apos;s by no means all his fault. &quot;My team bust a gut and pulled off something extraordinary,&quot; he says. &quot;So I&apos;m really sad. But Manchester still believe in the project. They&apos;ve said they want to rebuild it.&quot;  There have been other setbacks: the Rolling Bridge was out of action for about a year due to faulty welding, while a glass footbridge he designed for King&apos;s Cross has been cancelled due to lack of funds. It would have been quite something: a structure made from 1,200 glass panels, held together without screws, bolts or adhesives. Heatherwick, say his critics, is experiencing a much-needed reality check, but he remains sanguine. &quot;This goes with the territory,&quot; he says, adding that he has always made it his mission to break new ground, to become expert &quot;at not being expert&quot;. Heatherwick&apos;s inexpertise is certainly still heavily in demand, and the projects seem to be getting more ambitious. Increasingly, he is asked to design buildings, even though he&apos;s not an architect; he thought about studying architecture, but chose 3-D design instead. &quot;I thought I might have more chance of making things,&quot; he says. &quot;I studied at a time when buildings were sterile things, and their creators were hands-off people - super-intelligent people, but you felt they didn&apos;t love the stuff buildings are made from.&quot; Two years ago, Heatherwick completed his first free-standing building: the East Beach Cafe in Littlehampton, a sculptural form made of rusting steel that looks like a giant shell. Although it won him a Riba award and turned the town into a site of design pilgrimage, it could still be dismissed as a piece of sculpture, rather than &quot;proper&quot; architecture. His latest building, which has just opened, should change that. Made on a tiny budget, it&apos;s not a glamorous commission, but the new centre for creative businesses at Aberystwyth University is still extraordinary.  Heatherwick split the project into eight small units and reinstated the forest landscape around them. What could have been just another university building is instead an enchanted woodland community, albeit one that looks like something from a sci-fi movie, with crinkly walls that seem to have been made of tinfoil, although they are in fact stainless steel. &quot;It lasts for ever,&quot; says Heatherwick of the material, &quot;but it&apos;s phenomenally expensive. So we thought, &apos;If it&apos;s everlasting and doesn&apos;t corrode, why do you need it to be thick?&apos; We found a mill in Finland where they rolled it 0.1mm thick - the thickness of a coke can. The problem is, it crinkles. So we thought, &apos;What if we let it crinkle and enjoy that?&apos;&quot;  His team designed a knobbly mangle to find the right crinkle. Insulating foam was then injected behind the sheets to keep their shape. You feel as if you could poke your finger through the walls, but actually they can take a hammer blow. Not only are the units energy efficient, their shiny surfaces grab at the light, throwing it back like thousands of reflecting leaves. &quot;In the evening,&quot; says Heatherwick, &quot;they actually glow. I was a bit scared, but it worked out really well.&quot;  That&apos;s not the sort of thing you&apos;d hear a proper architect say, but, looking around Heatherwick&apos;s studio, there are plenty of other projects that suggest there&apos;s a big-hitter at work here. A tall, wavy sculpture turns out to be a model for a low-cost apartment block in Hong Kong: &quot;It&apos;s not far off the height of the Gherkin but for the price of the atrium on top.&quot; Also in Hong Kong, he&apos;s working on a \u00a3120m redesign of the Pacific Place shopping mall. No detail, it seems, escapes his attention: on his phone, he shows me a video of a new hinge he&apos;s designed for the toilet doors.  Then there&apos;s his design for a British pavilion for the Shanghai Expo next year - a project that would normally go to a top architect. And it&apos;s difficult to imagine many top architects coming up with what Heatherwick is proposing: a simple cube from which 70,000 transparent acrylic rods, each five metres long, will protrude - like a giant fibre-optic lamp from the 1970s. Inside, there will be a &quot;seed cathedral&quot;: embedded in the ends of the light-channelling rods will be seeds from Kew Gardens&apos; Millennium Seed Bank project. &quot;How do you show off in a place where everyone&apos;s showing off?&quot; he asks. &quot;That will probably stand out more than a fancy shape or a beautiful box.&quot;  Heatherwick is the first to admit he still has a lot to learn about architecture, but perhaps architects could learn things from him. It&apos;s notoriously hard to innovate in construction without falling flat, or getting sued, and few seem willing to take the risk. Heatherwick&apos;s envelope-pushing is a breath of fresh air. Architects could also learn from his ability to cut through the clutter and conjure simple yet distinctive forms that make everything else look bland, without being either wilfully sculptural or noncommittally minimal.  In architecture, he says, the worst thing is to come up with what is essentially a one-liner. &quot;But,&quot; he adds, &quot;sometimes something needs to have one clear idea, otherwise it&apos;ll just be lost in the fuzz of everything. I don&apos;t feel I&apos;m trying to make art. I&apos;m trying to make interesting things. People can relate to that.&quot;", "tags": ["Design", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Sculpture", "Thomas Heatherwick"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-26T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/27/china-green-supertower", "sentences": ["Six of the world&apos;s 10 tallest buildings completed last year were in China, including the 492-metre-tall Shanghai World Financial Centre.", "Even taller structures are on their way \u2013 such as the Shanghai Centre, 632 metres,\u00a0 and at 600 metres, the Goldin Finance 117 in Tianjin."], "title": "Supertower offers glimmer of hope in polluted Chinese city", "article": "You can see the carbon emissions rising by the day over the skyline of Guangzhou, where armies of construction workers are busy throwing up skyscrapers that will soon surpass anything in New York in terms of height and \u00adenergy consumption.     Pearl River Tower in Guangzhou, China. Artist's impression: Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP 2009    It is the same story all over China where, despite the economic crisis, engineers are completing four more tower blocks every day \u2013 almost all fitted with air conditioning, heating, lighting and lifts that will run on coal-powered electricity. The country is in the middle of the greatest building boom in human history. Six of the world&apos;s 10 tallest buildings completed last year were in China, including the 492-metre-tall Shanghai World Financial Centre. Even taller structures are on their way \u2013 such as the Shanghai Centre, 632 metres,\u00a0 and at 600 metres, the Goldin Finance 117 in Tianjin. But among the giants there is one that could hold out hope for a low-carbon future. The Pearl River Tower, now being erected in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong province, is being billed as the most energy efficient superskyscraper ever built. With wind turbines, solar panels, \u00adsun-shields, smart lighting, water-cooled ceilings and state-of-the-art insulation, the 310-metre tower is designed to use half the energy of most buildings of its size and set a new global benchmark for self-sufficiency among the planet&apos;s high rises. Engineers say the tower could even be enhanced to create surplus electricity if the local power firm relaxes its monopoly over energy generation. Due for completion in October 2010, the structure currently looks no different from the many other masses of steel and concrete that are reaching for the sky in Guangzhou. The horizon is rising fast and grey in China&apos;s wealthiest province. By the time the Asian games begin next year, the provincial capital will boast a 432-metre-high TV tower, excluding its 150-metre antenna, and the 391-metre Zhongxin Plaza. Both structures will be bigger than any building in New York. While Dubai and other cities in the Middle East are building a handful of still loftier structures, nowhere can compare with China for the sheer mass of supertowers being planned or under construction. One management consultancy firm estimates that China will erect up to 50,000 new skyscrapers by 2025. Along with smaller structures, McKinsey \u00adestimates that buildings will account for 25% of China&apos;s energy consumption by then, up from 17% today. More efficient buildings could drastically reduce this demand, though few are likely to go as far the 71-storey Pearl River Tower, which combines many of the world&apos;s leading energy-saving technologies on a scale never seen before. The most spectacular feature will be the four wind turbines built into the belly of the structure. The building has been shaped to drive air through the cavities at maximum velocity so the \u00adturbines can generate 1m kilowatt hours of electricity a year. The building will also produce electricity via the photovoltaic cells of the solar shades cooling its east and west facades. The biggest contribution to energy efficiency will come from the radiant ceiling technology, which uses piped water to keep the internal space cool. Energy will also be extracted from the difference in air temperature between the building&apos;s inner and outer walls. Rather than use fans to recirculate old air, fresh air will be delivered to every floor through natural buoyancy. According to Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the US architectural firm behind the design, the energy efficiency devices add about $13m (\u00a38m) to the construction costs. But this could be earned back within five years by reduced electricity bills, lower maintenance costs and extra rent from the space not used for air \u00adconditioning ducts. Roger Frechette, the firm&apos;s chief engineer, estimates the tower will reduce energy consumption by 58% compared with a standard building this size. Under the initial design for a &quot;zero-emission skyscraper&quot;, it could even have generated surplus energy with micro-turbines that could sell electricity back to the grid at night. But this proposal was dropped after opposition from the local utility company, which is cautious about allowing rival sources of power generation. This may change. Faced by a deteriorating environment, uncertain world energy supplies and pressure to act on climate change, the Chinese government is trying to shift towards a more sustainable model of development. It is experimenting with ecocities and introducing new green building codes. Guangzhou is following this trend. As the workshop of the world, the city has a reputation as a humid, heavily polluted sprawl. But it is trying to change this by building taller structures as well as improving the infrastructure for service industries. &quot;We are trying to make our city more energy efficient. In the past, we expanded too fast. That was a mistake we are trying to correct now,&quot; said Chen Qing, the deputy director of the city&apos;s Urban Planning and Research Centre. Not everyone, however, is convinced that skyscrapers are the best way to achieve the city&apos;s green goals, given that the Pearl River Tower will be built with 26,500 tonnes of steel and more than 40,000 cubic metres of concrete, and that its main tenant will be a tobacco company. Meng Qinglin, a professor at the \u00adenvironment and energy laboratory of the South China University of Technology, says urban planners are following global fashions without paying sufficient attention to whether low emission buildings are what they claim to be. &quot;There is a misconception that buildings can generate sufficient wind and solar power for themselves. We need to look deeper at how much pollution is caused and how many resources are used in the development and manufacture of those technologies,&quot; he said. &quot;They call it clean energy, but often the burden is simply being shifted to other places, where the silicon is mined and the turbines and solar panels are made.&quot;", "tags": ["Green building", "Environment", "China", "Construction industry", "Architecture", "Design", "Asia Pacific", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-27T16:27:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/28/john-kerry-united-states-china-climate-change", "sentences": ["&quot;That will swamp everything that Europe and the US is willing to do,&quot; said Charlie McElwee, a Shanghai-based environmental lawyer."], "title": "John Kerry hails progress of US-China climate talks", "article": "Climate talks between the United States and China have entered a crucial few weeks that will determine the outcome of landmark negotiations in Copenhagen later this year, according to US senator John Kerry. Speaking in Beijing, the former presidential candidate and chairman of the powerful Senate foreign relations committee, said he was hopeful that an agreement can be reached after what he described as the &quot;most constructive and productive&quot; talks he has had with China over climate change in 20 years. &quot;Based on these meetings, I am very optimistic at the possibility of producing a successful outcome in Copenhagen,&quot; said Kerry, who has been involved in negotiations since 1988. The senator&apos;s comments mark a further sweetening of the mood music between the two nations that together account for almost half of the world&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions, but this has yet to translate into concrete progress.  In their formal positions, the two sides remain far apart. China wants developed nations to make a 40% cut in emissions by 2020 from 1990 levels, far above the goal set by President Obama&apos;s administration. The United States wants China to set voluntary but verifiable goals to reduce its energy use and, in the longer term, to join richer nations in cutting overall emissions. But Kerry said senior Chinese politicians had shown a willingness to compromise, particularly over the 40% target that he described as politically impossible in the US at present. By sharing know-how and conducting joint research into renewable and energy-saving technology, he said China would realise that it can go beyond its current target of a 20% cut in energy intensity of its economy - the amount of carbon released per dollar of GDP. The Chinese government has already tripled its target for wind power and will soon announce a $200bn investment in clean energy, Kerry said. He quoted first vice-premier Li Keqiang as saying &quot;Let&apos;s do it&quot; with regard to bilateral cooperation in the field. Major sticking points remain over the question of which nations will pay and how much will be spent on measures to mitigate climate change and its impact. It is also far from certain that China will agree to the stringent verification process sought by the US. How far each side is willing to compromise will be largely determined in June, when the chief US negotiator Todd Stern visits Beijing, US politicians consider new legislation to cut emissions and the United Nations hosts international talks in Bonn at which the first negotiating texts will be on the table. US house speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said the possibility of a deal on the environment could transform relations between the world&apos;s richest and most populous nations. &quot;I do see this opportunity for climate change to be ... a game-changer,&quot; she told students at the elite Tsinghua University. &quot;The impact of climate change is a tremendous risk to the security and wellbeing of our countries.&quot; In a sign of shifting priorities, Pelosi has been noticeably quiet about China&apos;s human rights record during this week&apos;s visit. She was previously a vociferous critic of Beijing&apos;s controls on the media, political activists, lawyers and religious groups. Many doubt the two nations are being ambitious enough. If China sticks to its current energy efficiency goals and growth rate, the consultancy McKinsey estimates that its emissions will double by 2030. &quot;That will swamp everything that Europe and the US is willing to do,&quot; said Charlie McElwee, a Shanghai-based environmental lawyer.", "tags": ["Climate change", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "US news", "China", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "World news", "Global climate talks", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-28T12:25:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/29/the-fiver", "sentences": ["\u00b7 And a Germany side featuring Robert Huth caused a Shanghai surprise when they held China to a 1-1 draw on their tour of Asia."], "title": "Gravy And Maraschino Slice; and Semantic Grounds", "article": "SIGN O&apos; THE (TV) TIMES Weird Uncle Fiver&apos;s viewing habits aren&apos;t as one dimensional as you might think.

Recently the Fiver too has been enjoying ESPN Classic&apos;s fare very much, from old BBC footage of the 1965 Monaco grand prix - not-particularly-fast cars pootling round hairpin corners at 1mph in the pouring rain, set to a soundtrack of jazz vibraphone (you have to see it, really) - to the busty model in the stings for channel sponsors C&amp;A Building Plastics. But perhaps best of all have been the reruns of classic FA Cup finals of yore, including the 1981 FA Cup final replay featuring the best cup final goal of all time - yes, that Steve MacKenzie belter - and the 1973 match between Sunderland and Dirty Leeds, during which the Mackems started showcasing fancy backheels before the end of the first half, having gone one up through the eventual recipient of the most hilariously backhanded obituary of all time, Ian Porterfield. Will this season&apos;s final go down in history alongside those classic matches, and provide future generations with nostalgic entertainment for years to come? It&apos;s unlikely, let&apos;s face it, the moneymen have spent the last two decades jiggering everything up. But Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink is nevertheless doing his best to reapply some much-needed lustre to the dull old pot. &quot;Make no mistake, the FA Cup is a big title, not only recognised in England but also worldwide,&quot; said Hiddink today, buffing furiously and nearly getting up a nice shine. &quot;We have some players who are at the start of their careers and some who have already a beautiful career, but if every now and then a trophy materialises, it is the cherry on the pie.&quot; Sadly, as Hiddink continued to work away with his chamois, while simultaneously attempting to wedge a glace cocktail fruit atop a Ginsters beef-and-onion crust, his counterpart in tomorrow&apos;s final was doing his best to undo all his good work. &quot;We are trying to keep the whole thing rising all the time,&quot; said David Moyes, either referring to that gravy and maraschino slice, or his Everton Project. &quot;If we are fortunate to win the cup, it would be something for us to build on.

The Fiver, of course, believes in one world, travels without a passport (usually in the luggage rack) and opens its spindly, underdeveloped tea-time email arms to embrace every man woman and legally viable adolescent without the foresight to effect an evasive manoeuvre. As do the FAs of the home nations, which today hinted, leaked and suggested under cover of a theatrical cough that the London 2012 Olympic Games will in fact feature a Team GB football team. Even if it&apos;s actually a team comprised by decree of the Scottish, Welsh and Norn Iron 1-0 FAs of 11 English players, rather than the alternative - a team comprised by a simple process of elimination of 11 English players with perhaps a token Celt sat on the bench with a grump on next to Tom Huddlestone. The Olympic plan is expected to be rubber-stamped by Fifa at next week&apos;s annual groaning cheese selection-plate and five-star Thai nibble selection buffet congress, which, by a stroke of good fortune, is taking place in the Bahamas. After which the Fiver can only hope the home nations take to the idea with the same bridge-building elan shown at its own recent humorous tea-time communication UK forum held inside a damp cardboard box in the right-exit arm of the Egham bypass foot tunnel complex, where No No No No We Want To Walk Down That Road Fiver showed his enthusiasm for integration by sulking in a corner, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch Fiver got into the swing of things by sulking in a corner and Shortbread McFiver, fuelled by 2.5l of Fistfight, joined in the fun by sulking violently in the corner.

Although headline grabbing in nature, the collapse of GM has been well trailed and when the bankruptcy petition is filed at lunchtime today many traders will see it as the last gasp of a company that has been on the sick list for years. Instead, traders have been poring over the Chinese purchasing managers&apos; index for May which provides more evidence that the world&apos;s third largest economy is recovering. The index looks at a number of factors \u2013 from order levels and production to employment \u2013 and aggregates them: an index level over 50 means manufacturing is growing, anything under 50 means it is contracting. Because PMI figures are published one working day after the month they describe, the index is watched closely and for the third month in a row China&apos;s PMI has remained above 50, although it was actually slightly down in May \u2013 at 53.1 \u2013 from April&apos;s 53.5. The data suggests manufacturing is recovering in China, boosting the prospects of an overall global recovery. Shares across Asia rose in the early morning and that optimism buoyed the FTSE 100 when it opened. Two hours after trading started, the FTSE 100 is up 71.32 points at 4,489.26 points. The PMI has helped US oil futures hit their highest point for more than six months - at $67 a barrel - on hopes for a pick-up in demand. Crude for July delivery has added 0.9% to $66.92 having earlier hit a seven-month high of $67.  Across the Asia markets there were gains overnight. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index rose 1.5%, Japan&apos;s Nikkei was up 1.2% and the Shanghai stockmarket increased 2.2%. In Europe Frankfurt&apos;s DAX is up about 3.2% at more than 5,100 with the CAC-40 in Paris up 2.4% at more than 3,350. The more buoyant tone of stockmarkets has hurt the dollar with investors turning their back on its perceived safe-haven status to invest elsewhere in the hope for a better return.

But once in a while you get a business whose death is about much more than supply chains or sales targets; it sounds the death knell for an entire era. And the funeral bells surely tolled this week when General Motors filed for bankruptcy. Start talking about GM, and the superlatives soon run out. What&apos;s now the largest industrial failure in US \u00adhistory was for so many years the biggest company in the world. More than that, the 100-year-old giant was the corporate embodiment of the American Century. Everyone knows the one about how a former boss of General Motors (nearly) said that what was good for his company was good for America, and vice versa. Today the statement is used for easy irony, but at the time Charles Wilson was voicing a truism. He was speaking a few years after the second world war, during which carmakers supplied the US military with hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of planes, tanks and other military equipment. The management theorist Peter Drucker said it was not the generals but General Motors who &quot;won the war for America&quot;. And they were rewarded handsomely, with cosy regulation and ridiculously low taxes on fuel. The gasoline-industrial complex, you could call it, and for much of the postwar period it held up well enough. Not any more. Of the Detroit Three, GM and Chrysler are now enfeebled, on an IV-drip of government money. Only Ford has avoided the same fate, by taking out a giant loan three years ago and beginning its own painful restructuring. The official line is that GM is not dead, it&apos;s just regrouping. Even as he administered the last rites this week, Barack Obama heralded &quot;the beginning of a new GM&quot;. Yes, and I&apos;m sure we all look forward to the continued banking success of Sir Fred Goodwin. If there are no second acts in American life, the world of business is barely more forgiving. Even optimists admit that whatever emerges from Detroit will be a shrunken, modest thing, shorn of its pomp and might. Just as Detroit&apos;s rise was about more than business, so too is its demise. When people talk about the rising economic might of Asia, they normally paint it in genteel, gradual terms \u2013 photo\u00ad calls at international summits, say. But sometimes this slow shift of power becomes more of a lurch. Sometimes it&apos;s marked by an industrial humiliation. For Porsche, BMW and other luxury marques, Shanghai is already the second most important market in the world. And this year, for the first time ever, the Chinese are set to buy more cars than recession-hit Americans. But the developing countries of Asia are not just consuming more, they are closing the gap in manufacturing. In doing so, they are on a well-trodden path to industrialisation, following Japan and South Korea. Those countries pioneered cheaper, small cars; this time, the new frontiers of globalisation are leading the way on electric cars. Yes, you read that right: the green auto, the will-o&apos;-the-wisp of the motor industry, is already being made in smoke-belching Asia. The world&apos;s bestselling plug-in car, the G-Wiz, was invented and built by an Indian firm, Reva. The company that has got the furthest in developing a battery-powered auto which can go for long distances is called BYD (short for Build Your Dreams) and is based in Shenzen, southern China. True, the little G-Wiz is a funny-looking thing, more milkfloat than motor. Then again, the Americans used to laugh at Toyota \u2013 and now it&apos;s the world&apos;s no 1. When pleading for Washington aid, GM execs made much of their new electric vehicle, the Volt \u2013 but that&apos;s still years from going on sale. Such slow-footedness is hardly a surprise from a company whose vice-chair, Bob Lutz, last year reportedly described global warming as &quot;a crock of shit&quot;. Once a petrolhead, always a \u00adpetrolhead. And that&apos;s the other big \u00addifference about the electric brigade \u2013 strikingly few of its leaders are motor men. Reva&apos;s founder comes from the solar-power industry; BYD used to make mobile-phone \u00adbatteries, and only got into cars this decade; Shai Agassi, the leading designer of a \u00adsystem for \u00adcharging electric \u00advehicles, is an Israeli who used to be big in \u00adaccountancy software. &quot;The car industry is heading for a showdown between discipline and imagination,&quot; says John Wormald, a British consultant to auto firms for over 30 years. &quot;The old giants have plenty of discipline and heft; but the start-ups have got far more imagination.&quot; Or, as a Chinese car executive put it to the New Yorker not so long ago: &quot;We have no brand name, no recognition, nothing. We are simply aggressive.&quot; Plenty of people will read all this as a triumph of free-market economics: the old overtaken by the new, the public good served by an eager private sector, and creative destruction writ large. I&apos;m not so sure. Anyone who&apos;s ever been to India and China knows that what they really need is fewer cars and more cheap public transport, powered as cleanly as possible. And all that is far more likely to come now that America&apos;s Big Three have less of a stranglehold on the auto sector.

But this is not the latest experiment in European green living. This is a ground-breaking mega development in China that could serve as a model for eco cities across the developing world, say to its backers. China and Singapore are pooling expertise and finance to build a green urban community in north-east China, with the capacity for 350,000 people, near the western shore of the Bohai, one of the most polluted seas in the world. The plan to build this settlement, known as Tianjin Eco-City and likely to be the size of Bristol, is, though, haunted by the failure of a yet more ambitious scheme, near Shanghai. At a ceremony to mark the start of construction on the first phase of Tianjin \u2013 an &quot;eco-business park&quot; over 150 hectares (370 acres) \u2013 investors\u00a0said the 10-year scheme was intended to be &quot;scalable and replicable&quot; so it could be used across China, India and other developing nations. A new model is certainly needed. Over the next 20 years the number of urban dwellers in China is forecast to swell by more than 300 million, equivalent to the entire population of the US. With consumption levels and wages three times higher in the city than in the countryside, this will put an enormous strain on energy and water resources \u2013 unless there is a change in the urbanisation model. Prototype eco cities and villages are springing up in several areas in China, including\u00a0Xiangji town in Xinjiang, and Huangbaiyu in Liaoning. But finding the right balance between radical change and realism has proved elusive. The biggest disappointment has been the eco city plan for Dongtan, which the engineering consultants Arup\u00a0billed as a model for the world. Under a hugely ambitious scheme dreamed up by the British company, the silt flats north of Shanghai would have been home to a low-carbon, near car-free city the size of Manhattan. But just a year before the first phase was to have been completed, the site is moribund. The project&apos;s main political backer is in jail on corruption charges, construction permits have lapsed and prospects of the plan being realised look increasingly distant. Goh Chye Boon, chief of the joint venture running the business park at Tianjin Eco-City, said his project had learned from Dongtan that it was better not to reach immediately for the skies. &quot;We aspire to one day be a dream city like Dongtan but we want to take one credible step at a time,&quot; he said. &quot;Dongtan inspired me, but I think when you reach too high, you may forget that the ultimate beneficiary must be the resident.&quot; But the new city being built in Tianjin\u00a0is in danger of going too far the other way by not being ambitious enough. Although it will use wind and geothermal power, its target of 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020 is only a tiny improvement on the goal for the national average.\u00a0The goal for carbon emissions\u00a0is equally modest. Every building is to be insulated, double glazed and made entirely of materials that abide by the government&apos;s green standards. More than 60% of waste will be recycled. To cut car journeys by 90%, a light railway will pass close by every home, and zoning will ensure all residents have shops, schools and clinics within walking distance. It will be more verdant than almost any other city in China, with an average of 12sq\u00a0metres (nearly 130sq ft) of parks or lawns or wetlands for each person.\u00a0Domestic water use should be kept below 120\u00a0litres (26 gallons) per person each day,\u00a0 with more than half supplied by rain capture and recycled grey water. Success will depend on finding the right mixture of economics, user-friendliness and environmental concerns. Paul French, chief China analyst at Access Asia, said Dongtan had died because planners h ad failed to consult the local community and had aimed too high. &quot;Dongtan was plonked down on everyone. They were going to do everything,\u00a0but nothing has been realised. It&apos;s really important with environmental stuff that you only say what you can actually deliver or people will lose trust.&quot; Liang Benfan, a professor of urban development at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: &quot;It&apos;s good people are discussing this, but they are too focused on technology.

Small groups of young men and women head for the central railway station, carrying presents home in cheap, shiny suitcases or striped travel sacks. The men still have a country look about them, stopping to squat on the kerb and smoke a cigarette. The women are very different, dressed in bright, striking style, often in high heels quite unsuitable for the long journey. Chinese-American journalist Leslie Chang rode the local buses in Dongguan, one of the biggest centres for migrant work across the Hong Kong border, and observed this sharp division of the sexes: &quot;The young men on the bus smelled of gamy sweat, the scent of people who walked long distances outdoors ... The young women were immaculate; they never smelled, and their hair was always sleek and shiny.&quot; Other writers have chronicled the exploitation of China&apos;s migrant workers, whose dirt-cheap labour provides most of the leisure and electronic goods which fuelled our credit boom. Chang&apos;s brilliant book Factory Girls also portrays the hard side of life for those who have left the land, but it is, above all, a tribute to the determination of China&apos;s &quot;factory girls&quot; to make a better life for themselves. The &quot;boys&quot;, most of whom work in the construction industry, show rather less drive and initiative. There is a good reason for this disparity. China&apos;s internal migrants are believed (there are no reliable figures) to total some 120 million - perhaps one-seventh of the country&apos;s adult working population. More than a third of these are women from a still very traditional rural society. And unlike the men, Chang explains, the women have no permanent home to go back to. They have broken away from a life where rural daughters are supposed to marry and move to live with their in-laws. Migration liberates them from the village but it has also dropped them, literally, in a &quot;no-man&apos;s land&quot;. No wonder they are more motivated than the boys to dress smartly, try to impress the boss, and to &quot;value migration for its life-changing possibilities&quot;. When I first visited Dongguan in the early 1980s, the city and large rural area under its jurisdiction had a combined population of about one million. The Dongguan that Chang knows now has a population of 7.5 million, of whom 5.8 million are migrants. It has high-rises, international hotels, super-highways and more than 100 industrial districts and technology parks. Economic growth over the past two decades has averaged 15% a year; it makes 40% of the magnetic heads used in PCs around the world and 30% of their disk drives. Two-thirds of the workers are women, employed for their dexterity on the production line and perhaps because they are thought to be easier to bully. The two young women whom Chang got to know well, and through whom we see the life of a migrant worker, may be more independent-minded than the average: it probably takes some nerve to befriend a foreigner, even one who looks and speaks Chinese and dresses for the part. Wu left her home in rural Hunan at the age of 17, tired of peddling fruit and vegetables. Lured to a job near the Hong Kong border in a &quot;hair salon&quot;, she realised it was a brothel and ran straight out, leaving her documents behind her. Eventually she found an abandoned ID card and started again. She learned to speak standard Chinese to get rid of her provincial accent (Hunanese have a &quot;country hick&quot; reputation) and Cantonese to talk with the bosses. She started to keep a diary with self-motivating entries: &quot;I have no time to be unhappy because there are too many things I want to do&quot;; &quot;We can be ordinary but we must not be vulgar.&quot; Wu went into direct sales, hawking Tibetan medicine and funeral plots - city dwellers often buy rural plots of land located with auspicious views for the afterlife. She made a lot of money, set up a small business and lost it all, then found another job selling paint. Chang first met her at the Dongguan Making Friends Club where migrant boys and girls look for partners. Chang accompanied Wu on a blind date, shared the romantic ups and downs and sat in on business meetings. She learnt about the fake licences, kick-backs and other forms of petty corruption. Through Wu she also learnt about the psychology of the Chinese male boss. Arrive late for meetings, look bored, read the newspaper, say as little as possible and leave it to your subordinates. Chang&apos;s other friend was Min, who left her village in Hubei province at the age of 18. She too had daunting reversals and her own self-sustaining philosophy: &quot;Happiness makes a person shallow. It is only through suffering that we grow up.&quot; Min switched jobs several times to better her prospects or escape from bad bosses. After a year and a half she lost all her money and her mobile phone - the most essential possession for any migrant worker, with all the numbers of friends and job contacts. Sometimes a girl will signal her interest in a boy by offering to pay his mobile phone bill. Min met Chang &quot;to see what an American looks like&quot;, and took her home for Chinese new year. She brought as gifts for the family a down jacket, a box of traditional medicine whose principal ingredient is donkey hide, a pink purse made by her factory, Nestl\u00e9 milk powder, a box of cookies, two men&apos;s shirts, a plastic heart-shaped box of candy and 1,000 yuan (\u00a3100) folded into a tight square. During the visit she tried to &quot;civilise&quot; her family, buying a hot water dispenser and urging her dad to stop smoking. More traditionally, she paid her respects to her ancestors, visited the local temple and prayed for a good marriage. These are impressive stories of determination and courage but they also show the limits of this new kind of liberation for so many Chinese rural women. Alongside the ambition there is a sense of fatalism, and in three years in Dongguan, Chang never heard a single person express anything like a feminist sentiment. We don&apos;t know of course how her two friends are faring today in an environment which is much harder as the recession hits China&apos;s export trade. We leave Min doing well: on her next visit home she took a new TV, a DVD player and 5,000 yuan (\u00a3500) in cash. Wu, after another venture into direct sales (selling bee pollen and other &quot;health cures&quot;), had slid down again, earning less than a fifth of what she did before. But she still hoped to meet the right man, have a child and &quot;make a contribution to society&quot;. Chang&apos;s lively, perceptive and well-researched work has an additional strand, for she has woven into it the story of her own Chinese-American family. Her grandfather was a migrant to the US, although he went back to China and later died in murky circumstances in 1946 at the start of the civil war. I am not entirely sure whether this improves the book or is a distraction from what is already a rich and complex narrative. At any rate she tells the story sensitively and without over-dramatising her own role. Jan Wong is another Chinese-North American (her grandfather emigrated to Canada) journalist who has done excellent work reporting from China, and has a fascinating but more personal story to tell. In 1972, during the cultural revolution, Wong was one of a handful of foreign students in Beijing and, at the age of 19, already an ardent Maoist. One day a young Chinese student called Yin naively told Wong and another friend that she wanted to go to America and asked for their help.  Shocked at this betrayal of the Chinese &quot;workers and peasants&quot; who through their selfless labour were supporting Yin&apos;s studies, the two foreigners reported her to the college. Yin promptly disappeared. Wong went back home to Canada to organise a Maoist takeover of the McGill University Chinese Students Society. Wong has returned to Beijing hoping to find Yin and seek forgiveness - somehow she had suppressed the memory while working in China during the 1980s and 90s. She has another motive too: to try to understand &quot;why I threw myself so enthusiastically into the cultural revolution&quot;. That&apos;s a very good question for all of us who became so excited then by Mao&apos;s vision of a new socialist society. It takes 240 pages for Wong, with her husband and two sons in tow, to track down Yin during a hot summer in Beijing, and to hear her story. It turns out that Yin was sent to the countryside but - perhaps because her father was an army officer - did not suffer a worse fate. She returned to Beijing in the improving political climate after Mao Zedong&apos;s death and persuaded the university to exonerate her. Smartly deciding to study law, after graduation she made the even smarter decision to join the army as a lawyer. Then, in the early 90s, Yin joined the many thousands of upwardly mobile Chinese who &quot;took the plunge&quot; into business, selling wine and tobacco wholesale. She had a car by 1994. Five years later she finally visited the US - her brother was living there. Now Yin is married to a university professor, lives in a &quot;heritage home&quot; (once occupied by the writer Bing Xin) on the Beijing campus, has three other properties and a fluffy white cat. This is a very different sort of Chinese migration story - equally engrossing, but told with rather less sensitivity than Chang&apos;s account of the Dongguan workers. So many pages are spent describing the quest to find Yin that it becomes much less her tale, and much more that of the Wong family in Beijing. We learn at some length that Chinese toilets are greatly improved, that the Beijing traffic is dreadful, that the capital has a restaurant for every 400 people, that the massive silk market, famous for its counterfeit designer goods, has moved to an air-conditioned building, and that there is a water cooler in Citibank&apos;s ATM lobby. The central question as to why Wong (and many millions of Chinese) threw themselves into the cultural revolution with so much enthusiasm is never properly addressed. Wong is &quot;forgiven&quot; but she, and we, understand no more than before. Xiaomei Martell&apos;s gentle account of her childhood in China, Lion&apos;s Head, Four Happiness, is a reminder that politics was not everything (though she was only a young child during the revolution). Some of her most lyrical passages recollect the delights of food. Chinese rationing brought out the creative side because the cook had to plan so carefully: she can still remember the joy of getting two eggs for her birthday. But life was often more serious than that: Xiaomei&apos;s father died when she was four and her mother had to struggle. Neighbours kept at a distance, saying that to mix with a widow would bring bad luck; but kind uncles helped out, one of them making &quot;lion&apos;s head&quot; meatballs for supper - very finely chopped pork, with ginger, spring onion and garlic, mixed with egg and deep-fried until golden brown.  Xiaomei had good teachers at her school in Huhehot, the provincial capital of Inner Mongolia. She scored highly in the national exams and studied English in Beijing, where she fell in love with the works of Chaucer and Jane Eyre - as well as with Peking duck.

The group warned full year profits would not meet market expectations if trading conditions continued to be difficult. That seems a given, so its shares have plunged nearly 15%, down 84p to 480p. Welding business ESAB seems to be one of the main problem areas. Analysts at KBC Peel Hunt said:  &quot;Charter has released an unexpected trading statement this morning. Demand at ESAB in May has declined substantially across both consumables and standard cutting equipment compared with the January to April period. Assuming current conditions persist to year end, our EPS forecasts for 2009 will potentially come back by 30% to 45p.  &quot;At this level this would mean a 27% reduction to 2009 consensus. However, should end markets show an improvement towards the end of the year there is potential for this number to be exceeded. Applying a sector average PER multiple of 9.2 times to the new earnings estimate would result in a price of 415p versus last night&apos;s close of 564p.&quot;  Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 74.44 to 4479.23, albeit volumes are fairly thin, with the Tube strike not helping things. The FTSE 250 is up 88.43 points at 7780.08. Owen Ireland, sales broker at spread betters ODL Securities, said:  &quot;The FTSE has traded somewhat quietly four days in a row, and the positive news about TARP repayments in the US seems to have had little effect. That said, however, the markets have been steadily creeping up and investors aren&apos;t complaining about the rising value of their stocks.&quot;  Mining shares are benefiting from metal prices moving higher again on hopes for economic recovery and the recent dollar weakness - copper was up another 2% in Shanghai. Reports that China&apos;s industrial production rose by a better than expected 8.9% in May is also helping sentiment. So eight of the top risers in the FTSE 100 are miners, with Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation up 48.5p at 724p after it said the decline in the dollar could temporarily lift the price of its most important commodity, ferrochrome, although it was still cautious about the overall outlook. Its associate Kazakhmys climbed 35p to 730p, while BHP Billiton was 68p better at \u00a315.63, despite the latter announcing it had signed contracts for a significant amount of its metallurgical coal but at 58% less than in 2008. Details of new coal contracts by the miners have been eagerly awaited by sector followers. The continuing rise in the crude oil price has also pushed the market higher. BP is up 13p at 542.75p, adding around 10 points to the leading index, while Royal Dutch Shell A shares have risen 39p to \u00a317.10. Elsewhere Balfour Beatty, the engineering and construction group, added 1.25p to 345p.25p. A last minute spurt in the share price yesterday following a well timed investor day saw the company narrowly avoid the ignominy of dropping out of the FTSE 100 in the latest quarterly review, which should be confirmed later today. Commenting on the investor day, Panmure Gordon analyst Andy Brown said:  &quot;A series of divisional presentations and a site visit [to the Olympics Aquatics Centre] was a good reminder of the quality within Balfour Beatty. With plenty of opportunities and a drive towards greater integration of services, we reiterate our positive stance. &quot;While no update was made on current trading, the impact of a change in government was discussed. Initially spending plans do not change much as policy takes a while to implement. It is likely that there will be a shift towards power, water utility and transport infrastructure. The group is well positioned in these areas.&quot;  ", "tags": ["Business", "Charter", "Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation", "BHP Billiton", "Kazakhmys", "Balfour Beatty", "Royal Dutch Shell", "BP"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-10T07:55:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jun/13/western-province-v-lions-live", "sentences": ["&quot;We still lack a tough man who puts it about like Johnson used to,&quot; reckons John, who apparently belongs to the Shanghai Hairy Crabs RFC."], "title": "Western Province 23\u201326 Lions - as it happened!", "article": " Alan will be here from 1.45pm to see if the Lions can notch their fifth tour win from five. The latest news is that Mike Blair will not be taking his place on the replacements bench, due to a sprained ligament in his foot. Luckily he&apos;s not yet gone the way of Ryan Jones, perhaps the shortest tourist in Lions history. In the meantime, why not read up on the challenge Western Province are likely to provide today? We&apos;ve also got Phil Vickery&apos;s thoughts on leading the Lions out, and a look at the enormous amount of number-crunching that goes into preparing the Test side. Or you might like this provocative little number from Barry Glendenning about why the Lions should really be all-Irish ...  Preamble: The Lions&apos; Saturdays have so far proved a distinctly mixed bag. A scratchy win over the Royal XV was followed last weekend by a two-point victory over the Free State Cheetahs in a low-tempo affair. In both cases, the Lions did enough \u2013 but with the first Test now just seven days away, the stakes are a wee bit higher. Can Phil Vickery make a case for the tighthead spot? Will Andrew Sheridan take his chance to dominate the scrum? And can Riki Flutey and Ugo Monye force their way into the back-line contention ...? What are we thinking about the XV for the first Test, people? Your thoughts, and e-company, would be greatly appreciated.  Those teamsWestern Province: Pietersen, Chavhanga, Newman, Grant, Bobo, de Waal, Duvenage, Blaauw, Liebenberg, B. Harris, Muller, van Zyl, P. Louw, D. Vermeulen, Watson.Replacements: Shimange, Moller, Steenkamp, Jordaan, Hoffmann, Engelbrecht, AplonLions: Kearney, Bowe, Earls, Flutey, Monye, S. Jones, Ellis, Sheridan, Rees, Vickery, O&apos;Callaghan, Hines, Worsley, M. Williams, Powell.Replacements: Ford, Murray, Shaw, Croft, Hook, D&apos;Arcy, S. Williams Yes, and that is Shane Williams as reserve scrum-half ...  Weather report: It&apos;s looking a bit wet and wild at Newlands. Let&apos;s hope this doesn&apos;t descend into a bout of pinball kicking.  A few colourful ponchos in the crowd as well as plenty of red shirts. Looks like the Lions support has properly hit Cape Town for this one. By no means a full stadium, though. Here come the Lions, led by Vickery. Followed by the blue-and-white striped Western Provincials ...  1min: Stephen Jones kicks off, and Rob Kearney immediately recieves a return kick. The mark is called ... and Pietersen boots it straight back downfield.  3min: Nathan Hines hits the first ruck of the day, before Ugo Monye gets a run on the left. He loses it, then the ball is pinged back and forth two, three times. The Lions are eventually forced back into the far right corner, with Kearney&apos;s kick not making touch. The Lions then find themselves offside and concede a penalty ...  4min: Penalty, De Waal (Western Province 3\u20130 Lions) Good kick in the conditions, and the Provincials (as I shall be calling them) are ahead.  6min: Penalty, Jones (Western Province 3\u20133 Lions) The Provincials receive the kick, and immediately are offside themselves. Stephen Jones slots the 5,465th kick of the game thus far and we&apos;re square again.  8min: Province fullback, Pietersen, knocks on from a high ball, and we have the first scrum of the game. The Lions take things on, and we get a look at how the breakdown will be played ... Pietersen fumbles Jones&apos;s crossfield kick in the air, again, and it&apos;s scrum time once more.  9min: Penalty, Jones (Western Province 3\u20136 Lions) The scrum gets a bit messy twice, and Vickery then scores first blood by forcing his Provincials opposite number, Blaauw, to turn. Jones says thank you very much from the resultant pen.  12min: A bit more kicking results in a line-out. Bit ragged, this, so far anyway. Provincials No6 Louw concedes another penalty near the halfway line ... but Jones&apos;s kick doesn&apos;t have the legs.  14mins: Harry Ellis&apos;s box kick is returned with interest by De Waal; who then sees Kearney boom a kick from one end of the field to the other. Province line-out on the 22, which the South Africans win, before finding touch near halfway.  16mins: The Lions start ot put together a few phases in the centre of the field, but they don&apos;t get very far. Jones&apos;s kick is then dealt with quite well by Pietersen, and the men in red concede a penalt themselves, deep in Province territory.  18min: Drop goal, De Waal (Western Province 6\u20136 Lions) Province maul to within striking distance of the 22, before De Waal nails a precise drop goal to pull his side back level.  20min: The Lions certainly aren&apos;t having it all their way ... A quick kick-off briefly sees some haring up and down, before the Lions are awarded a scrum on halfway after a not-straight lineout. The Lions then lose on their own put-in, and Province make good ground from the resulting kick.  21min: Kearney catches beautifully before wriggling out of a tackle, only to see his good work undone by a forward pass to Joe Worsely. Scrum to WP ...  23min: Jones kicks poorly under pressure, and Province wing Chavhanga is free to bear down on Monye out on the left. He tries to kick, but lands it straight in Monye&apos;s midriff. From the lineout, WP then concede penalty and Kearney lands the ball in tough deep in the home side&apos;s territory.  25min: Hines is doing some good work in the loose, but after Kieth Earls goes into contact the Lions Martyn Williams is caught trying to play the ball on the floor.  27min: Drop goal, Pietersen (Western Province 9\u20136 Lions) The Lions are completely caught out by De Waal&apos;s crossfield kick, and as Chavhanga take the high ball, Monye practically slides through him feet first! Luckily the wing managed to hop over the worst of it, but the penalty is won anyway ... De Waal finds touch in the corner, and after the lineout is won and sent across the field, Pietersen drops another goal.  29mins: Try! Bowe (Western Province 9\u201311 Lions) Great try for the Lions! The Lions recycle possession on the left and Andy Powell goes on a bullocking run through the middle. He offloads to Williams whose quick pass sets the ball going through the hands towards Bowe on the right wing. Kearney&apos;s tep helped to make the space and Bowe smashed through two covering tackles to make the line.  31min: Near disaster for the Lions, after retaking the lead \u2013 Matthew Rees&apos;s lineout throw completely misses everyone, and the Provincials appear to have a pretty clear run from about 30 metres out. They&apos;re held up, though, and then Louw is penalised again for entering the ruck from the side.  33min: Worsley smashes up the centre \u2013 bosh! A nice step gives Riki Flutey some space, before the Lions recycle. The tourists are beginning to keep the ball well, now ...  34min: Try! Monye (Western Province 9\u201318 Lions) Brilliant break from that man again, Bowe, who comes off his wing, takes Jones&apos;s pass and splits the defence in midfield. He runs into Pietersen, but manage to loft the ball towards the onrushing Monye, who dives home to avoid the covering men. Jones adds the extras.  36min: The Lions will be purring (sorry) after that. Lovely score. WP concede another penalty in the middle of the park, but the Lions are then pinged for crossing. More bad news for the Provincials \u2013 Chavhanga is down, after taking Kearney&apos;s elbow in the face in a tackle.  38min: Fairly lenghty break there, while Chavhanga left the field ... Bowe looks like he&apos;s nailed himself a Test spot here. And Monye is giving a very good account of himself in the race for the other wing position. Lions win a Province lineout on their own 22, before Monye, Pietersen, and Kearney exchange kicks.  39min: The Lions win their lineout and then drive up the middle. Monye manages to get himself in all sorts of trouble on the floor, and the Lions are as good as turned over before conceding a penalty. They&apos;re then sent way back into their half by the kick...  40min: Penalty, De Waal (Western Province 12\u201318 Lions) Sheridan, this time, is caught at the bottom of a ruck, and it&apos;s another penalty for WP \u2013 the last act of the half.  Half time: Western Province 12\u201318 Lions A bit sloppy at times from the tourists, who have scintillated on a couple of occasions, but also given away a number of needless penalties. Bowe has been excellent with the ball in hand, and Stephen Jones has controlled play reasonably well \u2013 but the likes of Sheridan, Powell, Ellis maybe need to do a bit more. Thoughts?  How about sending out an all-Irish XV? That&apos;s the call being made by the in-no-way-partisan Barry Glendenning. I say they need a few English and Welsh lads in there to keep them honest ... Here&apos;s the interestingly named &apos;tutorsinchina&apos; with their angle from Beijing: &quot;Sheridan&apos;s decent enough in the tight but lacks the mobility of Jenkins. Powell has been disappointing throughout the tour.&quot;  41min: We start the second half as we began the first, as the sides kick possession repeatedly out of hand. Ping pong, ho hum.  43min: A clever break from the always fleet-footed Williams comes to nothing, but a quickly taken penalty from Ellis get the red shirts going forward again.  45min: Scrum near the halfway, and Powell takes the ball into contact \u2013 only for Sheridan and Vickery to flop over the ruck and give away a penalty for going in off the feet. De Waal has a crack from a good 45 metres, but can&apos;t make the posts and the gap remains six points.  47min: Penalty, De Waal (Western Province 15\u201318 Lions) They&apos;re not so lucky a couple of minutes later, though, as the Lions&apos; rush defence is penalised for being offside \u2013 though they appear not to have been \u2013 and De Waal again knocks it over.  49min: Superb defensive kick from De Waal, who launches a left-foot boot into the Lions 22. O&apos;Callaghan, who I haven&apos;t seen too much of so far, wins the lineout, but the Provincials collect the kick and attack crossfield. They eventually knock on, though, and the Lions will put into the scrum.  51mins: Monye breaks beautifully after a mistake from Bobo, and the men in red shirts rumble up to the Province 22. Lions pick and drive, with Powell again taking it on \u2013 only to lose the ball in contact. Pietersen then clears the decks.  54min: Bowe takes a crossfield kick from Jones, and then drives on another five metres at least while being held \u2013 the man is a beast! The Lions then recycle down the left, and Williams finds Jones inside, just metres from the line. The forwards sniff glory here ...  55min: Try! Williams (Western Province 15\u201323 Lions) It&apos;s try time for the tourists. The pack provide the platform in front of the line, before Williams just has a quick look then punches a hole around the fringes to score in the corner.  57min: We have a name for that mystery collective, &apos;tutorsinchina&apos;: John Woodferry. &quot;We still lack a tough man who puts it about like Johnson used to,&quot; reckons John, who apparently belongs to the Shanghai Hairy Crabs RFC. Interesting name \u2013 presumably you can only go sideways on the field?  60min: Penalty, De Waal (Western Province 18\u201323 Lions) Bit of messing about in midfield (I confess, I didn&apos;t really see it) and the locals have three more points to cheer. Still could go wrong for the Lions, here, especially if they keep giving up cheap pens.  62min: Try! Pietersen (Western Province 23\u201323 Lions) What did I say? Van Zyl, a second row, goes skipping through the field in broken play, and although he&apos;s held up down on the Lions&apos; left the Provincials spread it back the other way. A huge cut-out pass (from De Waal I think) then sends Pietersen clear to slide over in the corner.  66min: The momentum is very much with the home side now, and James Hook, just on the field for Kearney, slices his kick horribly. Luckily WP muck up in possession to give the Lions another shot at goal ... but not even Hook&apos;s big boot can make the posts from that distance. Maybe he was put off by the crowd &quot;giving him the bird&quot;, as Miles Harrison saw it.  68min: Jones is made to look foolish by a high ball, but Hook eventually makes the mark. A silly short lineout puts Monye in trouble and it&apos;s all a bit loose until the ref pings for a scrum to Province. Tom Croft enters the fray for Worsley.  70min: Williams kicks clear, evidently deciding the Lions should stop playing in their own 22. Simon Shaw is also on, as the Lions start to make better use of possession ...  71min: Crunch! Powell smashes over the Province right wing, after the Lions lost the ball when well set some 15 metres out. But it was an illegal hit from Powell, who had his arms down by his side when he bodychecked the man. No sin-binning, though, as it was deemed not to have been a shoulder charge.  73min: After losing such a good position, the Lions find themselves pinned back in their own 22 again. Monye tries to take a quick lineout to himself, but is whistled for the ball not going five metres. Looked a bit harsh, that. The Lions put the squeeze on, though, to win an important scrum.  75min: The Lions win a freekick, releasing the pressure somewhat. There&apos;s a good atmosphere at Newlands now, the crowd sensing this could go their way. Red scrum, and the Provincials collapse it ... penalty.  76min: Penalty, Hook (Western Province 23\u201326 Lions) Monster kick from Hook in these conditions, and the home fans are back in their seats.  78min: Western Province immediately break down the Lions&apos; left, but they are eventually forced infield, and Van Zyl takes a forward pass \u2013 scrum to the Lions, which again goes down. Jones lands the penalty kick in touch midway inside the WP half.  80min: Ross Ford, the Scotland hooker, fails to deliver straight into the lineout, handing a last-gasp scrum to WP. But Pietersen, as the horn goes for the end of 80 minutes, kicks the ball away rather than keep the move alive. Bowe sends it straight out, to seal the win ...  Full time: Western Province 23\u201326 Lions Well, that Hook kick turned out to be the clincher. That was a real test for McGeechan&apos;s side \u2013 but they&apos;ve come through it unscathed, just about. Five wins out of five now.  &quot;That was character-building,&quot; says Graham Rowntree ... I think that&apos;s the best way to look at such a win. Western Province showed up today, De Waal kicked well, and they kept on pressing. The only place they couldn&apos;t match the Lions was in the scrum, which will be a crucial battle ground next Saturday. Players that put their hands up? Bowe, Williams, Monye, Hook with that nerveless kick \u2013 all will be in the 22 to face South Africa, for my money, while Vickery and Powell worked hard as well. Jones didn&apos;t quite dictate play as immaculately as he&apos;d have liked, while Flutey and Earls didn&apos;t do enough to dislodge BOD or Roberts \u2013 barring injury \u2013 in the centres. Still questions for Geech, but nothing will be decided until after the final midweek match, apparently. Anyway, I&apos;m going to wrap things up ... You can read Robert Kitson&apos;s thoughts here.

She already has 26 and, she tells us, will never get bored of attempting more. The problem is that everyone else might. Isinbayeva has been embraced by the sport&apos;s governing body as the darling of the athletics world, the perfect poster girl, but, realistically, can watching records steadily climb, centimetre by centimetre, each earning their maker a large pay cheque really be what the sport needs? Does anyone care? And how many casual athletics fans could even name the twice-decorated sportswoman of the year? You have to wonder, is Isinbayeva the best advertisement for 21st-century athletics? The answer is no. But it&apos;s not Isinbayeva&apos;s fault \u2013 there is a real lack of alternative track and field icons. When Sergey Bubka set 35 world records in the men&apos;s pole vault he was adored by the public. But Bubka wasn&apos;t the only name out there, he was just one of many. The undisputed star of athletics right now is the triple world-record holder and Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt, but one man cannot be expected to carry the sport on his shoulders. Joining Isinbayeva in Berlin will be America&apos;s Sanya Richards \u2013 the fastest woman over 400m this century \u2013 but she will not face her biggest rivals today and that is one of the problems with the Golden League. Everybody is dying to see another Richards versus Christine Ohuruogu showdown, but it is likely that won&apos;t take place until the world championships in August. There is talk of a Bolt versus Tyson Gay versus Dwain Chambers sprint final at the Paris Golden League meet next month, the build-up to which would be enthralling, but one meet will not an athletics series make. This continuing problem of a dwindling number of head-to-head rivalries is at the crux of the issue. Isinbayeva&apos;s exploits would be far more meaningful if she had some genuine competition. When the American pole vaulter, Jennifer Stuczynski, last year claimed she was going to &quot;kick some Russian butt&quot;\u201a she may have offended Isinbayeva, but she delighted the rest of us. Stuczynski jumped 4.92m last year, the closest anyone got to Isinbayeva&apos;s 5.05m. With the stars and rivalries lacking, what then is the solution for track and field? Perhaps the time has come for the sport to ask itself some really tough questions. Not just about drugs scandals and a wavering credibility, but about how it will court its audience in this new century. The launch of the Diamond League next year \u2013 a global event, with central contracts for star athletes encouraging more head-to-head clashes \u2013 is a great step forward. But could the sport go further? Let&apos;s be honest, how many people beyond the anoraks really care who wins a medal outside of the Olympics and the world championships? The answer, most likely, is very few. If there are only a sprinkling of star athletes, if there are dozens of meaningless grands prix and super grands prix and a bloated bling-bling league that has no narrative, what will bring the crowds back to athletics stadiums? Small discussions in and around the sport by those advocating a bold change could provide the answer. What if the Diamond League was to be an international city versus city contest? Like the Super8 concept road-tested in Cardiff last week, but on a global scale with New York versus London, Shanghai versus Paris? Athletes without a home city could be drafted in, like an international Premier League, with transfer fees. Each city and stadium would have its own unique atmosphere, with distinct sets of fans. As in football every point would be crucial, so that British fans might be screaming their lungs out for pole-vaulter Kate Dennison to finish anywhere near the top 10 and gift London yet another vital team point. Purists will say that athletics is an individual sport, that the hysteria of football should be kept well away from the oldest competition in the world. But purists need to accept that their sport isn&apos;t looking so pure these days. There will still be Olympics and world championships, European championships and Commonwealth Games, World Indoors and European Indoors as individual medal opportunities. But doesn&apos;t the sport need something different? If Bolt&apos;s performances in Beijing \u2013 during and after the races \u2013 taught us anything, it&apos;s that the sport needs a new approach. Even the dinosaurs, like Jacques Rogge, have had to concede that.", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-13T17:21:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jun/14/stephen-daldry-billy-elliot-tonys", "sentences": ["They all have their values straight.&quot; Daldry has just directed a New York production of Hare&apos;s dual monologues, Berlin/Wall, and later this morning he&apos;s leaving for Tokyo, Melbourne and Shanghai to promote The Reader."], "title": "How Britain became the toast of Broadway", "article": "Last Monday morning at eight o&apos;clock I was hired to hijack Stephen Daldry. A scant few hours earlier, his Broadway musical Billy Elliot had won a record-breaking 10 Tony Awards, and even fewer hours earlier he returned from the party. He was presumably still asleep when I spoke to his PR, who said: &quot;I know he&apos;ll be delighted to see you, Gaby, it&apos;s just that, well ... he doesn&apos;t know that yet. But he&apos;s leaving for the airport at 10.30, so if you could just be outside his house, you could get in the car ...&quot; Call it what you will - charm, exhilaration, Stockholm syndrome - Daldry takes his kidnapping remarkably well. &quot;Come up, darling,&quot; he says over the intercom, and greets me cheerily in his sprawling, low-key New York apartment before taking me to a diner across the street. (His flight has been delayed; we now have time for breakfast.) Daldry is spindly and quick - to move, to think, to laugh. As we walk he pulls a crumpled packet from his pocket and lights up one of many &quot;last&quot; cigarettes. &quot;Today is a new day,&quot; he says purposefully. In the restaurant he orders an omelette and a coffee and throws his whole body on to the red vinyl seat. &quot;Ugh!&quot; he groans, &quot;I&apos;m dead!&quot;  He is recovering from a night he describes as one of the most stressful experiences of his life. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be glib about award ceremonies,&quot; Daldry says, &quot;but I&apos;m not their biggest fan.&quot; He was most nervous for the three teenage boys who alternate in the title role (David Alvarez, Trent Kowalik and Kiril Kulish), who ended up winning a unique joint Tony for best actor. Then they had a big party, and one thing Daldry loves about Billy Elliot are the parties that follow on its coat-tails. There are so many children in the cast that every party turns into &quot;sort of a Polish wedding&quot;. He left this one at 2am, whereupon he resisted the temptation to go to the party for Hair. &quot;Fewer kids at the Hair party,&quot; I suggest. He nods. &quot;A lot of smoking at the Hair party.&quot;  Daldry passes me his phone to show me a funny email he&apos;s just received from Richard Curtis. Curtis sends his congratulations, and ends with the suggestion that Daldry might consider running for prime minister next: &quot;There may be a vacancy.&quot; Daldry shakes his head and smiles. &quot;Sweetheart,&quot; he says. The New York Billy Elliot is a wonderful production full of incredible performers, but whatever its theatrical merits, it&apos;s hard to beat the magnificent weirdness of watching hundreds of Americans listening to an Elton John song called &quot;Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher&quot;, or the sheer surreal joy of seeing Arthur Scargill&apos;s face on Broadway.  Daldry finds this &quot;wickedly amusing&quot;, too. He&apos;s been working on Billy Elliot - first the film and then different incarnations of the musical - for 10 years now, and he still finds it very moving. &quot;It still takes me by surprise that it&apos;s a story about this little place in the north-east of England and what happened during the miners&apos; strike, and this little story about this town is a story on Broadway.&quot; The show was due to come to New York sooner but Daldry ended up working on The Reader, his most recent film, for two full years. &quot;As it happened,&quot; he says, &quot;the timing was good because suddenly the economy tanked and a story about a community fighting for its survival felt like it was topical.&quot; Though Daldry&apos;s success may be unique on Broadway - no British musical has ever won as many Tonys as this one did last week - it has been seen as proof of a boom in British theatre more generally. One might have expected the recession to hit theatres hard, yet people in the UK are going in droves this year; according to figures released 10 days ago by the Society of London Theatre, attendance at plays this past quarter is up by almost 30% on the same period last year. And the boom is not just about quantity: there&apos;s Helen Mirren as Ph\u00e8dre, Jude Law as Hamlet, Sam Mendes&apos;s Bridge Project at the Old Vic and Tom Stoppard&apos;s Arcadia at the Duke of York&apos;s. This has been hailed as an exceptional period for drama in Britain, the effects of which extend far beyond its shores: almost a third of all Tony nominations this year went to Brits. Whether this golden moment has come about despite or because of the political and economic apocalypse is up for debate. &quot;When times get bad, cinema becomes more conservative and the theatre becomes more imaginative,&quot; Daldry says. I ask him to give examples. &quot;Well, I don&apos;t want to go too far back,&quot; he replies, &quot;but Weimar Germany, turn of the century in England, turn of the century in Russia ... and I think that right now the theatre is more imaginative than it&apos;s been in a long time.&quot; Nevertheless, he thinks that on the whole the current confluence of British talent exists regardless of the recession. &quot;My honest answer is you can never underestimate the importance of inspired individuals who are running either organisations, buildings or companies,&quot; he says. &quot;And I think we&apos;re very lucky to have Nick Hytner at the National Theatre, Dominic [Cooke] at the Royal Court and Michael [Attenborough] at the Almeida. There are just a lot of really good, imaginative artistic directors out there at the moment, doing fantastic work.&quot; Beyond this happy coincidence, Daldry suggests, &quot;the reimagining of what a theatre audience is - that [executive director] Nick Starr has been doing for example at the National Theatre - is genuinely revolutionary.&quot; If all serious theatre is the theatre of dissent, he says, &quot;it&apos;s taken a decade or two to realise that that dissent has no coherence about it. The notion of dissent being essentially a liberal, left-wing thing is not true - dissent can be a whole variety of different things.&quot; So, where once there was a unified body of people who formed, say, a National Theatre audience, now, Daldry explains, &quot;people will come for individual pieces of work&quot;. Daldry ran the Gate Theatre in London for three years, then went on to run (and oversee a wholesale revival of) the Royal Court for six. &quot;The audience for one play at the Royal Court to the next play are not necessarily the same people at all,&quot; he goes on. &quot;Don&apos;t expect, require or yearn for a crossover - allow that diversity, celebrate the fact that you&apos;re going to get different people in on different nights for different shows, embrace it and allow that to be your policy. Once you get into that idea, it changes how you think about what you&apos;re programming, how you market it. It changes the age make-up of that audience, the race make-up of that audience.&quot; What this means is both that what&apos;s on offer is more varied and less risk-averse, and that a greater proportion of the populace has a stake in it. Theatre, Daldry asserts, is &quot;part of the national conversation - in a way that the movies are not&quot;. He interrupts himself to apologise for the generalisation before going on to say, &quot;Theatre is of the conscious mind, whereas movies are of the unconscious mind.&quot; That makes movies sound more interesting, I say.  &quot;Maybe they are,&quot; he replies. &quot;I&apos;m not pitching one against the other. I&apos;m just talking about the idea of being part of a national debate. In America, movies are more dominant because they&apos;re not so language-based, and this is a country with a cacophony of languages. In England we have, on the whole, one language and our theatre is more important.&quot; When Daldry made the film version of Billy Elliot nine years ago he became one of very few who have worked, with equal comfort and to parallel acclaim, on both stage and screen. One of the proudest achievements of his life remains, he says, the redevelopment of the Royal Court theatre, and his three movies - Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader, have totted up a good few Oscars and many nominations between them.  In both film and theatre he frequently works with David Hare (&quot;we are like a married couple,&quot; Daldry says). Hare praises Daldry&apos;s versatility. &quot;Theatre directors have always made terrible film directors,&quot; Hare told me recently. &quot;The two don&apos;t seem to mix - until this new generation of Stephen Daldry, Sam Mendes and John Crowley, who seem able to go from one to the other without strain. Best of all, having had success in cinema, none of them want to abandon theatre. Many of us in the theatre like them for that. They all have their values straight.&quot; Daldry has just directed a New York production of Hare&apos;s dual monologues, Berlin/Wall, and later this morning he&apos;s leaving for Tokyo, Melbourne and Shanghai to promote The Reader. Then he&apos;s embarking on another film - rumoured to be an adaptation of Michael Chabon&apos;s The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, though Daldry won&apos;t confirm this because &quot;the movie industry is so fragile at the moment that I don&apos;t think you actually know you&apos;re going to make a movie until you&apos;re making it&quot;. Meanwhile, he&apos;s going to take advantage of the long-haul flights to catch up on some sleep, organise his photo albums and give up smoking. He gets up to go outside. &quot;Do you mind?&quot; he says, &quot;I&apos;m going to smoke myself to death.&quot; He looks at his watch. &quot;I&apos;ve only got an hour.&quot; Daldry decided he wanted to be a director at the age of 15. His mum was a local amateur cabaret &quot;artiste&quot;, as he puts it, and he would go and watch her shows. That, combined with the influence of a schoolteacher, help from a woman who ran the local youth theatre, and a life-altering production of Hair, led him to believe directing was &quot;definitely the best fun&quot; you could have.  &quot;I never went to the cinema,&quot; he remembers. &quot;You know, film directors always have this Cinema Paradiso story about when they fell in love with the movies. I never had it. It was always theatre for me.&quot; Hair was the first professional show he saw, and &quot;me and my school friend thought it was the best thing ever. They were naked!&quot; he laughs, and adds: &quot;It was helped by the fact that I was in love with my friend.&quot; It was around that time, too, that Daldry&apos;s father died of cancer of the bladder. There was a long period when he was ill at home, the effect of which, Daldry says now, was that &quot;to me as a kid it allowed me a lot more freedom&quot;. Then he adds, unusually gnomically: &quot;More freedom than you might expect.&quot; Clever, coherent and unswervingly commercial as Daldry&apos;s artistic output has been, the style of his personal life is what you might call lived-in avant-garde. He doesn&apos;t come across as neurotic or even particularly complicated, but that may be because he has embraced so much of what anyone else might call complication. Daldry is a big advocate of communal living. In the flat I&apos;ve just visited, which appears to have endless rooms unfolding from a long, wonky corridor and where Ed Harris was filmed jumping out of the window in The Hours, Daldry lives with his wife Lucy Sexton (an American performance artist and his best friend of 20 years), their six year-old daughter Annabel, a younger girl named May-May they are bringing up as their own, one of May-May&apos;s biological parents, two mental healthcare workers, and an indeterminate number of semi-permanent inhabitants. &quot;It&apos;s literally an old-fashioned 60s commune,&quot; says Daldry, who plans to adopt some more kids now that he and Lucy are almost 50 (&quot;the more kids the merrier&quot;). His children go to the local state school, they don&apos;t have a nanny because they can all take the childcare in turns ... In short, it sounds idyllic. Just one thing: for 13 years Daldry was in a relationship with the set designer Ian MacNeil. How did he wind up married to a woman? How long have you and Lucy been married? I ask. &quot;About eight years,&quot; he says. Because you decided you wanted kids? &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, and pauses only slightly before adding, &quot;Well, you know, I mean: I&apos;m gay.&quot; There is no hedging with Daldry. He recently explained that yes, he does have sex with his wife, but if anyone asks, he always says he&apos;s gay because it&apos;s easier and people prefer it. &quot;They don&apos;t like the confusion,&quot; he shrugs. How does his wife feel about being married to a gay man? I ask. &quot;You&apos;d have to ask her,&quot; he says. &quot;But do you know what I honestly think? I think one of the great things about our marriage is, we&apos;re never going to get a divorce, and we don&apos;t have to worry about infidelity. To marry your best friend is one of the great gifts of life, and to have kids with your best friend is fantastic.&quot; The family travels frequently, shuttling between New York and a grand old home outside London. As for Daldry himself, he spends half his life in the air. I ask him if he minds flying, and his reply suggests a good deal about his casual exigency and the way he faces complexity with panache. He is, he confesses, a &quot;fussy&quot; flier. I expect him to say, perhaps, that he insists on a window seat, or that he always travels with a certain pair of talismanic socks. Oh no.  &quot;Seats aren&apos;t important,&quot; Daldry elaborates. &quot;It&apos;s airlines, and: how old is the aircraft? Is the aircraft leased or owned by the airline? I don&apos;t like leased aircraft because I know the maintenance contracts are subcontracted.  &quot;And sometimes, you know, like this trip, I sort of do want to see a picture of the aeroplane, to see whether I want to go on it. I have been on aeroplanes - I mean checked in, gone on and sat down, and gone: I don&apos;t like this. It doesn&apos;t feel right.&quot; I can&apos;t help laughing. That&apos;s happened to me before, too, but I call it a panic attack. To Daldry, it&apos;s just being a bit fussy. And with that, he jumps up from his seat. &quot;Now look,&quot; he says, dashing out of the door, &quot;I&apos;ve got to go to Tokyo!&quot;", "tags": ["Stephen Daldry", "Musicals", "Tony awards", "Theatre", "Broadway", "West End", "Stage", "Film", "Culture", "US news", "World news", "Relationships", "Family", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-13T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/jun/15/climate-change-children", "sentences": ["Al Gore famously depicted how a sea-level rise of 20ft (six metres) would almost completely flood Florida, New York, Holland, Bangladesh, and Shanghai, even though the United Nations says that such a thing will not even happen, estimating that sea levels will rise 20 times less than that."], "title": "Scared silly over climate change | Bj\u00f6rn Lomborg", "article": "The continuous presentation of scary stories about global warming in the popular media makes us unnecessarily frightened. Even worse, it terrifies our kids. Al Gore famously depicted how a sea-level rise of 20ft (six metres) would almost completely flood Florida, New York, Holland, Bangladesh, and Shanghai, even though the United Nations says that such a thing will not even happen, estimating that sea levels will rise 20 times less than that. When confronted with these exaggerations, some of us say that they are for a good cause, and surely there is no harm done if the result is that we focus even more on tackling climate change. A similar argument was used when George W Bush&apos;s administration overstated the terror threat from Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq. This argument is astonishingly wrong. Such exaggerations do plenty of harm. Worrying excessively about global warming means that we worry less about other things, where we could do so much more good. We focus, for example, on global warming&apos;s impact on malaria \u2013 which will be to put slightly more people at risk in 100 years \u2013 instead of tackling the half a billion people suffering from malaria today with prevention and treatment policies that are much cheaper and dramatically more effective than carbon reduction would be. Exaggeration also wears out the public&apos;s willingness to tackle global warming. If the planet is doomed, people wonder, why do anything? A record 54% of American voters now believe the news media make global warming appear worse than it really is. A majority of people now believe \u2013 incorrectly \u2013 that global warming is not even caused by humans. In the United Kingdom, 40% believe that global warming is exaggerated and 60% doubt that it is man-made. But the worst cost of exaggeration, I believe, is the unnecessary alarm that it causes \u2013 particularly among children. Recently, I discussed climate change with a group of Danish teenagers. One of them worried that global warming would cause the planet to &quot;explode&quot; \u2013 and all the others had similar fears. In the US, the ABC television network recently reported that psychologists are starting to see more neuroses in people anxious about climate change. An article in the Washington Post cited nine-year-old Alyssa, who cries about the possibility of mass animal extinctions from global warming. In her words: &quot;I don&apos;t like global warming because it kills animals, and I like animals.&quot; From a child who is yet to lose all her baby teeth: &quot;I worry about [global warming] because I don&apos;t want to die.&quot; The newspaper also reported that parents are searching for &quot;productive&quot; outlets for their eight-year-olds&apos; obsessions with dying polar bears. They might be better off educating them and letting them know that, contrary to common belief, the global polar bear population has doubled and perhaps even quadrupled over the past half-century, to about 22,000. Despite diminishing \u2013 and eventually disappearing \u2013 summer Arctic ice, polar bears will not become extinct. After all, in the first part of the current interglacial period, glaciers were almost entirely absent in the northern hemisphere, and the Arctic was probably ice-free for 1,000 years, yet polar bears are still with us. Another nine-year old showed the Washington Post his drawing of a global warming timeline. &quot;That&apos;s the Earth now,&quot; Alex says, pointing to a dark shape at the bottom. &quot;And then it&apos;s just starting to fade away.&quot; Looking up to make sure his mother is following along, he taps the end of the drawing: &quot;In 20 years, there&apos;s no oxygen.&quot; Then, to dramatise the point, he collapses, &quot;dead&quot;, to the floor. And these are not just two freak stories. In a new survey of 500 American pre-teens, it was found that one in three children, aged between six and 11, feared that the earth would not exist when they reach adulthood because of global warming and other environmental threats. An unbelievable one-third of our children believe that they don&apos;t have a future because of scary global warming stories. We see the same pattern in the United Kingdom, where a survey showed that half of young children aged between seven and 11 are anxious about the effects of global warming, often losing sleep because of their concern. This is grotesquely harmful. And let us be honest. This scare was intended. Children believe that global warming will destroy the planet before they grow up because adults are telling them that . When every prediction about global warming is scarier than the last one, and the scariest predictions \u2013 often not backed up by peer-reviewed science \u2013 get the most airtime, it is little wonder that children are worried. Nowhere is this deliberate fear mongering more obvious than in Al Gore&apos;s An Inconvenient Truth , a film that was marketed as &quot;by far the most terrifying film you will ever see&quot;. Take a look at the trailer for this movie on YouTube. Notice the imagery of chilling, larger-than-life forces evaporating our future. The commentary tells us that this film has &quot;shocked audiences everywhere&quot;, and that &quot;nothing is scarier&quot; than what Gore is about to tell us. Notice how the trailer even includes a nuclear explosion. The current debate about global warming is clearly harmful. I believe that it is time we demanded that the media stop scaring us and our kids silly. We deserve a more reasoned, more constructive, and less frightening dialogue.

Massive rallies in Tehran on Monday saw tens of thousands defy a ban to take to the streets to protest the declaring of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the winner of Friday&apos;s election over the more moderate Mir Hosein Mousavi. Today the Iranian regime seemed to be reversing its position which had been to declare Ahmadinejad the winner by a landslide. The aftermath of Monday&apos;s massive rallies, said to be the biggest since the Iranian revolution, was reported to have left seven people dead, with further rallies expected today as the challenge to the Iranian regime intensified. The powerful guardian council announced it was ready to hold a recount in areas disputed by opposition candidates. No detail of the scope of the recount and who would carry it out were available. The guardian council was reported to have said that a recount may lead to changes in the votes recorded for the candidates. Iran&apos;s post-election political unrest saw seven people killed in clashes between supporters of the defeated presidential candidate, Mousavi, and militiamen loyal to the hardline incumbent, Ahmadinejad, state radio reported this morning. According to the report, seven people were killed as shooting erupted after a group at the protest &quot;tried to attack a military location&quot; last night, in western Tehran. The first fatality came yesterday, when shots were fired at supporters of Mousavi, who had defied an official ban to march in their hundreds of thousands through the city centre to Azadi (Freedom) Square, demanding the result of last Friday&apos;s election be annulled. Basij militiamen linked to Iran&apos;s powerful Revolutionary Guard were said to be responsible for the shooting. Precise figures for the scale of the demonstration were not available, but some estimates suggested that more than 500,000 people were involved in the protest against the election &quot;theft&quot;. Such large-scale protest has not been seen in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution. &quot;Mousavi we support you! We will die but regain our votes,&quot; shouted supporters, many wearing the green of the moderate&apos;s election campaign and carrying signs with the message &quot;Where is my vote?&quot; Several vehicles were set alight in Tehran&apos;s streets and there were reports that protesters had taken to city rooftops at nightfall yesterday, shouting &quot;death to the dictator&quot;. Last night, protesters promised they would be back on the streets again today. The presence of huge crowds on the streets \u2013 and reports of other fatalities \u2013 appeared to dash earlier predictions that the unrest of the past three days would fade away. There was also a fresh twist when it was announced that Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had ordered the powerful guardian council to investigate claims of election fraud. Diplomatic sources said this was not a major shift, suggesting that Khamenei had merely warned Mousavi that he should proceed with his fraud complaints carefully, using only &quot;legal&quot; means available to him. Khamenei, who stands at the apex of Iran&apos;s complex political system, endorsed the election result on Saturday, dashing opposition hopes that he might be persuaded to order a recount or even annul the result. The guardian council, comprised of 12 senior clerics, said it would rule within 10 days on two official complaints it had received from Mousavi and Mohsen Rezaie, another election candidate. The council vets candidates and must formally approve results for the outcome to stand. The interior ministry, which announced the election result on Saturday, and the president, have rejected charges of fraud. Ahmadinejad compared protesters to football fans angry that their team had lost. Questions were asked though how 40m Iranian votes had been counted and the results announced so soon after the polls closed. Observers were stunned by the size of the Tehran rally, in defiance of a ban. And there was no sign of the anger diminishing: &quot;Many of my friends are in prison,&quot; said Saman Imani, a student beaten by police. &quot;Iran is becoming a dictatorship. Ahmadinejad is denying the Holocaust because he&apos;s as brutal as Hitler was.&quot; Ebrahim Yazdi, leader of the banned opposition Freedom Movement and a veteran of the revolution, warned that Ahmadinejad&apos;s attacks on his opponents had opened a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box&quot; which had led to a deep crisis within the regime. &quot;The result of such a crisis now is that the rift among the ... personalities of the revolution is getting deeper,&quot; he said. &quot;It is also between people and their government ... a rift between state and the nation. It is the biggest crisis since the revolution.&quot; Further reports last night spoke of people in Isfahan, Ahwaz, Zahedan, Yazd and Mashhad shouting &quot;Allahu Akbar [God is great]&quot; in support of the Tehran demonstrations. Mohammad Khatami, the reformist ex-president and a backer of Mousavi, attacked the government for banning the rally. Ahmadinejad initially delayed a visit to Russia but arrived in Yekaterinburg today, for talks at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Concerned governments around the globe were watching the situation closely. &quot;The implications are not yet clear,&quot; said David Miliband, the foreign secretary. The US president, Barack Obama, said he was &quot;deeply troubled&quot; by the post-election violence. &quot;It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran&apos;s leaders will be.

But today Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took time out from the turmoil engulfing Iran to drop into a regional summit in Russia, taking a break from the anti-government protests following Friday&apos;s disputed \u00adIranian presidential election. Smiling broadly, and looking remarkably untouched by the crisis back home, President Ahmadinejad met Russia&apos;s president, Dmitry Medvedev, in the city of Yekaterinburg. He pumped Medvedev&apos;s hand warmly. Medvedev was hosting a meeting of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), which represents a loose-knit group of central Asian nations, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, as well as China and Russia. Iran is one of several observers, together with India and Pakistan. While Iran&apos;s powerful guardian council announced a partial recount of Friday&apos;s disputed vote today, the SCO group formally congratulated Ahmadinejad on his landslide win. Their willingness to overlook apparently glaring irregularities in Friday&apos;s poll is hardly a surprise. None of the SCO member states can be described as proper democracies; central Asia&apos;s leaders, moreover, are all a bunch of super-presidents, apparently in the job for life. Should Ahmadinejad eventually be swept from power, his decision to fly to Yekaterinburg will probably go down in history as his Paris moment \u2013 recalling Margaret Thatcher&apos;s ill-fated decision in 1990 to leave Downing Street for a European summit while her Tory enemies, led by Michael Heseltine, plotted to remove her. Other leaders in the wrong place at the wrong time include Mikhail Gorbachev, then Soviet president, who was on holiday in the Crimea in August 1991 when a group of KGB hardliners led an unsuccessful coup attempt. After three days of house arrest he managed to fly back from his dacha. Ahmadinejad was supposed to have turned up to the summit yesterday but in the end his trip was brief and little more than symbolic: a few pleasantries with Medvedev, a quick round-table in Yekaterinburg&apos;s Hyatt hotel, and then off home. The Iranian president scrapped a press conference scheduled for later today. Before he went, Ahmadinejad did manage to utter a few words. Not on the chaos enveloping Iran, but on the United States \u2013 a failing empire, as he put it. &quot;America is in the grip of political and economic crisis,&quot; he told the SCO leaders, according to Reuters, adding: &quot;The United States and its allies are unable to deal with the crisis.&quot; The Kremlin, meanwhile, expressed satisfaction today that Ahmadinejad had made his first foreign trip to Russia. The two countries share a basic antipathy towards the US. &quot;The Iranian elections are the internal affair of Iran,&quot; the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, explained. &quot;We welcome the fact that elections took place, we welcome the new president on Russian soil and see it as symbolic that he made his first visit to Russia.

It&apos;s very important and valuable to the society that they are free.&quot; Chinese directors are required to have their scripts vetted in advance by the state censors, and those that attempt to circumvent this process face lengthy bans. In recent years, a number of acclaimed film-makers have been forced to shoot their pictures under the radar, with funding largely provided by European production houses. Director Lou Ye defied a five-year ban to screen his latest drama, Spring Fever, at last month&apos;s Cannes film festival. &quot;It shouldn&apos;t be possible to ban film-makers from making films, and I hope I am the last director to be banned,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;I hope young Chinese film-makers will be able to make films freely in the future.&quot; Despite his criticism, however, Boyle admitted that he would be happy to direct films in China himself. The experience of making the Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire had taught him the value of relying on a local cast and crew, he added. Boyle compared the process of shooting Slumdog Millionaire in Mumbai with the troubled history of his Thailand-set blockbuster, The Beach, back in 2000.

Rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns and increases in temperature, varying from locality to locality, all demand the implementation of adaptation measures to manage the increasing risk to our coastlines, cities, towns and villages, and the infrastructure serving them. We are fortunate in having the best climate modelling capacity in the world here in the UK. Now the question is whether or not the British public and their councillors, planners, civil servants and politicians have the appetite to provide sufficient funding to devise and implement long-range schemes of adaptation across the 23 river basins, 16 administrative regions and eight coastal regions covered by the report. Until the past 10 years, risk management against extreme events such as storms at sea, flash floods and hot dry summers, was framed in terms of the frequency of these events. The Thames Barrier, for example, was designed to withstand a 1-in-2,000 year event, thus preventing London from flooding through surges up or down the river except in the most extreme cases. But with a changing climate, this language has to be altered. What was a 1-in-2,000 year event in 1982, when the barrier first became operational, will now be a 1-in-1,000 year event later this century. The barrier will need to be retro-fitted to face our changing climate challenges. Our changing climate has a built in inertia of about 30 years. The increase in greenhouse gases brought about largely by our use of fossil fuels and by deforestation over the past 50 years will continue to cause global warming over the coming decades, even if we were to terminate all emissions now. But decisions to cut back on emissions now \u2013 globally, not just in the UK \u2013 will have a dramatic effect on impacts in the period beyond 2040. Here is the political challenge: to reduce the impacts for future generations we must de-fossilise our economies now. Have we, as a global civilisation, developed the capability and the appetite for joint action on a scale never previously achieved for the benefit not of ourselves but for future generations? In 2005, on behalf of the UK government, I signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government to enable members of our foresight flood and coastal defence team to work with Chinese engineers, scientists and economists on the flood risk to Shanghai and the Yangse basin area of China. The outcome, I believe, was a startling realisation for the Chinese that Shanghai, the jewel in the crown of China&apos;s economic miracle, was itself at risk of unmanageable levels of flooding before the end of the century, under a business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions. I believe that this may well have been a major factor in the clear change in the Chinese leadership&apos;s approach to the need for global action on emissions. Today, China is possibly the most progressive country in the world on taking action on climate change, including significant use of stimulus funds to green its development. The Chinese negotiating position for Copenhagen climate talks in December is now very critical of the laggards among the developed nations, particularly Japan and Canada. This report is therefore very welcome as a further step towards managing risks for the UK from the global warming impacts that are already in the pipeline. But this is one step in the process. We need to have a full-scale review and refinancing of our adaptation procedures. And on the international scale, we will have to redouble our efforts if there is to be any useful outcome from the Copenhagen negotiations. In the face of the global economic downturn and, specifically, the further major downturn in the Japanese economy and the emerging dependence of the Canadian economy on extracting oil from tar sands, do we have the global political appetite for action on the scale required? \u2022 Professor Sir David King is director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford.

I got some answers too. Here&apos;s one in full:  Ian meets monthly (sometimes fortnightly) with borough leaders and the Mayor. (e.g. Leaders of Hounslow, Brent and Southwark over the last couple of months). He does monthly borough visits to meet with the borough leader, cabinet and senior officials. (He went to Greenwich a couple of weeks ago and is due to visit Haringey next month). He attends quarterly meetings with the Minister for London and the Mayor. He has regular meetings with Peter Rogers from the LDA, Peter Hendy at TfL, Justine Greening (shadow Minister for London), Government Office for London and London Councils. In the last six months, he has also met with an official delegation from Shanghai, with a group of civil servants from Pakistan, the CEO of the UK India Business Council and a group of potential Russian investors to London. In the last month, Ian has spoken at an evening class for Birkbeck students on the Elected Members Development Course (several of whom are London councillors), at a Westminster Forum event and at an event for veterans at the RAF Museum in Hillingdon.  So there you are. I also double-checked, just in case, that the full summary of non-personal use expenses provided on Tuesday referred only to purchases made with that fateful corporate credit card. Information about all Clement&apos;s expenses claims are carried in reports to the quarterly meetings of the Audit Panel.  There have been four of those since Boris came to power, of which the last two - held on January 15th and April 2nd 2009 - considered reports into &quot;senior employees&apos; expenses&quot; under Boris and his team. Squint hard and you&apos;ll see that the first (pdf) shows that the Deputy Mayor for Government Relations had accrued a total of \u00a36,324 to October 2008 and the second (pdf) that he&apos;d run up a further \u00a33,193 from November 2008 to January 2009. His total to that point, \u00a39,460, was far greater than that of the senior staffer in second place (Munira Mirza on \u00a33,234). There&apos;s no breakdown of these figures, other than a footnote attached to the Clement column in each case explaining that the big numbers reflect the costs of far-off foreign visits: the ones to, respectively, Beijing for the 2008 Olympics and that upgraded one to New York with its seven hundred quid &quot;formal dinner&quot; that angered Mayor Johnson. Yet this bigger expenses picture, together with that description of his working live, throws into slightly sharper relief the extent to which Clement used his credit card to pay for dining out with fellow Tories, almost as if it were a modern day luncheon voucher. I still can&apos;t see why those transactions were accepted as legitimate.  Will Clement survive? There&apos;s pressure on him to go, but the one man who could remove him would rather not. Some say that&apos;s out of loyalty and a disposition to be lenient with friends. Others say Boris fears making enemies.

With a string of memorable hits behind them such as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, Harvey and Bob Weinstein have long been at the top of Hollywood&apos;s power elite. But the admired film moguls now appear to be standing on the brink of disaster as rumours swirl that their studio, the Weinstein Company, is teetering on the edge of financial collapse. Taking into account the company&apos;s large debts and a string of box-office flops, many Hollywood insiders believe the long era of the Weinstein brothers as a major force is over. Their hopes for survival appear to rest on an old and familiar face: director Quentin Tarantino. If his latest film, the controversial Inglourious Basterds, proves a mega-hit, it could save the company, just as his earlier smash, Pulp Fiction, saved the Weinsteins&apos; first firm, Miramax, from going over the edge in the 1990s.  &quot;They have always been the cats with nine lives. They have always walked right up to the brink and always managed to pull off a piece of magic,&quot; said Sharon Waxman, founder of movie news website The Wrap and author of a book about Hollywood mavericks, Rebels on the Backlot. &quot;Anything can happen,&quot; she added. But there appears to be no guarantee of survival for the men who helped shape modern movie-going. The Weinstein Company, which was behind last year&apos;s Oscar-winning film The Reader, has insisted it is still in good financial shape and is gearing up for a series of new releases. But a recent run of bad news surrounding the company has set Hollywood gossiping about its problems. Waxman said that the situation has become so acute other companies dealing with the studio are asking to be paid in advance. Certainly the firm is showing signs of trouble. At the end of last year it laid off 11% of its workforce. A month later an investment group, Fidelity, marked down the value of its shares in the company by 25%.  This month the Weinstein Company hired financial advisers Miller Buckfire, and the Weinsteins issued a statement saying the firm would &quot;help us navigate through this economic climate&quot;. But Miller Buckfire is primarily known for restructuring deeply troubled outfits. &quot;I think the company is in big trouble,&quot; said Waxman. The Weinsteins&apos; troubles are twofold. First, independent movie companies all over America are suffering a serious downturn as audiences snub their productions and major studios concentrate on churning out blockbusting franchise films. Second, the studio appears to have had a run of bad choices. The company was set up to produce genre films, such as horror flicks, that would earn enough money to finance quality pieces such as The Reader. But in recent years neither side of the business has scored many hits. &quot;The problem is nothing has worked. The lowbrow has not worked, the highbrow has not worked,&quot; said Waxman. Tongues are now wagging about Weinstein films having their release dates pushed back, because the company supposedly does not have the money to market them. All Good Things, with Ryan Gosling, has had its July release shelved. Shanghai, a thriller set in the 1940s, has been pushed back from September to October. Other projects are still sitting on the shelf.  When Harvey Weinstein put his Manhattan apartment up for sale recently it was portrayed in the New York tabloids as a desperate attempt to raise cash to market Tarantino&apos;s new second world war epic properly. Indeed, it is with Tarantino, and the upcoming Rob Zombie gore-fest, Halloween II, that many believe the company&apos;s hopes lie. Both films are being released in August and the Weinsteins desperately need them to score big at the box office. &quot;My sources say August could be the cruellest month for them. Everything depends on these two movies. Both are crucial to their survival,&quot; said Nikki Finke, a long-time Hollywood journalist who writes the Deadline Hollywood Daily website. If the Weinsteins do go under, they will leave a huge legacy. The brothers&apos; first company, Miramax, was the studio that revolutionised Hollywood. It almost single-handedly showed that small-scale quality films could not only reap Oscars but could also score millions of dollars at the box office.  Miramax was a roaring success, putting out films such as Pulp Fiction, The Piano, The Talented Mr Ripley and many others. &quot;The Weinsteins showed Hollywood you can stir up enormous interest and enormous profits from the right independent movies ... they made some glorious movies,&quot; said Finke.  They also triggered a wave of independent films and soon almost every major studio set up its own &quot;independent&quot; arm to try to replicate their success. Miramax itself was eventually bought by Disney, with the Weinsteins continuing to run it. That relationship ended in 2005 when the brothers left the firm they had founded and set up the Weinstein Company in a bid to re-create their success. But it has been harder to do the second time around.  Now some feel the era of the Weinsteins as major players with their own studio is already at an end. &quot;It is terribly sad. It would be a terrible loss to those who love film. The movie-going experience will be poorer if they are not around,&quot; said Waxman.", "tags": ["Harvey Weinstein", "Quentin Tarantino", "Film", "World news", "US news", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-20T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/jun/23/climate-change-ipcc", "sentences": ["Coral reefs, mega-deltas (which include cities like Shanghai, Kolkata, and Dhaka), and small island states are also extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels."], "title": "Where's the world's plan of action against climate change?| Rajendra Pachauri", "article": "Today, international action on climate change is urgent and essential. Indeed, there can no longer be any debate about the need to act, because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), of which I am chairman, has established climate change as an unequivocal reality beyond scientific doubt. For instance, changes are taking place in precipitation patterns, with a trend toward higher precipitation levels in the world&apos;s upper latitudes and lower precipitation in some sub-tropical and tropical regions, as well as in the Mediterranean area. The number of extreme precipitation events is also increasing \u2013 and are increasingly widespread. Moreover, the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, floods, and droughts are on the rise. This change in the amount and pattern of rainfall has serious implications for many economic activities, as well as for countries&apos; preparedness to handle emergencies such as large-scale coastal flooding or heavy snowfall. Some parts of the world are more vulnerable than others to these changes. The Arctic region, in particular, has been warming at twice the rate of the rest of the globe. Coral reefs, mega-deltas (which include cities like Shanghai, Kolkata, and Dhaka), and small island states are also extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels. Other negative effects of climate change include possible reductions in crop yields. In some African countries, for example, yields could decline by as much as 50% by 2020. Climate change would also lead to increased water stress, which by 2020 could affect 75-250 million people in Africa alone. Overall, temperature increases are projected to increase by the year 2100 within a range of 1.1C to 6.4C. In order to focus on this set of outcomes, the IPCC has come up with a best estimate at the lower end of this range of 1.8C, and 4C at the upper end. Even at the lower estimate, the consequences of climate change could be severe in several parts of the world, including an increase in water stress, serious effects on ecosystems and food security, and threats to life and property as a result of coastal flooding. There also may be serious direct consequences for human health if climate change is not checked, particularly increased morbidity and mortality as a result of heatwaves, floods, and droughts. Moreover, the distribution of some diseases would change, making human populations more vulnerable. Because the impact of climate change is global, it is essential that the world as a whole take specific measures to adapt. But it is already clear that the capacity of some communities to adapt will quickly be exceeded if climate change goes unmitigated. To help these most vulnerable communities, it is essential for the world to devise a plan of action to limit the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Several scenarios have been assessed by the IPCC, and one that would limit future temperature increase to between 2.0-2.4C would require that emissions peak no later than 2015, and decline thereafter. The rate of decline would then determine the extent to which the worst effects of climate change can be avoided. The IPCC also found that the cost of such a strict effort at mitigation would not exceed 3% of global GDP in 2030. Moreover, there are enormous co-benefits to mitigation: lower emissions of GHGs would be accompanied by lower air pollution and increased energy security, agricultural output, and employment. If these co-benefits were taken fully into account, that price tag of 3% of GDP in 2030 would be substantially lower, perhaps even negative. The world could actually enhance economic output and welfare by pursuing a path of mitigation. The need for international action, therefore, stems from two important observations arising out of the IPCC&apos;s work. First, if we do not mitigate emissions of GHGs, the negative effects of climate change will be difficult to reverse, implying great hardship and possibly danger to mankind and other species. Second, the benefits of mitigating emissions of GHGs are so overwhelming that this, combined with the prospect of the harm resulting from inaction, makes it imperative for the world to devise an international response and a plan of action. Given the challenge facing us, the magnitude and nature of which were clearly brought out by the IPCC, the Copenhagen conference later this year must produce a multi-lateral agreement that deals adequately with climate change.

When the financial crisis rolled out into a general economic downturn last year, the theory of &quot;decoupling&quot; raised its head, offering the prospect that China and other big emerging economies would be able to continue to grow in such a way as to keep the global economy afloat. That proved not to be the case as the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) felt the strain of sharply falling external demand and the tightening of capital flows. But now it is back, buoyed largely by the not-as-bad-as-we-feared data coming out of China. Goldman Sachs, which first coined the BRIC acronym, has forecast that China will romp back into double-digit growth in 2010 and that its health plan will be a big driver of world recovery in the coming years as Chinese people stop saving in case they fall ill and spend their money on consumer goods instead. Meanwhile, Brazil will, according to the optimists, soon pull out of a short-lived recession, India will benefit from a stronger post-election political situation and Russia will be all right as sunnier times send up oil and gas prices. All very comforting, on paper at least, and boosted by an improved forecast for 2009 growth from the World Bank. But, looking at the main source of the optimism, China, reality is rather less alluring. It would be amazing if the total of more than $1tn that has been thrown at the economy in fiscal and monetary stimulus this year does not produce a stronger growth figure for the second quarter than for the first. Given the slice of the immensely enlarged volume of bank loans that have gone into corporate treasuries and the stock market, it would be surprising if companies do not look healthier and the Shanghai exchange index does not retain the increase seen this year \u2013 helped by a ban on new share issues that is only now being lifted. Getting China out of the downturn was the prime political necessity for the Communist party and government this year. Though they do not face elections, party leader Hu Jintao and the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, cannot ignore public opinion, and have scrabbled since the end of last year to prop up threatened industries and preserve jobs. As a result of their largesse with abundant state funds, they may reach 8% growth by the end of 2009, bearing out Wen&apos;s statements about China&apos;s economic medicine being the right cure for the country and enabling Hu to claim that the benefits of one-party rule have been demonstrated. But that is only the start of the story. The trouble is that the medicine looks much like a short-term palliative and that the increased sway the party is assuming over the economy is a distinctly retrograde step. China needs to change its post-1978 model to reduce its dependence on fixed-asset investment, property and exports while significantly increasing domestic consumption, moving industry up the value chain and boosting services. (That forms the essential backdrop to the Cif debate about China&apos;s longer-term future, which seems at the moment to take too little account of economic, social and political realities.) The growing conservatism of Hu&apos;s regime and the emergence of consensus rule in the politburo may be welcomed as a switch away from the mad utopianism of the Mao era and the political stasis of the Deng years. All the indications are that the next leadership team of Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang will be equally constrained. The interplay of interest groups and factions also tempers authoritarian decision-making at the top. But the combination of economic reform is likely to move China on to a more cautious path. Thus, $580bn is being poured into a two-year infrastructure programme \u2013 which looks a lot until you examine the detail. Most of it would have been spent anyway \u2013 on earthquake relief in Sichuan or the much-need improvement of the railways and power grid. The central government is providing, at most, only a third of the funding: the rest comes from provincial governments and from loans. Since a lot of local authorities haven&apos;t got the cash, the bank taps have been turned on: loans in the first three months of this year were as big as for all 2008. The result, as regulators recognise, will be an increase in the bad loans that China spent much of the first part of this decade eradicating after a similar splurge during the Asian economic crisis at the turn of the century. The build-up of liquidity will fuel inflationary pressures with the prospect of stagflation next year. Tightening is probable in 2010, bringing with it the danger of business contraction that contributed to the present downturn as a result of the tougher monetary policy applied at the end of 2007 to check inflation. Nor are infrastructure projects the most efficient way of creating jobs and, by their nature, they have a limited life. While they were meant to soak up the huge inventories of steel, iron ore and cement build up last summer, the exuberant reaction of companies to the stimulus package means that these stockpiles are growing once more. The big excess capacity problem that bedevils China is not getting any better. Slack external demand still drags down exports and, as other Asian countries (notably Japan) suffer, the volume of semi-finished goods sent to the mainland for final assembly and sale on world markets will decline. Industrial policy is aiding big state firms, which will keep up employment levels in return and follow the leadership&apos;s directives; private enterprise and small and medium-sized enterprises are not getting much of a look-in. Tax breaks that seek to help export industries risk cushioning low-margin, labour-intensive firms that China should not longer need. Household and corporate savings have shot up, hindering the consumption boost China requires. Though the property market is recovering from the sharp decline last year, buyers are still cautious. While the health programme contains big figures, its first years will be spent on building clinics, not providing services that would help to reduce precautionary savings, and the amount budgeted looks puny when divided by 1.3 billion people over 12 years. The challenges to the regime abound. The rural revival the leadership wants will be sidelined so long as it continues to put land reform on the back burner for ideological reasons. A demographic black hole looms with a low retirement age, a fast-growing population of old people and a declining workforce due to the one-child policy. Wealth disparities, which Hu set out to reduce, have widened. Scores of mass protests occur each year \u2013 last weekend a crowd took over the middle of a town in central China after the mysterious death of a hotel chef and big squads of armed police had to be sent in to restore order. Meanwhile, in the political and legal spheres, any talk of relaxation of party control has gone out of the window \u2013 judicial reform has been rolled back and the crackdown on dissidents and the media continues apace. This does not mean that the collapse of China predicted 10 years ago is any more likely than the people&apos;s republic ruling the world, as Martin Jacques forecasts. There is no alternative to communist rule, which is why I think it will be able to get away without applying the enlightenment values Will Hutton believes it needs to espouse. What Hu and Wen are doing is quite understandable. They have to get through this year and hope for a better 2010 with a flourish of improved data in the coming months. Confidence, says the prime minister, is more valuable than gold. But the whole policy approach looks decidedly retrograde, more a matter of muddling through than of following a new policy prescription to move the Deng economic revolution forward. That can only hold the mainland back as it digs itself into the hole of its outdated model.", "tags": ["China", "Global recession", "Economic policy", "Economics", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-24T11:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/26/russia-africa-dmitry-medvedev", "sentences": ["It has to be considered in the context of Russia&apos;s final withdrawal from its negotiations to join the WTO, and the two summits that Medvedev hosted in Yekaterinburg \u2013 that of Bric countries and of the members of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation."], "title": "Russia's plans for Africa | Irina Filatova", "article": "Russia&apos;s president Dmitry Medvedev spent this week in Africa, visiting four countries, Egypt, Nigeria, Angola and Namibia. Russian official sources present the visit as purely economic, stressing that its goals are to assist Russian business and to develop mutually beneficial relations with African countries. The president is accompanied by a 400-strong business delegation, and a number of important economic agreements have been signed, particularly in the sphere of energy resources and nuclear power. This seems logical. A number of big Russian companies, such as Alrosa, Rusal, Renova, Rosneft and Gazprom are either involved in Africa or are seeking deals there, yet Russia&apos;s trade with the continent falls far behind that of China or India, let alone the US. Russia&apos;s own enormous energy resources are located in areas that are not easily accessible, sparsely populated and have extremely unfriendly climatic conditions \u2013 so developing them would be a much costlier business than developing the same resources in Africa. But historically, visits of Russia&apos;s (Soviet) heads of state to Africa always had a political agenda \u2013 for example the 1961 visit by Leonid Brezhnev to Ghana and Guinea and the 1977 visit of Nikolai Podgornyj to Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique. Each marked a new stage of Soviet involvement in Africa. Is Medvedev&apos;s visit completely different? Not quite. There is, indeed, a serious business element to it \u2013 much more serious, in fact, than during the African visit of Medvedev&apos;s predecessor Vladimir Putin three years ago. However, there is hardly any doubt that Medvedev&apos;s visit is at least as much about policy as it is about business \u2013 and perhaps much more so. It has to be considered in the context of Russia&apos;s final withdrawal from its negotiations to join the WTO, and the two summits that Medvedev hosted in Yekaterinburg \u2013 that of Bric countries and of the members of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. The US asked to participate as an observer, but the request was not granted. All these moves are a sign of a new stage of Russia&apos;s policy of disengagement with the west and of its leaving western financial and economic space. This tendency has been developing for a few years, but now it has obviously reached a new active phase. During his second term as president Putin often spoke of the need to transform the global economic order in order to diminish its dependence on the west. The Yekaterinburg summits sought to achieve exactly this. In effect, Medvedev&apos;s visit to Africa should be seen as a move to create a bloc of countries rich in energy resources. The existence of such a bloc, in Russia&apos;s thinking, would increase the political weight of its participants and thus change the balance of power and influence in the world. This may be more difficult to achieve than some Russian politicians think. Some African leaders may still be grateful to Russia for its assistance in their liberation struggles, but they need delivery, not just deals. Russia&apos;s record on this is not great. More importantly, however, the competition for the control of energy resources is exactly the field where Russia is bound to find itself in a head-on collision course not just with the west, but also with China, Russia&apos;s prize political ally in the new global order as it is seen from Moscow. It remains to be seen, how effective Russia&apos;s new engagement in Africa is going to be, and what effect it will have on its bigger goals.

His 1980s albums penetrated into places that lay beyond the reach of pop in the days of Elvis or the Beatles. Youth culture has fragmented since, while the internet has eaten into record sales, so the 65m copies of Thriller that he shifted will surely never be surpassed. Snatches of his songs are among the only English known by thousands globally, a reality that has much to do with the Jackson industry, but which also bears testimony to innate talent. However saccharine his work became, it is impossible to return to the 11-year-old Jackson&apos;s rendering of I Want You Back - a fearsomely complex song, which he made sound easy - without appreciating this. He touched fashion, dance and - most of all - he pioneered the age of the video, which made the look of pop as important as the sound. Music lovers may not thank him for that, but they should for adapting soul and Motown to the mainstream. Sure, soul singers such as James Brown and Aretha Franklin had made the big time before, but the pop industry thought of theirs as &quot;black music&quot;, as if their art could somehow be boiled down to their ethnicity. Chuck Berry was pioneering rock&apos;n&apos;roll before Elvis, but it took the white boy from Tennessee to grab middle America&apos;s attention. No one had to make the breakthrough for Jackson, however, and in the early days he might have been able to sing with credibility that &quot;it don&apos;t matter if you&apos;re black or white&quot;. By the time he sang those words, though, the surgical mauling of his features was well under way. Whatever the truth of his claim that the gradual whitening of his skin was down to the disease vitiligo, the thinned lips and reworked nose did not sit comfortably with his claim to being a proud African-American. Taken alone, the cruel irony of the man who made black music mainstream shunning his own black appearance might have said as much about the maladies of American society as the personal frailties of Jackson himself. But there were other problems besides, in particular the sense that his whole adult life was spent trying to live out the childhood he had never had the first time around - because he was performing by the age of six, and driven to work ever harder by a father who brandished a belt. So there was the fixation with Disney, with funfairs and then, of course, with children themselves. He was acquitted of various sexual abuse charges, but settled on others out of court, and the impression lingered that he sought to make up for the deficit he felt so keenly by stealing the childhoods of others. If he was bent out of shape young, the warping of Jackson continued into adulthood, as he proved unable to manage the success he had worked to achieve. Such were his legal fees and the lavish lifestyle he developed that even the hundreds of millions that allowed him to outbid Paul McCartney for the Beatles&apos; back catalogue proved insufficient. He all but lost his Neverland ranch, and withdrew - frequently hiding behind a mask on the occasions when he did appear in public, a shield against fame which only made him more newsworthy. Jackson&apos;s tale is a fable of the ultimate emptiness of victory, even in the supposed winner-takes-all world of showbiz. Bewildering stardom, comeback plans and rumours of prescription drugs all invite comparisons between the self-styled King of Pop, and the King of Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll, who died even younger, a generation before. These days the idea of a single pole position in pop - measured in No 1s or packed stadiums - has gone. The shame for Jackson is that this did not happen in time for him to be able to avoid living as a legend. Oxygen tents, private theme parks and the glove of God were his hallmark in life. In death, he will best be remembered as a song and dance man.", "tags": ["Michael Jackson", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Celebrity", "Life and style", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-26T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/01/guinness-to-arthur-campaign", "sentences": ["The toast is overheard by other bar members and continues out in to the street and then across continents to Africa and to other countries including Chile, Brazil and Shanghai."], "title": "Guinness to launch global 'To Arthur' 250th birthday campaign", "article": "     Guinness is to launch its first global TV advertising campaign \u2013 featuring an international raising of glasses to celebrate the 250th anniversary of arguably Ireland&apos;s most famous export. The multimillion-pound TV campaign, developed by the Publicis Groupe agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, celebrates 250 years since Arthur Guinness signed the 9,000-year lease on the brewer&apos;s famous St James&apos;s Gate premises in Dublin. Guinness&apos;s &quot;To Arthur&quot; campaign breaks across Ireland and Africa today with a staged roll-out in other international markets. The UK TV debut is planned for September. The 60-second TV ad opens in Dublin with two men raising a toast to Arthur Guinness. The toast is overheard by other bar members and continues out in to the street and then across continents to Africa and to other countries including Chile, Brazil and Shanghai. The ad ends with a voiceover saying: &quot;Join the worldwide celebration of a man named Arthur and a beer named Guinness.&quot; There are two versions of the global TV ad. A second version will see the &quot;To Arthur&quot; toast changing as it is passed on until people in the ad are toasting things such as parsnips and llamas. This ad will air in the UK and some Asian markets. The campaign is being launched as the forerunner to a series of global celebrations, dubbed &quot;Arthur&apos;s Day&quot;, planned for 24 September \u2013 the date of the brewer&apos;s 250th anniversary. Guinness is also launching a worldwide promotion that will include prizes such as a journey into space, in conjunction with Richard Branson&apos;s Virgin Galactic; a private gig with the Black Eyed Peas; and an underwater bar accessible only by submarine. The ad was directed through production company Partizan. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi won a pitch against Guinness&apos;s global roster Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, the agency behind famous ads such as Tipping Point and Surfer, to develop the 250th anniversary campaign in January last year. BBDO holds the Guinness account in the UK, Ireland and North America, while Saatchis has the business in Asia, Africa and South America. \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Although more diplomatic in his tones than some, during the cold war he was a classic, well-heeled Tory defender of the US-led anti-Soviet coalition when serving Margaret Thatcher as a Foreign Office minister (1979-81) and then at the Ministry of Defence (1981-83). His last post (1996-97) was as the sole Lords member of the intelligence and security committee. Thoroughly pro-American, Blaker urged closer British support for US intervention in Vietnam in the 1960s and supported their invasion of Grenada in 1983. He urged that &quot;the Soviet Union&apos;s bluff be called&quot; and backed the boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Born in Hong Kong, he was the son of Cedric Blaker, who had set up on his own as a China coast trader in 1919, and his New Zealand wife Louisa. At the age of seven, Peter was sent to a boarding prep school in Sussex, and then to Shrewsbury school. When France fell in 1940, his father wanted the family to be reunited in Hong Kong. Peter and his brother were crossing Canada to pick up a trans-Pacific liner when word came that Hong Kong&apos;s European families were to be evacuated, so he went to Toronto University and gained a first in classics. He joined up in 1942, and in 1944 he fought with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada from Normandy to the Dutch border, and was wounded. His family had meanwhile been interned by the Japanese in Hong Kong. After the war, Blaker went to New College, Oxford, where he roomed next to Tony Benn and became treasurer of the Oxford Liberals under Jeremy Thorpe. Between 1946 and 1952, he gained a degree in philosophy, politics and economics, a first-class degree in jurisprudence, qualified as a solicitor and was called to the bar at Lincoln&apos;s Inn. Nonetheless, in 1953 he joined the Foreign Office and married Jennifer, daughter of Sir Pierson Dixon, then the FO&apos;s deputy under-secretary. First they were sent to Phnom Penh, Cambodia (1955-57), then to Ottowa (1957-60). Blaker returned to London to specialise in the Middle East before being assigned as private secretary to the Tory Foreign Office minister Joseph Godber (1962-64). It was in that job that Blaker decided he would like to become a Tory MP, and he was fortunate to be chosen from 300 candidates to succeed Sir Roland Robinson in Blackpool South. After his election in 1964, Blaker made an impact with his maiden speech, warning the new Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, against his mock-Kennedy &quot;first 100 days&quot; of rushed foreign affairs decisions. In other ways, he established himself as a mainstream establishment Tory, voting against the abolition of hanging, though in favour of legalising homosexual practices. He voted for the pro-European Edward Heath as the new leader rather than the Eurosceptic Reginald Maudling during the contest to replace Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In 1967 he was elected to the executive of the 1922 Committee, the Conservative backbench organisation. His father Cecil had become chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), the South China Morning Post and the Hong Kong chamber of commerce, and the postwar success of his business enabled Peter to buy a 200-acre farm at Lindfield in West Sussex. Two years after the Tories&apos; return to office in 1970, he became an army under-secretary. He had just been shifted sideways to the Foreign Office when Labour won the February 1974 election. Although strongly anti-Soviet, Blaker remained moderate in domestic politics, insisting the Tories had to remain a centre party which could &quot;remain in power for 15 to 20 years&quot;. That opportunity came after Thatcher&apos;s victory in 1979, but his own ministerial career came to an end after the 1983 election, when he was knighted and became a privy counsellor. He retained his interest in foreign affairs on Commons committees and in organisations such as Chatham House (the Royal Institute of International Affairs), but decided not to contest the 1992 election. He is survived by Jennifer, his daughters Helena and Candida, and his son Adam. Tony Benn writes: Peter and I met at New College in 1946. He was a captain who had been severely wounded, and I was back from the RAF. We each became president of the Oxford Union, and our friendship lasted for 63 years. The following summer we enjoyed a holiday in Belgium, where he had fought. The country was devastated, and there were still German prisoners working the coal mine we visited. In 1949 he came to stay with Caroline and me, just after our wedding in Cincinnati, Ohio. I told the local paper that he was &quot;Sir Peter Blaker&quot;, anticipating his appearance in the honours list by 34 years, which led to them printing a glowing interview. Later we each asked the other to be godfather to our eldest sons. Peter will be remembered as a public servant of great distinction with a deep knowledge of defence, foreign policy and, above all, intelligence - interests which he retained in his contributions in the debates in the Lords. Politically, we could not have been further apart, and after he left the Commons we saw much less of each other. However, he, Jennifer and I did have a meal together not so long ago and greatly enjoyed going over old times. He was a dear friend, and I shall miss him. \u2022 Peter Allan Renshaw Blaker, Baron Blaker, diplomat, politician and farmer, born 4 October 1922; died 5 July 2009", "tags": ["Conservatives", "House of Lords", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-08T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/09/boris-eu-hedge-funds", "sentences": ["&quot;While it would be fair to say they did not promise there and then to up sticks and vanish, the key point is that if you do undermine their competitive advantage in the way that is proposed, then you simply hand that advantage not to Frankfurt or Paris or to any other European capital but to other cities around the world \u2013 to New York or Shanghai or wherever it happens to be.&quot; Johnson addressed a conference at the Royal Opera House in central London this morning on the challenges facing London&apos;s economic future."], "title": "Boris Johnson warns EU hedge funds law will 'strangle' City of London", "article": "Boris Johnson warned today that a draft European directive threatened to &quot;strangle&quot; the City of London by forcing hedge funds out of Europe.

Speaking ahead of a London conference on the economy, at which Johnson will speak alongside business secretary Lord Mandelson, the mayor panned the draft directive as &quot;badly thought out or thought out with malign intent&quot;. Johnson said the directive attacked an area that he said had not &quot;really been implicated&quot; in the recent financial meltdown. He told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme: &quot;It&apos;s a weird thing that in the fog of confusion and war the commission is proceeding to attack something in which London simply excels and was not responsible for recent catastrophe.&quot; He added: &quot;I don&apos;t say this in any particular spirit of perverse wanting to stick up for bankers, but it is very important that we defend an industry that generates huge sums of tax for this country.&quot; Johnson said the proposals were &quot;very dangerous&quot; both for the City, since 80% of hedge funds are located in London, and for Europe. He urged the European commission and other members around the table in the council of ministers &quot;to see sense&quot; over an issue that he said was profoundly against the interests of Europe. Johnson said hedge fund managers had warned him that not just London but Europe as a whole could lose out if the directive goes through. &quot;I met the other day with a collection of hedge funds,&quot; he said. &quot;While it would be fair to say they did not promise there and then to up sticks and vanish, the key point is that if you do undermine their competitive advantage in the way that is proposed, then you simply hand that advantage not to Frankfurt or Paris or to any other European capital but to other cities around the world \u2013 to New York or Shanghai or wherever it happens to be.&quot; Johnson addressed a conference at the Royal Opera House in central London this morning on the challenges facing London&apos;s economic future.

They were not yet sure what work they would find in their home town. A student from Kashgar said: &quot;I&apos;m afraid. [There&apos;s] so much violence - Chinese people and Uighur people just fighting. &quot;I want to go back to my home. My parents are also afraid for me.&quot; Chinese media reported yesterday that passengers were also crowding Urumqi airport and camping out in nearby hotels until they could buy a ticket. &quot;We fear Xinjiang is not safe anymore,&quot; one told China Daily. At least 156 people died and more than 1,000 were injured in violence in Urumqi on Sunday night, the authorities have said. Witnesses reported brutal attacks by Uighurs on Han Chinese, but the authorities have yet to disclose the identities or ethnicities of the victims. On Tuesday, a Han mob took to the streets armed with meat cleavers, shovels and other weapons and headed for a Uighur area in search of revenge, trashing stores and throwing rocks at a mosque. Paramilitary and riot police eventually dispersed them with teargas. Officials have not offered casualty numbers for that day. Several students at the bus station said they were going home because the university ended the academic year two weeks early following the unrest, but that they expected to return in the autumn. They were kept on campus until this morning. Many other travellers said they did not know if or when they would return to Urumqi. &quot;It&apos;s not safe now. When it&apos;s stable I hope I can come back,&quot; said a man who had come to work in the computer trade, but was now returning to his home town of Yili, in southern Xinjiang. The authorities posted up signs around the station and elsewhere in the city calling for the rioters to surrender themselves. The notices, in both Chinese and Uighur, said those who hid or protected criminals would also be punished. Around 1,400 people have already been arrested and officials have pledged to execute those who resorted to &quot;cruel means&quot;. A meeting of the country&apos;s top leaders last night was told that stability in the region was the &quot;most important and pressing task&quot;, according to a statement issued today. It was convened by President Hu Jintao, who cut short a trip to Italy for the G8 summit due to the violence. Many Han also remained frightened following the violence. Shi Guanzheng, a retired teacher originally from Shanghai, told Reuters he did not dare venture too far. &quot;Now both sides are so filled with emotion that the repercussions will last a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m scared about what will happen when the People&apos;s Armed Police have to leave. It&apos;s not about tomorrow or the next day. It&apos;s about next month or after. What then?&quot; There is still a huge security presence in the city and forces mounted another strength this afternoon with hundreds marching through the streets of the capital. However, the atmosphere was generally calmer, and in many areas Swat teams and paramilitary groups, though armed, were chatting and resting in the shade rather than standing on alert. Vegetable stalls were bustling with trade as shoppers stocked up after days without an opportunity to buy food. Some people said they had not dared to leave their houses. Buses could be seen on the streets again, although around 190 of them were destroyed by rioters on Sunday night. A government notice issued to the foreign media this afternoon said: &quot;Till now, the &apos;7.5 [July 5] Beating, Smashing, Grabbing and Firing Severe Violent Criminal Event&apos; has been under effective control. The normal social order, production and people&apos;s life have been restored and all the following-up measures have been conducted systematically.&quot; It promised that press officials would continue to help journalists cover events, but added: &quot;For your convenience and safety, the press centre would like to remind all the reporters that please follow the related Chinese regulations and rules voluntarily during your interview, do not conduct any activities contradicted to your professionalism.

For three decades the UN has overestimated the future population of the world&apos;s megacities: in 1975, the UN Population Fund forecast a 2000 population of 19.7 million for Kolkata (it was 13.1). Jakarta was to reach 16.9 million (it had 11.1). Mexico City 31.6 million (18.1), Cairo 16.4 million (10.4). The most recent UN/Habitat document, The Challenge of Slums in 2003, sees the doubling by 2030 of the 1 billion slum dwellers of today. Asia will have at least five cities with more than 20 million by 2025 \u2013 Jakarta, Dhaka, Karachi, Shanghai and Mumbai. Mike Davis, in his splendid polemic, Planet of Slums, evokes a plausibly scary world in which hundreds of millions of young urban unemployed, prey to fundamentalism \u2013 Muslim and Christian \u2013 are potential recruits in drug wars, mafias, and political militias. Given this apocalyptic consensus, it is surprising that the government of India&apos;s urban poverty report of 2009 (pdf) claims a mere 25% of people in cities live in slums, against The Challenge of Slums estimate of 60%. In June 2009, the president of India declared there would be a &quot;slum-free India&quot; in the next five years. It is natural for governments to play down slum populations, just as non-government organisations working with the urban poor will seek to inflate the figures to impress donors. But why such wide variations? Amitabh Kundu of Jawaharlal Nehru University, who edited the Indian report, says: &quot;The UN extrapolations, stories of unmanageable cities, are created by projections of the experience of the west, especially Britain in the 19th century, on to far greater populations of a wider world.&quot; He might have added that the nightmares that created panic in Victorian Britain also haunt the reports: slums as generators of disease, crime, drug addiction, poverty, unemployment and violence. Within their uncharted precincts no one knows what disaffection may be brewing, what alienated populations, increasingly segregated spatially from fortified communities of wealth, dreaming their malign dreams of theft, murder and mayhem. The word &quot;slum&quot; is itself problematic. It arose out of a specifically British experience of the early industrial era, and its first use dates from the second decade of the 19th century. Slums were usually jerry-built houses speculatively constructed around a mill, factory or mine, which soon became overcrowded, as they accommodated migrants from an impoverished rural hinterland. The word has associations inappropriate to poor urban settlements of Dhaka, Mumbai or Lagos. For one thing, slum formation in the early Victorian era was determined by mass manufacture, intensive concentrations of labour serving a single industry in a particular town or city. Such employment is absent from most present-day urban development. Concentrations of labour in the 19th-century also facilitated collective organisation. No such facility of association occurs in today&apos;s mushroom-cities, where livelihood has been fragmented. Work is dominated by an &quot;informal&quot; economy, labour is scattered and much of the manufacturing industry is sub-contracted to the so-called self-employed; a context in which self-exploitation, child and bonded labour flourish. There are other reasons why the word &quot;slum&quot; is a treacherous term. Since slums have all but disappeared in western cities, this suggests they are an inescapable phase of progress, and will, in due course, also vanish from Kinshasa, Cairo and Nairobi. Over the past 25 years, although habitations of appalling wretchedness remain in most major cities, many have stabilised, with or without help from government, international aid or NGOs. The greatest benefactors of the slums are those who live there. Slums are transformed into communities, which, if not yet adequately served by water, sanitation, healthcare and education, show significant improvement; although even when governments provide residents with security of tenure, their rights may be undermined by more urgent requirements of city authorities. Inhabitants risk eviction for infrastructure projects, airports, special economic zones, or because former slums have become expensive real estate. Amitabh Kundu, as a statistician, insists that the data collected in India has been rigorously compiled; but he concedes that the idea of slums is more elastic than that conceived by government. Figures for those living in &quot;unacceptable&quot; conditions have an &quot;element of subjectivity&quot;; certain aspects of slum life are simply not amenable to statistical measurement. In Kolkata, Focus, (Forum of Communities United in Service) has enumerated 4,000 separate poor communities in the city. The estimate of Md Alamgir, who was born and has spent his whole working life in the vast settlement of Tiljala, is that 70% of people in Kolkata live in overcrowded or dilapidated buildings. To project from the historical experience of the west is to present development as determinism. The slums of India challenge such thinking. Amitabh Kundu says migration into the largest urban areas has slowed over the past decade. Major metropolitan areas have sought to attract inward investment, provide &quot;habitable&quot; living spaces for the well-to-do. One consequence has been growing segmentation, protected developments on the one hand, and mass removal of the poor to what Amitabh Kundu calls &quot;degenerate peripheries&quot;. The courts, too, have become less sympathetic to those living on pavements, even though they include many of the 90 million or more domestic servants whose services are regarded as indispensable to the better-off. The urban poor do strive for self-improvement, but their efforts are often nullified by mass evictions to distant peripheries, from where they encircle the urban centres in threatening encampments. It is astonishing, given the attention they have received, how much remains unknown about the slums. Are they communities of poverty grappling heroically with disadvantage, or hotbeds of disaffection and antisocial behaviour? They are both. Whichever dominates in the coming years depends on a more realistic assessment of the actuality of slum life, both by the defenders of the poor and those who see them as a stain on the reputation of countries eager to modernise. The builders and creators of community already exist in the slums themselves. If they are supported and encouraged to get on with their lives in safety and security, the malign mythology of irresistible spreading sites of squalor, crime and immorality will simply fade away.", "tags": ["Population", "India", "Global development", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-12T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/13/starwatch-astronomy-venus-jupiter-neptune", "sentences": ["Shanghai lies just N of the mid-line of the path, so more people may witness this totality together than at any time in history."], "title": "Starwatch | Alan Pickup", "article": "Venus blazes in our eastern sky before dawn but it is Jupiter that rules much of our short July nights. Our chart shows its motion over the coming month as it moves westwards in NE Capricornus. The region covered, though, is only 5\u00b0 across making the chart of little help in locating Jupiter. In fact, the giant planet is hard to miss at magnitude -2.7 as it climbs from the ESE horizon at about 22.50 BST tonight to pass 20\u00b0 - 25\u00b0 high in the S at 04.00. It is outgunned only by the moon and by Venus which rises in the NE by 02.30 and lies above the star Aldebaran tomorrow. Where our chart is useful is in showing Jupiter&apos;s position in relation to Neptune. Both worlds lie close to the fifth magnitude star Mu Capricorni at present and although Mu should be easy to spot through binoculars, Neptune shines only at mag 7.8 and may require a small telescope. Neptune was known as the sun&apos;s outermost planet from its discovery in 1846 until Pluto was found in 1930, and it regained that status when Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Some 30 times as far from the sun as the Earth, it orbits every 165 years so it is almost exactly back to where it was when it was first spotted. Neptune is 17 times more massive than the Earth and, like Jupiter, consists largely of hydrogen and helium above a small rocky core. Water, ammonia and methane are also present, clouds of the latter lending the planet its distinctly bluish colour. It is 24,764km wide, yet only 2.3 arcsec wide through a telescope tonight. Compare these dimensions with the 71,492km and 47 arcsec of Jupiter and it is easy to see why Jupiter is more spectacular when viewed telescopically. The spectacle of the July daytime sky, though sadly not for Europe, is the total solar eclipse on 22 July. Dubbed the Eclipse of the Century, this has the longest spell of totality of any eclipse between 1991 and 2132. As the moon&apos;s dark umbral shadow races eastwards, its path stretches from India, across China and to the S of the Japanese mainland before striking out across the Pacific to end south of the equator and far to the S of Hawaii. Along that path, almost 260km wide at its widest, the sun&apos;s dazzling surface is hidden for up to 6 minutes 39 seconds. Shanghai lies just N of the mid-line of the path, so more people may witness this totality together than at any time in history. The extra-long eclipse occurs because the moon&apos;s disc is larger than usual in the sky at the same time as the sun appears smaller. Mid-eclipse comes six hours after the moon is at its closest to the Earth for this year, while the Earth was farthest from the Sun as recently as 4 July.", "tags": ["Astronomy", "Space", "Science", "Jupiter", "Venus"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-12T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/jul/13/osaka-japan-best-food-city", "sentences": ["Hanoi, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghai and most major Indian cities will all have their advocates, but is the refinement there?"], "title": "Osaka - the world's greatest food city", "article": "Simple question: what&apos;s the most greatest, most exciting, most dynamic food city in the world today, the culinary It City of our age?

At the risk of alerting John Crace, I have a new book out, &apos;Sushi and Beyond - What the Japanese Know About Food&apos;. So you&apos;d probably expect me to go with a Japanese city, but it&apos;s not Tokyo or Kyoto that I pine for on a daily basis, but Japan&apos;s often overlooked third city, Osaka.I originally went to Osaka on the recommendation of Anton Ego - the restaurant critic in Ratatouille (or rather Fran\u00e7ois Simon of Le Figaro, on whom, rumour has it, Ego was based). I interviewed him a few years back for one of those &apos;Can Paris Still Cut the Mustard?&apos; type pieces (answer - &apos;no&apos;) and was surprised to hear this most chauvinistic of food writers dismiss my adopted home city out of hand, and plump for Osaka instead. I booked my flight soon after and found a city fit to burst with incredible places to eat, from the dazzling depichika basement food halls (the greatest food shows on earth), to the exuberant restaurant quarter of Dotonbori, to the top end places like Kahala, a tiny, exclusive counter restaurant beloved of Tetsuya Wakada.  This is a city entirely at ease with its culinary identity but open to foreign influences (in this case, largely Korean), with several unique dishes, and a population possessed of an admirable gluttony for life. They even have a word for their insatiable gluttony, &apos;kuidaore&apos;, meaning &apos;eat until you burst / go bust&apos;. The city has an irresistible triumvirate of highly addictive, indigenous fast foods: okonomiyaki (thick, filled pancakes, made with yam flour batter, seafood, pork and kimchi); tako yaki (octopus doughnuts); and kushikatsu (deep fried, breaded skewers - invented at the restaurant Daruma, and much loved by Ferran Adri\u00e0, so the chef there told me), each of them slathered in a sweet, savoury, mahogany-coloured sauce. And let&apos;s not forget that kaiten sushi and instant ramen noodles were both invented in the city in the same epochal year (1958 - the latter are rather better than Pot Noodles, I should add).  This is also where you&apos;ll find the world&apos;s greatest (largest, most expensive, best equipped, toughest etc) cooking school, the Tsuji Culinary Institute; and a fish and produce market to rival Tsukiji.

He plays venal City banker Gus in the forthcoming BBC credit-crunch drama Freefall; after clinching some ghastly multi-billion sub-prime deal that ultimately leads to the debt-ridden immiseration of thousands, Gus retreats to the office loos to celebrate in the manner he deems most proper. Never has the cockney rhyming slang &quot;merchant banker&quot; been quite so luridly literalised. Harold Pinter described Gillen as &quot;dangerous&quot; after seeing him appear in a 2003 Broadway production of The Caretaker. As I walk towards him he wraps and unwraps his legs around each other repeatedly. His whole demeanour is an heroically uncomfortable array of twitches and leers. &quot;Having talked to a lot of those guys in banking, I realised that high finance is very exciting,&quot; he says as we settle down in the bar. &quot;It probably is terribly exciting to watch these deals fall into place.&quot; But surely not so terribly exciting as your character finds it? &quot;I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t want to get too wanky about it, but I can totally sympathise with him. There&apos;s pleasure in his life but there&apos;s nobody to share it with. Hence, you know, that scene.&quot; Gillen is no stranger to, you know, challenging scenes. A decade ago in Queer As Folk, he played Stuart, uttering the infamous lines: &quot;I&apos;m a faggot-ass, fudge-packing, shit-stabbing uphill gardener. I dine at the downstairs restaurant, I dance at the other end of the ballroom. I&apos;m Moses and the parting of the red cheeks . . . And I am not a pervert.&quot; (Gillen, a former Dublin altar boy, recalls watching some sex scenes from Queer As Folk with his mother. &quot;She said: &apos;How are they actually doing that?&apos; And my brother-in-law said: &apos;It&apos;s trick photography.&apos;&quot;) His performance was, like the series, widely praised. It was also typical of his astute preference for edgy small-screen dramas in recent years. Before Queer As Folk came the role of Gypo in Antonia Bird&apos;s Safe. At one point Gypo, a young homeless man, plunges a bottle into his chest in order to get free hospital treatment. More recently, Gillen starred as Baltimore mayor Tommy Carcetti in The Wire, a political reptile who unexpectedly grows a spine and a conscience while in office. How did Gillen get the role? &quot;They were casting the net wide getting actors who aren&apos;t recognised, so that&apos;s how us lot [he means the British and the Irish \u2013 Dominic West and Idris Elba also starred] got into it. It worked. I&apos;d just been in The Caretaker on Broadway, which meant nothing perhaps to TV audiences there, but showed I could do what they wanted. Also many American actors don&apos;t really want to blot their resum\u00e9s by appearing as scumbags. British actors \u2013 and Irish ones too if I&apos;m anything to go by \u2013 are less bothered about playing disgusting or even flawed people. They&apos;re often the most interesting roles, after all, but in the US they can be career death.&quot; Gillen&apos;s resum\u00e9, then, might not make much sense to an American actor: it teems with reptiles, chancers and scumbags (he was particularly effective as Mick, the swaggering, volatile pipe dreamer in The Caretaker, and as the slimy real-estate agent Richard Roma in a West End production of David Mamet&apos;s Glengarry Glen Ross). But he is proud of it. &quot;There&apos;s a common thread through Antonia Bird, Queer As Folk and The Wire,&quot; he says. &quot;I have been in control of what I&apos;ve been doing, of the career I&apos;ve put together.&quot; I&apos;m not sure how that control includes, say, his turn in the Jackie Chan-Owen Wilson buddy-chop-socky sequel Shanghai Knights, but let&apos;s not spoil the story. &quot;I&apos;ve made a point of trying not to play the same part, and of moving between theatre and film and TV. The idea is that by the time you come back you have been away for a year and people have forgotten you. If you like having time off, which I do, that&apos;s a good career strategy. Or at least, it&apos;s my strategy to keep my head together. I keep going back to Ireland to reboot. And then return, showing up as someone else.&quot; Freefall marks Gillen&apos;s return to British TV drama after too long away. &quot;When I was 19 growing up in Dublin, I wanted to come to London. I&apos;d done a lot of Irish stage work, which was great [in Billy Roche&apos;s A Handful of Stars, for instance], but London was a magnet . . . the place where the great TV dramas were made. It was like someone wanting to be in a rock&apos;n&apos;roll band now.&quot; His fellow Wire star Dominic West has said that the UK lacks quality contemporary drama on TV. He told Radio 4&apos;s Today programme recently: &quot;If you turn on American TV, there&apos;s a huge choice of nothing you want to see and, unfortunately, I think that&apos;s the case here now as well . . . we don&apos;t seem to be able to do contemporary stuff.&quot; Does Gillan agree? &quot;So-called reality TV, which dominates British channels, is destroying what made it cherishable to me and lots of others in the first place. I loved Alan Clarke, Ken Loach and Alan Bleasdale&apos;s work. In fact the first TV dramas I ever saw were Screen Twos produced by David Thompson, who also produced a lot of Alan Clarke. And now David produces Freefall, so it shows the kind of British TV drama I admired is not quite dead.&quot; That said, Gillen has now retreated to live in Ireland and works there as much as he can. &quot;I just wanted to get back home. I have always been travelling \u2013 New York and London. I want to give my kids a proper home.&quot; He lives with his wife Olivia O&apos;Flanagan in Kerry, and his children Berry and Joe attend a Gaelic-speaking school. &quot;They have been brought up in London but because they have Irish parents they seemed to have an Irish accent \u2013 then when they got out to Ireland they sounded like Oliver Twist.&quot; His latest project is to star in the first Hammer film of the 21st century. Called The Wake Wood, it doesn&apos;t sound like the camp Hammer horror that made films starring Ingrid Pitt and Peter Cushing so diverting 40 years ago. &quot;No, it&apos;s nothing like that. It&apos;s an Irish film written by a guy I know [writer-director David Keating]. It&apos;s the kind of horror film that I like \u2013 The Exorcist and The Wicker Man.&quot; The film tells the story of a couple, Patrick (Gillen) and Louise Daley (Eva Birthistle), whose nine-year-old daughter is killed in a dog attack. To escape their grief, they relocate to a remote rural community. The locals introduce the couple to a secret, pagan ritual that will allow them three more days with Alice before she is returned to the ground for ever. But what will they do when it&apos;s time for Alice to go back? Gillen sensibly won&apos;t divulge. Why did he take the role? &quot;I like to mix it up and do something completely different.&quot; It was, he says, &quot;literally the smell of the paint&quot; that made him become an actor in the first place: &quot;I was building and painting the sets. I didn&apos;t want to go to college or work in an office or have a nine-to-five job. I knew that quite clearly before I left school.&quot; He is 41 now, and in the intervening years says he &quot;definitely thought about stopping more than twice. I have been doing this since I was very young. If I could wind it back I would have another life \u2013 I would like that, but I would also like to have this life too. For me, now, working and children is it. There&apos;s nothing more to life&quot; \u2022 Freefall is on BBC2 tonight at 9pm.

The bad news is that if you are buying today, you have already missed out on a stunning rise in the Chinese stockmarket since March. Philip Ehrmann manages the top-performing \u00a3150m Jupiter China fund. Its record shows just how volatile investing in emerging markets can be. Launched three years ago, Jupiter China marched investors up the hill, enjoying a rise of 66% during 2007. Then it marched them back down again \u2013 falling by 45% in 2008. And now it&apos;s enjoying another march back up \u2013 with the fund up 35% so far this year. So is someone buying today coming in at the top? No, says Ehrmann, who reckons valuations are still extremely attractive, especially among small and midcap stocks. Consumer confidence is recovering, national debt remains low, government spending high, and even if demand in Europe and America flatlines, China will still motor along at 7-8% GDP growth, he says. At the height of the market in 2007, share valuations were 21-22 times earnings. Today, they are at 11-12, even after the recent rebound. It gives Ehrmann a lot of confidence that there&apos;s still a lot to go for. &quot;You are buying at these sorts of valuations when earnings growth is around 25%. A year ago, all the analysts were slashing forecasts, but now they are more comfortable about the prospects for earnings. We didn&apos;t think things were going to tank quite as much as they did, but we also thought Chinese growth would soon resume.&quot; Samantha Ho of Invesco Perpetual Hong Kong &amp; China fund shares his confidence. &quot;Chinese growth is sustainable. The countries that rely on exports for growth are in trouble. But China has found a way out as it has begun developing its huge internal consumption market, and not just in the coastal cities. Chinese banks are also in nothing like the shape of western banks. Their exposure to toxic assets is very low,&quot; she says. But JP Morgan, whose China fund is also in the top 10 performers over the past year, is more cautious. It says: &quot;Regional valuations are fair but no longer particularly cheap and the outlook for profits in 2010 remains uncertain. It would not come as a surprise to see a period of consolidation/range trading in markets over the summer. Our strategic preference is to stick with domestically oriented stocks in preference to exporters.&quot; Many economists also believe China&apos;s loose fiscal policy will soon have to be tightened to prevent another asset price bubble in sectors such as property. Stocks to pickSo what sort of stocks are the fund managers buying on behalf of small investors? At Jupiter, Ehrmann likes utility companies in particular, as they are beginning to reap the rewards of huge capital investment. He cites the natural gas companies, which, after spending billions connecting up Chinese consumers, are seeing the money flood in. The third-largest holding in his fund is XinAo Gas, which distributes in 60 cities across the mainland. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have more than doubled over the past year, from HK$5 to HK$12.78 (101p). Only last week he took part in a share placing for Beijing Enterprises Water. Ehrmann says water is seriously underpriced in China but reckons the growth in the stock will come from investments in water treatment as much as supply. He mostly looks for stocks outside the mega-caps that dominate the market. Ten companies make up 65% of the market&apos;s capitalisation, with five or six banks accounting for 45%. As a sector, he reckons banks will do &quot;OK,&quot; but it is underweight \u2013 although that still means that about 25% of the portfolio is in financials. A disconnect between domestic Chinese confidence and continuing western concerns is apparent in the fact that Shanghai-listed stocks have advanced far more than those in Hong Kong, where the market has been more volatile, says Ehrmann. But confidence is returning, valuations are far from being stretched, and the long-term story, he says, remains as strong as ever. \u2022 How to invest: Minimum in most China or Asia ex-Japan funds is around \u00a31,000 as a lump sum or \u00a350 a month.

Apparently, the city council has plans for the area \u2013 but nothing quite so grand as the government&apos;s latest initiative to approve four &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; ecotowns (Rackheath in Norfolk, Bordon-Whitehill in Hampshire, North West Bicester in Oxfordshire, and St Austell in Cornwall) whittled down from a list of 12. Although legal challenges from local opposition groups, allied with difficulties in attracting developers, have hindered progress, the government wants these four towns built by 2016 \u2013 and has offered \u00a360m over two years to kickstart the process by funding infrastructure, such as roads and sewers. Of course, on one level projects such as this, designed and planned to the highest carbon efficiency standards, could set an example for others to follow. Much of the building industry, which cannot see further than breeze block and brick, needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into the world of modern construction and high insulation. But why the obsession always with &quot;new&quot; towns? Why not, for instance, create eco-neighbourhoods in the inner-city alongside a suburban regeneration drive? Eco-suburbs should become as important a part of the new housing vocabulary as any ecotown. Why? Because around 80% of the population lives in suburbia, in its various forms. A timely collection of essays in a new book by the Smith Institute thinktank underlines the problems; namely, that we ignore suburban England at our peril. The aspiration of the semi, a detached house, or a bungalow on a city&apos;s outskirts still holds strong. But in many areas, property prices are collapsing \u2013 which means that those who want to move on are often trapped, awaiting some mythical upturn in the market. That won&apos;t come unless policymakers take the outer-city much more seriously. Somehow, in this recession, we need to rethink the housing offer. Sure we need many more homes, with council waiting lists rising, and millions priced out of the market with average house prices six times the average income, despite the current downturn. Building levels this year are likely to be the lowest since records began, despite the government&apos;s recent \u00a31.5bn boost to provide 20,000 more affordable homes. But where to put the new homes? Greenfields, and those much-vaunted recycled former industrial sites known as &quot;brownfield land&quot;, are not the only choice. Existing neighbourhoods, often areas with good public transport links, must be targeted for action. That means renewing some housing stock, and building new homes alongside where appropriate. Call them &quot;eco-communities&quot; if you like, and give them the same standing as any ecotown.", "tags": ["Communities", "Regeneration", "Housing", "Society", "Ecotowns", "Climate change", "Environment", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-23T09:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/24/ageing-population-china-shanghai-one-child-policy", "sentences": ["Officials in Shanghai are urging eligible couples to have two children amid concerns over an ageing population, the first time in decades that Chinese authorities are encouraging couples to conceive.", "More children would help relieve the problems caused by the growing number of elderly people in the city, said Zhang Meixin, a spokesman for the Shanghai population and family planning commission, adding that the basic population policy had not changed.", "&quot;Shanghai&apos;s over-60 population already exceeds 3 million, or 21.6% of registered residents,&quot; he told Reuters.", "&quot;That is already near the average figure of developed countries and is still rising quickly.&quot; Most newly married couples registered in Shanghai are both only children and so may have two children, Zhang said.", "The number of couples in Shanghai \u2013 China&apos;s most populous city \u2013 eligible to have two children rose from 4,600 in 2005 to 7,300 in 2008.", "&quot;If all couples have children according to the policy, it would definitely help relieve pressure in the long term.&quot; A recent survey released by the Shanghai population commission showed that more than half of the 4,800 respondents aged between 20 and 30 said they would like a second child if the one-child policy was eased."], "title": "Shanghai couples urged to have second child as Chinese population ages", "article": "Officials in Shanghai are urging eligible couples to have two children amid concerns over an ageing population, the first time in decades that Chinese authorities are encouraging couples to conceive.

Despite China&apos;s &quot;one-child&quot; policy, parents in urban areas are allowed to have two offspring if they are both only children. Rural couples are allowed a second child if their first is a girl. The number of couples in Shanghai \u2013 China&apos;s most populous city \u2013 eligible to have two children rose from 4,600 in 2005 to 7,300 in 2008. &quot;The current average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime is lower than one,&quot; Zhang said. &quot;If all couples have children according to the policy, it would definitely help relieve pressure in the long term.&quot; A recent survey released by the Shanghai population commission showed that more than half of the 4,800 respondents aged between 20 and 30 said they would like a second child if the one-child policy was eased. China started a family planning programme in the 1970s and began implementing the one-child-per-couple policy in 1979, aimed at curbing growth in the world&apos;s most populous nation. But success in curbing population growth has created its own headaches. The country will have just 1.6 working-age adults to support every person aged 60 and above, compared with 7.7 in 1975. A report by the US department of health and human services last month said the success of birth control measures means the growth of China&apos;s labour force may soon cease. In less than 10 years the size of the labour force is likely to start declining so that one of China&apos;s economic advantages may disappear. China&apos;s greying population has also given rise to concerns about whether family members will be available for older people&apos;s care. Without siblings to share the responsibility, young couples born since the one-child policy are often shouldering the task of taking care of four older parents. The children of today, if the current one-child policy continues to the time of their marriage in 20 years, could face the task of taking care of four parents and as many as eight grandparents. China&apos;s one-child policy has helped reduce the country&apos;s population by over 300 million and delayed the arrival of the 1.3-billion population mark by four years, officials said.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Population", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-24T10:57:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/24/shanghai-second-baby-family-planning", "sentences": ["Shanghai authorities are urging eligible couples to have a second baby amid concerns about a lack of young workers to support its ageing population.", "But in Shanghai, such families will now be actively encouraged to use what was previously seen as a privilege.", "&quot;We just hope more people can have a second child because for Shanghai, as a city which started family planning quite early, the process of ageing is fast,&quot; said Zhang Meixin of the Shanghai population and family planning commission.", "The problem is particularly acute in Shanghai.", "&quot;They should have done this earlier, and it should be promoted all over the country, not just in Shanghai.&quot; But he added that additional incentives \u2013 such as child benefit \u2013 may be necessary to persuade urbanites to have more babies.", "Errors were made during the editing process which meant the original headline, &apos;Shanghai ends one-child rule&apos;, as well as the standfirst and first two paragraphs were incorrect.", "Shanghai still follows the one-child rule but authorities are now actively encouraging couples exempt from this rule to have a second child."], "title": "Shanghai encourages second child for eligible couples", "article": "Shanghai authorities are urging eligible couples to have a second baby amid concerns about a lack of young workers to support its ageing population.

But in Shanghai, such families will now be actively encouraged to use what was previously seen as a privilege. &quot;We just hope more people can have a second child because for Shanghai, as a city which started family planning quite early, the process of ageing is fast,&quot; said Zhang Meixin of the Shanghai population and family planning commission. &quot;If eligible couples have two children, it might help to relieve the pressure.&quot; He said the authorities would not introduce new policies as such and stressed that the nationwide rules still stood. Officials have long feared that China cannot support a rising population \u2013 already over 1.3 billion and not expected to peak until it reaches 1.5 billion in about 2033. The change reflects the differing needs of China&apos;s modern cities and its countryside, and growing acknowledgement by officials that birth restrictions are a blunt tool with unwanted side-effects. Earlier this year the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies warned that China would have more than 438 million over-60s by 2050. Each would have just 1.6 working-age adults to support them, compared with 7.7 in 1975. The problem is particularly acute in Shanghai. Zhang said its fertility rate was 0.88 in 2008 \u2013 far below the national average of around 1.8 \u2013 and that which is needed simply to keep the population at the same level. Fertility rates tend to drop with economic development. China&apos;s is still above that of Britain and many European countries. Xia Xueluan, a professor of sociology at Peking University, said family planning had many advantages, but applauded the new policy. &quot;They should have done this earlier, and it should be promoted all over the country, not just in Shanghai.&quot; But he added that additional incentives \u2013 such as child benefit \u2013 may be necessary to persuade urbanites to have more babies. But while rural dwellers in particular chafe at restrictions and heavy-handed enforcement \u2013 which has included forced abortions \u2013 many in cities are used to the policy and seem largely indifferent, or like the idea of increasing their families but worry about the financial impact. Resentment is often sparked by the variation in the policing of the rules rather than the law per se \u2013 with many complaining that the rich are unaffected by fines that can cripple poorer households. &quot;I don&apos;t want a second child. One is enough, and I hope it is a girl, said expectant mother Yu Nan, 25. &quot;It is very nice to be the only child; you don&apos;t need to share or grab things from others. You can have all your parents&apos; attention. My parents have brothers and sisters, but when my grandparents died they quarrelled over the legacy. That was horrible and hurtful. Being the only child, you won&apos;t have those problems.&quot; \u2022 Additional research by Chen Shi \u2022 This article was amended on 25 July 2009.

The world could heave a sigh of relief that Beijing was going to throw its weight behind global economy, and the China bulls could predict that the last major state ruled by a Communist party was going to ride to the rescue of capitalism. The numbers appear to say it all: growth back to 7.1% after a hiccup around the turn of the year, with forecasts of 7.9% for the year as a whole. The Shanghai stock market index is booming. Property prices are recovering in major cities. There is no sign of the widespread labour unrest forecast at the start of 2009 as tens of millions of migrant workers lost their jobs. All in all, China is the hot investment tip. Though anybody with any sense would have got in months ago; confidence is being pumped up as fast as a weightlifter&apos;s muscles. Well, yes. The summer economic data were bound to be sunny. After all, Beijing has not only pumped the equivalent of $580bn into a fiscal package concentrated on infrastructure, but has opened the bank lending taps to a degree that is still barely grasped \u2013 so far this year around $1tn has poured out in cheap credit, triple the figure for the same period of 2008. Exporting firms, from steel to textiles, have been showered with tax rebates. Huge railway projects have been launched. Subsidies have poured out for farmers and to encourage rural households to buy household appliances. If all that did not produce an upturn in growth, something very strange would be happening. As a matter of fact, it is, but in a way that the bulls prefer to ignore. Despite the rise in GDP, tax receipts are falling (that can&apos;t be all the effect of the rebates). Despite the enormous injection of liquidity from bank loans, deflation has set in. Despite the availability of cheap money, household consumption is not growing much faster. Despite the reported increase in industrial production, imports, which go largely into goods finished on the mainland, are dropping. In other words, this is a peculiar kind of recovery. It is, in part, a political phenomenon. Having adopted economic expansion and material betterment as its main reasons for legitimacy after Mao was shunted off to the mausoleum, the current leadership of party chief Hu Jintao and prime minister Wen Jiabao has to come up with the goods to show that their movement alone is fitted to run the world&apos;s most populous nation. On top of that, as will be evident at the US-China strategic dialogue this week, they are not averse to pointing out that China&apos;s system of state controls enabled it to avoid the financial crisis that gripped the west and that its pain is the result of the crash in its external markets (not the whole story but true enough to pass muster). But it seems that, when it comes to the medium-term outlook, the leaders part company with the bulls who see 11% growth returning in 2010-11. Last week, the politburo took control of economic policy which had previously been left to the government. That is probably a sign of two linked factors \u2013 a feeling at the very top of the regime that the short-term measures undertaken by Wen and his ministers will not prove enough, and a realisation of the scale of the longer-term challenge facing China as it seeks to upgrade its industry and rebalance its economy for a more sustainable future. The politburo decided to continue with the stimulus remedy, a sign that it believes not enough have been done despite the 7.1% growth number. Monetary policy is to be &quot;moderately relaxed&quot;, which means keeping up the lending. Fear of escalating non-performing loans, a wash of liquidity and the build-up of inflationary pressures could count for little when a political leadership is committed to producing an 8% growth figure by the end of 2009. The snag is that the medicine China is applying, while producing spectacular short-term results, pushes the country in the wrong direction. Nearly 90% of the 7.1% growth came from government investments and guaranteed cheap loans. Spending on railways more than doubled. Expenditure on roads and irrigation were up 50%. Overall, fixed asset investment in everything from power grids to residential property increased by 34% year-on-year. Some of this is needed \u2013 the railways, for instance, were in dire need of new track and rolling stock, the power grid was in a bad way and poor irrigation is a major obstacle to making agriculture more efficient. But much of the money that has splurged out of the state banks this year has gone to state firms and provincial governments which are generally inefficient users of capital for both internal structural and political reasons. The hoped-for effect on employment has not been noticeable while small- and medium-sized firms, particularly in the private sector, complain that they are not getting much of the new cash. The state banking system has proved highly effective at getting money out of the door, but its ability to allocate capital efficiently is questionable, while anecdotal evidence tells of big state companies making a nice profit by lending on their cheap loans to smaller firms at jacked-up rates. The numbers in the months ahead will undoubtedly remain strong. The top leadership has to perform. But the underlying stability of the recovery remains uncertain. So does the volatility shown by tens of thousands of mass protests each year and episodes like the revolt of steel workers in the north-east who beat a new manager to death after he announced that a take-over he was implementing would lead to big job losses. China, to beat my old drum, is not going to collapse or implode. But it is at a crossroads in many senses. This includes the economy. The politicians in Beijing are, understandably, taking a short-term route and are being applauded for the inevitable results. But they are using old methods that do not offer the progress towards an economy which can really compete on terms others than those provided by cheap labour and capital. Hu Jintao laid out the road map in that direction 18 months ago, but that was before the knee-jerk reaction to the external events of 2009 and the internal imbalances which compounded their effect. As a result, looking beyond the end of this year, the outlook may not be quite what the bulls of 2009 anticipate. It&apos;s not exactly a false dawn, more a matter of sunny intervals in an uncertain sky.", "tags": ["China", "Economics", "Economic recovery", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-27T18:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jul/28/michael-carrick-manchester-united-china-charity", "sentences": ["Hangzhou is a modern, prosperous city to the west of Shanghai, and Manchester United are big news."], "title": "Manchester United's Michael Carrick finds football is helping to combat HIV in China | Tim Rich", "article": "This is a story about fame. Last year, three men fronted a video and poster campaign to try to reduce the spread of HIV in Sierra Leone. They told young men to wear a condom, to stop blaming others for not getting themselves tested, and to fight the stigma of the virus. The campaign achieved dramatic increases in the number of young men who knew how to practise safe sex and who were prepared to be tested. However, the people giving the advice were not doctors, politicians or even film stars, but footballers: Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra. &quot;It is weird,&quot; said Michael Carrick, who is talking to teenagers in Hangzhou about the stigma of Aids as part of a Unicef project. &quot;You see kids who maybe haven&apos;t got long to live, they meet you and they are happy for a while. It is hard for me to get my head round that. Why should they listen to me? I find that so strange.&quot; It is a good question. Hangzhou is a modern, prosperous city to the west of Shanghai, and Manchester United are big news. Their hotel, on the shores of a mountain-ringed lake that gives it the feel of an oriental Switzerland, was constantly under siege; the moment someone in club uniform appeared on the stairs, hundreds of voices in the lobby exploded. Some fans have slept on the pavement outside. However, Aids in China is largely a rural phenomenon, with the virus most rampant in Yunnan province, near the border with Burma, and it is spread by the drugs of the Golden Triangle not sex. And surely nobody in Yunnan knows who Michael Carrick or Dimitar Berbatov are? Yet the Unicef officials in the Hyatt Regency tell a story of one of their colleagues who travelled to a desperately remote village in Trinidad that she thought had been abandoned. Eventually, she found everyone in a single house, crammed around a television watching the European Cup final. Manchester United have never played in Sierra Leone and, given the poverty of the country, are unlikely ever to do so. Most people in Yunnan have television, and the name Manchester United will mean something to someone. &quot;Listen,&quot; said Berbatov, who, like Giggs, is a Unicef ambassador and supports five care homes in his native Bulgaria. &quot;If David Beckham says something about HIV, then people will remember it. People do listen to the famous and maybe that is a little bit strange. When I was a boy I listened to my parents because what better example can you get than your parents? But many of these kids don&apos;t have parents; they need someone else. &quot;But really, I don&apos;t think you should need to talk to a famous person before you can address the problems you face. You need to understand the problems before they hit you. We come here for a reason, that is to train and play football, but there is also this, and I would say it is equally important and when I look back on my life it might be more important.&quot; Nearly six out of every 10 Chinese teenagers have no idea how to protect themselves from Aids. Sixty-nine per cent believe it can be passed on through chopsticks. Unlike in South Africa, where Manchester United toured last summer, the Chinese government has been quick to recognise the spread of the virus. It is illegal to discriminate against HIV carriers, but to emphasise the point Berbatov and Carrick take part in a game where each teenager has a sticker placed on their forehead. They don&apos;t know what colour it is. If it&apos;s blue, everyone can shake hands with them. If it is yellow, you can go up to them but you can&apos;t shake their hands, although they can touch yours. If you have a red sticker, nobody goes near you. These 12- to 15-year-olds with red stickers quickly discover what it is like to be shunned. Games like these, along with books, educational materials and sports equipment, are packed in boxes and sent to 295 schools in the worst-affected areas. It is a two-year project and the \u00a3230,000 cost is borne by Manchester United. The box itself opens up into a sort of blackboard. It trades under the name of &quot;Skills for Life in a Box&quot;. It is easy to be cynical about footballers and these kinds of events. You think of Cristiano Ronaldo constantly looking at his watch during the club&apos;s media day to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich disaster; of Liverpool&apos;s reserve keeper Charles Itandje giggling through the service to mark the 20th anniversary of Hillsborough. It is a box to be ticked, like listening to Harry Enfield&apos;s creations, Smashie and Nicey, talking about &quot;charideee&quot;. But it matters to others. CLR James, the great writer on the Caribbean, asked: &quot;What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?&quot; It goes for football, too. &quot;But if it wasn&apos;t for football, I wouldn&apos;t have seen the things I have,&quot; Carrick reflected. &quot;I am being educated. I have been to hospices and orphanages and if not for football, then I would never have done. &quot;It makes a massive difference now that I have a child of my own. I went to South Africa last year. It was my first tour and when I got home I thought that having a child changes a lot. I come here, I see these children and what they are going through and look at it in a completely different light. &quot;It puts into perspective how lucky I am, how lucky my little girl is. She has things, she has her health. But it feels surreal being here, trying to help but you just keep thinking ...&quot; And he can&apos;t put it into words.

Announcing a 20% drop in first half profits and plans to axe its interim dividend, Rexam explained:  The Rights Issue will enable the Group to put in place a more conservative and resilient long term capital structure and significantly enhances the prospect of maintaining the Group&apos;s current investment grade credit rating. The issue will also put Rexam in a strong position from which to grow when markets recover. Since the Interim Management Statement in May it has become increasingly clear that the effect of the recession on Rexam&apos;s trading will be deeper and more prolonged than previously thought with cyclical, more premium parts of the business disproportionately impacted by the downturn.

Heading in the opposite direction were shares in Schroders as Morgan Stanley upped its stance on the fund management firm to overweight and increased its share price target to \u00a310.45 from 710p. Having had a good look at the firm&apos;s pipeline of business, Morgan Stanley reckons:  We believe consensus (20% below our numbers) underestimates the earnings upside risk from a strong rebound in high-margin retail flows.   The shares are up 45.5p at 954.5p. Elsewhere in the financials sector, Aviva picks up 13.5p to 345.5p after Deutsche Bank raised its target price to 401p from 385p and moved from a hold to a buy. Among the second line stocks, Inchcape has added 3p to 25.5p after first half results fromn the car dealer that were not as bad as the City had expected. Pretax profits were down 58% at \u00a365.4m, better than the \u00a344m to \u00a352m that had been forecast. Finally, there are shenanigans going on at Gulf Keystone Petroleum. Shares in the AIM-listed oil and gas company, which has exploration rights in Algeria and the Kurdistan area of Northern Iraq, have leapt almost 25% after an odd report from an Indian newswire about a bid valuing the company at $2.23bn from the state-owned Indian Oil Corporation. The report was picked up by the team at FTAlphaville this morning who, it is fair to say, took it with a truckload of salt. The figure would be staggering as Gulf Keystone is currently valued - even with the share price rise - at \u00a351m. The price might make a bit of sense if the figure should actually be read in rupees as that would work out at about \u00a330m but sources close to the company branded the report as rubbish.

So are \u20ac6,000 cotton beach dresses with Mongolian fur trim, Lamborghini Gallardos ostentatiously parked in front of harbourside cafes, and gin-palace superyachts. And you certainly won&apos;t see estate agents with details of stratospherically pricey villas in French, English and Russian. Yet the petite port of Marseillan on the Languedoc coast, kissing a Mediterranean lagoon east of B\u00e9ziers, has an undeniable frisson of St Tropez. Not the 2009 Riviera honeypot oozing bling, Eurotrash and traffic, but the serene isolated fishing village that first attracted artists and writers in the late 19th century, and then Bardot and the jet set in the 1950s. As elsewhere in the south of France, looks count. While no doppelg\u00e4nger, Marseillan shares strands of scenic DNA with its more famous C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur counterpart. The views across its dazzling turquoise water to the hillside rooftops of S\u00e8te are reminiscent of St Tropez&apos;s to Grimaud and Sainte-Maxime. And both ports have excellent beaches a couple of miles outside town - although you&apos;ve far less chance of being hit by a wayward Cristal cork around Marseillan plage. But it&apos;s the town&apos;s protected 17th-century harbour that really captures the early Riviera vibe. Low-level houses laced with wrought-iron balconies and splattered with flowers swaddle a channel that jiggles with small boats and yachts, with a left bank of thriving restaurants and cafes. And now unpretentious, laid-back Marseillan has some seriously stylish new accommodation. Port Rive Gauche, a converted 19th-century wine storehouse (booming trade spawned several monumental cellars near the waterfront) has two-bedroom apartments with balconies and terraces bombarded with startling lagoon light - all whites and light greys with beams, limed wood floors, and artfully distressed furniture. The little touches - antique dressmakers&apos; dummies to hang clothes, old trunks and French words spelt out in jumbo metallic letters - are guaranteed to induce serious interior design envy. So far, so chic. But despite its cool contemporary mood, the development - the only hotel near the harbour - seems to slip easily into Marseillan life. It doesn&apos;t appear to be an early sign of St Tropez-isation. The port&apos;s holiday trump card, after all, is its low-key charm and authentic local activities. It&apos;s why I found myself on the water with Jean-Claude Caumil. The ludicrously healthy retiree offers boat rides around the Bassin de Thau but shows little evidence of brutal commercialisation. His afternoon trip costs just \u20ac8pp. It wasn&apos;t just excellent value, it was also fascinating. The massive lagoon has more than 700 Mediterranean species, including seahorses, and lies at the eastern end of the Canal du Midi, the 240km Unesco world heritage site.  &quot;Do you want Toulouse or Bordeaux?&quot; asked Jean-Claude, as we dissected its narrow entrance, nosing alongside the abandoned rusting hull of the Louisdaky from Cape Town. Like the best travel, it&apos;s the quirky surprises, rather than the well-known show-stoppers, that hit the high notes. After passing the famed Les Gl\u00e9nans sailing club, where you ring a bell to summon a water taxi across the canal, Jean-Claude turned back to the lagoon, floored the engine and made a gesture of an elderly jockey whipping a horse. We bounced across the water like a giant Space Hopper, windsurfers and kitesurfers trailing in our wake. After anchoring we spear-fished - I&apos;ve never seen dorado laugh quite so brazenly - and snorkelled in crystal-clear shallows through waving seagrass. But best of all we simply slumped in the boat, let the sun freckle our faces and talked about nothing and everything. &quot;I miss some things about work,&quot; mused Jean-Claude, who swapped his nearby hotel for 364 days a year on the water. &quot;It had a nightclub and 250-cover restaurant. But it&apos;s good to relax.&quot; He appears to have it nailed. And he&apos;s not alone. Locals around Marseillan have turned relaxation, lubricated with decent wine and fresh seafood, into an art form. A few hours later, I&apos;m outside a white-walled, red-roofed chateau, sipping ros\u00e9 and shooting the breeze with the owners, Pierre and Marie-Christine Fabre de Roussac. Tucked into magnificent towering trees, Domaine de la Bellonette is one of several grand estates lining the Bassin&apos;s north shore. It offers spacious rooms with period furniture and a recently converted studio, but I was there for a major foodie treat: the local speciality of brazucade - a mussel barbecue with shellfish straight out of the briny. In the past, when fennel was as common as nettles, chefs would cover the crustaceans with a generous blanket of the herb, before torching it to generate a steaming scented infusion. When the shells popped, it was job done. Ours was a tad more mainstream, with mussels cooked over glowing wood embers, but it still beat the hell out of burgers and chicken wings, particularly with its side-serving of zingingly fresh oysters. &quot;I once made a 12m-long brazucade,&quot; said Pierre, casually opening another Languedoc wine. &quot;It was no particular occasion. Just pleasure. Why not? We are French. We are Gaulois.&quot; And also, Pierre, because you don&apos;t have to cook on a \u00a320 B&amp;Q barbie. But it&apos;s hard to disagree with the south-west joie de vivre. A couple more wines and I was seriously considering relocating.  Spend any time in Marseillan and you&apos;re constantly pulled back to the Bassin de Thau. All life swirls around, on or underneath it.  It&apos;s why I headed east along the shore to Medi Thau. It sounds like a centre for genetic engineering. And in a sense it is - only for oysters, not humans. The family firm has revolutionised the farming of the acclaimed crustaceans that thrive on the lagoon&apos;s phytoplankton.  Instead of submerging them on ropes for 12-18 months&apos; growth, Medi Thau&apos;s solar-powered lifts regularly pull them out of the briny for hours, sometimes days, at a time. The result is that, rather than endlessly gorging, the critters are forced to keep their mouths closed to retain water - a mini workout.  &quot;We make them suffer a little,&quot; says fisherman and directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Florent Tarbouriech, as we cruise around the sun-dappled oyster beds. &quot;It makes them stronger, more muscular, more fleshy.&quot; The tubby, plump beauties are up to 17% bigger than normal, fit to grace dining tables in Venice, Hong Kong and Shanghai. They also have a suntan: exposure to ultra-violet rays gives the shells a delicate rose blush and the name Pink Diamond. But in Marseillan you don&apos;t need to splash a second mortgage at a flash restaurant. Medi Thau serves the super-sized aphrodisiacs in its straw-roofed shack, dripping with geraniums and surrounded by old fishing nets. The Pink Diamonds are extraordinary, more like steaks than oysters, with an addictive sweet aftertaste.  &quot;All this just by lifting them out of the water,&quot; says Florent, as he prizes open another fleshy specimen. &quot;C&apos;est tr\u00e9s jolie. C&apos;est incroyable.&quot; Which, worryingly, is exactly what director Roger Vadim and many others said about Brigitte Bardot in her 1950s St Tropez heyday.  But while Pink Diamonds are another recent development guaranteed to put Marseillan on the food and travel map, the small port seems more than capable of retaining its unhurried, sunny, bling-free charm. \u2022 London to Montpelier by train costs from \u00a3109pp with Rail Europe (0844 8484064, raileurope.co.uk).

Last week China and Russia held their biggest joint military exercises ever - their battalions streaking across the plateaus and shimmering plains of Shenyang province. The exercises come as Moscow and Beijing prepare to celebrate an important moment in history: 60 years of diplomatic relations. After long periods of frigidity during the cold war, the two countries now claim to be enjoying an unprecedented strategic partnership. But the military manoeuvres - named Peace Operation 2009 - were not just about showing off, unleashing rockets at imaginary terrorist enemies or threatening the US. Instead their aim was to send an unambiguous message to the internal Muslim populations of China and Russia: no dissent will be tolerated.  Both countries are now facing simmering Muslim uprisings. In China&apos;s case, this comes from Uighurs whose revolt in the north-west province of Xinjiang this summer has been brutally suppressed. Russia, meanwhile, is facing an insurgency of its own in the north Caucasus republics of Ingushetia, Chechnya and Dagestan. But while China and Russia have much in common, including a mutual fear of separatism and Islamic radicalism, there are also signal differences. Despite last week&apos;s exercises, and a visit to Russia by Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, in June, politicians in Moscow harbour a deep-seated fear of China - in particular, of Chinese encroachment. Russian TV recently claimed that Beijing has drawn up a secret plan. According to this top-secret blueprint, China is determined to grab back Russia&apos;s remote, but vast, far east region. China&apos;s strategy includes persuading migrants to settle in Russia, marry local women and steal or co-opt local businesses. Russia&apos;s far east has always been the most strategically vulnerable part of Moscow&apos;s fissiparous imperium, in what is the world&apos;s biggest country. Some 6,100km (3,800 miles) and an eight-hour flight from Moscow, the far east is home to just 6.5 million Russian citizens. Next door, across the Amur river in north-eastern China, there are 107 million Chinese. Given this demographic imbalance, there is a primordial fear in the Russian imagination that China will eventually try to steal back the Europe-sized far east of Russia - a region rich in mineral resources, trees, coal and fish. The salmon alone are an attractive target. A quarter of the world&apos;s Pacific salmon spawn in the volcanic Kamchatka peninsula. According to the Russian TV scenario, Beijing is furtively plotting to undo the Russian colonisation of the Pacific coastal region, started in the 18th century by tsarist-era adventurers. The area&apos;s original inhabitants were Chinese. These early nomads eked out a meagre living while dodging the tigers that still haunt the Sikhote-Alin mountains. In reality, the relationship is far more fascinating than the baseless fears of Russia&apos;s nationalists. Over the past decade the number of Chinese migrants working in Russia&apos;s far east has actually fallen. In Moscow, the authorities have recently shut down the capital&apos;s enormous Cherkizovsky market, turfing thousands of Chinese out of a job. The huge bazaar was home to Chinese traders selling billions of dollars-worth of grey-sector goods. (According to China&apos;s Xinhua agency, losses from Wenzhou in Zhejiang province alone amount to more than $800m, after Russian police confiscated their stocks.) Some 150 Chinese workers have been deported since the market was closed on 29 June. Most experts believe China&apos;s own strategic goals do not include Russia&apos;s far east, or primitive territorial expansion. Instead Beijing&apos;s priorities lie elsewhere. They include development, reunification with Taiwan and internal stability, which experts suggest is more of a priority than ever following last month&apos;s ethnic riots against Han Chinese in Xinjiang. According to Dr Bobo Lo, a lecturer on Chinese-Russian relations at the Centre for European Reform, Beijing&apos;s real challenge to Moscow is rather different. He argues that the rise of China will lead to the &quot;steady marginalisation of Russia from regional and global decision-making&quot;. The Chinese do not want to invade Russia militarily because, he points out, they would lose. Any loss of influence would alarm the Kremlin, which still sees itself as a major global power. Over the past nine years, under president and then prime minister Vladimir Putin, Russia has worked hard to recover its superpower status. However, few outside Moscow doubt that the main challenge to the United States&apos;s increasingly wobbly global and economic hegemony comes not from Putin&apos;s Moscow but Hu&apos;s Beijing. In the meantime, informal ties between China and Russia are blossoming. During the summer, after the ice encrusting the Amur river melts, Russian tourists are now travelling to China from the attractive Russian town of Khabarovsk. Their destination is the gleaming Chinese town of Fuyuan, reached by whizzy hydrofoil. Yesterday, cruising down the Amur, Captain Alexander Udenka pointed out to the Observer the border between China and Russia. On the river&apos;s right bank is China and a series of low green mountains and Fuyuan&apos;s newly built high-rises. Out on the river, Chinese fishermen zip around in speedboats, looking for the giant but elusive Amur sturgeon. Over on the left bank, meanwhile, is Russia. Here there is no sign of human activity. The sandy bays are empty. There are not even any watchtowers - merely a shimmering green embankment of dense willows and oaks, as well as Manchurian nut trees and Japanese cherries - all apparently further evidence of far eastern Russia&apos;s lack of people. &quot;In 1969 China and Russia fought a war over one of these river islands,&quot; Udenka explains, sitting in his captain&apos;s cabin and steering in the middle of the river. &quot;It was a small war. Now there are good relations between Russia and China. We trust each other,&quot; he adds, in broken Chinese. A decade ago Fuyuan was little more than a village with a few pigs. Now it is a brash town, offering goods at less than half the price in Russia. During the season several hundred Russian tourists visit every day, staying on cheap two-day packages, and haggling with Chinese locals who have rapidly mastered the Russian language. Everything conceivable is on sale in Fuyuan - fur coats, computers, mobile telephones, socks and even sex toys. After trudging round the market for several hours, most Russians relax with a massage - \u00a310 for a one-hour session - or get their hair highlighted. Others tuck into a tasty lunch of silver carp caught from the Amur, or pork dumplings. &quot;I still haven&apos;t managed to get the hang of chopsticks,&quot; Igor, a 23-year-old Russian tourist confessed to the Observer. Igor showed off his new purchases - a black cowboy hat, a fake Armani jacket, Gillette Mach 3 razors and a bottle of aftershave with an English logo, &quot;Love Affairs&quot;. Asked why he had decided to buy a cowboy hat, Igor replied: &quot;I got drunk last night.&quot; Local Russians can travel to Fuyuan without a visa. This suits Fuyuan&apos;s traders, many of whom have moved from elsewhere in China. &quot;I like Russians. They are pretty indiscriminate. They just grab everything and run,&quot; said Li Wing, 42, who owns a sex shop in Fuyuan.  Fuyuan ends abruptly. Its shopping centre peters out at a decorative Chinese gate. From here, there is a stunning view of the Amur river and Russia. Up in the woods, among the pine trees, there is evidence of the environmental cost that new Chinese towns such as Fuyuan are wreaking: heaps of rubbish, plastic bags and a dead owl. The problem of what to do with the far east has long exercised Moscow&apos;s leadership. The Soviet Union offered generous subsidies to cajole workers and young couples to start a new life here. They got higher salaries, career opportunities, and flats. There were also cheap air fares back to European Russia. The incentives were needed given the region&apos;s harsh climate - scorching summers and freezing winters, with January temperatures regularly falling below -30C. However, after the demise of the Soviet Union this system collapsed. With a ticket to Moscow now costing \u00a3500 return, a new generation has grown up with weaker ties to the capital. Instead of visiting St Petersburg, local Russians are more likely to holiday in China - travelling by bus to the Chinese seaside resort of Dalian and other destinations in China&apos;s north east. Gradually, Asiatic Russians are getting to know their neighbours better. Farther down the Amur in the border town of Blagoveshchensk, Russian pensioners have even started buying up apartments on the Chinese side of the river. Other young Russians head west: since the early 1990s the Russian far east&apos;s population has plunged by 1.6 million. This exodus is a source of increasing worry for the Kremlin. On Friday Putin travelled to Khabarovsk to unveil a new pipeline stretching from the Russian island of Sakhalin to Khabarovsk and the far eastern port of Vladivostok. The pipeline will take gas to China, Japan and South Korea - part of an attempt to stimulate the region&apos;s economy. In June, during his trip to Russia, Hu attended a summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, and held talks in Moscow with Russia&apos;s president, Dmitry Medvedev, which led to the signing of a massive oil deal. He also had tea with Putin. The deal reinforced China&apos;s growing economic influence in the region, and its emergence as a competitor with Russia for Central Asia&apos;s energy reserves. In Khabarovsk, meanwhile, few locals see much prospect of the far east breaking away from Moscow. Despite improved understanding between China and Russia, the cultures remain too different. (The Chinese see the Russians as western-centric.) In Khabarovsk, the last stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway before Vladivostok, nobody is talking about secessionism. &quot;I&apos;ve had a few relationships with Russian girls. But I&apos;ll end up marrying a Chinese one,&quot; says Tsi Ke, 25, who has lived for the past decade in Khabarovsk. Tsi owns a thriving Chinese restaurant, where blonde Russian waitresses wear Chinese dresses. He adds: &quot;In China we believe a wife should stay at home a lot and be like a daughter to your own parents. For us, marriage isn&apos;t just between two people but between two families.&quot; A more pressing problem for the Kremlin is the growing estrangement between Russia&apos;s western and eastern halves. Resentment of Moscow and its far-away bureaucrats is rising. There have been grassroots protests in Khabarovsk and in Vladivostok after Moscow raised duties on second-hand Japanese cars late last year, killing off a major regional business. Anti-Kremlin protests are continuing. In May, Medvedev dropped into Khabarovsk for an EU-Russia summit. (The venue - 10 hours&apos; flight from Brussels - was apparently chosen by Russia to punish the EU&apos;s pampered representatives, several of whom fell asleep during sessions). Medvedev flatteringly described the far east as his &quot;favourite part&quot; of Russia, and expressed sympathy with students too broke to travel to Moscow. This summer the Kremlin has introduced a scheme offering some discounted tickets to the under-23s. It remains to be seen whether the scheme will make much difference. In reality, though, successive governments in Moscow have done little to develop the far east - making the region susceptible to civic unrest and discontent. The region suffers from &quot;long-term neglect by Moscow&quot; and &quot;appalling corruption and misgovernment at regional level&quot;, Bobo Lo says. Despite last week&apos;s show of unity during military manoeuvres, the relationship between Beijing and Moscow is no longer one of equals. Russia may see China as an important strategic counterweight to the US - with whom it is currently in conflict over a range of issues, including the planned US missile defence shield in central Europe. But the Chinese know that it is they, and not Putin&apos;s Russia, who are destined to become the world&apos;s newest superpower. And according to Bobo Lo, China is not interested in allowing strategic accommodation with Moscow to disrupt Beijing&apos;s more important partnership with Washington. &quot;Washington is still the world&apos;s only indispensable partner,&quot; he notes. A history of tension \u2022 Throughout much of the cold war Beijing and Moscow were enemies. However, Stalin had encouraged and financed Mao Zedong&apos;s revolution, recognising his communist People&apos;s Republic in October 1949. The partnership survived Stalin&apos;s death and the early Khrushchev years. \u2022 In 1959 the two countries squabbled over which should lead the world communist movement, an ideological quarrel replicated in communist parties across Asia and Africa. Khrushchev&apos;s decision to back down during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis also needled Mao. \u2022 In March 1969 tensions exploded when Russia and China fought a brief war in Russia&apos;s far east over the disputed Damansky island (now known as Zhenbao), close to Khabarovsk. \u2022 Tensions continued in the 1970s and 1980s, especially after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, pictured above. D\u00e9tente only became possible after the Soviet Union&apos;s demise. \u2022 Over the past two decades relations between Beijing and the Russian Federation have improved, with booming trade, agreement on many international issues, and growing military co-operation. In 2004 Russia settled a long-running border dispute with China, handing over Tarabarov island in the Amur river, and half of another large island, Bolshoy Ussuriysky. \u2022 China&apos;s rise, however, is likely to place increasing strain on the relationship.

While neighbouring China shows the first signs of relaxing its strict policy of one child per couple in the face of an ageing population, India is searching for a way of restricting the size of families as the battle over scarce resources grows. The country&apos;s population stands at 1.2 billion and is expected to reach 1.53 billion by 2050. But increasing pressure on resources means that there is barely enough water and food to go round. A pilot project in the Satara district of Maharashtra has proved a success and other states, including Delhi and Assam, are now considering cash incentives. Satara, funded by the National Rural Health Mission, is offering couples a reward of 5,000 rupees (\u00a362) if they delay having a child for two years (70 rupees a day is a good wage in rural areas). If they wait another year, they receive a further 2,500 rupees. The birthrate in the district rose from 16.5 births a thousand people in 2005 to 17 in 2007. The project initially attracted 977 couples, but that figure has risen to 2,366. Satara has about 25,000 marriages a year and 80% result in the birth of a child within the first year. Only 155 couples on the programme left to have children.  The first cheques are to be issued on 15 August, with officials cautiously optimistic about a reversal in the birthrate, which is now down to 16.1 per thousand. Couples who take part are also eligible for family planning advice and free condoms. In China, officials in Shanghai told couples last week that they could take advantage of exceptions to the one-child policy. The move was seen as a reaction to the city&apos;s ageing population and to years of population decline. Indian health officials could be forgiven for feeling envious of Shanghai. More than 27 million children are born in India every year and half the population is below the age of 25. If the projections are correct, India will overtake China to become the world&apos;s most populous nation by 2050. Vivek Baid, president of the Mission for Population Control, said India could no longer sustain large families, and that it should now aim for zero population growth. &quot;We feel that two children is a necessity, but that a third is not required. It is better for families to control their family size,&quot; he said. &quot;People&apos;s economic situation is not improved by having more children. It places them under greater financial pressure and exposes them to malnutrition and disease and they do not have the money for education and clothes.&quot; Indians have traditionally had large families, partly to counter the effects of high infant mortality. The preference for a male child has also led to large families as couples continue to try for a boy. Falling infant mortality rates and better education meant many families were now prepared to subscribe to the two-child solution, Baid said. But India was never likely to adopt the Chinese model. &quot;Family is a must among villagers. People would break the rule,&quot; he said. India&apos;s health minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, raised eyebrows last month when he suggested that the best way to curb population growth was to provide electricity to rural areas. Couples would spend more time watching television and less time making babies, he suggested. Although his suggestion was regarded as frivolous in some quarters, Azad was making a serious point. With the country&apos;s population increasing by 18 million a year, he urged couples to wait until they were 30 before they married and started a family. &quot;It&apos;s a great concern. We need to work at supersonic speed to curb population growth,&quot; he said.  Other politicians have taken a harder line. The health secretary of Karnataka state \u2013 population, 64 million \u2013 used the recent World Population Day to call for couples who had more than two children to be jailed. India&apos;s approach to population control has been anything but consistent. Jawaharlal Nehru, the country&apos;s first prime minister after independence, considered a large population to be an asset for a poor country. That did not stop India introducing its first family planning programme in 1952, promoting the use of contraceptives, although it was not a great success. By the 1970s, under Indira Gandhi, India was pursuing an aggressive policy of forced sterilisation for men with two children or more. That was abandoned when Gandhi was forced out and a more moderate policy of &quot;Hum do, hamare do&quot; (one family, two children) was adopted.", "tags": ["India", "China", "Family", "World news", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-01T23:06:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/aug/03/seafood-restaurants-europe", "sentences": ["I&apos;ve supped on hairy crabs in Shanghai (their claws are covered with golden filaments), gooseneck barnacles in Galicia (half a foot long, with blackened leathery shafts that end in a pink-and-white mosaic shelled tip, like alien phalluses), and shiokara in Tokyo (fermented squid entrails, an acquired taste)."], "title": "Seafood without a catch in Europe", "article": "When I travel, I eat seafood. A dinner hauled on to the pier by fishermen, simply served according to local traditions, and eaten within sight of the breakers, is the quickest way I know to escape from the tourist ghetto. For the length of a meal, at least, I feel like I am living like a local. In my career as a roaming piscivore, I&apos;ve enjoyed some fairly extreme cuisine. In Madrid, I once paid far too much for a bowl of baby eels, known as pibales or angulas (killed the traditional way, in an infusion of tobacco, fried in olive oil with chiles and garlic, and eaten with a wooden fork), and it&apos;s a meal I&apos;ve regretted ever since: eels should be allowed to grow to their full length of a metre and a half, not scooped up in their millions at the mouths of rivers when they&apos;re still the size of matchsticks. I&apos;ve supped on hairy crabs in Shanghai (their claws are covered with golden filaments), gooseneck barnacles in Galicia (half a foot long, with blackened leathery shafts that end in a pink-and-white mosaic shelled tip, like alien phalluses), and shiokara in Tokyo (fermented squid entrails, an acquired taste). And as much as I enjoyed eating the Proven\u00e7al dish friture - hundreds of anchovy-like sand-smelts, deep-fried and served like so many chips with eyes - there was something awesomely decadent, in a Goyaesque way, about consuming entire generations with every mouthful.  These days, I am far more selective about my fish eating. In 1988, we hit peak fish, with the worldwide catch topping 78 million tonnes; it has been in decline ever since. Stocks of species after species have crashed, from cod in the Atlantic to bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean. Gourmet trends have spelled doom for such formerly obscure species as Chilean sea bass, monkfish and orange roughy. Almost half the fish on our plates is now a product of aquaculture - and many farmed species, including shrimp and salmon, are fattened with the ground-up bodies of smaller, but perfectly edible species. These days, I tend to favour the middle and bottom of the oceanic food chain, eschewing tuna, swordfish, and salmon, and chewing on mackerel, sardines and herring. That doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;ve lost my sense of adventure. Many European cuisines make a virtue of using small, and delicious, species from the lower reaches of the food chain, so a trip to a seaside shack or a chippy need not induce guilt. Here&apos;s my address book for eight sustainable seafood eating experiences in Europe that, as the Michelin guides put it, valent le voyage. Chez Jacky, Riec-sur-Belon, France Raising oysters is a form of aquaculture that actually benefits the oceans: the bivalves feed on phytoplankton, which, if left to proliferate, can lead to harmful blooms of algae. For my money, the flat Belon oysters of Brittany - Ostrea edulis, Europe&apos;s original oyster, which once grew in vast natural banks from Denmark to Portugal - are the best. A great place to sample them is on the terrace of Chez Jacky, an oceanfront restaurant on the southern shore of Brittany. Savor a dozen slightly metallic Belons, with their hint of hazelnut, served on a bed of seaweed (never ice) over a pichet of muscadet, as you watch the sailboats passing at the mouth of the Belon River. \u2022 One dozen Belons: \u20ac23.

At L&apos;Epuisette, near the Vallon des Auffes, a former smugglers&apos; cove filled with fishermen&apos;s homes and good seafood restaurants, you can sup on a deluxe version of bouillabaisse (ask chef Guillaume Sorrieu to hold the &quot;lotte&quot;, or monkfish - one bouillabaisse ingredient that is overfished).

European chefs have been slower to catch on, but in Paris, at least one toqued head is paying attention: after years in three-star kitchens, Ga&apos;l Orieux is now trying to avoid such overfished, staples of French cuisine as sole, turbot, and cod. At his seventh-arrondissement restaurant Auguste (the name is a hommage to Escoffier, his inspiration), Orieux, who hails from Brittany, is one of the few Parisian chefs to experiment with lesser known, but more sustainably-fished species such as red drum, tacaud (poor cod), and black mullet.

North of Lisbon, the port of Peniche is famous for its fat, fleshy sardines, served barbecued within sight of the wooden fishing boats that net them just off the coast. Almost all of the seashore restaurants in Peniche grill sardines to perfection, but I favour the down-to-earth Mira Mar.

Though it&apos;s hardly shocking that his favourite British rock band is the Rolling Stones (followed by the Libertines), what&apos;s more surprising is that Jagger and his contemporaries truly believe a Chinese indie takeover of the world is imminent.  On the bill tonight are Brooklyn industrial-dub assassins These Are Powers, and though their presence is hungrily received by Chinese fans, the band are playing second fiddle to local talent. Carsick Cars and PK 14 represent two of China&apos;s most visercal new acts, taking their cues from Sonic Youth and the Fall respectively. Carsick Cars have even toured in support of their idols, after Sonic Youth&apos;s Thurston Moore declared his love for them. But these bands are not mere copyists. Instead, they absorb elements of Western culture only recently accessible to them, and turn them into something distinctly their own.  The atmosphere at Dream Factory is potent in a way that is rarely is at venues in Japan and Korea. When Carsick Cars play their biggest hit, Zhong Nan Hai, named after a Chinese tobacco brand, the crowd spend three and a half minutes pelting the band with cigarettes, which litter the stage by the end of it like confetti.  Meanwhile, the majority of PK 14&apos;s headline set is coordinated around the endless line of stage-invaders and crowd-surfers. Singing in Mandarin, PK 14&apos;s lyrics address conflicts of interest and questions of identity in modern China in a way that is oblique enough to avoid the ire of government censors.  As the largest city in China, and with a long history of international exchange (having once been a treaty port), Shanghai represents the entry point for foreign cultures, where they are assesed and then absorbed or rejected.

The Silk Road running westwards through China is studded with attractions: from Xi&apos;An, home to the Terracotta Army, to the precious Buddhist art in the caves at Dunhuang and the oasis of Turfan, close to the ancient ruins of Jiaohe and Gaochang. But, even by these standards, Kashgar - west of the vast Taklamakan desert and bounded on its other sides by the great Pamir, Tianshan and Kunlun mountain ranges - is a jewel. The old section is &quot;the best-preserved example of a traditional Islamic city to be found anywhere in Central Asia,&quot; the architect and historian George Michell wrote last year. Filmgoers may recognise it from The Kite Runner, where it doubles as Kabul. To walk through the narrow lanes of the old city is to walk into living history.

Crop-haired girls in bright frocks and mismatching plastic sandals giggle and shove as they see strangers; then sing and dance for their audience. The real pleasure here is to wander and watch.  Now these streets are being destroyed under a \u00a3300m government project to transform the city. The overhaul will see up to 85% of the area razed and many residents relocated. The demolition crews have already moved in. &quot;It&apos;s a bad thing,&quot; a young girl tells me on a wasteland. &quot;They&apos;re making us all go a long way, to high rises.&quot; This is the last chance to experience this incredible world; tearing down the old houses will rip apart the fabric of life here. Without courtyard homes, many women will no longer have outside space to go unveiled. Artisans will make way for modern stores. The danger, said one exile group recently, is that the area will become &quot;an open-air museum of Uighur culture&quot;.     Women working at home.  Photograph: Dan Chung    Muslim Uighurs make up almost half of the Xinjiang region&apos;s 22 million inhabitants. They have their own Turkic language, music, food - even their own (strictly unofficial) time zone, two hours behind Beijing&apos;s. They are partly what makes a trip to this area so fascinating.  Nowhere is this clearer than in Kashgar, where Uighurs account for up to nine-tenths of a population made up of 17 ethnic groups including Tajiks, Kyrgyz and Kazakhs. It&apos;s one of the reasons that locals insist you haven&apos;t seen Xinjiang if you haven&apos;t seen Kashgar. The city is where East and Central Asia meet, in terms of its people as well as its geography. But, throughout Xinjiang, many Uighurs complain that their culture is being rapidly eroded by Han Chinese immigration, controls on their religion and aggressive economic development.  And that explains why demolition is a highly sensitive topic; most residents were reluctant to speak about the changes, despite the fact we had left our guide behind.  &quot;No one wants to go,&quot; a young Uighur says bluntly. &quot;I have been here since I was a little boy; it&apos;s our whole life. But there&apos;s no alternative. They say it&apos;s not safe. This part will be knocked down next year; they have already started opposite.&quot;  The government argues that it has no choice: it fears the old buildings are a fire risk and would collapse in an earthquake like the one that killed an estimated 90,000 in Sichuan last year. And there&apos;s no doubt many residents would like proper plumbing and electricity. Wholesale demolition and reconstruction projects are common across China, where mile upon mile of historic architecture has fallen to bulldozers. [see Heritage SOS below]  As in those cases, the government believes the overhaul will accelerate development. There will still be some historic buildings and tourism will be easier in the new &quot;old city&quot;. But the vision laid out by officials - modern plazas and &quot;Uighur-style&quot; architecture - lacks the authentic magic that has always lured travellers to Kashgar.  You get a taste of the sanitised future at the Grand Bazaar, revamped a few years ago. It teems with locals buying blankets, headscarves and spices and tourists browsing the lutes, sheepskin hats and replica daggers. But the wide concrete aisles capture little of the Silk Road excitement. The mercantile spirit of Kashgar lives on however, at the livestock section, shunted a few miles south of town. There, at the packed Ivan Bazaar, a young boy shears a sheep; the bray of donkeys rakes the air. Men step aside nimbly as a bull, pulled from a truck, shakes its owner loose. Sometimes even camels show up for sale here.  There are other spots worth visiting outside the centre; notably the exquisitely glazed 17th-century Abak Khoja Mausoleum, also known as the Tomb of the Fragrant Concubine in honour of a consort of Emperor Qianlong. The grounds include several small mosques still in use today. Further away is the breathtaking glacial lake Karakuli, beneath Muztagh Ata, a peak more than 7,500m high. Visitors can camp in yurts and explore by foot, or on horse- or camel-back. Even in modernised parts of the centre, old habits cling on. Modern shops replaced the bazaar around the Idkah Mosque, but after Friday prayers - when 20,000 can crowd there - vendors rush to the steps to sell their wares. There are baskets of yellow figs and trays of perfume; new prayer mats and basins of corn cobs. One man waves an animal pelt and brandishes a bucket of marmot fat, said to be medicinal. Just behind the mosque, melon sellers on the road carve off single slices dripping with juice; Xinjiang is famed for its fruits and much of the best food is bought on the street here. Fresh naan bread, hot from round clay ovens, is dipped in onion and sesame.  But Kashgar&apos;s residents want the benefits of both old and new. No society is static, least of all one based on trade and poised at a crossroads. Demand for Tohti Hajim&apos;s horseshoes has fallen; many farmers putter past on motorised tricycles. On the street I pass an old Uighur man bellowing into a mobile. Women wear leopard print and sequins as well as Atlas silks. But the abruptness of the modernisation is of another order. This is the year to go to make the most of Kashgar&apos;s treasures. Since our visit, Xinjiang has seen violent inter-ethnic riots in its capital Urumqi kill almost 200. Although Kashgar is more than 650 miles away, it saw several violent incidents last year.  But despite the region&apos;s troubles, Kashgar remains a beautiful, hospitable city; colourful and abundant. And for a few months more it will be at its best - filled with bird lovers, blacksmiths and children with henna-stained fingers playing in the alleys. Heritage SOS ...

Hutchison China Meditech (Chi-Med), led by Scots-born Christian Hogg, is seeking to challenge that notion by developing traditional Chinese medicine - &quot;TCM&quot;, as it is referred to - for western markets. In a laboratory just outside Shanghai, he has built up a team of 200 scientists and support staff and spent $100m on research and development. The idea is to produce medicines derived from roots and herbs documented in Chinese texts, some dating back 2,000 years. &quot;Prospects are quite incredible,&quot; says Hogg. &quot;The Chinese healthcare market is growing at 20% a year, and 40% is accounted for by TCM.&quot;  But the challenge is to crack the US and Europe, where he must break down resistance to remedies that have &quot;worked for years in the east&quot;. It&apos;s an uphill task: Chi-Med&apos;s shares have bombed since the company floated on the junior London Aim market in 2006, from a float price of 275p to 80p. In part, this is due to impatience by investors who want results sooner rather than later. A note by Charles Stanley flagged up the fact that almost the entire value of the business, which last year generated revenue of $100m, was accounted for by TCM sales in China itself. The R&amp;D side has yet to produce anything of significance that has received western regulatory approval, so the broker has discounted its future potential value. Hogg is pinning a lot of hope on something called HMPL-004, a compound based on a natural Chinese remedy for inflammation of the bowel and Crohn&apos;s disease, which is about halfway through the US regulatory process, overseen by the Food and Drug Administration. If it gets approval, Chi-Med would license it to a western pharmaceutical company, paving the way for a sizable up-front fee and future royalty payments. But we are quite a way from that possibility, admits Hogg, &quot;although the omens look good&quot;. His company has a powerful backer as it is 72%-owned by Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that owns ports and telephone companies in the UK, and is headed by Asia&apos;s richest man, Li Ka-shing. Hutchison can open doors for Hogg on the Chinese mainland, where sales representatives are promoting Chi-Med&apos;s products to doctors and hospitals - but it cannot come up with blockbuster TCM drugs that will sell into western markets. Ever optimistic, Hogg notes that UBS recently acquired an 8.4% stake, which he believes is a sign investors will seek out firms such as Chi-Med to gain exposure to China, which is recording 8% GDP growth while Europe and America are deep in recession. With trillions in foreign reserves and big current account surplus, the government is in spending mode and recently said the health sector would receive a \u00a375bn boost via additional subsidies for consumers, as well as new hospitals and surgeries. As fears increase about swine flu, the Chinese are queuing up for Chi-Med&apos;s anti-flu drug, Banlangen, whose sales are up 46% in the past six months. Why can&apos;t it be sold to the west? Hogg explains that it would take years to receive regulatory approval as the authorities would have to test each of the 15 compounds that go into the substance. Likewise with the firm&apos;s best-selling Chinese cardiovascular remedy, which contains 13 different herbal extracts. &quot;These medicines illustrate the complexity of getting the regulatory green light for medicines developed over centuries in Asia and which are unknown elsewhere,&quot; he says. Developing TCM for developed countries is made more difficult by the fact that the Chinese government is anxious to safeguard herbal patents, viewing many as part of the country&apos;s heritage. To underline the point, Beijing recently assigned &quot;state secret status&quot; to up to a dozen ancient remedies. Hogg, 43, has lived in Hong Kong for 10 years but grew up in Scotland where he studied civil engineering at Edinburgh before undertaking an MBA in the US. He was headhunted by Procter &amp; Gamble and sent by the US consumer goods giant to China in 1995 to market the firm&apos;s range of laundry detergents. There, he met Hutchison Whampoa&apos;s Chinese boss, Simon To, who recruited him to Chi-Med in early 2000. In the past 20 years, the pharmaceuticals industry has often looked for inspiration to the thousands of natural products used in traditional Chinese medicine. The best current malaria medicine is based on an ancient Chinese treatment for fevers that comes from star anise fruit, and two recent cancer drugs are derived from Camptotheca acuminata, a tree found in China. But there is still scepticism within the industry about the scientific potential of natural products. The British Medical Association says: &quot;It&apos;s important that the many patients interested in exploring complementary therapy can be confident they are seeing bona fide practitioners providing treatments supported by an evidence base. Currently, osteopathy and chiropractic are the only alternative treatments fully regulated by law.&quot; But Hogg counters: &quot;Our aim is to modernise and globalise traditional Chinese medicine.&quot; He says there are 1,200 drug manufacturers across China and the industry is ripe for consolidation.  Chi-Med also has an overseas retail business, which hopes to tap growing demand for Asian health and beauty products. Chi-Med has six London shops under the Sen brand name in places such as Harvey Nichols, colourful spaces that sell teas and tonics as well as acupuncture and reflexology.  However, the main reason for Hutchison to get involved is the scientific opportunity. The company has a library of 10,000 natural substances, many of which have been used for centuries, that it is scanning for medical potential. Hogg argues that as its scientists dig deeper into the Hutchison library, they should begin to understand how the substances work on a molecular level and react with the human body. Consequently, they could begin to isolate specific chemicals that could be the basis for potential new drugs, which would be easier to patent. If he&apos;s right, Chi-Med could be sitting on a gold mine - but he has a lot to prove before investors are persuaded to buy into his optimism.", "tags": ["Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-08T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/09/china-rio-tinto-industrial-espionage", "sentences": ["Four Rio Tinto employees, including an Australian citizen, have been held in Shanghai for the past month."], "title": "China accuses Rio Tinto of spying over six years", "article": "China escalated its confrontation with Rio Tinto yesterday when it accused the mining company of industrial espionage stretching back six years at a potential cost to the country of $100bn (\u00a360bn). Four Rio Tinto employees, including an Australian citizen, have been held in Shanghai for the past month. The latest accusations \u2013 which emerged on the website of the state secrets agency at the weekend \u2013 are likely to heighten tensions between Beijing and Canberra over their potential fate. Australian citizen Stern Hu, Rio&apos;s chief iron ore negotiator, and three Chinese colleagues were detained on 5 July on suspicion of commercial spying. No charges have been brought, but the state news agency, Xinhua, has reported that Hu was facing charges of obtaining sensitive industrial information through &quot;abnormal means&quot;. The incident could also signal a potential hardening of conditions for foreign companies currently doing business in China. The country&apos;s national administration for the protection of state secrets said the case should force Chinese officials and companies to do more to protect sensitive commercial information, and foreign businesses in China must come under stricter controls to deter them from spying. &quot;Our country has entered a peak period of commercial espionage warfare, and the threat to important economic intelligence and security of national economic activity increases by the day,&quot; the report claimed. Contacts between local officials, experts and managers and foreign businesses should also be more strictly controlled, it said, adding that &quot;traitors&quot; were enriching themselves at the expense of Chinese businesses. A Rio Tinto spokesman in London said: &quot;We are clearly very concerned about our employees who have now been detained for some time. We believe that they acted at all times with integrity and in accordance with Rio Tinto&apos;s strict and publicly stated code of ethical behaviour.&quot; The state secrets agency&apos;s report said Rio Tinto&apos;s commercial spying involved &quot;winning over and buying off, prying out intelligence ... and gaining things by deceit&quot; over six years. &quot;The large amount of intelligence and data from our country&apos;s steel sector found on Rio Tinto&apos;s computers and the massive damage to our national economic security and interests are plainly obvious,&quot; it said, adding that Rio&apos;s alleged spying meant Chinese steel makers paid \u00a5700bn yuan (\u00a361bn) more for imported iron ore than they otherwise would have. The accusations will send shockwaves through the industry as China consumes more than half of the world&apos;s iron ore, turning it into steel for making goods it exports to the west. Sales to China by Rio&apos;s operations in Australia account for about a fifth of the company&apos;s $60bn annual turnover. In February, Rio said that Chinese state-owned aluminium group Chinalco would double its stake in Rio \u2013 listed in both London and Australia \u2013 to 18% in exchange for $20bn of investment. Rio&apos;s British shareholders protested and the deal was scrapped, to the annoyance of the Chinese authorities. Rio Tinto did a rights issue among existing shareholders instead. The detentions followed months of fraying relations between China and Australia \u2013 a huge exporter of iron ore. The sides have been locked in talks over iron ore prices, which ran over a deadline of 30 June. They were subsequently settled when Chinese steel mills agreed the same 33% cut in annual iron ore prices that other Asian steelmakers had agreed, even though the Chinese had wanted a 45% cut in the face of the deepest global recession for decades. The following is an excerpt from the report which accuses Rio of extensive industrial espionage: &quot;The large amount of intelligence and data from our country&apos;s steel sector found on Rio Tinto&apos;s computers and the massive damage to our national economic security and interests are plainly obvious. Hu Shitai [Stern Hu] collusion with the senior ranks of some major steel enterprises ... is in essence the same [as other recent cases of commercial espionage], showing that these are not merely individual cases, but the tip of the iceberg. If they are not swiftly investigated and dealt with, this will be disastrous. Many economic spies have acquired advanced technology, information about important negotiations and a range of other state economic, technological and commercial secrets, inflicting major economic damage on China.&quot;&quot;As one central leader sharply pointed out, protecting the secrets of the [Communist] Party and the state, including secrets in the economic and technological spheres, is a major concern for the interests of the nation, state and people.&quot;", "tags": ["Rio Tinto", "Mining", "Business", "China", "Australia news", "Espionage", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-09T01:25:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/09/china-typhoon-morakot", "sentences": ["Further up the coast, Shanghai was on &quot;high alert&quot; and dozens of cargo ships in the area delayed or cancelled voyages, with forecasters warning of torrential downpours and waves at sea up to seven metres or higher, Xinhua said."], "title": "Million Chinese flee typhoon Morakot", "article": "Almost 1 million people were evacuated from China&apos;s south-eastern coast as typhoon Morakot swept across to the mainland from Taiwan today, bringing torrential rain and huge waves.

In Zhejiang, around 35,440 ships were called back from sea. Flights from Fuzhou and Xiamen were cancelled. At least one cargo ship was stranded after the strong winds and waves pushed it into shallow waters. Further up the coast, Shanghai was on &quot;high alert&quot; and dozens of cargo ships in the area delayed or cancelled voyages, with forecasters warning of torrential downpours and waves at sea up to seven metres or higher, Xinhua said.

Though Eunice never aspired to enter the world of political controversy that enveloped her brothers, she was prominent in US public life and won numerous awards for her work for people with learning difficulties. She was the fifth of the Kennedy children and the third daughter. The tragedies that repeatedly struck the family began in her earliest years. Her oldest brother, Joseph, was killed in the second world war; her elder sister, Rosemary, had learning difficulties and underwent the appalling experience of a prefrontal lobotomy that ruined the rest of her long life; another sister, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948. Later, of course, two brothers, John and Robert, were assassinated, and the third, Edward, was involved in the car accident at Chappaquiddick island, off Massachusetts, which resulted in the drowning of a young woman. Small wonder that Eunice avoided their boisterous competitiveness. Her retiring nature even extended to wearing black dresses throughout her five pregnancies, to make her condition less evident. Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, she was given the conventional education of a rich New England Roman Catholic - including a spell at a convent school in London, while her father was US ambassador - and in 1943 gained a Stanford University sociology degree. Her father&apos;s prominence in the Roosevelt administration ensured that she was assigned to the special war problems section of the State Department. She then became a prison social worker in West Virginia and later moved to Chicago to deal with juvenile offenders. There she met and, in 1953, married Sargent Shriver, a lawyer and former naval officer who had joined the Kennedy family&apos;s Chicago merchandising company and, under President John Kennedy (another one-time naval officer), founded and directed the American Peace Corps (1961-66). He went on to be Democratic vice-presidential candidate when George McGovern ran for president in 1972, and four years later was, briefly, a presidential hopeful. Eunice&apos;s faith in her brothers&apos; capacity to surmount all obstacles emerged in November 1963 when she was lunching at a restaurant with her husband. He was called to the telephone and returned saying: &quot;Something has happened to Jack.&quot; There was a rumour that the president had been shot. Eunice continued studying the menu and calmly ordered her meal with the comment: &quot;There have been so many crises in his life: he&apos;ll pull through.&quot; She had taken over the direction of the family foundation, named after her eldest brother and dedicated to research into learning difficulties, in 1957. What eventually became her principal undertaking began at her home in Maryland in 1962, when she organised a summer day camp for adults and children with learning difficulties. Six years later this had evolved into the International Special Olympics in Chicago, initially with 1,000 competitors from the US and Canada. From 1975, the summer games were held every four years, and Eunice was present in Shanghai in 2007, when 7,000 athletes took part. In 160 countries round the world, there are more than a million participants in Special Olympics events every year. Her tireless fundraising and organisation, in later years with the formal participation of her husband, drew worldwide praise. In 1984, Ronald Reagan gave her the presidential medal of freedom, and she also became the first living American woman to be portrayed on one of her country&apos;s medals. She is survived by her husband, daughter Maria (who is married to Arnold Schwarzenegger), sons Robert, Timothy, Mark, Anthony, brother Edward and sister Jean Kennedy Smith. \u2022 Eunice Mary Kennedy Shriver, philanthropist, born 10 July 1921; died 11 August 2009", "tags": ["The Kennedys", "US news", "Disability"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-11T14:42:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/12/bhp-billiton-profits-commodity-prices", "sentences": ["Chinese authorities announced that the four Rio Tinto Shanghai-based employees had been arrested for bribery."], "title": "Slump in demand for metals knocks BHP Billiton profits", "article": "  BHP Billiton, the world&apos;s largest miner, said today it was too early to declare the bottom of the commodities slump as it posted a 62% fall in profits. Marius Kloppers, chief executive, said that sickly demand from the US and Europe had now &quot;stabilised&quot; but he warned that appetite for metals in China could weaken in the next few months. He also called for a change in the way iron ore is sold to avoid a repeat of the fractious negotiations that, this summer, formed the backdrop to the arrest of four Rio Tinto staff in China. Unlike most other metals, the price of iron ore is fixed by annual contracts negotiated by each miner and individual importing country. &quot;The process is very protracted and exhausting,&quot; Kloppers said. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult for two people to sit across the table and find a price in one go. There has to be another way.&quot; Kloppers said that it would make more sense for China, and other importers of iron ore, to be able to buy it using a variety of forward contracts of different lengths. Chinese authorities announced that the four Rio Tinto Shanghai-based employees had been arrested for bribery. It is understood that the more serious charge of stealing state secrets has been dropped. Kloppers offered a cautious outlook for world demand for metals, which is a good indicator of economic growth. He said that in the last six months, China had been buying more metals to restock its depleted inventories. This helped make up for anaemic demand in the US and Europe, which had been using up their stocks, but now demand there had &quot;stabilised&quot;. But Chinese demand would now ease off in the short term, while the lingering effects of the credit crunch in the developed world would hold back growth there, he added. &quot;We are not massively biased towards the downside [in terms of the prospect of prices falling] but equally we should not expect dramatic price spikes because things are going to be in short supply.&quot; He said it would not be until next year before the company would be able to more accurately predict underlying demand, unaffected by the distorting effect of restocking. BHP made a profit of $5.9bn (\u00a33.6bn) for the year to the end of June, compared with $15.4bn the previous year. This compares with a 77% fall in profit for the second half of the year posted recently by rival Xstrata. BHP said that commodity prices fell by up to 90% in the last six months of last year. While prices had recently rallied, they were still up to 60% lower than last summer. Charles Kernot, analyst from Evolution Securities, said that BHP was coming out of the economic downturn stronger than any of its competitors. Unlike Rio Tinto and Xstrata, BHP is not encumbered by a vast debt pile, but this is partly because it lost out to Rio in the bidding for Canadian aluminium producer Alcan. The costly acquisition forced Rio to attempt a $20bn bail out from the Chinese government in order to pay back the debt.

Business secretary Lord Mandelson has so far focused attention on the ill-fated firm&apos;s former owners, the so-called Phoenix Four businessmen. But the firm&apos;s auditors, who received millions of pounds in fees from the business, are also the subject of intense scrutiny. The Accountancy and Actuarial Discipline Board has already spent four years looking into the conduct of Deloitte in its capacity as auditor and adviser to Rover and its parent company Phoenix Venture Holdings. The non-statutory industry watchdog has powers to fine firms and individuals and to ban qualified professionals from practising. Deloitte believes it carried out its work on Rover entirely professionally. A Guardian review of Rover-related accounts for years between 2000 and 2003 show Deloitte received \u00a31.9m for its role as auditor to the carmaker and linked companies. Meanwhile, over the same period, the accountancy firm was also handed \u00a33.1m in &quot;other&quot; fees as well as \u00a39m for its role in advising on three corporate transactions. The firm also acted as adviser on a further three deals, though related fees are not disclosed in publicly available company filings. Among the key figures in Deloitte&apos;s relationship with Rover was mergers and acquisitions partner Maghsoud Einollahi, who retired from the UK firm last year. On 26 October, 2004, Deloitte signed off the accounts of Phoenix Venture Holdings, noting in passing that the business&apos;s fortunes could be greatly influenced by ongoing &quot;strategic relationship&quot; negotiations with Chinese firm Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC). It added: &quot;In view of the significance of this uncertainty we consider it should be drawn to you [sic] attention. However our opinion is not qualified in this respect.&quot; According to the National Audit Office&apos;s report into the Rover collapse, exactly a month later, and three days before MG Rover was due to settle its October 2004 VAT return, Deloitte, in its role as Rover&apos;s tax adviser, contacted Customs and Excise proposing the carmaker should delay VAT payments, pending the conclusion of the SAIC deal. Rover went on to request a tax deferral throughout 2005 and stated that it was only asking for such a facility &quot;as a matter of last resort&quot;. By April that year, the firm was bankrupt. The AADB&apos;s inquiry had been due to finish 18 months ago but a final round of revisions is expected to be added following the publication next month of an eagerly awaited report into the Phoenix acquisition and ultimate demise of Rover by the government-appointed inspectors Guy Newey QC and Gervase MacGregor, an insolvency law expert and BDO Stoy Hayward partner. The inspectors&apos; report has cost \u00a316m, and is believed to provide a comprehensive forensic examination of the Rover story. Unlike previous inquiries into the matter, the inspectors have been able to use their powers under section 432 of the 1985 Companies Act to compel witnesses to produce evidence. The AADB has previously said it has been &quot;liaising&quot; with the inspectors but would not comment on whether it had been passed evidence obtained under 432 powers. Last month Mandelson sent the inspectors report to the Serious Fraud Office, asking the agency to consider opening a criminal investigation. The SFO rejected that request, prompting Mandelson to pursue actions through the civil courts to ban certain former Rover directors from serving as directors of public companies.", "tags": ["Rover", "Automotive industry", "Serious Fraud Office", "Peter Mandelson", "UK news", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-12T23:05:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/18/china-d22-beijing-scene", "sentences": ["After the chaotic scenes witnessed at Shanghai&apos;s Dream Factory, I was hoping to hear something even more revolutionary at China&apos;s most famous underground music venue, D22."], "title": "Turning Japanese heads to China: D22 and the Beijing scene", "article": "Golden Driver&apos;s lithe, slightly scared looking drummer wears a T-shirt with WARHOL emblazoned across it in bold capitals.

Is he hoping for us to infer that Golden Driver are marking the death knell of western pop culture&apos;s dominance, that the creative youth of China are here to enact the next stage of global art history? Er, probably not. Ten minutes into the self-indulgent depths of Golden Driver&apos;s soporific indie dirge and the mood feels about as revolutionary as a sixth-form battle of the bands contest. Which is a shame. After the chaotic scenes witnessed at Shanghai&apos;s Dream Factory, I was hoping to hear something even more revolutionary at China&apos;s most famous underground music venue, D22. It has, after all, been the birthplace of some of the country&apos;s most celebrated alternative bands like Queen Sea Big Shark, Joyside and Hedgehog. But with nothing on stage to hold your attention, you can&apos;t ignore the fact that the venue looks a lot like a Wetherspoons somewhere in the east Midlands. With all this in mind, it&apos;s more likely that the Warhol T-shirt was worn by Golden Driver&apos;s snare-tapping wannabe rock star simply because it looked cool. Still, the original point remains. China&apos;s growth into an economic and cultural beast gives it the potential for fostering an entirely new creative environment, one which eschews western pop culture. The Chinese government is perhaps still unsure as to what to do with the country&apos;s burgeoning art scene (witness Beijing&apos;s Factory 798 \u2013 a vibrant, organically grown arts and culture district that was nearly demolished to build cheap accommodation). Perhaps because of this, many new bands like Golden Driver are still in the process of discovering their own distinctly Chinese voice. Despite these difficulties, it&apos;s still fascinating to watch popular youth culture in Asia developing along new lines, because it hasn&apos;t had the opportunity to do so before. Here, if there is a new pop art it will unfold in uncharted territories and newly crafted contexts, which Warhol and his followers could never have envisaged.", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "World music", "Music", "Culture", "Indie"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-18T15:35:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/aug/19/nasa-astronauts-film-list", "sentences": ["In other words, if the astronauts on the International Space Station want to watch Pearl Harbor, Shanghai Knights or, for that matter, Apollo 13, that&apos;s what they&apos;re going to watch."], "title": "The wrong stuff: Nasa's out-of-this-world movie choices shock the film community | Ben Walters", "article": "&quot;Houston, we have a problem.

They need their downtime, too, and, according to official documents released by Nasa, a liberally stocked DVD library is among the recreational options at their disposal. Wedding Crashers is among the 150-odd titles they can choose from, as, somewhat incredibly, are Apollo 13 and Armageddon \u2013 films about a calamitous systems failure on board a manned rocket and an off-world suicide mission.

Those presuming that Earth&apos;s ambassadors to the stars partake of a rarefied cultural diet \u2013 the aesthetic equivalent, if you like, of their boundary-pushing profession \u2013 will be disappointed. This is a solidly middlebrow Hollywood selection, heavy on studio genre fare and blockbusters: the Matrix, Lord of the Rings, X-Men and Indiana Jones trilogies are all present and correct, along with the likes of When Harry Met Sally \u2026, Forrest Gump and Secondhand Lions. There are other, less alarming titles germane to the situation, such as the utopian fantasies of Contact and 2010 (although no 2001), the complete Star Wars saga and the heroic-aviation adventures The Right Stuff and Top Gun, and a couple of other transportation-related disaster movies, too, like Black Hawk Down and Titanic. The book library is heavy on science fiction and the music selection \u2013 which, at a bare 20 tracks, is more of a playlist than a library \u2013 includes both Sinatra&apos;s Fly Me to the Moon and The Police&apos;s Walking on the Moon. Earlier this year, the list came to the attention of Shooting People, the independent film-making collective. They were aghast at the idea of humanity&apos;s only off-world film library being dominated by mainstream Americana, and challenged their 35,000 members to come up with some more edifying suggestions. The resulting ideas ranged from alternative spaced-themed titles (Solaris, Galaxy Quest) to The Third Man (&quot;The location would give a whole new resonance to Harry Lime&apos;s speech: &quot;Look down there. Tell me, would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?&apos;&quot;) and even The Ice Storm (&quot;because you might be missing your families up there. And sex&quot;).  In May, Shooting People&apos;s creative director, James Mullighan, wrote to Nasa, arguing that &quot;Caddyshack, Cheaper By the Dozen and \u2013 heaven forfend \u2013 Beverly Hills Cop might weaken the critical faculties of those on board, possibly even putting their lives and ours in danger&quot; and offering a selection of the alternatives proposed on the group&apos;s website: &quot;Our members would like to see Harold and Maude rather than Harold and Kumar, and Man on Wire replace Man on Fire.&quot; Rather wonderfully, Nasa wrote back. Associate administrator William H Gerstenmaier informed Shooting People that &quot;Nasa shares your interest in assuring that a broad selection of entertainment is available for crew members&apos; selection&quot; and told the group that its suggestions &quot;have been forwarded to the crew office for further consideration&quot;. But he also made clear that the titles were largely the result of crew members&apos; personal preferences: they either requested these films or brought them on board themselves.

But petty people politics makes me cross. How do you deal with people when you are angry? I make sure the organisation or person gets it: I don&apos;t go off in a huff.

It was clearly the hat that had inspired the carving.&quot; The relationship of the hat to the wooden man, the wooden man to &quot;a thickset troll&quot; who exercises a quasi-magical power over the protagonists perfectly exemplifies Jane Gardam&apos;s poetic method. Memories resonate with each other and echo across decades. People and places, the past and the present, are woven into threads of narrative which, drawn together, give the writing a marvellous lilting power. This novel and its predecessor, Old Filth, have a symbiotic relationship: they are hugely enjoyable entities in their own right but the sum of them adds up to something more than the parts. Together the novels offer a view of England refracted through its colonial past. They are not exactly prequel and sequel, more lives recounted from different points of view - the male protagonist, Edward Feathers, in the first novel; the female, his wife Betty, in the second. Childhood, home and exile are constantly recurring themes but the real subject is love. Most of the cast of The Man in the Wooden Hat are familiar from its predecessor. The owner of the hat - not wooden but felt - is the troll, the &quot;dwarfish&quot; and impossibly vain Albert Ross, otherwise known as &quot;Loss&quot;, or &quot;Albatross&quot;, or &quot;Coleridge&quot; or &quot;Ancient Mariner&quot;. He is an &quot;almost lifetime friend&quot; of Edward and becomes his instructing solicitor, amanuensis and protector - even to the extent of warning Edward&apos;s wife never to desert him: &quot;If you leave him I will break you.&quot; Notionally Chinese, but preferring to be known as a Hakka from the ancient tribe of oriental Gypsies, he compulsively conjures cards out of his hat and tells fortunes: he tells Betty that she has made &quot;a prudent marriage not for love&quot;. Later he relents and apologises to her. Edward is self-mockingly known as &quot;Old Filth&quot; (Failed in London Try Hong Kong), a name that sits paradoxically on this good, diligent, clever, tidy man who is a specialist in construction disputes. He keeps people at a distance in the English way - &quot;a blank to everyone, but full of mystery&quot;. He&apos;s a Raj orphan, &quot;born to an earlier England&quot; in Malaya, then as a child bounced between colonies and institutions. Removed from his parents and deprived of a sense of home, he&apos;s forced to cauterise his feelings. He appears blocked from love - an emotionally depleted man who doesn&apos;t understand women - and yet Gardam never withdraws her mercy from him. In his estimation his wife is &quot;a good sort&quot;. She grew up in a Japanese internment camp in Shanghai and says of herself: &quot;I have no aim. No certainty. I am a postwar invertebrate ... I have settled on exactly what my mother would have wanted: a rich, safe, good husband and a pleasant life. All the things she must have thought in the Camp were gone for ever.&quot; She possesses a sort of diffident determinism: she can&apos;t find a reason not to marry Edward.  In the first novel we see her largely through her husband&apos;s eyes and accept his partial view of her. In the second it&apos;s a surprise to discover that she&apos;s an able linguist, an expert in ciphers (a Bletchley code-breaker), a social worker and has, all her life, been in love with her husband&apos;s rival, Terry Veneering, whose son, Harry, becomes her surrogate child. Harry&apos;s death, and her own which follows shortly after, crowns the book with a beautifully orchestrated and touching conclusion. In the wake of Harry&apos;s death, she decides to leave her husband to join her lover. Her pearl necklace (&quot;my guilty pearls&quot;) - a present from him - slips from her neck when she&apos;s planting bulbs. She covers the pearls with earth, looks up at her husband who is shooting crows with his walking stick and thinks:  &quot;He&apos;s quite potty. It&apos;s too late. I can&apos;t leave him now.&quot;  But then she did. That pitch-perfect death is typical of Gardam&apos;s writing. While the narrative is kaleidoscopic - letters (some unsent), flashbacks, scenes from a screenplay - it is always sure-footed. There&apos;s something Dickensian about it - Old Filth and Veneering&apos;s names, the part-conjuror part-guardian angel Albert Ross, the remarkable coincidences, the revelation of ancient secrets - but there&apos;s nothing Dickensian about the spare, subtle prose, glazed with irony and wit. There&apos;s a wonderful specificity of period and place and class which gives authority to even the most exceptional turns of fate. If you take both novels together, they make up an extraordinarily rich account of a long marriage, the restraints, the compromises and the sacrifices as much as the secrets and the unexpected - and often unearned - rewards. &quot;Betty was always ready to give,&quot; says Filth finally to Veneering, &quot;whether any of us asked or not.&quot; \u2022 Richard Eyre&apos;s Talking Theatre is published by Nick Hern", "tags": ["Jane Gardam", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-04T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/06/chinese-restaurant-silk-road-london", "sentences": ["It is very cool indeed to talk knowledgeably about the differences in food between, say, Beijing, Shanghai and Hunan."], "title": "Jay Rayner reviews the Chinese restaurant Silk Road in London", "article": "Silk Road,49 Camberwell Church Street, London SE5 (020 7703 4832).

The reporting of those riots in a part of the country most of us had never heard of before was more explicit than almost any I could recall. That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean we understand it. In the past decade or so we have finally begun to recognise that huge countries like India and China do not simply have a single culinary tradition. It is very cool indeed to talk knowledgeably about the differences in food between, say, Beijing, Shanghai and Hunan. Again, it doesn&apos;t mean we know what we&apos;re talking about.  I am well eaten (if less well travelled) and still managed to come a cropper in a review of Gourmet San, a cheap, boisterous restaurant on London&apos;s Bethnal Green Road, which I described as being Sichuanese on account of big plates of stuff rustling in piles of red peppers and salt and aromatic peppercorns. I was later taken to task by Fuchsia Dunlop, Britain&apos;s head girl when it comes to Chinese regional cookery. She didn&apos;t think the food was Sichuanese at all. Some of it was from Xinjiang, she said. The huge helpings suggested Dongbei. As to the chef, he was apparently from Harbin in Heilongjiang province. At which point my eyes glazed over. Can&apos;t I just say it was really nice? The food at Silk Road is really nice and really distinctive. It advertises itself as serving the food of Xinjiang, and Fuchsia - even allowing for a few pork dishes on the menu, which place it on the liberal side of Muslim observance - I&apos;m going to let them define themselves. It is a simple, brightly lit room with communal tables and benches, and a reassuringly short menu, compared to the novels you find in many Chinese restaurants. The most familiar plate of food was a pork fillet stir-fry with curly black fungus, in a sauce spiked with chilli. Less familiar was the big-plate chicken, though I should say we had the medium plate; our waiter didn&apos;t think we&apos;d have a hope in hell of finishing it.  What arrived was a sizable bowl of a light, savoury chilli broth - though not one of those nuclear, sweat-from-the-scalp jobs you get in Sichuan restaurants - bobbing with pieces of chicken on the bone. Alongside the chicken were large pieces of potato braising nicely in the liquor. I can&apos;t think of another Chinese dish that features potatoes like this (I don&apos;t count the cold, congealing basket in which crispy chilli beef is occasionally served). Once we had dredged out most of what it had to offer we were brought a plate of wide, glutinous hand-made noodles, which were tipped unceremoniously into that fabulous broth, those noodles marked for their blandness against the kick of the liquid. It was a thrilling bowlful, equally so for costing just \u00a39.      Silk Road's grilled lamb. Photograph: Katherine Rose    Pieces of grilled lamb came crusted with ground cumin, chilli and salt. We pulled them off the metal spikes with our fingers and felt butch and prehistoric for doing so. I appreciated the inclusion of little squares of crisped lamb fat, though beware: they are lovely the moment they come off the grill; grim and greasy a minute later. Less thrilling were lamb kidneys, which were tough and tasted of what kidneys are designed to filter the body&apos;s fluids down to. A plate of cold, crunchy, shredded kelp dressed with enthusiastic amounts of chilli and garlic was curiously refreshing. My companion and I drank a couple of beers each and agreed that while what he had eaten was clearly hewn from the same rock as the Chinese food we recognised, this came from its outer edges; from a harder place of cold winter winds.  I know little of Xinjiang and its ethnic strife. But I do know I liked the version of its food served to me at Silk Road. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk", "tags": ["Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-05T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/06/snooker-shanghai-masters-wpbsa", "sentences": ["The BBC&apos;s seminal decision to cover the 1978 World Championship inspired a tournament circuit from which players were able to earn fortunes but this campaign, which begins with the Shanghai Masters, will feature a lack of sponsors, fewer ranking events and lower prize money.", "The Welsh Open, which is covered by BBC Wales, the Shanghai Masters and the China Open complete the ranking circuit."], "title": "Dearth of sponsors has snooker in a back spin | Clive Everton", "article": "A new snooker season starts tomorrow with the sport in its worst commercial position since becoming mainstream TV entertainment more than 30 years ago. The BBC&apos;s seminal decision to cover the 1978 World Championship inspired a tournament circuit from which players were able to earn fortunes but this campaign, which begins with the Shanghai Masters, will feature a lack of sponsors, fewer ranking events and lower prize money. Only six ranking events (plus the Masters) will take place compared with last season&apos;s eight, while prize money has fallen by \u00a3435,500 to \u00a33,063,600. The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association have secured a title sponsor for only one of the four events televised under its contract with the BBC. Betfred is in the second year of its \u00a32.6m, four-year deal for the World Championship but there is no sponsor for next month&apos;s Grand Prix, December&apos;s UK Championship or January&apos;s Masters, at Wembley. The Welsh Open, which is covered by BBC Wales, the Shanghai Masters and the China Open complete the ranking circuit. Funding issues have led to the disappearance of the Northern Ireland Trophy and the Bahrain Open. Players are growing increasingly restive over the large gaps between substantial tournaments and the low level of prize money. Only 43 of the 96 players on the professional circuit earned more than \u00a327,000 from it last season. Last April, the WPBSA chairman, Sir Rodney Walker, outlined a series of planned minor ranking events with scaled-down prize money and ranking point tariffs. Instead, the WPBSA have merely announced six non-ranking events in low-key venues in Britain with aggregate prize money of \u00a390,000. Only 40 of the WPBSA&apos;s 96 players entered the first tournament. The world No8, Mark Selby, recently blogged: &quot;I remember Sir Rodney Walker talking to me a while back. He had all these ideas and plans for the future and was really positive but none of them have come to fruition.&quot; Selby is among those who have played exhibitions to packed houses on the continent. &quot;The last couple I&apos;ve done have been in Germany and the amount of people who came to watch was fantastic. Imagine what it would be like if we had even a minor ranking tournament there. And not just in Germany. Countries like Poland and the Czech Republic are snooker mad. It would certainly make more sense to tap into Europe than have another tournament somewhere like Bahrain.&quot; Last November&apos;s Bahrain Open cost the WPBSA \u00a3250,000 in prize money and about the same in staging and other costs. The largest attendance was 150. One session started with no spectators at all. In a recent BBC Radio 5 Live broadcast, The State of Snooker, Steve Davis raised the inherent conflict of interest between the WPBSA as governing body and their wholly owned commercial subsidiary, World Snooker, &quot;promoting events and not allowing outside promoters to breathe&quot;. In theory, the WPBSA also remain the players&apos; trade union, their original purpose, but this function may soon be taken over by the Snooker Players&apos; Association chiefly through the efforts of John Higgins, the world champion, and his manager, Pat Mooney. &quot;Just over 100 registrations have been received, including 35 of the top 64,&quot; says Mooney, who emphasises that evolution is preferred to revolution and that a meeting with WPBSA is desired. The SPA&apos;s first objective would be the co-ordination of a schedule incorporating independently promoted events with ranking points awarded on a scale appropriate to prize funds and other conditions \u2013 a recognisable variant of the scheme outlined by Walker last April. Various independents are breaking new ground for tournaments. For instance, the World Series co-promoted by Mooney and Higgins staged events last season in Jersey, Poland, Russia and Portugal, and before Christmas will stage them in Prague, Warsaw and Jeddah. Yet the WPBSA do not carry information about any tournaments other than their own on worldsnooker.com. Unless the elite game flourishes in the form of more tournaments and more stories worth reporting, snooker&apos;s profile could swirl into a vortex of decline.", "tags": ["Snooker", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-05T23:10:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/globalcleantech100/trailblazers-innovation", "sentences": ["In China, it is providing the batteries to power a new hybrid car in Shanghai, the SAIC Hybrid electric vehicle due out next year."], "title": "Trailblazers in innovation", "article": "The industrial revolution began in the UK and the country has been justly proud of its inventive skills ever since. Now it is the turn of the green revolution and the British are again helping to change the way the world makes its manufactured goods and generates and uses electricity so we can all have a better, safer place for civilisation to thrive. While the US dominates the Global Cleantech 100 with 55 entries, the UK is second with 13 entries and Germany comes third with 10 entries. On this page we reflect the strengths of these three countries with a selection of companies from each. All have different ideas and products designed to transform our lives. Solar is the top technology on the following pages but the UK&apos;s contribution varies from intelligent chip technology engineered to improve energy efficiency to wave and tidal energy generation. US One of the world&apos;s leading suppliers of high-power lithium-ion batteries, A123 specialises in transport, electric grid and portable power manufacturing. It is working with Chrysler, for instance, on battery modules and battery packs for Chrysler&apos;s range-extended electric vehicle and battery-only electric vehicle production programmes. In China, it is providing the batteries to power a new hybrid car in Shanghai, the SAIC Hybrid electric vehicle due out next year.  Bridgelux believes it is the first, new US-based LED (light-emitting diode) manufacturer of the past 20 years. It helps customers switch from traditional, less efficient lighting systems (such as incandescent, halogen and fluorescent lighting) to solid-state lighting solutions that are less wasteful because they generate less heat as a by-product. It provides higher performance and energy-efficient white light for indoor and exterior application areas. With its latest innovations, Bridgelux LED Arrays, the company believes it will drive down the high costs that have held back the spread of solid-state lighting. As well as addressing cost issues, the Array products are designed to optimise the quantity of light, energy efficiency, colour rendering and beam uniformity.  BrightSource builds and runs solar energy plants around the world, aiming to provide reliable and low-cost energy for both industrial and utility use. Its tested and proven LPT 550 energy system uses thousands of small mirrors to reflect sunlight on to a boiler on the top of a tower to produce high-temperature steam. The steam is then piped to a conventional turbine, which generates electricity. To conserve water, the steam is air-cooled and piped back into the system. The company is running a demonstration tower scheme in the Negev Desert in Israel.  The Tesla Roadster proves that electric cars have a future beyond short shopping trips or commuting. Weight is the enemy of efficiency in all cars, and especially those powered by electric but, thanks to its lightweight sportscar body, and the latest lithium-ion batteries, the Tesla Roadster accelerates to 60mph in 3.9 seconds, generates a third of the CO2 of hybrid cars, and has an impressive range of 240 miles at a cost of \u00a33. The next challenge: a seven-seater saloon model launching in 2011. With sales of more than 1m two-way, intelligent communication devices for smart grid management for water, gas and electricity, Trilliant can claim to be one of the biggest players in a fast-emerging market. The company, established in 2004, supplies advanced metering products that let utilities deliver higher levels of customer service and information, reduce operational costs, and provide innovative new programs, thus allowing consumers to change their consumption behaviour to take advantage of lower market prices. UK New technologies such as Acal Energy&apos;s low-cost proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems are gradually replacing traditional combustion engines. The Runcorn-based company believes it is now the world leader in this market. It promises substantial cost savings and performance improvements to clients through this clean, quiet and efficient technology which was also a crucial feature of the Gemini space missions, the first manned US flights outside the earth&apos;s atmosphere. Acal&apos;s systems are powered by its proprietary platinum-free cathode technology (FlowCath). Other projects include modules and consumable chemicals for a range of uses, including stationary, residential and automotive applications requiring more than 1kw of power.  CamSemi is a leader in intelligent power-management integrated circuits, helping the consumer electronics sector develop much more energy-efficient power supplies, lighting and other power conversion products at low cost. Products based around CamSemi chips have simple circuitry, offer high performance and exceed the demands of Energy Star, the European code of conduct and other energy-efficiency regulations. The company&apos;s C2160 products - launched this July - are designed to allow mobile phone and other manufacturers to introduce highly energy-efficient chargers - quickly and at low cost. CamSemi also has centres in Tapei, Taiwan and Shenzhen, China. How clever is your fridge? The problem with renewable energy, such as wind or solar power, is that it&apos;s difficult to plan supply and, if the sun stops shining or wind drops at times of high network usage, you&apos;d have a melted ice cream problem. Among RLtec&apos;s smart grid solutions is Dynamic Demand, a system which allows appliances to monitor their own usage and work out if they can move to lower power states for a time to limit their demand. It displaces high-carbon emitting generation with lower-carbon alternatives as much as possible and helps to facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the grid. Germany Making solar cells that are lightweight, cost-effective and efficient yet able to be integrated into the aesthetics of buildings will result in a major growth of the sector. Odersun has proved that it can be done: it has already supplied &quot;sun roofs&quot; for buildings at Beijing&apos;s Olympic Park. It does this using thin-film solar modules in a glass-foil laminate, and an innovative copper tape wiring system, which allows a significantly higher amount of modules to be interconnected in one string. Although it produces less energy that standard solar cells, its unique ability to be integrated en masse into the fabric of the building is a huge asset.  Silicon carbide and glycol are key materials in the process of making silicon wafers for solar panels but much is lost in the manufacturing process. Sic Processing&apos;s technologically advanced hydrocyclone recycling system can recover significant amounts of both materials from the slurry arising from silicon wafer production panels - this can then be reused by the manufacturer. As a result, the cost of this vital energy-harnessing product can be significantly reduced.", "tags": ["Supplement"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-08T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/09/china-us-greentech-plan", "sentences": ["The authors of the plan, which was six months in the making, sketched out their proposal at a gathering of business executives in Shanghai today.", "Progress was made in Shanghai last month on what has been billed as the world&apos;s biggest and most efficient carbon capture and storage project.", "At a signing ceremony in Beijing with the China Energy Conservation Investment Corporation, Peter Mandelson, secretary of state for business, innovation and skills, said: &quot;As we enter a new era of innovation driven by the rapidly expanding low-carbon economy, we must ensure that UK companies benefit and develop overseas markets.&quot; The sentiment was shared in Shanghai."], "title": "US and China to unveil joint plan to 'take over' cleantech market", "article": "A joint US-China plan to &quot;take over the world&quot; in low-carbon technology will be revealed tomorrow at a meeting of Davos&apos;s World Economic Forum in Dalian. The sweeping initiative to secure the opportunities arising from tackling climate change is based on top-level business collaboration between the two superpowers, with some deals already done. One obstacle, however, will be growing trade friction over clean technology. Leading industrialists, entrepreneurs and financiers from the world&apos;s two biggest polluters have marked out the development strategy for a trillion dollar &quot;greentech&quot; market for inclusion in a bilateral climate agreement that is expected to be signed by the two governments when Obama visits China in November. The global clean technology market would get a major boost from any deal at the global climate summit in Copenhagen in December. Under the plan, cash from the two nations and private sector acumen would be used to massively expand China&apos;s solar, wind, carbon capture and smart-grid markets in a move that could be as groundbreaking as the commercialisation of the internet. The authors of the plan, which was six months in the making, sketched out their proposal at a gathering of business executives in Shanghai today. &quot;This is a coming-out party for China&apos;s &apos;greentech&apos; initiatives,&quot; said Ming Sung, of the Clean Air Task Force. &quot;China and the US can takeover the world on low-carbon technology.&quot; Executives from Boeing, General Electric and other major US firms talked to counterparts from China, including senior figures from Suntech, the solar cell maker, and BYD, a manufacturer of hybrid and electric cars. Rod Quinn, a regional director of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, was among those leading the charge for collaboration on &quot;clean coal&quot; technology. &quot;I&apos;m very upbeat,&quot; he said. &quot;Two great nations. One great plan. That&apos;s what we hope for.&quot; Chinese policymakers noted the government&apos;s focus on improving energy efficiency but were positive about the prospects for shared research in the fields such as gasification of coal for cleaner burning and the capturing and storing of carbon dioxide emissions. These two expensive technologies are expected to play a central role in minimising the impact of coal on global warming \u2013 both the US and China are heavily dependent on coal. The perception that technology development in China relies on western ideas \u2013 and a loose view of patents \u2013 is also changing. Progress was made in Shanghai last month on what has been billed as the world&apos;s biggest and most efficient carbon capture and storage project. The facility is expected to capture carbon at a cost of $40 (\u00a324) a tonne, compared to $100 a tonne at less-advanced facilities in the US. Its operating utility, Huaneng has already signed a commercial deal with Duke Energy, one of the biggest oil companies in the US. Chinese policy advisers said 105 geological sites, mostly saline aquifers and empty oil shafts, had been identified for possible carbon sequestration. China is also taking the lead in coal gasification technology, known as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology. GreenGen, an IGCC project now under construction in Shandong, is moving ahead, while a similar US project FutureGen is floundering. China&apos;s National Development and Reform Commission is considering four other IGCC plans. The potential for firms from both countries to make money through such projects was noted by Mark Norbon, the chairman of General Electric China whose company has sold more than 40 patents to China in the field of coal gasification technology. But even before details of the China Greentech Initiative were announced, accusations of protectionism threatened to overshadow its vision of collaboration. Mark Norbonwarned unfair trade practices could prevent progress. &quot;The two governments have to get rid of barriers blocking co-operation. On the Chinese side there have been moves towards protectionism.&quot; Such accusations have grown louder this year as Beijing has focussed the clean energy share of its massive 4 trillion yuan stimulus package on domestic firms. European wind turbine manufacturers complain they are being frozen out of a market that is doubling every year. Foreign complaints about China&apos;s solar industry also focus on dumping and government subsidies that give domestic firms an unfair advantage. Shi Zhengrong, the founder of Suntech defended his firm, saying it was making solar more affordable so it could compete with dirtier forms of energy. &quot;Western countries worry about the dramatic price reduction and talk about dumping. That shows a protectionist attitude. That&apos;s wrong. We must work together to promote and utilise each other&apos;s strengths,&quot; he said. For their part, China has criticised proposed US legislation that could impose punitive tariffs on goods produced in nations without carbon reduction targets. This results from many senators in the US worrying China may be taking the lead in the new energy sector. Almost all of China&apos;s solar panels are exported. But the domestic market is expected to grow when the government unveils a new policy of feed-in tariffs. &quot;We hope for a decision by the end of the year. It will be very important for the development of the Chinese market,&quot; Shi said. China is expected to make an announcement soon on its plans to ease the carbon intensity of its economy and its target for renewable energy. British companies are also trying to secure a share of the business in China. The UK&apos;s Carbon Trust today launched a new \u00a310m low-carbon technology investment joint venture to help British firms develop clean technologies in China. At a signing ceremony in Beijing with the China Energy Conservation Investment Corporation, Peter Mandelson, secretary of state for business, innovation and skills, said: &quot;As we enter a new era of innovation driven by the rapidly expanding low-carbon economy, we must ensure that UK companies benefit and develop overseas markets.&quot; The sentiment was shared in Shanghai. Ellen Carberry, managing director of the GreenTech initiative, said: &quot;We have to work together in this market to create a sustainable world.&quot;", "tags": ["Renewable energy", "Energy", "Climate change", "Environment", "Davos", "Business", "Energy", "Technology", "US news", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-09T14:50:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/09/stephen-maguire-shower-injury-shanghai", "sentences": ["Injuries were, unusually for snooker, a running theme at the Shanghai Masters, from which Stephen Maguire withdrew yesterday with a shoulder injury caused by slipping in his shower at home."], "title": "Stephen Maguire out of Shanghai Masters after bathroom fall", "article": "Injuries were, unusually for snooker, a running theme at the Shanghai Masters, from which Stephen Maguire withdrew yesterday with a shoulder injury caused by slipping in his shower at home.

It is understood that none of the 60 staff at the freesheet being made redundant have secured jobs at other News International titles, although negotiations are continuing. &quot;We wanted to open negotiations but we have been faced with a brick wall there,&quot; said Emerson. &quot;I think it&apos;s a shame really and price has been mentioned - we haven&apos;t discussed any money. After losing money for three years they have just decided to stop it without trying to get any money back, which I think is a little strange.&quot; Launched on 4 September 2006, the London Paper recorded a pre-tax loss of \u00a312.9m in the year to 29 June 2008 on a turnover of \u00a314.1m. In the previous 10 months it had lost \u00a316.8m. The paper had a free distribution of 500,348 copies in July, about 100,000 more than its Associated Newspapers rival, London Lite. The Shanghai Diving Dragon Cultural Broadcasting Company has a registered capital of 1.5m yuan, equivalent to \u00a3135,000. Emerson said that it planned to form a consortium with other companies to raise the capital needed to buy the London Paper. The company&apos;s magazine division employs 90 staff and plans to launch luxury car and golf titles next year. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

The studio is to create a family-friendly, live-action film featuring the blonde dolly, who turned 50 earlier this year, after completing a deal with toy manufacturer Mattel. &quot;Barbie is the most famous doll in history, a unique cultural icon in the world of brands,&quot; said Universal Pictures chairman Marc Shmuger. &quot;So many representations of Barbie frequent pop culture, but never before has she been brought to life in a motion picture.&quot; Barbie, or Barbara Millicent Roberts to be precise, was originally created by Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler, who saw a market for three-dimensional, adult-looking dolls with which girls could act out their dreams. She loosely based the doll on a racy German comic-book character called Lilli and renamed her Barbie, after her young daughter, Barbara. Barbie was unveiled at the 1959 toy fair in New York City and has never looked back since. The Universal-Mattel deal is not the first time that Barbie will be seen on screen. She had an effervescent cameo in Pixar&apos;s Toy Story 2 and, on the small screen, has starred in numerous direct-to-video animated titles. She also enjoys a mushrooming online presence including a Twitter feed, a fashion-centric blog, All Doll&apos;d Up, a Facebook profile and a dedicated YouTube channel. All of which undoubtedly contribute to Barbie&apos;s 99% worldwide brand awareness. A live-action film was described by Barbie general manager and Mattel senior VP Richard Dickson, who will executive produce the film, as part of a natural evolution. &quot;The brand wasn&apos;t ready for a movie,&quot; he said. &quot;In the last 10 years, Barbie has evolved from a toy into an intellectual property. We&apos;ve already had enormous success in the entertainment industry. Barbie has a proven track record in home entertainment, there have been live stage shows, live symphonies and other non-traditional forms of entertainment. There is a flagship store in Shanghai. There are a lot of ways we are already communicating with Barbie&apos;s audience, and there is a richness to the brand as an entertainment property.&quot; Further details on the film, including casting, have not yet been announced, with the producers keen to stress that they&apos;re in no hurry to rush out a product. &quot;Barbie may be the most popular girl in the world,&quot; said Lawrence Mark, who&apos;ll take on producing duties, &quot;and has always been a wonderfully aspirational figure, so we must do her proud.&quot; Barbie world \u2022 Her on-off boyfriend, Ken Carson, first put in an appearance in 1961.

She has also cared for over 40 pets including a panda, a lion cub and a zebra. \u2022 Her vocabulary has expanded greatly from 1992, when Mattel released Teen Talk Barbie whose phrases included, &quot;Will we ever have enough clothes?&quot;, &quot;I love shopping!&quot;, &quot;Wanna have a pizza party?&quot; and &quot;Math class is tough!&quot;, the last of which led to criticism from the American Association of University Women.", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Toys", "Universal Pictures"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-24T11:46:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/24/weinstein-company-staff-cuts", "sentences": ["By the end of the year, the look of the company will be complete, and we can continue releasing successful films.&quot; In June, the Weinstein Company hired financial advisers Miller Buckfire to help it restructure and delayed the release of two titles: the John Cusack and Gong Li-starring period thriller Shanghai and the romantic mystery All Good Things, directed by Andrew Jarecki of Capturing the Friedmans fame."], "title": "Troubled Weinstein Company lays off more staff", "article": "Its latest big release, Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Inglourious Basterds, has raked in close to $230m (\u00a3142m) at the worldwide box office so far.

The decision by the UK&apos;s biggest bank and largest company to move its chief executive to Asia comes at time when the traditional G7 power base is being overtaken by the wider group of nations in the G20, reflecting the growth in emerging markets such as China and India. The bank&apos;s chairman, Stephen Green, was adamant that Geoghegan was not &quot;turning his back on London&quot; and denied the move would result in the gradual shift in HSBC&apos;s business out of London to Hong Kong. The Financial Services Authority, which will continue to be the main regulator of the bank, had sanctioned Geoghegan&apos;s move, Green said. The bank will continue to be headquartered at its landmark tower in Canary Wharf, east London, and Green insisted that tax laws and the regulatory environment still made the UK the most attractive placed to be based. Even so, one banks analyst said the move was likely to be an early signal that HSBC would eventually return to its roots in Asia, after rapid expansion in the UK and the US in the last 20 years. HSBC was created in Hong Hong in 1865 and has only been based in London since 1993 when it was forced to relocate following its takeover of Midland bank. It wants to make more than 60% of its profits from emerging markets and has 30% of its shareholders based there. It wants to be the first overseas company to list its shares in Shanghai and Geoghegan&apos;s move to Hong Kong might help its talks with the authorities. Green highlighted prospects for growth in China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. Geoghegan, 55, has been chief executive since 2006 but despite being British and working for HSBC for 36 years, he has spent less than 10 years of his career working in his homeland and is known to enjoy the expat life. His wife is moving with him to Hong Kong although he denied that the move would help him avoid the new 50% tax rate in the UK. &quot;I will be analysed for tax in the UK,&quot; he said. Geoghegan made it clear that future chief executives would be based on Hong Kong and that this was not just a move for him. Speculation may now be prompted about his successor after Asian-based Sandy Flockhart was promoted to chairman of personal and commercial banking and London-based Stuart Gulliver, who runs the investment bank, given the extra responsibility of chairman of Europe and the Middle East. HSBC always appoints its chief executive internally. Geoghegan is taking 15 staff with him but will also keep an office in London where he committed to spending at least one day a month and most likely 70 working days a year. The bank had no information about any changes to his pay or whether he would receive relocation allowances following the move, which will take place on 1 February. Geoghegan&apos;s Hong Kong move led to concerns about communication challenges with Green, who will be based in London, and Douglas Flint, the finance director.", "tags": ["HSBC", "Banking", "Business", "Economics", "UK news", "World news", "Michael Geoghegan"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-25T16:41:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/26/dubai-abu-dhabi-reviews", "sentences": ["By the start of the 21st century, both cities had high-rise skylines to rival Shanghai and Hong Kong."], "title": "Middle Eastern affairs | Book reviews", "article": "Over the past half century, Abu Dhabi and Dubai have emerged from obscurity to global prominence as the richest and fastest-growing cities in the world, respectively. In March, 2007, Forbes Magazine declared Abu Dhabi the richest city in the world. Its 420,000 citizens, who sit on one-tenth of the world&apos;s oil, are worth about $17m apiece. Dubai, much less favoured with oil reserves, has speculated on its strategic location to siphon its neighbours&apos; oil wealth into its own economy through trade, finance and leisure. The ultimate service economy, Dubai lives on momentum, never daring to slow lest it be overtaken by its rivals. The high standard of living has come at a price to the environment. By 2008, the Worldwide Fund for Nature&apos;s Living Planet report ranked the United Arab Emirates (of which both Abu Dhabi and Dubai are member states) at the top of the list of carbon emissions, with an ecological footprint of 9.5 global hectares per person \u2013 exceeding the United States (number two, at 9.4 hectares) and Britain (5.3 hectares), and more than triple the global average of 2.7 hectares. The report claimed that if everyone consumed at the same rate as Abu Dhabi and Dubai, it would take four and a half times the Earth&apos;s resources to provide for them. It wasn&apos;t always so. On the eve of the discovery of oil in the late 1950s, both city states had populations numbering in the tens of thousands, with no electricity or paved roads. In 1971, when the seven sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf formed the federation known as the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai were only beginning to reap the benefits of their oil wealth. By the start of the 21st century, both cities had high-rise skylines to rival Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is hard to think of another part of the world that has experienced such rapid change in modern times. For Jo Tatchell, who lived in Abu Dhabi as a child in the 70s, and returned after graduating from university for a brief stint in the 90s, the pace of change is unsettling. A Diamond in the Desert is a welcome addition to the short list of books on Abu Dhabi. An independent journalist and author of an acclaimed book on Iraq (Nabeel&apos;s Song: A Family Story of Survival in Iraq), Tatchell returned to Abu Dhabi to see what had become of the place and to resolve a dark story in her family&apos;s past. A Diamond in the Desert moves between past and present, as Tatchell tracks down old family friends and long-term expatriate residents in Abu Dhabi for their stories. She grows exasperated with a forward-looking society that shows so little concern for conserving its past, captured in her largely unsuccessful efforts to locate the UAE national press archive of &quot;old&quot; (ie dating back to independence in 1971) newspapers. She clearly has mixed feelings about the development of the Abu Dhabi archipelago. She remembered Saadiyat Island as a beach retreat for family picnics in the 70s, and tries to imagine the same spot transformed into a world-class cultural centre with branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim designed by signature architects. It was, in fact, Saadiyat Island that was to be the centre of the family secret, after Tatchell&apos;s brother witnessed a fatal boating accident there in 1994. He tried to help the injured, but discovered that one of the victims, a UAE citizen, had been nearly decapitated by an outboard motor propeller. Fearful lest he be blamed for the death of a local, and horrified by what he had witnessed, he left Abu Dhabi within the month, never to return. He did not mention the event until Tatchell&apos;s return visit to write this book. By the time AP journalist Jim Krane reached Dubai in January 2005, he was already faced with a boom town that had commandeered 10% of the world&apos;s\u00a0cranes to build its ambitions. Never having known the sleepy little port of the 60s, he comes to his subject unburdened with nostalgia. He is clearly fascinated by the story of how such a global city emerged from such unlikely foundations. Written as a narrative history, Dubai: The Story of the World&apos;s Fastest City begins with the emirate&apos;s tribal and imperial history in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Even in the old days Dubai catered to conspicuous consumption, its early economy based on pearl diving. The crash of 1929 and the Japanese invention of cultured pearls meant that Dubai lost its primary export, and was forced back on its role as a regional port serving Iran, India and eastern Arabia. The origins of modern Dubai lie in three radical expansions of its port facilities. In the late 50s, the ruler dredged Dubai creek to make the port accessible to deeper draft shipping. When the work was completed in 1961, Dubai was the most accessible and important port on the Trucial Coast. A decade later, Sheikh Rashid applied his country&apos;s limited oil revenues to dredge a massive deep-water port, completed in 1971 and inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth in 1972. And in 1983, Dubai opened the world&apos;s largest man-made harbour and one of the largest dry-dock facilities . . . one year before the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war entered a new stage in which they targeted oil tankers. The port facilities have been over-subscribed ever since. Dubai was open for trade. Since the 90s, Dubai has really taken off: the creation of a media city, a technology city and an international finance centre governed by the laws of the City of London have all served to attract the global leaders in finance, IT and the press. The construction industry, building the sky-scrapers to house these new service industries, has boomed. Krane relates the stories behind the iconic super-luxury hotel, the Burj al-Arab, the construction of the world&apos;s tallest building, the Burj Dubai (burj is the Arabic word for &quot;tower&quot;), the Palm project \u2013 a residential and tourism complex of man-made islands for the super rich \u2013 and many other excesses that have kept Dubai in the world&apos;s eye. Both books approach their subjects through the lens of visionary leaders. The late Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan is credited with both holding the young United Arab Emirates together after the British withdrawal in 1971, and with overseeing the development of his own state during his 38-year reign (1966-2004). The current standard-bearer of the Al Nahyan vision is his son, the crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, who Tatchell says &quot;wants to go down in history as the man who took his people into a new age of enlightenment&quot;. Dubai is treated as the brainchild of Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum (who ruled from 1958 to 1990) and his capable son, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the current ruler. Yet the books also tell of the loyal lieutenants, the elites of the emirates, who realised the leaders&apos; vision. And both Tatchell and Krane dwell at some length on the emirates&apos; poor record on the treatment of the migrant labourers who build, clean and service these exuberant cities. After so many years of boom, the bust of 2008 has cast a heavy shadow over Abu Dhabi and Dubai \u2013 Dubai in particular. Suddenly, the thriving property market was revealed to be a pyramid scheme and collapsed. Huge infrastructural projects were abandoned. Businesses went broke, workers were laid off. Retailers were hard hit, and the enormous new malls teeter on the brink of failure. Dubai turned to Abu Dhabi for a bail-out. It is still too early to determine how deep the recession will prove in the Emirates, and if Abu Dhabi intends to use its new leverage over Dubai to bring its upstart neighbour into line, or to enjoy a larger cut of the profits when Dubai recovers. Neither Krane nor Tatchell speculates on what the future holds for the most globalised corner of the Arab world. It is enough that they tell the fascinating story of how Abu Dhabi and Dubai reached the current crossroad.

The nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s vicious crackdown in Shanghai in 1927 threatened to wipe out the party completely. But communist armed forces established bases in the south and turned from the urban poor to the peasantry as the base of their support. As Chiang Kai-shek continued his campaign against them, they embarked on the Long March in 1934: an astounding journey taking them thousands of miles to a new centre in the north. Three years later, the two sides were forced into an alliance against a common enemy \u2013 the Japanese, who had invaded. By the end of the second world war, full-scale civil war resumed and Communist party membership, and the Red forces, had mushroomed. After three more years of bitter fighting \u2013 resulting in at least two million deaths, according to official figures \u2013 Mao Zedong proclaimed the creation of the People&apos;s Republic of China on 1 October 1949. The last six decades have seen extraordinary accomplishments, misjudgments and atrocities and remarkable reversals. The party would seize land and hand it to peasant farmers; force them to form communes; then allow them to farm it individually again. The 30 years since reform and opening have seen the undoing of much of the previous 30&apos;s work, as &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot; \u2013 a capitalist economy, allied to the existing political system \u2013 has transformed the nation Mao made. Hou Bo, Mao&apos;s photographer Hou Bo should never have got the assignment. Aged just 25, she had picked up a camera after stints as a nurse and teaching peasant farmers to read. But the more experienced photographers were in the provinces and could not reach Beijing in time. So when Chairman Mao stood on the rostrum of Tiananmen Square and proclaimed the creation of the People&apos;s Republic to cheering crowds beneath, it was Hou who captured the moment. Crammed into a tiny space \u2013 with her husband, Xu Xiaobing, who was filming \u2013 she struggled to compose a shot with her Rolleiflex. &quot;The machine could only take 12 pictures at a time. I didn&apos;t have a wide-angle or long lens,&quot; she says. Leaning far back over the rails, she realised it was a long way down if she fell. &quot;It was dangerous \u2013 very dangerous. But I was very excited and this photo was very important,&quot; she says. &quot;Later, I noticed somebody was hanging on to my shirt [to protect me]. I turned around and had a look. Oh \u2013 it was Zhou Enlai.&quot; Zhou was, after Mao, one of the defining figures of the revolution; while Mao led the country, Zhou was premier. The result was the first in a string of iconic shots. Hou became Mao&apos;s personal photographer and, over 12 years, produced pictures that burnished his image and shaped the way he is seen even now: on the seashore; pensive before the Yellow river; jovial in a crowd. Many other pictures were not revealed until after his death, judged too intimate or inappropriate to his stature. She grew to know the chairman well and talks fondly of his love for swimming \u2013 sometimes with a lit cigarette in his mouth. Living in party headquarters, she became so close to other leaders that she would confide in them; &quot;They treated us as family members,&quot; she says. Hou had grown up in the communist fold, joining after her family fled invading Japanese troops. It provided her marriage and her career; she met her husband in Yan&apos;an \u2013 the revolutionary base \u2013 and learned from him how to take pictures. But the couple&apos;s loyalty was no protection against the brutal excesses of the cultural revolution. Both were beaten savagely and exiled to labour camps \u2013 separately \u2013 in the countryside for years. She is not clear why she was persecuted; millions of others were too, and hundreds of thousands killed. Like many, she blames those around Mao, not the man himself. &quot;Jiang Qing [Mao&apos;s wife, and one of the notorious &apos;gang of four&apos;] criticised me . . . saying I was a fake party member; those sorts of accusations,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I joined at the age of 14. These accusations could not stand up. But there was no way out, so I just did the labour work.&quot; Her ordeal ended when the cultural revolution petered out in the mid-1970s. No one told her she could leave, but when even the guards abandoned the fields, she walked away, back to her family. Only in 1977 \u2013 a decade after the accusations \u2013 was she exonerated. Frail but articulate, she lives in a comfortable Beijing flat with her husband, now 94, their son and daughter-in-law. Alongside the pictures of Hou and Xu with Mao and other leaders, there is one of their son with the magician David Copperfield. Like their country, the couple have been on a long and strange journey. &quot;We&apos;ve had many good experiences, but there have been some mistakes. Ordinary people can understand that.&quot; Hu Muying, daughter of Mao&apos;s secretary     Hu Muying, daughter of Mao's secretary.   Photo by Dan Chung Photograph: Dan Chung/Dan Chung    They say the revolution was born in Yan&apos;an. So was Hu Muying. She arrived at the communist base in 1941, the year her father became Mao Zedong&apos;s secretary. Her mother was another loyal cadre. &quot;Jiang Qing [&apos;Madame Mao&apos;, a key figure in the cultural revolution] often asked us children to go to her home to play with [their daughter] Li Na,&quot; says Hu. &quot;We only knew the chairman as a very kind and friendly &apos;uncle&apos;.&quot; As they grew up, they followed him about. &quot;He would take us out and walk around. And we could ride on his jeep \u2013 that was great fun. He liked listening to Beijing opera and Li Na and other kids could sing a few lines,&quot; she recalls. Then, in spring 1949, the communists marched into Beijing. Hu remembers the excitement of listening to the founding ceremony on her school&apos;s radio; and, later, of learning about the creation of the communes. Her class smelted iron in the Great Leap Forward \u2013 the disastrous, ideologically driven attempt, that started in 1957, to send harvests and industrial production skyrocketing. Instead, it produced a famine which killed tens of millions.But to urban youth the era was intoxicating: &quot;We felt this was the new China . . . every day something new happened,&quot; she says. Her father, Hu Qiaomu, helped draft China&apos;s first constitution; her mother, Gu Yu, worked on projects to build the atomic bomb and first satellite. Their work was so sensitive that she learned about it mainly after their deaths \u2013 and through denouncements of them in the cultural revolution. &quot;Those 10 years were a big spiritual transition for us,&quot; she says. Her parents were purged and Hu, a new graduate, sent to work in a foundry. &quot;Everyone was working hard to construct the new China. How could everything suddenly become like this?&quot; she asks, even now a little bewildered. But her parents had no doubts about Mao&apos;s leadership, pointing to the country&apos;s growing industry and international heft. &quot;Though they were criticised and denounced, they believed Chairman Mao&apos;s intention in starting these activities was for China&apos;s interest. Personal pain was not a big deal if the country was better,&quot; she says. Hu Qiaomu remained a hardline Marxist who, after rehabilitation, blocked reformists and opposed the economic changes which set China on its current path. His daughter, at 68, is director of Sons and Daughters of Yan&apos;an: her peers gather regularly to mark their parents&apos; achievements. For her, it is simple: &quot;Mao Zedong, in my heart, is a great man. If the sun has a black spot, it is still the sun,&quot; she says. Besides, she says, mistakes were corrected and now the country is developing fast. She worries about the &quot;more and more serious&quot; problems of corruption, drug use and prostitution, but adds that she is reassured by the zeal of officials tackling such issues. Still, there is a shade of wistfulness as she suggests that people are happiest in their childhood and youth. &quot;As you grew older, everything got more and more complicated,&quot; Hu says. &quot;There was good news; and at the same time you would see things you did not wish to see or hear.&quot; Sidney Rittenberg, GI turned cadre           Sidney Rittenberg missed the proclamation of the People&apos;s Republic. It was months later that he learned of its creation. &quot;They put me in a cell [where] the windows were boarded up and there was newspaper pasted over the boards on the inside. And one of the papers was for 1 October, the People&apos;s Daily in big red print,&quot; he says. It was a bittersweet moment. Rittenberg, who had arrived in China as a US soldier in the early 40s, stayed on and ended up joining the communists at their base in Yan&apos;an in 1946.The young idealist&apos;s leftwing beliefs were reinforced by what he saw on his arrival. &quot;Human beings were treated very cheaply. If you had some standing \u2013 power, money \u2013 you could just wipe people out,&quot; he says. &quot;If you asked a country person what he did, he wouldn&apos;t say, &apos;I&apos;m a farmer.&apos; He&apos;d say, &apos;I suffer.&apos;&quot; But he saw a sharp contrast between the corruption of Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s nationalists, siphoning foreign aid into the black market, and the communists. &quot;I felt it was like living with the early Christians \u2013 those kinds of stories; the top leaders lived very frugal lives,&quot; he says. He joined them to work on propaganda and monitoring the foreign media \u2013 including the Guardian. Despite the apparent puritanism, the Saturday dances and gin rummy sessions in Mao&apos;s cave-house were a shock after the earnest conversation of American communists in the US. &quot;People like Zhou Enlai, Zhu De \u2013 as you played, they would cuff each other around and tease each other and have great sport,&quot; he says. Then he pauses. &quot;Mao liked to play too. But no one cuffed him around.&quot; He chuckles. Rittenberg distinguishes between the man he knew then and the near-emperor of later years \u2013 the first, &quot;the best listener I had ever met&quot;; the second, holding forth \u2013 though not everyone has such a rosy view of the early days. Political purges had begun long before the party reached Yan&apos;an. By the time Rittenberg&apos;s dreams of a revolution became true, he had been jailed for attempting to wreck it: &quot;I didn&apos;t know that Stalin had personally sent a written message to Mao, asking that I be arrested as chief of an international spy ring.&quot; Despite 16 years in solitary confinement, Rittenberg chose to stay in China when released and was reinstated in official communist circles. He became an enthusiastic advocate of the cultural revolution, only to fall victim himself, leading to his second spell in jail and the persecution of his family. &quot;No one in his right mind would choose to have that sort of holocaust,&quot; he says. But, he added, it made people more critical; less willing to believe what they were told. And he cites the staggering improvements in life expectancy \u2013 which has more than doubled \u2013 as proof of the last 60 years&apos; worth of achievements. &quot;But could it have been done with less sacrifice?&quot; he asks. &quot;Undoubtedly it could.&quot; Liu Tianyou, Red Army soldier     Former soldier Liu Tianyou, aged 95, who was on the Long march, in hospital in Yan'an, Shaanxi, China.   Photo by Dan Chung Photograph: Dan Chung/Dan Chung    She didn&apos;t have a name of her own until she was 17. No one had thought she needed or deserved one. She had no mother, no father and no money; she was a girl. She survived by herding pigs and selling rice liquor on the streets. And when Red Army recruiters in the early 1930s arrived in her hometown in Sichuan province, she enrolled with the name they gave her: Liu Tianyou. Now, at 95, she lives in a care home for veterans in the former communist base of Yan&apos;an, Shaanxi. Few of her former comrades enjoy this comfort; but, as another resident explained, the authorities like them to live there &quot;to do propaganda and education work&quot;. Liu has become something of a celebrity as a communist stalwart. She took part in the Olympic torch relay and though she never met Mao, &quot;Chairman Hu&quot; \u2013 as she calls the Chinese president \u2013 visited her recently. When we arrive she is in hospital, recovering from respiratory problems. Even using an oxygen mask, each sentence is a slow, painful struggle \u2013 yet she is keen to talk. &quot;The power of the masses was mighty . . . The Red Army attacked despotic gentry and evil landlords, people who exploited our country and exploited individuals,&quot; she says, recalling her reasons for joining. &quot;Everybody was unified. The Red Army never scolded people or beat people up. It never looked down on ordinary people, whether they were rich or poor. If you were poor, they would give you food and clothes to wear.&quot; Not all veterans have such rosy memories; others tell of forced recruitment, brutal purges and strategic errors. What all agree on, however, is the improbability of their victory. Vastly outnumbered and outgunned by Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Kuomintang, many fought with spears, clubs and wooden &quot;guns&quot; until they could capture Kuomintang  weapons. The lucky had cloth shoes; others wore grass sandals. Liu was there for the hardest part of all: the Long March. Driven out of their southern bases by the nationalists, the communists trekked for 8,000 miles in desperate conditions to their new base in Yan&apos;an. Their extraordinarily circuitous route reflected uncertainty about their ultimate destination, as well as the need to avoid hostile forces. Only a fifth of them completed the journey: barely 40,000. Others deserted, fell in battle or starved along the way. Yet this ignominious retreat became enshrined as a glorious victory; the guts of survivors made it a founding myth. The bitterest time, Liu recalls, was crossing the grasslands and the snow-covered mountains. Many froze to death. Desperate for nourishment, the troops stripped bark from the trees to eat and boiled up their leather belts. &quot;The soldiers before her had eaten all the grass; she had to eat the grass&apos;s roots,&quot; her son tells us. Yet Liu remembers her soldiering days with relish. &quot;The Kuomintang wanted to wipe out the communists. Aiya! The Red Army had such strong power. How could you finish them off? Wherever you went, the Red Army was there. The Red Army is wily!&quot; She takes as much delight in the republic she helped to found: &quot;China is a great country now.

Baosteel has tabled a proposal to pay \u00a31bn for a 30% stake in Anglo&apos;s huge Minas Rio iron ore mine in Brazil, which it acquired last year for \u00a33.7bn. If Anglo agrees a deal with Baosteel, the Chinese company could help it fend off bids from predators such as Xstrata, which was told last week by the City&apos;s Takeover Panel to make a formal bid for Anglo by 20 October or walk away. Baosteel, which is based in Shanghai, employs 112,000 staff and generates annual revenue of $21.5bn (\u00a313.5bn). It is keen to expand internationally and has been exploring opportunities in Africa and Asia as well as South America. Anglo has made it clear that it is seeking a partner to help develop Minas Rio, which is expected to produce more than 35m tonnes of iron ore by 2011. Production could rise by another 50% within a decade. Two other companies are understood to have contacted Anglo about buying a stake in Minas \u2013 the Bahrain-based Gulf Industrial Investment Company and Sojitz, a Japanese conglomerate. But Baosteel is understood to be the frontrunner. Latin America is Anglo&apos;s fastest growing region and this week the group will take shareholders and analysts to Brazil and Chile to review its operations there. The trip is being seen by the company as an &quot;opportunity to showcase Anglo&apos;s most attractive assets and to outline future growth prospects&quot;. Observers believe Anglo&apos;s management want to emphasise the &quot;hidden value&quot; within the company to underline their opposition to Xstrata&apos;s proposal for a nil-premium merger, which would create a company worth \u00a340bn. Anglo&apos;s shareholders have made it clear to new chairman Sir John Parker, who took over from Mark Moody-Stuart in August, that Xstrata&apos;s offer is unacceptable because of the absence of any takeover premium. Insiders say Parker is implacably opposed to a deal with Xstrata on the basis of the terms outlined four months ago. Xstrata, led by Mick Davis, is under pressure to add a cash component to any future offer for Anglo, but will need to raise funds via a rights issue to make additional cash available. If Xstrata can find the money for a premium, shareholders are likely to force Anglo&apos;s management into talks.

Not for him a storming of the barricades and a rapid expansion of HSBC&apos;s balance sheet when the outlook remains so uncertain. Geoghegan prefers a more measured approach \u2013 and rightly so, as investors would react badly if he took risks at this stage of the economic cycle. Like others, he believes there may be months, even years, of pain ahead, and possibly a couple of serious wobbles on the stockmarket before recovery takes hold. But though nervous about the backdrop, Geoghegan is viewing the world from a position of strength. HSBC has weathered this recession better than nearly all of its competitors, many of which have been rescued by the taxpayer and are now controlled by government. Its balance sheet has been bolstered by March&apos;s \u00a312.5bn rights issue, the biggest in UK corporate history, a move that boosted its capital ratios and gave it the financial headroom to make medium-sized acquisitions. Last week, the bank was in pole position to acquire assets in Asia being sold by two troubled western financial groups \u2013 ING and RBS \u2013 for around $2bn (\u00a31.2bn), chickenfeed for a bank capitalised on the London market at \u00a3122bn. Its funding base is the envy of the industry: a loan-to-deposit ratio of just 84% reflects its status as a magnet for savers seeking safety. HSBC has a reputation for being conservative and risk-averse, and this has stood it in good stead during the credit crunch. But its record is hardly unblemished: it blotted its copybook by investing in US sub-prime lender Household, on its own admission destroying about $10bn of shareholder value since the acquisition in 2003. Executives led by Sir John Bond, then the bank&apos;s chairman, talked regularly about the bank having more than 100 employees with PhDs and expertise at predicting consumer behaviour. But they did not predict the collapse of the US mortgage market. It is clear that HSBC expanded Household and bought other banks&apos; risky subprime mortgages in the mistaken belief that it was better able to assess the risks. It has now scaled back its US consumer finance operations, closing much of them to new business. But HSBC is a huge corporate animal and profits at its international businesses have held up remarkably well. So well, in fact, that it has been able to withstand the damage from Household with relative ease. An analysis of its 2007 results shows that 63% of group profit came from Asia and Latin America, illustrating its dependence on emerging markets, where the credit crunch has been less severe. Known in the industry as &quot;the big elephant&quot;, HSBC could generate 60% of profit from Asia alone in 10 years, say analysts. So important is the region to the bank that it announced recently that Geoghegan would move from London to Hong Kong, where HSBC was established in 1865 as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. As part of a wider management reshuffle, chairman Stephen Green will cede responsibility for group strategy to Geoghegan, though Green will continue in a full-time executive role. The timing of the announcement, close to the 60th anniversary of the communists coming to power in China, could hardly have been more significant. HSBC is already the biggest foreign bank in a country where the market potential is viewed as vast. Currying favour with the Chinese is both sensible and necessary if you are serious about growing in a nation with 1.3 billion people. HSBC is preparing to list on the Shanghai stockmarket in a bid to draw in local investors and further raise its profile, and this could happen within months, according to City experts. Simon Maughan, an analyst at MF Global, says: &quot;You can&apos;t overestimate the importance of China. If the Chinese were to move towards more open capital markets, perhaps allowing foreign institutions to invest in Chinese government debt, HSBC would be better positioned than any other western bank because it already has such a big presence in Hong Kong. The rewards would be enormous.&quot; Other analysts are more circumspect. One says: &quot;Asia is not without its risks: there are already signs that asset prices are overheating, so HSBC have to be careful. On the other hand, they are punching below their weight in personal financial services, so they need to do something.&quot; Green said that Geoghegan&apos;s move to Hong Kong was rich in symbolism and underlined the fact that Asia and China were &quot;at the heart of HSBC&apos;s business&quot;. The manoeuvre has the added benefit of addressing criticism from Knight Vinke, the activist investment group, which argues that the chairman should be less involved in day-to-day strategy, and that the bank should have been focusing more on Asia. By putting Geoghegan in Hong Kong with overarching executive powers, HSBC has tacitly admitted that Knight Vinke might have been right all along. But the bigger point HSBC has demonstrated is that if you do not have your top executive in Hong Kong, your commitment to China may be viewed as half-hearted. There is no doubt that other banks will sit up and take notice, as will multinational corporations that are targeting China for expansion. &quot;You have to be there on the ground if you want to be taken seriously,&quot; says Maughan.", "tags": ["HSBC", "Banking", "Credit crunch", "Business", "China", "Michael Geoghegan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-10T23:05:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/oct/11/tales-ballycumber-blue-dragon-clapp", "sentences": ["A loft in Shanghai, lacquered like a Chinese box, is split horizontally: architecturally accurate but also psychologically telling."], "title": "Tales of Ballycumber, The Blue Dragon | Theatre reviews", "article": "Dublin&apos;s tiger economy has long ceased to roar. But theatre is booming on the banks of the Liffey. An evening in the stalls is relatively cheap and the Ulster Bank Dublin theatre festival makes it look like very good value indeed. A new play by Sebastian Barry is the perfect linchpin for the homegrown wing, which will also include Conor McPherson&apos;s new version of The Birds. Tales of Ballycumber draws on a tradition of sad stories told by the hearth, and on a history of sectarian division so near the surface of memory that it begins to strangle the present. Rendered in Barry&apos;s richly laden dialogue, it teems with spectres and omens and storms. Its geraniums are blood red; its smiles are &quot;as wide as Wicklow&quot;. This could easily be too much of an Irish thing. But its pivot is subtle and unexpected: an ageing farmer, a gentle bachelor, is so ensnared by his own stories that he can&apos;t hear the voices of others. He precipitates a tragedy not through malevolence but by inattention. Excellent Stephen Rea creaks around his kitchen with the self-absorption of the accustomed solitary, at ease with long moments of stillness and silence. He has had problems with jackdaws building in his chimney: they might consider a move to his hair. His sister pays him a visit as if she were a district nurse. Planted in sensible shoes, Derbhle Crotty gives Tania exactly the right mix of stolidity and exasperation. She&apos;s borne a lot from a bullying father whose first brutality took place at her christening: her full name is Britannia. David Leveaux&apos;s production captures the homely as well as the eldritch in all this. The design by Mike Britton floats the scrubby farm interior like an island among a host of yellow daffodils: the blooms are so bright and abundant that when the action darkens, their gaiety looks vicious. Through them a young girl comes singing: not a plangent piece of Gaelic, but &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. The French-Canadian director (and designer, actor and writer) Robert Lepage heads up the international part of the festival with the UK premiere of The Blue Dragon. This sequel to his 1985 Dragon Trilogy is a mixed sac. The plot is conventional, playing around with pretty much every possible permutation in the relationships of a young Chinese woman artist, her older French lover, his blotto ex-wife and a baby. The dialogue is meagrely written and sometimes so stiltedly spoken that it&apos;s as if some obscure irony were being practised. Yet there is real splendour in the visual storytelling. A miniature train, a line of lit-up windows, speeds across the stage; a character then appears inside a full-size version of such a train, silhouetted against one of those windows. A blizzard of snow sends the whole stage into a fizzing storm, buzzing like a telly without an aerial. On a video screen a beneficent, long-bearded Confucian sage is seen nodding gravely, and is then seen to be enthusiastically endorsing Kentucky Fried Chicken. These are not only pleasing images. They are ideograms showing a China caught between past and future, and characters suspended between different lives. In the opening scene a man both practises and describes Chinese calligraphy. As he makes his first line, a brushstroke appears enlarged on a screen. That first simple horizontal bar can, he points out, stand for a division between sky and earth and between the known and the unknown. And from then on this story of two cultures, and of concealment and lies, is played out on a stage that is always divided. Sometimes the division is barely perceptible: it just makes sense. A loft in Shanghai, lacquered like a Chinese box, is split horizontally: architecturally accurate but also psychologically telling.

Although this particular Maggie&apos;s, the sixth in a projected 14, is attached to Charing Cross hospital in wealthy Fulham, anyone diagnosed with cancer can come off the street, from anywhere, and, in calm and safety, start to try to deal with the fact that they may be facing the end of their life. Because while other things are of course offered, besides tea and cake \u2013 psychologists; guided internet searching, where a specialist explains the terminology; nutritionists; stress management courses; tai chi; courses for carers \u2013 the beautiful building, designed by Richard Rogers&apos;s firm Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, and shortlisted for this year&apos;s Stirling architecture prize; the gardens, by Dan Pearson; and the attention to every detail, from jugs to hinges, are an integral part of the process. &quot;You&apos;re communicating to people when they come in the door that they&apos;re of value,&quot; says Laura Lee, who was a specialist cancer nurse before she became chief executive here. She has a girlish presence, a supple voice, and a sudden, outsize laugh. &quot;The touch of the building is important \u2013 so the wood is a lovely material to touch. The smell of the building \u2013 we&apos;re communicating that this is not a hospital. For people with cancer, hospital becomes very much associated with clinical, technical smells, particularly when they&apos;re getting chemotherapy, and there&apos;s anticipatory nausea.&quot; And the cup of tea \u2013 well, &quot;part of the issue is not to make it this thing where you&apos;re led down a corridor, and you know, &apos;Sit down, tell me how you feel&apos;&quot;. The Maggie after whom the centres are named put it even more strongly: &quot;Most hospital environments say to the patient, in effect: &apos;How you feel is unimportant. You are not of value. Fit in with us, not us with you.&apos;&quot; Lee&apos;s connection with Maggie&apos;s started with Maggie herself. Margaret Keswick Jencks was a writer and garden designer who was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s. Lee, who administered her chemotherapy, noticed &quot;her smile. How she carried herself. She had the walk of a ballerina without being a ballerina. She had a gentle, inviting way. She was someone you just wanted to approach.&quot; Over the next 18 months they grew close, through the chemotherapy, through phone calls about blood work, through Jencks&apos;s many questions \u2013 how could she support her children, her husband, her mother? What questions should she ask her doctor? What diets would help? Why was there nowhere in the hospital where she could go to cry? Used to being surrounded by beauty, she returned again and again to its complete absence in a clinical setting: did life and death have to be played out under strip lighting, among bare walls, bleak corridors? Gradually the idea for Maggie&apos;s took shape. Jencks was the only child of a wealthy family. Her father ran the Scottish trading company Jardine Matheson, and she was brought up in Shanghai and Hong Kong before being sent to school in England. She studied English at Oxford, for a while ran a boutique, Annacat, where she and Janet Lyle gave the first house-room to Laura Ashley; she was photographed by David Bailey and Patrick Lichfield. She left to study at the Architectural Association, where she met her husband, architecture critic Charles Jencks; Rem Koolhaas, Frank Gehry (with whom Margaret collaborated on a garden), Zaha Hadid and Richard Rogers were among their friends (hence the extraordinary list of architects who have built, or are slated to build, Maggie&apos;s centres across Britain. Gehry, Hadid, Rogers, Richard Murphy and David Page have already done theirs (Gehry is to design another, in Hong Kong); Wilkinson Eyre, Kisho Kurokawa, Piers Gough, Foreign Office Architects, and Richard MacCormac are signed up for more. &quot;I am a sanguine character,&quot; Jencks wrote in A View from the Front Line, published in medical journal The Breast, &quot;and for 48 years my life was exceptionally easy. So easy that for me breast cancer seemed almost like a payment of dues.&quot; Lee&apos;s own background is quite different. She grew up in Peterhead, &quot;a pretty cold bit of Scotland&quot; known for its fishing, farming, and particularly for its prison. Her father was an electrician in the mines, worked in the nearby power station, and then became head of operations at what became Scottish and Southern Energy. Of her three younger brothers, two survived into adulthood. Lee left home at 16, to become a nurse. &quot;I told my mum I wanted to do nursing and she laughed at me and told me I was the most uncaring person she knew. I think that solidified my resolve, actually \u2013 I would show mum I was a caring and considerate person even if she didn&apos;t appreciate that aspect of me. So that&apos;s why I went off and did it, and it&apos;s been a\u00a0fantastic profession \u2013 I&apos;ve had no regrets about it whatsoever.&quot; She chose cancer nursing because she liked the long-term nature of it, the opportunity to get to know patients and to help them through some of the most intense moments of their lives. But Jencks&apos;s death, surrounded by blueprints for the first Maggie&apos;s centre, was the hardest to witness in all her professional life. &quot;I was back giving her treatment. And I had gone from being a professional delivering technical and emotional care to a personal [friend] \u2026 she stayed at my house, on the floor, in a bed-settee. So when she came in again and [the cancer] recurred \u2013 the thing about being professional is that you keep your professional hat on, but it was painful.&quot; She has run the charity ever since, from Edinburgh, and now from London. In the process, and with the involvement of Charles Jencks, she has become one of the most adventurous commissioners of architecture in the country. She misses Scottish skies, and knows exactly how long she&apos;s been away from them \u2013 &quot;five years and 11 months&quot; \u2013 but her oncology professor husband, who, although he grew up in Scotland is of Egyptian descent, loves London, &quot;adores the multiculturalism aspect of it&quot;, the relief from &quot;Morningside women in twinsets and pearls&quot;, so she suspects they, and their three children, will stay. Even though she had been so involved, all along, she didn&apos;t viscerally understand the importance of the architecture until the first centre was up and running. &quot;I had the perspective that it&apos;s the people, and the professionals you employ, and their capacity to deliver and do an excellent job \u2013 I mean, for me the surprise was when people came into the Edinburgh centre, the first one, and they used language like they felt the building &apos;hugged&apos; them.&quot; Even more importantly, &quot;I discovered that the same people I had been seeing in my clinical nurse role, only a few hundred yards away, would come to see me at Maggie&apos;s and tell me things that they had never shared with me. And you know \u2013 I regarded myself as a pretty good communicator, as someone who did their best to give time, in addition to the technical stuff, but there was something about coming in that door that allowed people to talk about their real feelings and fears in a way that they couldn&apos;t with their doctor or nurse because they might alter the dose of the drugs or think they weren&apos;t coping.&quot; There is also, with doctors, the fact that &quot;there&apos;s an inevitable power relationship, and whenever you have that, it inevitably changes the dynamics of how one communicates&quot;. It&apos;s not that most consultants don&apos;t know that the news they give their patients has vast psychological ramifications, it&apos;s that there just isn&apos;t the time to address it. When the Gehry-designed Maggie&apos;s at Dundee&apos;s Ninewells hospital was being planned, its three full-time cancer doctors were treating 9,000 to 10,000 patients each year. &quot;If you start to open things up and explore what&apos;s going on, how do you take the time to handle it?&quot; At Maggie&apos;s there is time and space, to speak or not to speak. Lee remembers, for example, a man with prostate cancer. He accepted the treatment, but could not get to grips with its ramifications: impotence, breasts, hair loss. &quot;So actually some of what he experienced was to come and meet some of the men in our prostate group, to realise that you&apos;re not alone. Come and talk to our psychologists individually, about how to maintain intimacy with your partner.&quot; Or there&apos;s the woman who was told her uterus had to be removed. Again, she understood that from a clinical point of view it would save her life, but what she could not say to her doctors was that &quot;she was young, she was in a new relationship. For her it was very much about coming to see the psychologist \u2013 and then doing some couple work with her partner, because, for him, she was enough. But for her, it became an exploration of actually, is he enough? Because I wanted to have a baby, and I&apos;m not going to have a baby, and dealing with that.&quot; &quot;Cancer is like a parachute jump without a map, behind enemy lines,&quot; Jencks wrote before she died. &quot;There you are, the future patient, quietly progressing with other passengers towards a distant destination when, astonishingly, a large hole opens in the floor next to you. People in white coats appear, help you into a parachute \u2013 and out you go. Aaaiiiieeeee! If you&apos;re lucky, the parachute opens. You descend. You hit the ground. You crawl upright \u2026 But where is the enemy? What is the enemy? What is it up to? Is it here, behind this bush? Over there? And which way is home? No road. No compass. No map. Is there something you should know and don&apos;t? The white coats are far away, strapping others into their parachutes. Occasionally they wave but, even if you ask them, they don&apos;t know the answers. They are up there in the jumbo, involved with parachutes, not mapmaking.&quot; These centres are an attempt to provide the map that Maggie wished for.

The execution orders in the city of Chongqing follow the arrests of senior police chiefs, prosecutors and more than 1,500 suspects in one of the biggest crackdowns in recent memory on &quot;black societies&quot;, as the gangs are known. Among the most notorious of those sentenced to death by the number three intermediate court of Chongqing was gang leader Liu Zhongyong, who was found guilty of stabbing a man to death in March 2008 after a quarrel that started when Liu complained the victim was singing karaoke too loudly. According to the Xinhua news agency, Liu owned a coal mine and used mobsters to force other colliery owners to sell him cheap coal. After three miners died in an accident his gang beat up industrial safety inspectors. Another prominent defendant was Yang Tianqing, who was sentenced to death for blackmail, possession of illegal weapons and assault. From 2005 Yang recruited jobless migrants to run extortion rackets. They were also hired by local businessmen to attack rivals. In May this year the gang killed a man after being ordered to hack his legs off, the China News Agency reported. When gangsters were put in prison Yang reportedly paid their families a regular income to ensure the members would rejoin him on their release. According to the China Daily, Yang &quot;tightened control on the gang by sponsoring members&apos; livelihoods and arranging group drugs, binge drinking and prostitution&quot;. Four other men were sentenced to death, three on suspended sentences, which are often commuted to life in prison. Others are likely to follow. Under a crime sweep led by the mayor, Bo Xilai, more than a dozen gangs have been broken up and 1,544 suspects detained in Chongqing, China&apos;s biggest municipality. The deputy head of police who headed the judicial bureau is under investigation by the Communist party for allegedly protecting gangs in the city. Local politicians have also been caught in the dragnet. Residents said they were not surprised by the reports of criminal activity that have emerged from the courtroom. &quot;Chongqing is a port city with a history of violence. It&apos;s what people always talk about over tea. I don&apos;t think the government crackdown is a big issue,&quot; said a computer firm employee who gave only his surname, Wang. As well as prostitution, loan sharking and drugs, gangs were mainly involved with small businesses, Wang said. &quot;In the fish market the gangsters would fix a higher price and force everyone to follow it. Anyone who disputed their ruling was beaten. Since the crackdown, business is fairer.&quot; Chongqing is far from alone in suffering from organised crime, but has gone further than most cities in tackling it. In cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the lack of political accountability, judicial independence and media scrutiny have created ripe conditions for mobsters to collude with corrupt officials in setting up illegal businesses and extorting money. &quot;We have to pay off the gangsters and the police,&quot; a club manager in Shanghai told the Guardian. &quot;There are two brothers in the city who always dine together.

In 1931 this genteel port on Hawke&apos;s Bay, on the east coast of North Island, was struck by a tremor measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale. It flattened the city just as its children were starting the first day of a new school year. A total of 256 people lost their lives in what remains the country&apos;s worst natural disaster \u2013 although there were some lucky escapes. &quot;Our family had an outside toilet back then,&quot; Gill recalls, &quot;and Grandad fell into the cess pit, where he was eventually rescued some hours later. The soft landing saved his life.&quot; If you believe clouds have silver linings, Napier&apos;s is surely rimmed with neon and chrome, the shiny new materials of the art-deco age. For this was an earthquake that also gave back, tilting the coast up by a couple of metres and draining a huge lagoon that is now filled with fertile farmland, the city airport, and some choice stretches of 30s and 40s suburbia. Downtown Napier, meanwhile, was quickly rebuilt in a colourful, confidence-raising art-deco style that married symbols of renewal \u2013 sunbursts, fountains, flowers \u2013 with robustly quake-proof buildings limited to two storeys. Out went brick parapets, gables and heavy facades; in came chrome speed-lines, ziggurats and naked women reaching for the stars. What&apos;s remarkable is that it is still all there. Lovers of art deco will find plenty of individual gems to swoon over in metropolises such as Paris, New York and Shanghai, but Napier is exceptional because it offers such an engaging and strollable concentration of provincial 30s edifices. According to the local Art Deco Trust, which arranges guided walks and bus tours and produces excellent background literature, the city has 147 art-deco buildings, decorated in styles that include Egyptian, Mayan and Maori. Many have been restored and repainted in cheery pastels, and star turns include the still-thriving 1938 Municipal Theatre, which has its original chrome and neon fittings, and a cubist carpet faithfully recreated from a pre-earthquake scrap found in the manager&apos;s office. Walk down Tennyson Street and you meet one 1932 joy after another. Here is the curious Scinde Building, once a Masonic lodge; there are the former offices of the Daily Telegraph newspaper with its lotus flower capitals \u2013 it&apos;s now an estate agent. Some buildings quietly tell tales about their owners&apos; origins: there are sweet little shamrocks on the Munster Chambers, Scottish thistles on Parker&apos;s menswear store. A German national flag, in stucco, flutters above Hildebrandts, the chiropodist. For many, the most engaging sight is the ASB Building, a 1934 bank adorned with a union of art-deco style with Maori motifs. Look above the modern counters and you see stylised hammerhead sharks, curling fern fronds and whales&apos; tails dancing around the ceiling. In the flamboyant National Tobacco Building in the port of Ahuriri, roses and citrus fruits twirl around its stained glass dome as if to dispel the odium of smoking. Out in the suburb of Marewa there are swathes of streamlined 30s homes with trademark flat roofs, curved corners and sunburst-pattern front gates. As if that wasn&apos;t enough, in nearby Taradale they&apos;ve even got a 1931 hotel turned &quot;McDeco McDonald&apos;s&quot;, which has achieved cult status with a particular strand of travellers. As a result of all this, visiting Napier feels rather like discovering that there&apos;s a bonus track to the familiar compilation of New Zealand&apos;s greatest hits. We&apos;ve all heard about the country&apos;s heartlifting landscapes, madcap adrenalin activities, intensely flavoured wines and the nostalgic notion it is how Britain used to be \u2013 and Hawke&apos;s Bay doesn&apos;t stint on such delights. A 40-minute drive south from Napier lies the five-mile sandy expanse of Ocean Beach and the gannet-filled wilderness of Cape Kidnappers, a peninsula so named because in 1769 the local Maoris tried to abduct a Tahitian member of Captain Cook&apos;s crew, mistaking him for one of their own. On a rollercoaster tour of its breezy clifftops, drinking in the peace and the sea views, I find myself commenting feebly on how lucky Kiwis are to have all this fresh air and stirring countryside to play in. &quot;We don&apos;t know we&apos;re alive,&quot; our guide reflects, just as I&apos;m feeling very much the opposite. For foodies, and the merely greedy, trails lead down roads lined with orchards and fields of melons and strawberries \u2013 this is where your supermarket apples may well have come from. Devotees of the assiduously sourced beach picnic can visit a wealth of small producers, such as the Hohepa farm shop near Clive, where the organic fruit and veg is as brightly coloured as snooker balls, and Arataki Honey in Havelock North, where a kilo of health-boosting manuka costs a mere \u00a36.50. Wine-lovers can explore a region best known for its premium reds \u2013 the finest I tasted was at Craggy Range, a shamelessly ambitious, family-run ego-trip beside Te Mata Peak. By contrast, at the small Clearview Estate on the coast near Te Awanga, the atmosphere is engagingly hippy-go-lucky, with the emphasis on &quot;experimenting and having fun&quot;. Its self-taught owner, Tim Turvey, set up in 1988 and has watched Hawke&apos;s Bay fill to the brim with boutique wineries. &quot;There are two types of winemakers here,&quot; he says, &quot;those in business, and those who are alcoholics.&quot; Lunch at Clearview is a pleasantly boozy affair, with children welcome and the tables and chairs spreading out through the vines. As everyone sits in the sunshine sipping their delightfully crisp Sauvignon plonk and nibbling on tasting plates loaded with artisan breads, pumpkin hummus and Te Mata cheeses, I can&apos;t help thinking what a shame it is that New Zealand is so bloomin&apos; far away. Why can&apos;t it be just down a bit from Brighton, rather than requiring so much of us in terms of expense, jet lag and movie-overload on that 24-hour, 11,400-mile fuel-guzzling flight? It&apos;s testimony to New Zealand&apos;s enduring appeal that so many of us still choose to make the trek down to the Land of the Long White Cloud \u2013 particularly in the midst of a recession. I&apos;d recommend going just on health grounds, because everything feels so darn safe, wholesome and 100% organic that just being here for a fortnight will surely up my life expectancy by, oh, five minutes. In the past many of us were drawn here to visit relatives, but now we&apos;re just as likely to go for solid holiday reasons: sunshine, empty beaches, unique and rewarding sights and all manner of sporty things to do. The living proof of this is Mary, my eightysomething mother and travelling companion, who had long nursed a desire to visit the country on the grounds that we had family there. Yet when I came to arrange the itinerary, she was so keen to see as many amazing things as possible that poor old auntie Jackie and assorted fruits still hanging on the family tree got unceremoniously dropped because they would take up too much valuable time. (And if you&apos;re reading this, hey, sorry...) That&apos;s why we&apos;re in Napier (my call), having had an indulgent sojourn nosing round the Bay of Islands (Mary&apos;s choice) in the Northland region of North Island. With its Cotswolds-pretty mission buildings, Maori heritage sites and hassocks adorned with whales and kiwis, this scenic honeypot provides a soft, welcoming and refreshingly Lord of the Rings-free initiation into the gripping adventure story that is New Zealand. Before that we had dropped in on Samoa, and on the way back we&apos;ll have a skyscraping spendfest in Hong Kong. Given that Air New Zealand flies round the world it seemed mad not to take up the circumnavigatory option and, let&apos;s face it, once you&apos;ve decided to boing yourself off to the other side of the world, you&apos;re locked into trip-of-a-lifetime, we&apos;d-better-buy-another-memory-card, territory. Thank goodness, then, that it&apos;s all so worth it \u2013 although, as we explore Napier, I do have a niggling worry. It seems churlish to mention it, but what are the chances an earthquake might strike again? &quot;Well, they&apos;re due a big one in Wellington,&quot; one resident tells me, voicing the age-old idea that everything bad starts in the capital. &quot;Small ones are happening all the time,&quot; another muses with a disdainful shrug. &quot;You come home and all the pictures on the wall are askew.&quot; The doom-inclined should visit the absorbing Hawke&apos;s Bay Museum to watch a film of the day the ground &quot;started to roll like a ship at sea&quot;, and hear eye-witness accounts. A computer screen gives continuous reports on how New Zealand is &quot;rumbling all the time&quot;. The rebuilding of Napier didn&apos;t just introduce a new architectural style \u2013 it gave its residents a revitalised sense of character too \u2013 what one survivor called &quot;an extra soul&quot;. Walk down Marine Parade today, with its splendid avenue of Norfolk pines (that most art deco of trees), bright splodges of municipal busy lizzies, and the lovely pink and white 1935 Soundshell Stage, and you could be in an Antipodean Eastbourne \u2013 with the exception that many Kiwis seem regrettably uninterested in dress codes (be prepared for cargo shorts and adventure sandals in the smartest restaurants). As with another famously earthquake-prone city \u2013 San Francisco \u2013 there is a sense here that life ought be enjoyed to the full thanks to the special permission bestowed by a past tragedy. &quot;The strongest tremor I&apos;ve ever felt was a 5.8,&quot; reflects Don Alexander, a veteran guide working for the Art Deco Trust. &quot;We were playing cricket in McLean Park at the time, and the bails just flew off the stumps...&quot; Bowled out by seismic activity, now that&apos;s one for the records.

How often have we heard that before? The difference on this occasion is that time is rapidly running out if Silverstone is to push the green light, sell enough tickets and have the organisation cranked up in time for 11 July, the proposed date for next year&apos;s race. If both sides fail to agree, the 2010 Formula One world championship will be without one of its few remaining traditional venues, the equivalent of the tennis tour without Wimbledon. Unthinkable \u2013 but possible. Does Ecclestone care? Probably not. Do Silverstone care? Most certainly, but only up to a sensible financial point. Silverstone, despite being ready to run the grand prix, is not willing to do so at a loss. Depending on who you talk to, Ecclestone, on behalf of Formula One, is demanding between \u00a311m and \u00a315m. But that figure is not the sticking point. That&apos;s the 7% annual escalator built into a contract that Ecclestone suggests should run for 17 years. \u00a0 When Silverstone said they wanted a long-term contract \u2013 as opposed to a quick fix to bail out F1 after the Donington shambles \u2013 this was not what they had in mind. The British Racing Drivers&apos; Club, owners of Silverstone, is not in the position to save the British grand prix at any price. If Ecclestone and CVC Capital Partners, majority shareholders of Formula One Management, are to avoid being pilloried for allowing commercial expediency to crush one of the sport&apos;s fading but fundamental venues, a compromise needs to be found. The bean counters in Formula One Management, most of whom would not know a \u00a3300 F1 admission ticket from an economy boarding pass, will point to vast riches on offer from countries in the Middle and Far East desperate to use F1 as a token of international credibility and celebrity. Places such as Shanghai and Malaysia, and to a lesser extent Bahrain, may bolster the figures on next year&apos;s FOM accounts\u00a0but they will make a sorry sight in years to come as rows of seats remain empty in grandstands in need of a lick of paint.\u00a0 Despite high admission charges, Silverstone can pull in 190,000 spectators with no trouble at all. The teams, 60% of whom are located a couple of hours from the Northamptonshire track, need the British grand prix for corporate entertainment and the necessary networking for sponsors and staff alike. The drivers, for their part, love the unique challenge of the track&apos;s superb high-speed layout. It is true that, as Ecclestone says, the place needs &quot;tidying up&quot;. The media centre is now one of the worst in the world, saved only by efficient and cheerful staff that epitomise the enthusiasm found in every corner of Silverstone. Next weekend&apos;s Abu Dhabi grand prix will push standards even further beyond Silverstone&apos;s reach. There will be luxury on a hitherto unknown scale. The media will have the use of a full-scale cafeteria. But it&apos;s probably fair to say that the general feeling within F1 is summed up by the majority of journalists being happy to continue with Silverstone&apos;s hot water urn and instant coffee if it means the British grand prix&apos;s continued inclusion on the calendar. \u00a0", "tags": ["Silverstone", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Bernie Ecclestone", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-27T13:45:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/29/useconomicgrowth-useconomy", "sentences": ["The real growth in the world economy is likely to come, not from Wall Street and Main Street, but Shanghai, Bangalore, Rio and Moscow."], "title": "Dan Roberts | US is growing, but the east is winning", "article": "As if France and Germany pulling out of recession first was not humiliating enough for Britain, now the US economy is growing again too, leaving us in the unwholesome company of Iceland, Spain, Italy and Ireland.

Today it was the turn of Lloyds to stick its hand out \u2013 indicating it wants an estimated \u00a35bn to support its latest restructuring wheeze. The day before Northern Rock put on its best puppy eyes and asked for \u00a38bn to expand its mortgage business. Given the mood in the Treasury, both look certain to get what they want. It&apos;s said that Britain&apos;s cash distribution network was hours from collapse at the height of last year&apos;s crisis, but I&apos;d say there was still something pretty wrong with it now: aren&apos;t banks supposed to lend us money? The similarities between Lloyds and Northern Rock are uncanny. Neither faces imminent collapse and neither restructuring will directly help the economy by extending credit to businesses or shoppers. Instead, both argue that investing a teensy bit extra now will be in the long-term interest of the taxpayer because our shares will be worth more when someone finally wants to buy them. Clam up at this stage and we risk undermining all that effort we put in to stop them collapsing last year. In the case of Lloyds, the argument is shrouded in several additional layers of complexity. It wants us to buy some shares to encourage other investors to buy some shares, so that it has enough money to convince the regulator that it does not need to spend money on a government insurance scheme designed to protect it if it ever runs out of money. Confused? They want you to be. The official version of events is even worse: &quot;Lloyds is in discussions regarding alternatives to participation in the government asset protection scheme ... capital-raising options include raising core tier-one capital by way of a rights issue.&quot; As first reported by this paper two weeks ago, the crucial detail left unmentioned in this proposal is that, as the largest shareholder, the government has to subscribe to this record-beating rights issue for it to have any hope of succeeding. There was no official word on this today, but it is inconceivable that Lloyds would have issued an official stock exchange announcement about its plans without first being sure of getting the nod from Alistair Darling. So what do we get in return for our \u00a35bn or so? The simple answer is: \u00a35bn of bank shares. Unfortunately, we already have lots of those and if we were certain of their long-term value, none of this would be happening. More immediately, we get to stop guaranteeing \u00a3250bn of dodgy bank loans covered by the asset protection scheme (APS). The catch here is that we haven&apos;t been paid yet for providing this insurance when it was needed most (ie, during the crisis) and are having to haggle to get the premium paid retrospectively. And no one believes for a minute that if Lloyds really got into trouble again, the government wouldn&apos;t have to step back in anyway. The only difference is that this way Lloyds is one step closer to getting its independence back. All in all, it&apos;s like taking out house insurance during a fire, refusing to pay for it once the fire is out and sending the insurance company a bill for a new sprinkler system. The real irony is that behind all the complexity, the APS and this associated exit strategy boil down to something very recognisable to bankers by now: a credit derivative, the most toxic yet invented.

The romantic ideal of the Grand Tour had permeated the public consciousness, and now for the first time, such travel was a possibility for the middle classes as well.  While British beach resorts such as Blackpool began to develop to cater for holidaymakers of all social strata - at Scarborough spa, the wealthy rubbed shoulders with the working classes - former cabinet-maker Thomas Cook was masterminding what would become the world&apos;s first package tour.  First, he led groups from his native Leicester around the British Isles, arranging their accommodation and travel, and charging them a single rate. In 1855 he took a group to Paris for the Great Exhibition, and following the success of that tour, he led groups around Europe, to the Middle East, and to America, opening each route as a set itinerary for people to follow. A new version of the Grand Tour, a kind of proto-gap year, was becoming a necessary part of education for the well-off middle classes, and chaperoned group tours for unmarried young women, unheard-of just decades earlier, were becoming available. The first holidays snaps were starting to appear, too: as cameras became more portable, travels could be more easily documented, and memories preserved. In 1869 the Suez Canal was completed, opening up the Far East to cheaper and safer shipping. By that time, the middle classes had followed the royal families of Britain, France and Spain to the seaside resorts on the French and Italian Riviera. A long stay in the Alps was a recognised recuperative aid for the infirm or ill, and mountain sports such as skiing were becoming popular as well. Tourism as we know it today had been born. 10 popular 19th-century destinations 1. Nile River Cruise For the first half of the century, Nile cruising was limited to wooden sailing vessels known as Dahabiyyas, which were slow. As the era of archaeological discovery in Egypt began to gather momentum, tourists wanting to follow in the footsteps of the Egyptologists \u2013 and the looters \u2013 were able to charter local steam-vessels. By the late 1880s, as more and more archaeological finds were being made, Thomas Cook introduced larger, more opulent steam-ships. Described by a journalist as &quot;the most luxurious vessels to sail the Nile since Cleopatra&apos;s barge&quot;, they ploughed the Nile from Cairo all the way to Aswan. 2. Paris via Brussels and the Rhine Thomas Cook began operating his European tours in the middle of the century, opening the continent up to a whole new market: the middle classes. His first European tour was a wide circle ending with four days in Paris for the 1855 exhibition. After that, the route was open permanently: starting in Brussels, tourists could cruise down the Rhine from Cologne to Mainz then head to Paris by rail via Frankfurt, the casinos at Baden-Baden, Weisbaden castle and Strasbourg. This tour was consistently one of Cook&apos;s most popular: by the end of the century, thousands of tourists were making the journey each year. 3. Davos, Switzerland Davos became famous as a health resort after Alexander Spengler, a German country doctor and political refugee, popularised the notion that the mountain air in the valley carried significant medical benefits, and opened a clinic. As the resort grew in the latter part of the century, it began to see the rise of a new trend: skiing. One of the pioneers of the fledgeling sport was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who on 20 March 1894 became the first Englishman to cross the 2,440m Maienfelder Furka pass above the resort and ski down the other side. 4. Camping in the Holy Land The Holy Land, which lacked hotels and infrastructure, was accessible to Thomas Cook by way of a camping tour. Luxury, fully furnished and carpeted tents housed the tourists, who were looked after by a large entourage of servants, guides and porters. The whole operation was transported by a train of 130 pack-horses and mules, and took in sites of biblical and geographical importance including Jerusalem, Jaffa, the Dead Sea, Damascus and Galilee, before continuing on to Constantinople, a journey that cost each tourist nearly\uffe1100 - about \u00a310,000 today. 5. Niagara Falls In 1827 the enterprising hotelier William Forsyth, having just built the luxurious Pavilion Hotel overlooking the Horseshoe Falls, arranged the first of many spectacles at the falls. The condemned schooner Michigan, decorated to look like a pirate ship and filled with &quot;fearsome animals&quot;, was sent to its destruction over the Falls. The stunt, which saw two bears escape the boat and swim to safety and a single goose survive the plunge, was witnessed by nearly 10,000 people. The publicity attracted many British travellers touring the US, and the town grew as daredevils attempted more dramatic stunts. 6. The French seaside: Nice, Biarritz and Deauville In 1854 the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, built a palace on the beach at Biarritz. A half-brother of the reigning French monarch Napoleon III, Auguste de Morny, commissioned an architect to create a &quot;kingdom of elegance&quot; near Paris, and Deauville&apos;s first villas and grand seafront hippodrome took shape between 1860 and 1864. At the same time, Nice was ceded back to French sovereignty and began constructing grand hotels and a promenade which would be named Anglaise for the English tourists who thronged there. The British, French and Spanish royal families holidayed regularly in these new resorts, and the British upper- and middle-classes followed them in droves. 7. Italy post-Grand Tour The era of the Grand Tour may have been more or less over, but the middle-class travellers on Thomas Cook&apos;s package tours were entranced by the romantic ideal of it. This meant that tours of Renaissance Italy remained consistently popular, with Rome, Florence and especially Venice emerging as favourite destinations. The reputation of the Grand Tour as an experience of cultural and sexual awakening was intrinsically linked with Italy, and most young men of privilege in the 19th century still made the pilgrimage to Venice to complete their education.  8. Fjord cruise Legend has it that boat trips to Scandinavia started in 1870 as a route to collect blue glacial ice for drinks in top London clubs. Whether this is true or not, sightseers were soon chartering cabins on cargo routes to Norway as word of the beauty of the landscape got around. Thomas Cook started a tourist cruise to the fjords in 1875 called The Midnight Sun, which ran weekly out of Hull and proved to be one of their longest-running itineraries. 9. Bath For those holidaying closer to home, the spa town of Bath was a consistently popular destination. The Hot Bath and Cross Bath had been rebuilt at the end of the 18th century, and the Great Pump Room built. The Royal Hotel opened in 1846, and the Empire Hotel was complete by the end of the century. The iconic Royal Crescent served mainly as short-stay, vacation residences for most of the 1800s. A six-week stay to take the waters was common medical advice, and the health benefits of the spa were well-publicised.  10. Shanghai When the First Opium War ended in 1842, Shanghai became a boomtown. Situated at the mouth of the Yangtze, it was perfectly placed as the gateway for the West, and especially imperial Britain, to enter China. It also became a major destination for more adventurous British tourists. When it opened in 1846, the Astor House was not only Shanghai&apos;s first hotel, but also the first Western hotel on Chinese soil.

Our drivers [Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello] are really enjoying the track and have made no adverse comments about the lighting; it&apos;s high above the track and doesn&apos;t seem to be casting any distracting shadows. &quot;It looks like it will be great for racing with a slow corner leading on to the straight and a slow corner at the end of it giving a good opportunity for overtaking. It&apos;s quite hard on brakes and that could be a factor in the race.&quot; The approach of darkness allowed at least one helmet manufacturer, Arai, to experiment successfully with tear-off visors, starting with tinted visors, designed to deal with the setting sun which can be torn off to reveal clearer visors as the evening wears on. The Yas Marina track is but a small part of a $40bn (\u00a324bn) development embracing what could be harshly described as the purchase of culture. The discovery of oil in the late 1950s made Abu Dhabi the wealthiest of the seven Emirates when the UAE was formed in 1971. Much of that money is going towards development being carried out through a slow, sustainable expansion programme across two decades. \u00a0There are plans for a cultural district that will boast the Louvre Abu Dhabi and a Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim, sites that are currently holes in the ground on Saadiyat Island. The construction of the race track on nearby Yas Island has, appropriately enough, been carried out at a breakneck pace. Work began in February 2007; 1.6 million cubic meters of earthwork and 225,000 cubic metres of concrete later, this addition to the F1 calendar has raised the bar through the glittering roof of the futuristic five-star Yas Hotel straddling the track. Much the same was said in 2004 when the Shanghai circuit brought Formula One to China. That facility, in a shabby industrial area an hour&apos;s drive from the city centre, is in danger of becoming a white elephant if the government becomes disenchanted with low attendance figures and a lack of interest within a population possessing little knowledge of motor sport. Who is to say the Yas Marina project will not go the same way once Bernie Ecclestone and his board have lined their pockets and moved on? &quot;This is a different concept altogether,&quot; says Richard Cregan, CEO of the circuit. &quot;The buildings within the circuit are designed to be used for other motorsport events, corporate conferences and public events. It&apos;s massively accessible, being 12 minutes from the international airport and 20 minutes from the city centre. &quot;There are yacht clubs, golf clubs, hotels and the Ferrari World theme park close by and they can exploit the circuit, as can local businesses, for driving days and so on. We will use the amphitheatre created by one of the grandstands to stage concerts. There are numerous ways we and the community will be able to use all of the facilities throughout the year.&quot; Having worked for Toyota for 24 years and managed the team, Cregan was familiar with the sophisticated requirements of teams expecting to decant from Brazil and get straight down to winning the final race. There would be no allowances for this being a new venue ignorant of Formula One&apos;s special needs. The Dubliner has been as good as his word. A recent reconnaissance by the logistics manager from one team found nothing wanting \u2013 a first for a new venue. With the event having recently sold out, the settling of the championship appears not to have had a detrimental effect. &quot;We&apos;ve had an amazing response locally, nationally and internationally and every ticket has been sold,&quot; said Cregan. &quot;This will be the first F1 race at Yas Marina; the first day into evening F1 race \u2013 and there will be only one driver who will forever be recognised in F1 history as the winner of the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. &quot;I&apos;ve always felt that whether Abu Dhabi had a championship decider or not, we&apos;re going to have a great weekend. The fact the championship has been decided in Brazil leaves the teams and drivers in a more relaxed mode and they will enjoy the challenge more. Winning the race is at stake. And what could be better than having an end-of-season grand prix that puts the focus back on the track and not the paddock? &quot;People are going to see a project they didn&apos;t think would be finished. They are going to see a project that not only has been finished, but has been finished with the kind of detail you would expect for this part of the world and Abu Dhabi.&quot; There are many novelties, such as the run-off area at the end of the back straight running beneath a grandstand which is one of several that will accommodate a total of 50,000 spectators, all under cover. The straight, now the longest in Formula One, allows the cars to stretch their legs before tackling a return loop which resembles Monaco as it skirts a marina and passes beneath the Yas Hotel. Cregan says established venues must not be ignored but hopes the Yas Marina project will show that newcomers, well thought out and managed, have a place, too.", "tags": ["Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-30T19:52:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/01/lou-jing-chinese-talent-show", "sentences": ["She was, however, one of the five Shanghai representatives picked to appear on the show, which featured contestants from all over the country.", "The 20-year-old daughter of a Chinese mother and an African-American father who left the country before she was born, Lou was a highly unusual entrant to Shanghai-based Dragon TV&apos;s Go Oriental Angel.", "&quot;I wish netizens could tolerate my particular parentage and let it go as soon as possible.&quot; She has stressed that she is a true Shanghainese, an assertion underlined by her accent.", "Unsurprisingly shaken by the fallout from what was supposed to be a talent contest, Lou and her mother are contemplating legal action against a Shanghai newspaper that they claim fabricated an interview about her father."], "title": "China's black pop idol exposes her nation's racism", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday 8 November 2009  An error introduced into this article at the editing stage had us state that black contestant Lou Jing was one of five finalists on Dragon TV&apos;s Go Oriental Angel. She was, however, one of the five Shanghai representatives picked to appear on the show, which featured contestants from all over the country. Judges denied her the chance to go further than the top 30.   She is attractive, effervescent and has an appealing voice. But these qualities alone would not have made Lou Jing the most famous television talent show contestant in China and the subject of national debate in the world&apos;s most populous country. The reason they are talking about Lou is because she is black. The 20-year-old daughter of a Chinese mother and an African-American father who left the country before she was born, Lou was a highly unusual entrant to Shanghai-based Dragon TV&apos;s Go Oriental Angel. Her appearances \u2013 she became one of five finalists \u2013 have provoked a storm of abuse on the internet, a rare debate on racism in the media, and a bout of self-examination in a country where skin colour is a notoriously sensitive subject. Dragon TV initially had doubts about allowing Lou to perform, but then realised that her presence would do much to attract publicity for the show. But few executives can have expected the fury contained in many of the blogs and online posts that accompanied her performances. The internet is the only place in China where the public can express views with near-freedom \u2013 although they are rapidly cut off by an army of state censors if they stray into territory that attracts official disapproval. The huge online interest in Lou clearly does not fall into this category. &quot;Ugh. Yellow people and black people mixed together is very gross,&quot; was one representative post. And Lou&apos;s critics are incensed not only by her colour but also because she is apparently the product of an extramarital relationship. Another blogger wrote: &quot;Numb! This bitch still has the audacity to appear on television! I don&apos;t know what to say! One cannot be shameless to this kind of level!&quot; Lou admitted to Neteast News that the level of hostility had come as a shock. &quot;The whole thing was a big bomb to my family and me and it caused great harm,&quot; she said. &quot;I wish netizens could tolerate my particular parentage and let it go as soon as possible.&quot; She has stressed that she is a true Shanghainese, an assertion underlined by her accent. There has been no official response to the racism, but public figures have been quick to join what has become an impassioned debate on the Chinese and race. Media commentator and author Hung Huang wrote on her blog: &quot;In the same year that Americans welcome Obama to the White House, we can&apos;t even accept this girl with a different skin colour.&quot; The China Daily newspaper also published a sterling defence of the young theatre student, written by one of its top columnists. &quot;There are two factors at work here,&quot; wrote Raymond Zhou. &quot;Lou Jing is not a pure-blood Chinese and anyone who marries a foreigner is deemed a &apos;traitor&apos; to his or her race. More relevant, Lou&apos;s father is black.&quot; Zhou concluded: &quot;It is high time we introduced some sensitivity training on races and ethnicities if we are going to latch on to the orbit of globalisation. People should realise that if you have a right to discriminate against another race you have automatically given others the right to discriminate against you.&quot; Chip Tsao, one of Hong Kong&apos;s leading columnists and cultural commentators, believes that a child of a Chinese woman and a black person hits all the buttons that cause prejudice among Chinese. &quot;It&apos;s an obnoxious novelty,&quot; he said, adding that Chinese prejudice against black people was part of &quot;prejudice against people less well-off than themselves&quot;. There was, he said, greater acceptance of Europeans because they were viewed as successful, but mixed Chinese/white European couples frequently attracted racist comment. One leading actress, Jiang Ziyi, who has an Israeli boyfriend, has routinely been accused of betrayal for consorting with a foreigner. A stark reminder of official racism came last year when Ding Hui, of mixed Chinese and African parentage, was barred from representing his country in the national volleyball team. China officially lists 56 approved ethnic minorities within its borders, but discussion about ethnic differences is largely taboo. Racial tensions have recently broken out between the Muslim Uighur population, who look more like Europeans, and the &quot;Chinese&quot;-looking majority. In the Mao era there was much talk of China&apos;s brotherhood with the developing world, which led to many African students arriving to study in Chinese universities and the export of many Chinese workers to Africa, to help with development. Tsao said that although modern China invested in African raw material companies it did not trust local workers and instead imported its own. Many Chinese remain unaware that certain forms of behaviour and language are unacceptable in multicultural societies elsewhere. In Hong Kong one of the biggest-selling toothpaste brands was called Darkie, its trademark being a caricature of an Al Jolson-type smiling black man with gleaming white teeth. Overseas protests eventually led to the name being changed to Darlie. Unsurprisingly shaken by the fallout from what was supposed to be a talent contest, Lou and her mother are contemplating legal action against a Shanghai newspaper that they claim fabricated an interview about her father.

His life spanned nearly a century, from the final few days of the Qing Dynasty, through the Republican period, from 1912 to 1949, and on to the 60th anniversary of the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC). It also embodied the conflicts between the US and China, the two countries where he was to be based most of his life, and between which he was forced, finally, to choose. Qian was the son of a government official, born in the city of Hangzhou in the coastal province of Zhejiang. He was educated at Shanghai Jiaotong University, and, in 1935, with the help of a scholarship, went first to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, and then, a year later, to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he was to be awarded his doctorate, and be based for the next two decades. It was while in California, during the second world war, that his research concentrated on jet propulsion. With a number of other key US scientists, responding to the German V1 and V2 rockets, he devised a range of highly effective missiles, which proved crucial in the final stages of the war effort. Qian also participated in the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb. As a result of this, he was made the first director of the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Centre at Caltech in 1949. In the same year, however, the communists won their final push to become rulers of the PRC, exiling the Nationalist leadership under Chiang Kai-shek, whom the US had largely supported, to the island of Taiwan. Qian was immediately suspected of being a communist sympathiser, with claims being made that his name had appeared on Communist party documents as early as the late 1930s. His application for US citizenship was subsequently denied, and he was detained after applying to leave America. One US official at the time called this the &quot;stupidest thing this country ever did&quot;. In 1955, Qian was allowed to return to China. The US&apos;s loss (one of Qian&apos;s colleagues in the 1930s had called Qian a scientist of genius) was China&apos;s gain, at a critical period in its development. Qian was immediately allowed to establish an Institute of Mechanics in Beijing, and to work within the state-established Chinese Academy of Science. His skills and knowledge were absolutely critical at a time when many of China&apos;s most talented scientists had refused to return home because of the political changes that had taken place there. A symbol of the respect and trust Qian enjoyed was his admission to the Communist party in 1958. He started work on what was to become the Dongfeng missile. As a result both of his work, and of support from the Soviet Union (despite the fact that relations between these two countries had deteriorated badly in the late 1950s), China was able to test its own atomic bomb in 1963-64. A mere 15 years after its founding, it had joined the elite nuclear club. This was a seminal moment in the country&apos;s development. Qian seems to have been largely unaffected by the tumult of the Cultural Revolution, from 1966, probably because he was working in such a key national strategic area. While chaos reigned in the rest of China, military and technical research continued unaffected. In 2009, as China is preparing to build a space exploration launch pad on the island of Hainan, and has set itself the aim of getting a Chinese man on the moon in the next decade, Qian&apos;s contribution to China&apos;s space and missile programme should not be underestimated. Much of the technology behind the Shenzhou rockets, launched into space from the 1990s onwards to much national fanfare, can be traced back to research that Qian undertook. And much of that was based on what he had studied in the US during his 20 years there. After his retirement in 1991, he maintained a low profile, despite being garlanded with awards. He is survived by his wife, the highly acclaimed Beijing opera singer Jiang Ying. \u2022 Qian Xuesen, rocket scientist, born 11 December 1911; died 31 October 2009 \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2009.

Now Mickey Mouse and his bosses at Walt Disney face another challenge: to win the hearts and minds of the nation&apos;s booming middle class. The company announced today that Beijing has approved the creation of a Disneyland-style park in Shanghai; its first in mainland China and its fourth outside the United States after Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong. The 1,000-acre site attraction will reportedly cost $3.5bn (\u00a32.1bn) \u2013 making it one of the largest foreign investments on the mainland. The announcement comes two weeks before Sino-American relations come under the spotlight with US president Barack Obama&apos;s visit. &quot;China is one of the most dynamic, exciting and important countries in the world, and this approval marks a very significant milestone for the Walt Disney Company in mainland China,&quot; the firm&apos;s president and CEO Robert Iger said in a statement. More detailed talks between Disney and Shanghai authorities are ongoing, with issues thought to include the local partners for the park. A Chinese consortium is expected to contribute about 60% of the investment. Analysts say it is likely to be years before the attraction \u2013 which may open in 2014 \u2013 is able to turn a profit for Disney, which has a multibillion pound annual turnover. But the company&apos;s parks also help to promote the overall brand. It already has branded language schools in Shanghai and its products are on sale in around 6,000 outlets across China. Though critics have often held up Disney as a symbol of American cultural colonisation, the company tweaks its products for new audiences. Feng shui experts were hired to advise on the layout of Hong Kong Disneyland, and \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 shows are in Cantonese and Mandarin as well as English. But the site, which opened in 2005, has failed to attract as many visitors as expected. The company is preparing a $465m expansion to increase its appeal. Disney insisted that the Shanghai park would not compete with the Hong Kong site, but complement it. Analysts suggest the older location will still be more convenient for families in southern China, while the new site is perfectly placed for the fast-expanding middle class in Shanghai and other wealthy cities nearby. &quot;It&apos;s great news and we will definitely go,&quot; said Jin Guifang, from nearby Hangzhou. Her family visited the Hong Kong park two years ago at the request of her 12-year-old daughter Shihui. &quot;I enjoyed it as an adult too and since we came back Shihui has loved all the Disney stuff,&quot; she said. Christopher Marangi, senior analyst with Gabelli and Co in New York, told Reuters: &quot;They&apos;ve been laying the groundwork for a park for many years by exposing the population to Disney properties, film, TV and merchandising. &quot;Adding a physical presence in the form of a park would really complete and add to the value chain in China.&quot; From the Chinese point of view, building the theme park should create thousands of jobs. But villagers at the site have already begun to talk about relocation and compensation. &quot;If the country wants to develop this place, of course we have to support this,&quot; 62-year-old Shen Jinbao told Reuters. &quot;But the government must also treat the residents and villagers here well.&quot; Media struggle It&apos;s hard to escape western brand names such as Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nike in Chinese cities. But media companies such as Walt Disney and Rupert Murdoch&apos;s News Corporation have far less to show after years of slogging to break into the market. The government is still anxious about the potential influence of overseas media. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say this is a one-off gain,&quot; Vivek Couto, executive director of Media Partners Asia, told Reuters of the Disney theme park deal. &quot;But it&apos;s in a non-sensitive space.

David Miliband&apos;s much-anticipated visit to Moscow, the first of a British foreign secretary in over five years, has not produced a major breakthrough in bilateral relations between the UK and Russia. But there is a now a unique chance to do more than just mending fences. Britain has the opportunity to press the &quot;reset&quot; button and gradually turn enhanced co-operation into a strategic partnership, much like President Obama has sought to do since talks with his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, in the Kremlin in early July. In Britain&apos;s case, the main obstacle to better ties with Russia is the well-documented case of Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent with British citizenship who died of a massive dose of the radioactive isotope polonium 210 in London in November 2006 \u2013 an event that plunged UK-Russian relations to unprecedented depths since the end of the cold war. This was compounded by last summer&apos;s extreme tensions with Moscow over the war in Georgia&apos;s breakaway region of South Ossetia, when both the Labour government and the Conservative opposition accused the Kremlin of invading a sovereign country. But on neither account should Britain continue to limit co-operation with Russia to areas of immediate national interest such as trade, Afghanistan or Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions. The case of Andrei Lugovoi, the prime suspect in Litvinenko&apos;s brutal murder, is deadlocked. London insists on his extradition, which is banned by Russia&apos;s constitution. Moscow offers a trial according to Russian law, a procedure that is unlikely to be either free or fair. Rightly or wrongly, any compromise will have to be political, perhaps involving a special trial in a third country where all available evidence will have to be submitted from both sides. In any case, only closer co-operation will create an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust that is indispensable to a proper solution. Meanwhile, geopolitics, like life, must continue. And now that an independent commission has established that it was the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who launched a premeditated attack on South Ossetia and its civilians, it&apos;s time for the UK to drop the silly rhetoric about Russia&apos;s unilateral aggression and invasion. David Cameron&apos;s repeated support for Saakashvili is a serious error of judgment that does little to strengthen the foreign policy credentials of Britain&apos;s PM-in-waiting. Belatedly, Miliband is seeking to redress the UK&apos;s lopsided Ostpolitik. In his far-reaching foreign policy speech last Monday, he stressed the need to improve Anglo-Russian relations and voiced his strong support for &quot;hard-headed engagement across the full range of our shared interest&quot;, citing European security, energy and trade. Miliband&apos;s talks in Moscow with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, have helped repair bilateral relations and promote concrete co-operation in these and other areas. But something more ambitious, like a genuine strategic partnership, is necessary in order to complement Obama&apos;s new era of multilateral engagement and reinvigorate the stagnating relations between the EU and Russia. More than pragmatism is at stake. Without renewed British involvement, Obama&apos;s strategy of critical engagement with Russia could unravel over Iran, North Korea or Afghanistan. By working more closely with Moscow, London could help forge a new pan-Atlantic approach vis-a-vis Tehran and Pyongyang, combining the threat of sanctions with positive incentives to suspend nuclear enrichment such as civilian energy co-operation and perhaps even conditional security guarantees. On Afghanistan, the UK should promote a stronger Russian involvement in pacifying the border regions and bringing the Muslim countries of central Asia on board. Concretely, Moscow&apos;s military and political help is crucial in securing Afghanistan&apos;s northern borders and thereby preventing the spread of terrorism and drugs. This is also in Moscow&apos;s wider interest, as soaring drug consumption is the main reason for Russia&apos;s looming HIV epidemic. Likewise, without proper British leadership, the EU will continue to be divided along the lines of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new Europe&quot;. Since Britain is far less dependent on Russian energy supplies than Germany or Italy, it could and should take a leading role in mediating between western European interests and eastern European fears about a resurgent Russia. Neither taking sides nor remaining at Europe&apos;s margins is an option for a country such as Britain which, according to Miliband, seeks to be a &quot;global player of weight and power&quot;. All this will require a robust debate on the limits of the existing frameworks, institutions and organisations. These include the EU-Russia partnership and co-operation agreement, the Nato-Russia Council and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation \u2013 Moscow&apos;s alliance of convenience with China and central Asia. That is why Britain, Europe&apos;s most important military power, is uniquely positioned to discuss the Russian president&apos;s proposal for a new treaty on European security. By involving the UK in Obama&apos;s project of multilateral multi-polarity, Miliband can help shape a foreign policy legacy that the Tories won&apos;t be able to undo without causing a major rift with Washington.

The crude abuse\u00a0directed at her mother on the internet uncovered a deep well\u00a0of prejudice that comes as no surprise to foreigners living in China, but which for\u00a0years has been papered over by the official rhetoric of socialist solidarity with the developing world, including Africa. Solidarity, however, does not necessarily denote acceptance or equality, let alone full citizenship. China has not been a country of immigration: its ethnic diversity has come from expanding borders rather than inward migration. Who is really Chinese\u00a0is not the easiest question to answer in a country that officially has 56 ethnic groups \u2013 and in reality many more \u2013 but in which one group, the Han Chinese, is so dominant that it has the power to define the cultural and racial content of nationality. The non-Han citizens \u2013 Uighurs, Tibetans, Mongolians, Koreans and the many other cultural and ethnic groups \u2013 suffer accordingly: they are regarded as &quot;civilised&quot; to the degree that they come to resemble the Han majority. Many among that majority regard the relationship between the Han and the others as one of frank tutelage in preparation for assimilation. The Han, in other words, have a civilising mission to the more backward corners of the empire. For decades following the revolution in 1949, marriages between foreigners and Chinese were rare and, in the xenophobia of the Cultural Revolution, they were banned. It wasn&apos;t until as recently as the mid-70s that the first petitions for permission were accepted, and such marriages remained relatively unusual for a further two decades. Racism in what has thought of itself as a monocultural society is certainly a\u00a0large element in the discussion. But the ambivalence about race is a reflection of profound and unresolved questions about the identity of modern China, as\u00a0the world&apos;s most populous state reaches for a role in the 21st century after the painful dislocations of more than a century of political and social upheaval. The government that relies for its legitimacy on the twin pillars of economic growth and resurgent nationalism has crafted a national story of an unbroken line of political and cultural descent that stretches, implausibly, for\u00a05,000 years. China, the story goes, is\u00a0immutable as the current rulers invoke the mystique of past imperial dynasties to bolster their own authority. There are many difficulties in this narrative for China today, not least the fact that the modern idea of the Chinese nation, expounded by Sun Yat-sen 100 years ago, rested on overthrowing the hated Qing dynasty and expelling China&apos;s Manchu rulers. National purity would be restored and China would be strong again. Once the emperors had gone, though, China&apos;s new rulers found that retaining the territories the Manchu had conquered demanded a different narrative \u2013 that of a multinational state. The imperatives of the nation state and the realities of contemporary China have been in conflict ever since. Today this fragile construct is threatened by what for China is a new phenomenon \u2013 that of inward migration. In Lou Jing&apos;s home town of Shanghai, for instance, there have been some 3,000 mixed-race marriages each year for the past decade and in Guangzhou, according to local reports, as many as 100,000 Africans have settled in what is known locally as &quot;chocolate city&quot;. If China continues on its current trajectory, there will be many more cases like those of Lou Jing and Ding Hui, Chinese citizens whose appearance and personal history will force the world&apos;s most populous nation to confront the ambiguities of its own identity.", "tags": ["Politics", "China", "Race issues", "World news", "Tibet", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-05T21:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/08/emerging-cities-league-table", "sentences": ["New York, London and Paris may trip off the tongue as the world&apos;s top cities in terms of wealth but over the next 15 years emerging cities like Sao Paulo, Shanghai and Mumbai will give them a run for their money, says new research.", "Shanghai is set to rise from 25th place to 9th by then, with Mumbai likely to storm to 11th in the global gross domestic product per capita rankings from its current slot at number 29.", "&quot;Cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Mumbai, for example, are projected to grow at around 6-7% per annum in real terms, whereas cities such as New York, Tokyo, Chicago and London grow only at around 2% per annum on average.", "In absolute terms, the projected rise in Shanghai&apos;s GDP between 2008 and 2025 is greater than the combined GDP increase for London and Paris together.&quot; The research shows that the largest 100 cities accounted for about 30% of global GDP in 2008 and some have bigger economies than medium-sized countries like Sweden or Switzerland."], "title": "Emerging cities set to transform league table of world's wealthiest by 2025", "article": "New York, London and Paris may trip off the tongue as the world&apos;s top cities in terms of wealth but over the next 15 years emerging cities like Sao Paulo, Shanghai and Mumbai will give them a run for their money, says new research.

Shanghai is set to rise from 25th place to 9th by then, with Mumbai likely to storm to 11th in the global gross domestic product per capita rankings from its current slot at number 29.

But, says PwC, systematic global data on the size of city economies has been lacking until now. PwC published the first set of global city GDP rankings in 2007 and has now updated these to 2008 with projections to 2025. Thomas Hoehn, an economics partner at PwC, added: &quot;Global economic activity is concentrated in the world&apos;s largest cities and it is important to understand how those cities compare, especially when many developed economies are experiencing economic difficulties while countries like China and India continue to grow.&quot; Delhi, Guangzhou and Rio de Janeiro are all likely to rise rapidly up the table between now and 2025, PwC says, as are Istanbul and Cairo.

How attitudes have changed | Lawrence Donegan", "article": "In the merry-go-round of dreary press conferences hosted by the grandees of professional golf nothing lodges for in the memory for too long, although one exchange from three years ago has stuck. It featured the grandee of all grandees, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, and a disrespectful, scruffy hack who wasn&apos;t wearing a suit and tie (okay, it was me).  The subject was the apparent reluctance of Finchem and the tour to stage World Golf Championship events in countries where the national anthem did not feature the words star, spangled and banner. At the time, all WGC events for the foreseeable future were due to be staged in United States. The full transcript of Finchem&apos;s conference can be found here (warning; do not read while driving or attempting any other activity requiring conscious thought) but for the purposes of this blog we&apos;ll skip straight to the juicy bit:  Q. I think 39 of the 64 players in this week&apos;s field come from overseas. Can you part one of my question, can you explain why so many of these championships are played in the United States? And part two is don&apos;t you think that you have a responsibility to take these tournaments elsewhere in the world and to grow interest in the game elsewhere in the world?  COMMISSIONER TIM FINCHEM: ...to the second part of your question, yes and no. We would like to see World Golf Championships played around the world, and we have seen that the first eight years. I think we&apos;ve played on five different continents...that is a nice thing to do.  I think the fundamental, however, is not that. The fundamental is to bring to the world via incredible television capability, to 145 countries, all the best players in the world playing. The reality is that frankly Sergio Garcia is seen... when he&apos;s played in a World Golf Championship by more people than typically any other event he plays, regardless of where it is, whether in Europe or Asia or anywhere else. Ernie Els gets more global television exposure when he plays here this week than he does when he plays in China or Hong Kong.  And here is the best bit:  So it sounds good to say if you played more places you&apos;d reach more people, but the reality is that that&apos;s not always the case.   Three years later, Finchem has hitched the PGA Tour&apos;s wagon to the so-called golf boom in China (don&apos;t swallow that notion in its entirety, by the way - see this piece). He graced last weekend&apos;s HSBC Champions event in Shanghai with both the imprimatur of a &quot;WGC event&quot; and, goodness me, his presence.  Finchem was there to declare his hope of one day staging the President&apos;s Cup in China.  The Presidents Cup being staged in China in perhaps ten years&apos; time, which would become a goal of China to create players one year before the second playing of golf in the Olympics, who can play at that level. I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s possible, but we are in discussions over the next year as to how it could work, and we&apos;ll have more to say about that at a later date.   Can&apos;t all those Chinese fans just watch the President&apos;s Cup live on TV, all the way from San Francisco? After all, it sounds good to say if you played the event in more places you&apos;d reach more people, but the reality is that that&apos;s not always the case. Right?  Obviously, the pressing economic problems in the US, and the impact they have had on the finances of the PGA Tour, have forced Finchem to change his mind.  There is nothing wrong with changing your mind, of course, Likewise, there is nothing wrong with scruffy, impertinent golf journalists pointing that great proponents of global golf weren&apos;t always great proponents of global golf.

The Yangtze delta, which is home to about 400 million people, has been warming far faster than the global average for more than a decade and the implications for food security and biodiversity will worsen without remedial action, according to the study led by WWF China. The report found that in the first five years of this decade, temperatures along China&apos;s biggest river have increased by 0.71C, after a rise of a third of a degree in the 1990s. The consequences are already apparent, from the source to the estuary. The report&apos;s authors \u2013 which includes many of China&apos;s leading scientists \u2013 calculated that climate change was responsible for 81% of grassland degradation near the headwaters of the Yangtze on the Tibetan plateau. By the estuary near Shanghai, the sea level had risen by 11.5cm in the past 30 years. As well as having a dire impact on wildlife, particularly in wetlands, the report warned that people living on the delta would have to adapt or suffer from falling harvests, lengthening droughts and fiercer storms. If current trends continue, it predicted rice production in the Yantgtze basin would decrease by between 9% and 41% by the end of the 21st century, while harvest of corn and winter wheat would decline even more precipitously. Large areas of southern China are already experiencing a crippling drought. Chinese climatologists say rainstorms are growing more frequent and intense, raising the risks of floods. &quot;Extreme climate events such as storms and drought disasters will increase as climate change continues to alter our planet,&quot; said Xu Ming, the lead researcher on the report, which included contributions from the China Academy of Sciences, the China Meteorological Administration and other academic bodies. The study \u2013 one of the most comprehensive ever undertaken of a major river basin \u2013 was cautious about the rate of glacier shrinkage. Despite the rising temperatures, it predicted the icefields near the headwaters would only shrink by 11.6% between 1970 and 2060. This is a slower rate of decline than previous studies. The authors urged the authorities to ease the impact on people and the environment by developing hardier crop strains, shifting from corn to rice, improving the management of the river and dams, and by reinforcing dykes and power supply systems. &quot;Adaptation is a must for large developing nations such as China, which is particularly vulnerable to climate change because of its large population and relatively low economic development,&quot; said James Leape, director general of WWF International. &quot;The report is a reminder that while the whole world rises to meet the challenge of climate change, we must prepare for impacts that are already inevitable,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Water", "Climate change", "Food", "Flooding", "Drought", "Environment", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "China", "World news", "Farming", "Climate change", "Agriculture", "Science", "Conservation", "WWF", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-10T16:57:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/10/nien-cheng-obituary", "sentences": ["Life and Death in Shanghai (1987) is a memoir of huge sorrow and triumph by Nien Cheng, who has died aged 94; it could be read as symbolic of the story of modern China itself.", "After his death, Nien took up the position of political adviser to Shell and lived with their daughter, Meiping, a successful actor, in a large house in Shanghai, with antique furniture, servants and a good standard of living.", "But as Nien was to explain vividly in Life and Death in Shanghai, all that was brutally ended one day in 1967 when a visit by one of the newly created Red Guard rebellion groups heralded her own initiation into the terrifying world of the Cultural Revolution, which had started formally months earlier in Beijing."], "title": "Nien Cheng obituary", "article": "Several years before Jung Chang&apos;s Wild Swans (1991) proved a sensation in the west, the work of another Chinese woman who suffered badly during the Cultural Revolution&apos;s years of turbulence had become the first bestseller in English about this period. Life and Death in Shanghai (1987) is a memoir of huge sorrow and triumph by Nien Cheng, who has died aged 94; it could be read as symbolic of the story of modern China itself. She was born Yao Nien Yuan into a rich landowning family in Beijing and was studying at the London School of Economics in 1935 when she met her future husband, Kang-chi Cheng. A supporter of the Nationalists, on the couple&apos;s return to wartorn China in the 1940s he joined the ministry of foreign affairs, and they lived in Australia briefly, setting up an embassy there. The foundation of the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949 meant that Kang-chi&apos;s political affiliations were potentially a problem. But he was to die, of cancer, in 1957, while serving as a general manager for Shell, one of the few foreign companies that maintained a presence in Mao&apos;s China. After his death, Nien took up the position of political adviser to Shell and lived with their daughter, Meiping, a successful actor, in a large house in Shanghai, with antique furniture, servants and a good standard of living. But as Nien was to explain vividly in Life and Death in Shanghai, all that was brutally ended one day in 1967 when a visit by one of the newly created Red Guard rebellion groups heralded her own initiation into the terrifying world of the Cultural Revolution, which had started formally months earlier in Beijing. Her memoir documents her house arrest and the many hours of interrogations, in which she used Mao&apos;s words and slogans back at her own captors, and showed a proud, unbreakable spirit. She was placed in solitary confinement for more than six years, and was released in 1973, as the Cultural Revolution was winding down. She was told almost immediately that Meiping had committed suicide in 1967. Nien did not believe this and was to find subsequently that she had been murdered by Red Guards. This shattering revelation, and further attacks from leftist activists, meant that, in 1980, she applied to leave China, and went to Ottawa, Canada, and then, in 1983, to Washington. She was to be based there for the rest of her long life. With the publication of her memoir she received acclaim. The book was reviewed warmly, partly because it told the inhuman and incomprehensible story of the Cultural Revolution in a human, comprehensible voice. But the trauma that the events in the late 1960s had left on Nien were not so easily erased. She told Time magazine in 2007: &quot;In Washington, I live a full and busy life. Only sometimes I feel a haunting sadness. At dusk, when the day is fading away and my physical energy is at a low ebb, I may find myself depressed and nostalgic. But next morning I invariably wake up with renewed optimism to welcome the day as another God-given opportunity for enlightenment and experience.

It makes you think of glamorous climes \u2013 whether Miami, Havana, New York or Shanghai \u2013 in which buildings that seemed to be encrusted with fashionable jewellery gleam in the summer sun. It&apos;s also a style that&apos;s been much in vogue recently, because of BBC4&apos;s Glamour&apos;s Golden Age season, which includes a series of documentaries by David Heathcote on art deco icons. But here&apos;s the funny thing: Britain doesn&apos;t actually have much in the way of art deco architecture. Even London has just a sprinkling of buildings: Ideal House, a black granite-clad office block off Regent&apos;s Street designed by Raymond Hood; The Odeon, Leicester Square; and the glorious Daily Express building in Fleet Street, with its spectacular, cinema-style entrance lobby by Robert Atkinson. Outside London, cinemas are the most shining examples of the style \u2013 Harry Weedon&apos;s Odeons are the best (all too many converted into bingo halls or graceless multiplexes), along with shop fronts. Manchester and Glasgow have their own dramatically deco Daily Express buildings, both dramatic examples. If you look hard enough, you can detect deco influences in the buildings of Liverpool&apos;s Speke Airport (now a hotel) and even in the suburban stations of the old Southern Railway, such as Surbiton. But it&apos;s never a style that really took root in Britain. Which makes it all the odder that the BBC has decided to label buildings art deco that aren&apos;t. In his documentaries, Heathcote devoted much time to Charles Holden&apos;s 55 Broadway, the headquarters of London Underground, describing it as &quot;a fantastic art deco building&quot;. Holden would have turned in his grave at the description. Influenced by contemporary US architecture, yes. And detailed inside in ways that might suggest art deco. But an art deco icon? No. This isn&apos;t entirely Heathcote&apos;s fault. Television thrives on telling stories with the broadest of brush strokes. And art deco has become something of a catch-all title in recent years, used to describe almost any building, piece of furniture, bronze lamp or ceramic dish designed between about 1925 and 1940. I&apos;ve seen Albert Speer&apos;s Reich Chancellery for Adolf Hitler described as art deco and even \u2013 a mortal sin, surely? \u2013 Le Corbusier&apos;s coolly modern Villa Savoye in the suburbs of Paris tainted with the same label. The term itself was something of a latecomer. It wasn&apos;t much used before the design historian Bevis Hillier published his delightful book Art Deco of the 20s and 30s in 1968, defining a style that had more usually been known as moderne, modernistic and jazz modern. The style emerged from the legendary Exposition Internationale des Art D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes held in Paris in 1925 \u2013 a grand showing of design and decoration, from furniture and accessories to interiors and architecture, mapped out in acres of precious veneers, marble and onyx, stainless steel and aluminium, all much influenced by Egyptian, Babylonian and Assyrian archaeology. It was this licentious playfulness that provoked the contempt of the rising stars of the Modern movement \u2013 modernism \u2013 which had been rooted in the far more serious researches of the Bauhaus and, most notably, Le Corbusier. Modernists held art deco in contempt: it was all but sinful. A travesty. Low and dishonest. Downright vulgar \u2013 it was the stuff of fashion rather than function, of escapism rather than realism. When Nikolaus Pevsner, the architecture and design historian, went to see the cinematic Hoover Factory on London&apos;s Western Avenue, built by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners (1931\u20135), he described it in the Middlesex volume of his The Buildings of England series as &quot;perhaps the most offensive of the modernistic atrocities along this road of typical bypass factories&quot;. (A comment that was toned down to something substantially less angry in the revised edition of the book, published in 1991.) And whereas Modern architecture, for better or worse, influenced the British landscape for decades to come, art deco never really took flight. It remained in domestic settings: hinted at in the stained-glass sunrises of mock-Tudor front doors, echoed in the interiors of 1930s MG sports saloons. It conjured fantasy and escapism at a time when the world could be a very grim place indeed. Perhaps some of the same escapism touches our view of art deco. It&apos;s a way of looking at the past through neon-tinted glasses. By all means, watch Top Hat, gawp at the Chrysler Building, imagine yourself sipping cocktails aboard an ocean liner \u2013 let the dark and disturbing interwar era become the stuff of ritzy cinematic dreams. But life in the 1930s was more complicated. And while it&apos;s understandable that the BBC should have fallen for art deco&apos;s charms, it might have been better if they had got their history straight.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Le Corbusier", "Art and design", "Design", "Culture", "BBC"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-12T12:24:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/13/ethical-living-carbon-emissions", "sentences": ["Two saleswomen from Shanghai try to explain to me the fashion vagaries of doggie handbags (let&apos;s be clear: that&apos;s handbags to carry around your dog, rather than handbags made from dogs)."], "title": "Britain's problem with pets: they're bad for the planet", "article": "Henrietta Morrison confidently plunges her spoon into a tin of slow-cooked lamb hotpot and lifts out a mouthful for inspection. She passes her nostrils over the meat chunks and accompanying sauce, smiles, then places the whole lot into her mouth. &quot;Delicious,&quot; she remarks, as a small crowd of onlookers gathers round to watch the spectacle. Someone eating their lunch doesn&apos;t usually elicit such attention, but, then again, most people aren&apos;t prepared to tuck into a tin of dog food for sustenance. Morrison has a point to prove, though: she is at Europe&apos;s largest pet trade show, PetIndex, at the Birmingham NEC, and her company, Lily&apos;s Kitchen, sells the most expensive pet food on the market. Her dog food, for example, retails in places such as Harrods for more than \u00a32 a tin, with the promise that the contents are &quot;proper food&quot;. A quick inspection of the ingredients (&quot;organic and certified holistic&quot;) shows why Morrison is prepared to put her pet food where her mouth is. Lamb (&quot;60%&quot;), rice, pearl barley, broccoli, spinach, blueberries, flaxseed, marigold petals, burdock root and alfalfa are just some of the ingredients contained within a tin of slow-cooked lamb hotpot. It really does look and sound good enough to eat \u2013 that&apos;s the whole point. &quot;I eat my pet food regularly to test batches,&quot; says Morrison. &quot;My personal favourite is goose and duck feast with fruits, but chicken and turkey casserole is our bestseller.&quot; Lily&apos;s Kitchen and its range of anthropomorphised pet &quot;recipes&quot; represent the somewhat rarefied summit of the UK&apos;s pet food industry, which is now said to be worth close to \u00a32bn a year. Just like us humans, the nation&apos;s 8 million dogs and 8 million cats \u2013 as well as our collective menagerie of rabbits, horses, lizards, tropical fish et al \u2013 consume a wide variety of foodstuffs. In recent years, and despite the economic downturn, the pet food industry has witnessed a move towards &quot;premium products&quot;, but the market is still dominated by products made with ingredients that, frankly, can send a shudder down any owner&apos;s spine. &quot;Hydrolysed feather meal&quot;, &quot;derivatives of vegetable origin&quot;, &quot;ash&quot; and &quot;animal derivatives&quot; are just some of the delights routinely found in pet food. The industry has been the recipient of both jibes and brickbats about the true origin of its ingredients for decades. Horse meat, whale, kangaroo \u2013 before strict legislation tightened up the rules following the BSE scandal, we were used to hearing all sorts of hypotheses and rumours. But now it faces a new source of criticism: just what is the environmental impact of feeding the huge quantity of &quot;companion&quot; animals around the world? A new book with the somewhat provocative title of Time to Eat the Dog? The Real Guide to Sustainable Living has triggered a highly charged debate about the environmental efficacy of our pet-owning habits. If we are to examine the environmental impacts of all our lifestyle choices, the book argues, then we must also include pets in the discussion, no matter how unsettling the answers. The various environmental impacts attributed to the human food chain are well documented, so isn&apos;t it right, for example, that we should now be questioning whether it is sensible to be feeding slow-cooked lamb hotpot to our dogs, too? The New Scientist, in a recent editorial entitled &quot;Cute, fluffy and horribly greedy&quot;, largely agreed with the book&apos;s findings that some pets, due to the food they eat, have a surprisingly high &quot;ecological footprint&quot; (a way of quantifying human demand on the planet&apos;s ecosystems using a measure called &quot;global hectares&quot;). &quot;According to the authors . . . it takes 0.84 hectares [2.07 acres] of land to keep a medium-sized dog fed. In contrast, running a 4.6-litre Toyota Land Cruiser, including the energy required to construct the thing and drive it 10,000km a year, requires 0.41 hectares. Dogs are not the only environmental sinners. The eco-footprint of a cat equates to that of a Volkswagen Golf. If that&apos;s troubling, there is an even more shocking comparison. In 2004, the average citizen of Vietnam had an ecological footprint of 0.76 hectares. For an Ethiopian, it was just 0.67 hectares. In a world where scarce resources are already hogged by the rich, can we really justify keeping pets that take more than some people?&quot; Speaking from his university office in Christchurch, New Zealand, Robert Vale, who co-wrote the book with his partner Brenda Vale, admits that he has received a &quot;few unpleasant emails&quot; from irate pet owners since the New Scientist article was published, but insists that he still stands by his central point. &quot;We need to know what we&apos;re doing when it comes to the environment,&quot; he says. &quot;We can&apos;t go blind into this debate. Nothing should be off limits no matter how uncomfortable it is to discuss it. Human population growth is a huge issue, too. We have to recognise that we live in a world of finite resources.&quot; Vale says he was &quot;genuinely surprised&quot; when calculating quite how large the environmental impact was of some of our most popular pet species. &quot;Of all the areas we researched for the book, the subject of pets was by far the biggest surprise for us. But all we are arguing in the book is that we should be making sensible, informed choices. For example, it&apos;s not really going to be that much of a problem if you have a big dog but also take the bus everywhere, never fly and live in a small home. It&apos;s when everyone starts to have a big car, big house, big family and a big dog that the problems start.&quot; Vale does not \u2013 as some of his critics seem to assume \u2013 advocate a mass cull of the world&apos;s pets. But some of his proposed solutions are still likely to shock some pet owners. For example, the book suggests catching vermin such as rats and processing them into a &quot;natural&quot; cat food. Equally, the book proposes a return to the days when families would \u2013 hence the book&apos;s title \u2013 have edible pets. For example, a pair of rabbits would be kept as pets and their offspring would be eaten. It&apos;s hard to see that one gaining much traction. When feeding a pet, however, the advice is to &quot;think feathers and long ears, not horns and fins&quot;. In other words, favour pet foods made from chicken and rabbit meat and avoid those containing red meat and fish which, by comparison, have a much higher environmental impact. Last and, perhaps, most obvious: the smaller the pet, the better. Back among the avenues of stalls at the PetIndex show, vendors jostle for attention with their impressive and sometimes baffling range of pet foods and accessories. One woman proudly tells me why her pet food containing yucca extract makes &quot;her dog&apos;s poo stink less&quot;. Another tells me why, when you use her hair-grooming tool, you must aim to &quot;never expose a dog&apos;s testicles&quot;. Two saleswomen from Shanghai try to explain to me the fashion vagaries of doggie handbags (let&apos;s be clear: that&apos;s handbags to carry around your dog, rather than handbags made from dogs). I also spot car seats for dogs, a &quot;pet fountain&quot; that allows your cat to drink from a constantly flowing source of water, and a &quot;memory foam&quot; mattress for &quot;senior&quot; pooches with bad backs. I even come across a treadmill for obese dogs \u2013 the &quot;Fit Fur Life&quot; with its attendant price tag of \u00a31,865. Amid this paradise of pet paraphernalia, I meet Ben Helm, the sales and marketing director of Golden Acres, the UK&apos;s largest manufacturer of own-brand pet foods. The company owns Lancashire&apos;s largest arable farm and its on-site factory produces 70,000 tonnes of pet food a year, exporting to 37 countries around the world. By most measures, it&apos;s a huge operation, but it&apos;s a doggie biscuit in scale compared with the four leading pet-food manufacturers \u2013 P&amp;G, Nestl\u00e9, Mars and Colgate-Palmolive \u2013 which, between them, are thought to account for more than 80% of the world&apos;s pet-food market. &quot;Some people now spend more on feeding their pets than they do feeding their children,&quot; says Helm, with a hint of awe. &quot;It&apos;s a huge industry. Our bestselling &apos;kibble&apos; [dried composite biscuit] is lamb and rice. Until about a year ago, we were importing three shipping containers of lamb meal [the labelling term for dry rendered lamb derivative] from New Zealand every week to make our kibbles, but now we try to source more of it locally as people are worried about food miles.&quot; As for the rice, he says: &quot;The pet-food industry is now probably the biggest single importer of rice in the country.&quot; (I later check this factoid with the Pet Food Manufacturers&apos; Association. It says: &quot;So far as we can tell, our industry uses 50,000-150,000 tonnes of mostly &apos;broken rice&apos; [a byproduct of the milling process] a year. This compares with rice imports for human consumption of around 450,000 tonnes in the UK.&quot;) Helm picks up a handful of salmon kibbles for cats and rolls one around in his fingers. &quot;Cat food actually requires more processing than dog food because it makes it easier to digest. We also add high-quality fats to the surface of cat kibbles to aid palatability. They say that you can&apos;t fool a cat as they will detect bad fats. We source our chicken fat from the UK.&quot; Helm says that pet-food trends follow human food trends by about a year. He says that &quot;no carb&quot; pet food is currently the &quot;big thing&quot; largely because pet obesity \u2013 it is now estimated that between a quarter and half of the cats and dogs in the UK are obese \u2013 has become such a big talking point for the industry. Hypo-allergenic ranges are also popular, with many pet owners reporting that their pets are displaying signs of intolerance to the wheat found in many pet foods. It is one of the reasons why many owners are scaling up to the premium ranges offered by the likes of Lily&apos;s Kitchen. When viewing the sheer scale of the pet-food industry from on high, it can be tempting to agree with Vale&apos;s conclusion that we must urgently consider the associated environmental impacts of owning a pet. But the industry, as you might expect, puts up a spirited defence, arguing instead that the pet-food industry is actually a highly efficient processor of what would otherwise largely be waste material from the human food chain. &quot;Far from being unsustainable, pet-food manufacturing uses material from animals which are inspected by vets as fit for human consumption but which are surplus to the requirements of the human food industry,&quot; says Michael Bellingham, the chief executive of the Pet Food Manufacturers&apos; Association. &quot;These byproducts must meet the very high safety and quality criteria laid down in European legislation. Without us adding value annually to around 630,000 tonnes of animal byproducts in the UK, it might otherwise have to be disposed of via landfill or incineration. Not very green. Furthermore, a recent report by the Waste and Resources Action Programme [more commonly known as Wrap] is rightly damning of the enormous amounts of food \u2013 around 30% \u2013 that goes to waste each year. Compare that with the 1% of pet food they found went to disposal.&quot; Bellingham says that the &quot;vast majority&quot; of meat used in pet foods is byproduct from the human food chain, as opposed to &quot;human-grade ingredients&quot; or meat specifically reared for the purpose. The situation with fish, he says, is similar: &quot;The vast majority of the fish ingredients used by industry are the surplus from fish filleting plants, or fishmeal produced from such surpluses. Some &apos;super premium&apos; products may use human-grade ingredients but, for the very small amount of fish used and the tiny market share, this will have a negligible impact on fish stocks.&quot; But Bellingham also argues that the benefits of pets need to be viewed more holistically, rather than just through the prism of their &quot;carbon pawprint&quot;. &quot;Our environment, far from being threatened by pets, is greatly enriched by the part they play in our lives,&quot; he says. &quot;Pets in the home instil responsibility, encourage social as well as environmental awareness and have positive health benefits on children. Furthermore, children from households with pets are found to have stronger immune systems and take fewer days off school. People with pets make fewer visits to the doctor \u2013 21% less for elderly people. What large polluting car improves your health and gets you out for a walk every day?&quot; Archaeology has shown that we have been living with companion animals for at least 12,000 years. For example, in what is now northern Israel, a dig at the remains of the Natufian settlement called Ain Mallaha revealed the grave of an elderly man who is tenderly cradling a puppy in his arms. That we greatly benefit from the presence of pets isn&apos;t really disputed. But in order to reduce their impact on the environment, should there possibly be a limit to the number of pets we have? Because, of course, it&apos;s not just the food they eat that&apos;s the problem. Some conservationists, for example, have long been saying that the population of domesticated cats is having a detrimental impact on native fauna. As obligate carnivores, cats are, by instinct, opportunistic predators. A 2005 study in Bristol, for example, showed that 131 cats returned home 358 animals \u2013 birds, small mammals and amphibians \u2013 over the course of a year. It didn&apos;t record the prey the cats failed to return home. Professor Stephen Harris, based at the school of biological sciences at the University of Bristol, was one of the study&apos;s authors and he believes that the impact of some pets on local ecology needs to be debated much more widely. &quot;Compulsory neutering of cats is not really practical,&quot; he says. &quot;But people really should weigh up the environmental cost of owning a pet. We each need to ask ourselves if we really need a pet? In the US, animal welfare groups strongly recommend that cats are kept indoors. And in Australia, some states are now discussing making it compulsory to neuter cats, as well as introducing &apos;feline-free&apos; zones where, if found, cats can be trapped and humanely destroyed by the local authority. But here the British attitude to cats is that they should be left to roam as this is natural.&quot; (In an earlier study that Harris co-authored, it was calculated that the UK&apos;s 7.7 million cats kill around 188 million wild animals a year.) But Harris says dogs aren&apos;t exactly guilt-free, given that an estimated 250,000 tonnes of dog faeces are deposited on our streets and in our parks each year: &quot;It is calculated that 100 tonnes of dog shit is left on Richmond Park in London each year alone. This has a huge impact on the local ecology. If you see aerial photographs of the area, you can see how yellow the grass is around the car park where all the dogs rush out of the owners&apos; cars to urinate. Pets such as dogs and cats can have lots of these little impacts, which really do add up. Ecologically, pets are very demanding and this is a lifestyle choice that is difficult to justify for most people.&quot; (In their book, the Vales make the observation that, in San Francisco, city officials say that dog faeces now account for 4% of the municipal waste sent to landfill each year \u2013 the same level as used nappies.) Marina Pacheco, chief executive of the Mammal Society \u2013 who owns a cat herself \u2013 says education, rather than legislation, is the answer: &quot;We are aware of the huge impact cats have on small mammals. Yes, we probably have too many cats in the UK, but it&apos;s too hard to work out the optimum carrying capacity. We have to be pragmatic about the fact that millions of people do own cats. There are things cat owners can do, though. Keeping cats in during dusk and dawn, which is their natural hunting time, is a good idea, as are collar bells. Not owning too many cats is also sensible. One or two is enough and get them neutered, too. It must become socially unacceptable to be an irresponsible pet owner.&quot; Anyone who owns a pet will keenly testify how much joy and companionship they can bring. But they will also acknowledge just how much time, effort and money they can require, too: a tortoise needs its heat and lighting; a horse needs shoeing and a regular supply of straw; an iguana needs its supply of insects; a chicken needs grit and corn; a dog needs its delousing powder; a cat needs a scratch tower. And then there&apos;s the insurance, the vet&apos;s fees and the annual cost of food and bedding. It&apos;s little wonder that some pets are described as being as big a commitment as having a child in the home. So it shouldn&apos;t really come as a surprise that some are now viewing pets as having a similar environmental impact to that of a small person. After all, in many owners&apos; eyes, their pets are very much part of the family. Back at PetIndex, Morrison is handing out samples of her luxury pet food to passersby. &quot;No, we don&apos;t use any animal meal in our pet foods,&quot; she says proudly to one interested woman. &quot;It&apos;s the devil&apos;s work. They strip everything that&apos;s good off a chicken, even the fat, then they grind it into a powder for pet food. People are fixated on price \u2013 most pet food is cheaper than a tin of baked beans. But more and more people are coming round to the view, just as they are doing with their own diet, that quality counts. We&apos;ve only been going since last November and we&apos;ve already turned over half a million pounds. We have to start asking more questions about the food we feed our pets.&quot; For altogether different reasons, Morrison is right.", "tags": ["Ethical and green living", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Pets", "Waste", "Environment", "Life and style", "Food", "Animals"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-13T00:05:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/13/andy-murray-atp-tour-world-finals", "sentences": ["Last year in Shanghai Murray reached the semi-finals; this time his aim is the final and the title."], "title": "Andy Murray gets his priorities right with the O2 his No1 target", "article": "It was perfectly clear from the moment Andy Murray arrived in Paris on the back of his title in Valencia, his sixth of the season, that the Paris Indoor Masters was never going to figure high in his priorities.

Last year in Shanghai Murray reached the semi-finals; this time his aim is the final and the title. &quot;I will relax for a few days and then train hard. The centre court is not getting laid at the arena until I think Thursday or Friday, but they&apos;re putting down courts at Queen&apos;s, so I&apos;ll practise there when I&apos;m ready. I&apos;ll spend some time in the gym and get myself in good shape and give it my best shot for one last push. That&apos;s really the goal.&quot; After a six-week lay-off, forced on him by an injury to his left wrist, Murray felt his win in Valencia, and a further victory in Paris, were the perfect preparation, while the defeat by Radek Stepanek was of no consequence at all. &quot;My goal was to get in good enough shape to compete well in London. I&apos;ll be match-fit for my first match there. You know, my wrist is fine, which is great. It might have been a bit of a nightmare to come back and had problems with that again, but it&apos;s been absolutely perfect.&quot; At this time of the year all the players are carrying some sort of niggle or minor injury, and there was some concern during his matches against Blake and Stepanek that Murray was having trouble with a groin pull. &quot;It&apos;s been like that since last week in Valencia. I played a lot of long matches. It happens when you don&apos;t play for a long time. You just get niggles and little tweaks and stuff.&quot; Murray did not seem unduly concerned and was already turning his thoughts to his opponents in London. &quot;I don&apos;t know what the surface and conditions are going to be like in the O2.

Agreement between the US and China on key issues would breathe new life into the moribund negotiations towards a global climate deal. But sources are downplaying the chances of a breakthrough, suggesting another blow to the talks. Instead, modest progress may be announced in the fields of technology co-operation and private sector initiatives to move towards a low-carbon economy. In the run-up to Copenhagen, the US negotiator Todd Stern had hoped for a series of bilateral steps that might lead the world&apos;s major polluters into an international deal. These two nations, which together account for 40% of global emissions, will make or break the summit. China is moving towards setting its first &quot;carbon intensity&quot; target, which would curb \u2013 but not cut \u2013 the pollution emitted as its economy grows. The target is thought to be about a 40-45% reduction relative to economic growth by 2020. But China is unlikely to declare its hand yet. There remains a big gap in the demands made by each nation. The US wants China to sign up to specific emissions commitments; China insists they should be voluntary, as they are under the current Kyoto climate change treaty. China&apos;s public position is that rich nations should cut emissions by 40% by 2020. Privately, negotiators acknowledge this is unrealistic, but they want the US to go much further than the 17% cut approved by the House but blocked in the Senate. If the US president says he is prepared to push for a higher target, some observers believe Hu may give him a political &quot;gift&quot; to take back. &quot;China understands the political system in the US. We know it&apos;s difficult for Obama. If he wants the Senate to do more, he needs to be able to say China will do more than people expect,&quot; said Yang Fuqiang, the director of global climate change solutions at the Worldwide Fund for Nature. Yang identified several possible cards that China might play either during Obama&apos;s visit or at Copenhagen. Earlier this year, it withheld a planned announcement on a higher renewable energy target so that this could be used at a more politically opportune moment. Other major shifts in its energy mix are the likely doubling or tripling of nuclear power generation, greater use of natural gas \u2013 China has recently discovered some major fields inside its territory \u2013 and in the most optimistic scenario, a pledge to improve its energy or carbon efficiency by 20% for each of its five-year plans until 2020. &quot;All these measure together add up to emissions reduction of 4-4.5 gigatonnes over the period 2005 to 2020,&quot; said Yang. &quot;This is the opportunity. But the condition is that Obama uses the power of the presidency to persuade Congress to do more.&quot; Others believe this is overly optimistic. &quot;Obama&apos;s dream scenario would be to come to China and make it look like he saves the world from China so that he could go back and convince his Congress to back him up in Copenhagen. But why should China go along with that scenario. The US target is pathetic,&quot; said another Chinese observer, who declined to be identified. With dim prospects of a legally binding deal at Copenhagen or a US climate bill passing the Senate, others say Hu has little incentive to make concessions during Obama&apos;s visit. But the meeting itself will be significant. &quot;There will be a lot of public stuff about cooperation and in private they will get to understand each other better. It will be an opportunity to show that China is doing a lot. That will help in the Senate,&quot; said Deborah Seligsohn, a principal advisor to the World Resources Institute&apos;s Climate and Energy Programme in Beijing. &quot;Fundamentally, the objective is for Obama and Hu to speak face to face. Given that the specific issue is trust, that will help a lot.&quot; China&apos;s emissions have grown rapidly in recent years along with the economy, but it has one of the world&apos;s most ambitious renewable energy programmes and is on course to meet a self-set target to improve energy efficiency by 20% between 2005 and 2010. The world&apos;s number one emitter is adamant that it should not have to take actions that restrict economic growth because rich nations have a far greater historical and per capita responsibility for the carbon in the atmosphere. It wants wealthy countries like the US to provide technology and finance that will help developing nations to ease the impact of climate change and move towards a low-carbon economy. The two governments signed a memorandum of understanding in July that identified possible areas of collaboration on research and technology. But efforts to flesh out that agreement have proved tougher than expected. There have been wrangles over how much each nation should pay for a proposed joint research centre on clean energy. The US energy secretary, Steven Chu, who is travelling with Obama, is expected to sign an agreement next week, but it is unclear if the countries will split the costs down the middle. While business deals and joint projects may be announced to develop green buildings, electric cars and smart power grids, there is less confidence that a deal can be struck in the key area of &quot;clean&quot; coal technology. The US has proposed closer collaboration in this field, which is vital given the heavy reliance of both economies on coal. But China has been cautious about such overtures, perhaps because it is poised to move ahead of the United States in several key processes, including integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) in power stattions and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). If these two key players are unable to resolve their differences, there is a danger that the Copenhagen talks will suffer the same fate as the Kyoto protocol, which was handicapped by the absence of a clear commitment by China and rejection by the US Congress. There is scope for more progress this time. During the UN climate summit in September, Hu said China was prepared to reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by a &quot;notable margin&quot; by 2020. Beijing has a figure up its sleeve. Government-related thinktanks are proposing targets of 40-45% by 2020 and 78-80% by 2050. &quot;I think they will announce something soon,&quot; said a source in the Energy Research Institute. &quot;The upper end of our recommendation is 44%. But whether they will adopt it depends on their assessment of how fast the economy will grow.&quot; Whether this figure will be high enough and announced early enough to shake the rust from the Senate is uncertain. &quot;At some point, China must produce a number. Assuming its good enough, then it should be recorded in an international agreement,&quot; said Charlie McElwee, a Shanghai-based American lawyer specialising in environmental issues. &quot;Without that, I think there will be a pushback from the Senate.&quot; For the moment, it is unclear even if the two leaders will attend Copenhagen. Expectations have been pushed down so far recently that leaders appear reluctant to invest political capital in the talks.

What might have happened if they had met is a fascinating counter-factual question of history. After the communist victory in 1949, two decades of hostility ended with Nixon&apos;s visit to Beijing in 1972 when China became a useful ally for Washington against the Soviet Union. Since then the relationship has fluctuated but has always been seen on the Chinese side as essential \u2013 less consistently so by the US. What is different today, and what takes the Obama administration into new territory, is that it is at last a relationship of equals: the US now needs China as much as China needs the US. The contrast with the last presidential state visit to China, by Bill Clinton in 1998, is striking. That event was more show than substance, carefully choreographed to give the president a much-needed boost after the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clinton urged the virtues of democracy upon President Jiang Zemin and offered to act as a go-between for him and the Dalai Lama. It looked good at the time but the Tibetan offer came predictably to nothing and six months later Jiang launched a crackdown on the Chinese democracy movement. Within another six months, the US air force bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, provoking a wave of genuine anger across China. George Bush, in his presidential campaign, would label China as a potential strategic threat, not as a partner. It was the shock of 9/11 that gave China a grim golden chance to make itself more useful to the US (and target its own Muslim dissidents in Xinjiang province) by signing up to the war on terror. Yet in spite of Chinese entry into the World Trade Organisation, Beijing knew that the relationship remained less than equal: in the wry expression of a senior Chinese diplomat &quot;we think it is better to remain number two&quot;. Today&apos;s relationship occupies a completely different world in which there is talk of a Sino-US G2, and even suggestions that China might become No 1. The past rhetoric of both sides \u2013 &quot;empty cannons&quot; as Chairman Mao once called them \u2013 seems dated. China is not going to make too much fuss about continued US arms sales to Taiwan (when was that island last in the headlines?). Human rights in China \u2013 never a huge concern to Washington (only a month after the Beijing massacre in 1989, a secret US envoy was sent to Beijing to maintain relations) \u2013 will be mentioned for form&apos;s sake by Obama. But the priorities identified by Obama earlier this week are the only ones that really matter: &quot;climate change, economic recovery, nuclear non-proliferation&quot;. The US says it seeks a &quot;comprehensive partnership&quot; with China in what Jon Huntsman, new US ambassador to Beijing, calls &quot;the most important bilateral relationship in the world&quot;. This is music to the ears of Chinese foreign policy advisers in Beijing who have often worried about the underlying &quot;inequality&quot; in US-China relations. The presidents whom they advised, Jiang and now Hu Jintao, can privately tell internal critics that their long-term strategic policy of putting the relationship with the US first has paid off. More openly, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has warned the US military establishment that China should be regarded as a partner, not an adversary. Does China perhaps have the upper hand in this relationship, as it measures another 8% growth in GDP against the limping US economy? Hardly so, if we consider the real implication of the familiar statistic that China now holds $800bn in US Treasury bonds. Obama may ask Beijing to revalue the Renminbi; Hu may ask Washington to &quot;focus on its own financial deficit&quot;, but the Chinese surplus rides on the American debt as if on the back of the Old Man of the Sea: neither can let go of the other. And China&apos;s extensive growth over almost two decades is not only unhealthily dependent on foreign markets, but has been bought at the expense of a deteriorating environment and a worsening rich-poor divide. US presidential visits to China have always had a showbiz element \u2013 ever since Richard Nixon stood on the Great Wall and declared that it was truly a great wall. We may expect a wave of Obama-fever in the Chinese media: every tabloid paper \u2013 and there are a lot of them now \u2013 will want to have Michelle on the front page. Yet the widely read Huanqiu Bao (Global Times) says that the Obama visit &quot;won&apos;t shake the world&quot; and that most Chinese people have &quot;neither strong concerns nor high expectations&quot;. In a more equal Sino-US partnership, fewer heads may actually turn for the presidential motorcade.", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "China", "Obama administration", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Global economy", "Global recession", "Nuclear weapons", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-14T15:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/nov/13/china-race-obama", "sentences": ["For example, during the late summer, Luo Jing, a resident of Shanghai of mixed-race descent (her father an African-American, her mother is Chinese) appeared on a television talent show that was seen across China."], "title": "What does China make of Obama? | Russell Leigh Moses", "article": "Race is an insensitive issue in China. The sighting of someone who is not of the majority Han race does not stop conversation here, but sparks comments of all sorts \u2013 of surprise, wonder, bewilderment and defensiveness. Being cautious about what one says about colour or heritage in China is seen as silly and blinded. That is not to say that talking about race in China is a dialogue suffused with respect. For example, during the late summer, Luo Jing, a resident of Shanghai of mixed-race descent (her father an African-American, her mother is Chinese) appeared on a television talent show that was seen across China. The farther Lou advanced in the contest, the louder the voices and vitriol became, especially against her mother for having slept with a black man and producing what many Chinese saw as an impure prodigy. Only a precious few saw Lou as a contestant, instead of some sort of a specimen of an ill-fated union. Her singing voice and presence in front of the cameras were fine (although she ended up eventually losing the contest). It was her colour and ancestry that dominated the conversation online and in the streets here. And now, Barack Obama is walking into this conversation. Obama arrives to see a society that is increasingly self-confident about its identity and national power, and more open to debating issues. But while the rest of the world agonises over race and identity, the vast majority of Chinese know precisely who they are: they are Han, and the rest of the world is not. That world may be the source of some envy where hardware is concerned, but it is also populated with peoples who have a barbarian quality and an uncultured approach to life, according to many here.  Globalisation has shaken this simplicity somewhat \u2013 the idea of China being the centre of the world, with the rest of the globe populated by &quot;outsiders&quot;. Yet globalisation has also tossed many Chinese back into a more strident tone of traditionalism, one that accentuates differences between nations, peoples and races instead of celebrating the sort of diversity that helped bring Obama to high office in the United States.  Many Chinese do not know what to make of Obama. That he is immediately identifiable here in China does not make his policies or views well known. Obama is as perplexing to many residents as he is popular, as many see him as a famous black person on par with Michael Jackson instead of, say, Thomas Jefferson. Still, for more than a few Chinese, his triumph indicates a better system of selecting officials, whereby someone who is inexperienced and yet unique can rise to the top of government. For these folks, Obama is noteworthy for his sizeable talent as well as his skin colour. Obama is a political rock star, his image emblazoned on T-shirts and bags for sale in the odd tourist shop and storefront. Those products made enough bureaucrats nervous that products bearing his face were removed from many stores, reflecting not race but the nervousness of certain cadres about his popularity relative to some Chinese officials.  And it is the Chinese government that will endeavour to dictate the discourse while Obama is here. At a press conference this past week, a foreign ministry spokesperson implored Obama to understand the Chinese position on Tibet because, in Beijing&apos;s view, the Communist party liberated Tibetans from serfdom. Obama &quot;is a black president and understands the slavery abolition movement,&quot; the spokesperson intoned, and should therefore be sensible on such matters.  Chinese society appears to be convinced about the issue of race, and the government seems to have made up its mind on how Obama should act. It will be up to Obama to shake up that self-certainty and perhaps begin to change the contours of the conversation about race here. \u2022 Editor&apos;s note: The headlines on this article were changed after publication for purposes of clarification", "tags": ["China", "Race issues", "Barack Obama", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-15T13:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/16/barack-obama-shanghai-students-china", "sentences": ["The US believes that freedom of expression and political participation are universal values, Barack Obama told an audience of young Shanghai students today, in a townhall-style meeting streamed live on the White House website, broadcast on a local Shanghai television station and carried as text on a major Chinese portal.", "The president, who arrived in Shanghai late last night to begin the Chinese leg of his four-nation tour, answered questions from internet users and called at random on questioners in the audience \u2013 handpicked by officials at universities in the area."], "title": "Barack Obama meets Shanghai students in China", "article": "The US believes that freedom of expression and political participation are universal values, Barack Obama told an audience of young Shanghai students today, in a townhall-style meeting streamed live on the White House website, broadcast on a local Shanghai television station and carried as text on a major Chinese portal.

But some expressed disappointment at the soft tone of many questions and said he should have addressed human rights violations in China more directly. In brief opening remarks Obama repeated earlier assurances that America welcomed China&apos;s rise adding: &quot;Because of our co-operation, the US and China are more prosperous and more secure.&quot; But he went on to highlight differences between the two countries, telling his audience: &quot;We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation. &quot;But we also don&apos;t believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation.&quot; &quot;These freedoms of expression, and worship, of access to information and political participation \u2013 we believe they are universal rights.

The president, who arrived in Shanghai late last night to begin the Chinese leg of his four-nation tour, answered questions from internet users and called at random on questioners in the audience \u2013 handpicked by officials at universities in the area. Participants in such events are carefully briefed in advance on what they may ask. China-watchers in the US have long encouraged their government to reach out to the Chinese public, as well as the country&apos;s leaders. But the lengthy negotiations required to arrange today&apos;s town hall meetings \u2013 and the compromises required \u2013 are testament to the difficulties of doing so. At one stage US officials considered ditching the event because of disagreements over the number of attendees \u2013 they initially wanted 1,000 present \u2013 and whether it would be broadcast live or not. Campaigners have pushed hard for the president to speak out publicly on human rights issues. Aides have already indicated that he will raise them in his meetings with Chinese leaders. But Nicholas Bequelin, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Obama had missed an opportunity, framing such issues as a question of political culture rather than international legal norms. &quot;What&apos;s important is to put a degree of pressure on the Chinese government for its repressive practices,&quot; he said. &quot;You cannot do that without a degree of straight talk. That&apos;s not what happened at this meeting \u2026 What was needed was to include things relevant to what is happening in the country \u2013 as he did in Cairo, for example.&quot; For the most part, the president focused on a message of collaboration and mutual respect. Many of the most sensitive issues mentioned in the thousands of questions posted ahead of the event \u2013 such as Tibet \u2013 did not emerge. &quot;There are very few global challenges that can be solved unless the US and China agree,&quot; he told a questioner, citing the need to make progress on climate change. &quot;Other countries around the world will be waiting for us \u2026 If they say &apos;The US and China are not serious about this&apos;, they will not be serious either.

He will also visit the Forbidden City and Great Wall. Mo Shaoping, one of China&apos;s best-known human rights lawyers, told the Financial Times that people &quot;from the American side&quot; had contacted him to see whether he would meet Obama and that he was subsequently questioned about the event by public security officers.

Most Chinese citizens will have seen only brief extracts \u2013 not including the remarks on censorship. Although Obama selected questioners from the audience, those in the hall were picked by officials at Shanghai institutions. At least two of those who spoke were thought to be student officers of the Communist Youth League. Other questions were posted by internet users. One issues raised concerned arms sales to Taiwan \u2013 in a question Obama did not directly answer \u2013 another about the president&apos;s Nobel Peace Prize. It was the US ambassador Jon Huntsman who read out the question about China&apos;s &quot;Great Firewall&quot; and the blocking of Twitter, posted on a US government site. &quot;I think that the more freely information flows, the stronger the society becomes, because then citizens of countries around the world can hold their own governments accountable,&quot; Obama said. &quot;They can begin to think for themselves.&quot; He described himself as &quot;a big supporter of non-censorship&quot; and said criticism made him a better president. The comments on web censorship were carried on Xinhua, though bloggers reported that they disappeared from another news site. One Twitter user wrote: &quot;I will not forget this morning; I heard, on my shaky internet connection, a question about our own freedom which only a foreign leader can discuss.&quot; But influential Chinese blogger Michael Anti wrote: &quot;Except for the internet freedom Q&amp;A, Obama was too soft, carefully avoiding confronting China, so it made his town hall fail.&quot; In brief opening remarks Obama repeated earlier assurances that America welcomed China&apos;s rise, saying co-operation had made both countries more prosperous and secure.

Obama&apos;s reference to censorship and the internet in Shanghai today came as little surprise to those of us who attended a briefing last week organised by the US embassy. No traditional journalists were present; instead a range of prominent bloggers fresh from the fifth Chinese Blogger Conference in Guangdong province and a mix of opinion leaders were invited to three consulates in China, linked by a video conferencing system. The respected blogger Wen Yunchao said many internet users wanted Obama to urge Chinese leaders to release the internet from heavy censorship. In response, Wang Zheng, from Chinese Media University, argued that mainstream public opinion was not bothered about internet freedom \u2013 that they cared instead about financial freedom and freedom to travel. Bloggers in attendance swiftly tweeted Wang&apos;s remarks, triggering a big debate online. Within hours he had been given a new moniker by the twittersphere: Mr Mainstream. And still Chinese authorities march to the same old beat. In recent days they have detained several dissidents and civic right activists, including Zhao Lianhai, Yao Lifa, Zhang Mingxuan and Liu Zhengyou. It&apos;s the same mentality seen in the runup to the Olympic Games and after the Sichuan earthquake. The system is devoted to harmony in the short term, which leads to loss in the long term. But the booming internet cannot be controlled for much longer. It plays host to the panoply of opinions, collected in the form of a dynamic cloud, its shape constantly changing so that no one can map it. Followers of Mr Mainstream, upon hearing Obama&apos;s concerns about internet censorship, may respond by saying: &quot;We are not censoring the internet, we are merely enforcing existing laws.&quot; Maybe, but the internet has been anything but silent as Obama&apos;s trip approached. Beyond the moderated discussion on the official Xinhua news agency website, thousands of voices have sprung up on Twitter, collected from the twittersphere in a tag called #obamacn, started by Rebecca Machinnon, a famous China Internet expert. In his session with students in Shanghai \u2013 the only public meeting scheduled for his visit \u2013 Obama showed his shrewedness by sending a message about the internet and freedom of expression. One senses he knows something about the shape of clouds. It remains to be seen, however, whether the president will show the bandwidth in the next few days to make mention of the Chinese citizen and activist Feng Zhenghu, who has been barred from re-entering the country and remains stuck in Tokyo&apos;s Narita airport, the very same airport through which Barack Obama passed on his way to China.", "tags": ["Twitter", "China", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Media", "Internet", "Censorship", "Barack Obama", "Freedom of speech", "US news", "Law", "Social media", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-16T16:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/16/china-barack-obama-us-technology", "sentences": ["A day after backing a delay in the international negotiating process towards a deal in Copenhagen, the US president told a townhall meeting in Shanghai that he and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao would focus on ways to reduce their carbon footprints.", "This is more about money,&quot; said Charlie McElwee, a Shanghai-based American lawyer specialising in environmental issues."], "title": "China and US poised to break new ground in green technology partnership", "article": "Barack Obama said the US and China will break new ground in their partnership on clean energy technology during a summit in Beijing tomorrow that will also seek to find a new way forward for global climate talks. A day after backing a delay in the international negotiating process towards a deal in Copenhagen, the US president told a townhall meeting in Shanghai that he and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao would focus on ways to reduce their carbon footprints. As the world&apos;s two biggest emitters expand their economies and populations, he said they needed a way to minimise the impact of increased energy use. &quot;Both countries have a great interest in finding new strategies to combat climate change,&quot; he said. During the summit, the two nations will announce a new energy cooperation programme, unveil closer collaboration on &quot;cleaner coal&quot; technology and smart grids and establish a joint research centre. Sources close to the preparations say a memorandum of understanding will be signed in the Great Hall of the People, under which the US Trade Development Agency will fund an office in Beijing to assist US firms to secure government financing for new energy projects. A group of companies led by Peabody, one of the biggest US coal firms, will receive seed money from the US government money to establish a demonstration facility in China that shows off its scrubbing, washing and emission-reduction technology, the source says. The firm may also unveil a deepening of its involvement in China&apos;s GreenGen project to pioneer cleaner and more efficient coal burning technology. General Electric will sign a deal with Shenhua, China&apos;s biggest coal company, to use the former&apos;s coal gasification technology for increased energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage. But the message of cooperation between the world&apos;s two biggest emitters looks likely to be diluted by the competitive instincts of businesses and politicians who are reluctant to share funding and technology with a rival. US sources say no public money will be channelled to Chinese firms or projects because the country is seen as a rival. At the start of his Asia tour, Obama highlighted this point by describing China as a &quot;vital partner, as well as a competitor.&quot; The potential for friction has been evident in backroom negotiations over the funding of a joint clean energy research centre. China is thought to have asked the US to provide a larger share of the costs to reflect its greater wealth and historical responsibility for the carbon in the atmosphere. But the US wanted a 50-50 split. The final amount of its investment in the new centre, which is expected to be unveiled by energy secretary Steven Chu tomorrow, will be in the region of $18m, according to a source familiar with the deal. US officials have recently been trying to link China&apos;s Qinghua University, MIT in the US, and Cambridge in the UK. The two nations also talk a different language when it comes to the transfer of technology from west to east, a key concern for China. On Beijing&apos;s wishlist are salt-resistant materials for offshore windfarms, hi-tech components for large wind turbines, smart-grid control systems and more efficient pumps for nuclear reactors. But the US side prefers to talk in terms of &quot;technology cooperation&quot;, suggesting more of a two-way street. Observers say far more could have been achieved with a smoother transition between the Bush and Obama administrations and a greater level of trust. &quot;There are some areas where China is more advanced, but in key areas, it needs US technology,&quot; said Yang Fuqiang, head of climate solutions at the Worldwide Fund for Nature. &quot;The difficulty is how to compensate the private sector and how to remove trade restrictions on items that the US does not want to give to China because of its fears a loss of competitive advantage.&quot; Claims that China needs US technology are disputed. &quot;There is nothing out there that China does not have access to if it is willing to pay for it. This is more about money,&quot; said Charlie McElwee, a Shanghai-based American lawyer specialising in environmental issues. &quot;On carbon capture and storage, China is among the world leaders if not the leader.&quot; Business optimism about a potential low-carbon market worth $1 trillion in China has been tempered by concerns about trade tensions.

The last 18 months, with its succession of high-profile state events and serious unrest in Xinjiang and Tibet have not been good for Chinese web freedoms. Since the riots in Xinjiang, the entire province has been propelled back to the pre-internet age as the authorities simply shut down access across the board. But the outcome of the long-running war between Chinese web users and the censors is far from decided. Obama&apos;s visit itself became another excuse for official censorship: according to Chinese tweets, the authorities ordered all internet sites to exercise strict control of content, eliminating references to public letters to the president, meeting with dissidents (many of whom have, in any event, been detained in advance) offline protests and attacks on the Chinese government in vague and disguised language. As one Chinese tweeter responded, in an example of the kind of disguised language that enrages the censors, &quot;f**k the river crabs&quot;. The river crab is a pun, one of many with which rebellious Chinese netizens taunt the censors. The word for river crab is a homonym for the word for &quot;harmony&quot;, a reference to the government policy of building a &quot;harmonious society&quot;. When a blog is shut down in China, netizens describe it as being &quot;harmonised&quot; and pictures of river crabs abound on the Chinese web. The curiosity is that Chinese tweets are available at all: Twitter, along with Facebook has been officially blocked in China for months. But a glance at the Berlin Twitter Wall, set up as part of the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall the Berlin Wall, reveals that the space has been taken over by Chinese tweeters calling for the destruction of the Great Firewall of China, demonstrating once again their agility with proxy servers and other evasive strategies. As to the official response to Obama&apos;s appeal, while his own election campaign benefited hugely from its effective internet strategy, this is unlikely to impress a Chinese leadership whose risks of facing popular election, to put it mildly, are remote. But the lack of ballot box opportunities does not mean that public opinion has no value for a Chinese leadership whose other claims to legitimacy are precarious. What is said on the web matters a great deal. Their dilemma is that censorship is a crude instrument, and each time it is used it further alienates a constituency they would prefer to co-opt. The culture of savvy Chinese netizens \u2013 the ones who are expanding the public space the web creates, rather than shopping, gambling or downloading pornography \u2013 is more rebellious than compliant, more inventive than passive. Government-sponsored bloggers \u2013 the 50 cent party, as the Chinese call them \u2013 have the difficult task of generating exciting propaganda in a culture where satire is more appealing.

This may not be good news for Barack Obama. Despite all the assurances that the US and China have to work together, Obama&apos;s trip reveals a relationship with a strangely lopsided quality to it. America is still the richer and more powerful nation. Its military is far ahead of the People&apos;s Liberation Army. The administration&apos;s international fence-restoration means that it can count on an array of allies, whereas China&apos;s are few and far between, and founded mainly on money. For all Beijing&apos;s efforts to spread its soft power, it cannot hold a candle to America when it comes to popular culture; how many Chinese film stars can most people outside Asia name \u2013 other than perhaps Jet Li or Jackie Chan? Say what you will about delays in closing Guant\u00e1namo, but most people would prefer American values to those of a regime that maintains a big repressive apparatus, locks up lawyers who defend ordinary citizens, puts petitioners in &quot;black jails&quot;, imposes crackdowns in Tibet and Xinjiang worthy of British imperialism at its depths and forbids its citizens to watch its national day parade in the streets. Not to mention the control freakery of the system and the restrictions on information. Though optimists still saw Obama&apos;s town hall meeting in Shanghai as progress it was a sign of how constrained America allows its freedom of action to be when its leader is on Chinese soil. But this week in Beijing, Obama has been on the back foot. Take the main issues of his visit: \u2022 Money. Like Bush during the war in Iraq, he needs Chinese cash to fund his stimulus package. Of course, there is another side to this equation. China would like to put more of its money elsewhere than in dollars but it cannot do so on any significant scale; it is fair bet that the decision-makers in Beijing do not fancy going into Italian bonds in a big way and there is a limit to the number of mining companies they can buy in Africa or Australia. \u2022 North Korea. The US depends on China to pull something out of the hat on the nuclear issue. \u2022 Climate change. As a lawyer who knows when his brief is full of holes, Obama executed a strategic retreat over the Copenhagen conference on his way to Shanghai, which leaves the People&apos;s Republic free to do its own thing in dealing with its huge environmental crisis. \u2022 The currency. Washington would like Beijing to increase the value of the yuan, but the Chinese fired a pre-emptive strike at the weekend by castigating the combination of a weak dollar and monetary easing in the US, blaming it for the development of the destabilising &quot;carry trade&quot;, and they were right. \u2022 Trade. As the dollar declines, China is the big winner with its currency pegged to the greenback, its ability to lower input costs and its excess capacity. \u2022 Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan. He had to say something on the first, if only for domestic US reasons. But he kept it to a minimum and used wording designed not to ruffle Chinese feathers. China bulls speak of growth hitting 11.9% growth next year (such a precise figure immediately causes my eyebrows to twitch) and others see China&apos;s march to world supremacy as inevitable (it is noticeable that the triumphalism comes more from western observers than from serious Chinese analysts). I would be more cautious on both counts. China faces the biggest array of challenges of any administration on earth. These range from the aforementioned environmental issues to the wealth divide, corruption and the role of the Communist party, the retreat from legal reform, the demographic trap caused by the one-child policy and the increasing life expectancy of the aged. There is no doubting the short-term success of the administration in Beijing in climbing out of the hole caused from the spluttering of the export-driven economic model framed in the 1980s, but deeper structural reform which China needs appears to have been sidelined into sporadic local experiments. Hu Jintao and his colleagues have every reason to feel pleased with themselves. They have steered the economy back to 8% growth on the back of a huge fiscal and monetary stimulus. They have $2.4tn in foreign exchange reserves. The social instability which so many observers said would result from unemployment in export factories has not happened. China is managing its emergence from the crisis extremely well, with massive allocation of resources to projects and a drip-down effect on the rural sector. In short, the Chinese machine is working, whatever the doubts about its sustainability. That, after all, is what totalitarian systems are for \u2013 they can mobilise on a huge scale while democracies are delayed by due political process. What this means is that, for all his country&apos;s backwardness in many respects, Hu can look Obama in the eye, feeling like a winner who does not need to take any lessons.

Murray, the world No4, will not be the favourite but home support should be a decided advantage for this end-of-season elite eight-man tournament when all the players are a little weary. Last year in Shanghai the Scot scored a startling victory over Roger Federer, the world No1, to knock him out of the competition at the initial round\u2011robin stage for the first time. Yesterday Murray and Federer were drawn in the same group again, along with Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, the reigning US Open champion, and the Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, with the top two to qualify for the semi-finals a week on Saturday. The other round-robin group comprises Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic, the holder, Nikolay Davydenko, and Sweden&apos;s Robin Soderling, a late replacement for the injured Andy Roddick, this year&apos;s Wimbledon runner-up. Ideally Murray might have preferred to be in Nadal&apos;s group, simply because the Spanish world No2 appeared far from comfortable at the recent Paris Masters, and does not particularly enjoy playing indoors. However, the British No1 holds a career head-to-head advantage over Federer (6-3), Del Potro (4-1) and Verdasco (7-1), so should feel confident of reaching the semi-final, as he did on his debut last year. &quot;All of the guys are tough otherwise they wouldn&apos;t be here and at his best there is no one tougher than Roger,&quot; said Murray yesterday after being present at the draw made in one of the London Eye&apos;s windswept pods. London is the 15th city to host this end-of-season tournament. The pressure will be on him, though not to the same extent as Wimbledon where Murray reached the semi-finals this year. &quot;It&apos;s great that so many people are coming to watch at the O2 and that the ticket sales have been so good,&quot; Murray added. &quot;The Wimbledon build\u2011up with Queens makes it a lot longer and maybe in a couple of years&apos; time I won&apos;t notice it so much, but you&apos;d have to say this is not quite the same, though I&apos;m very focused.&quot;London is the 15th different city to play host to the year-end championships, which began in 1970 in Tokyo, with Murray attempting to become only the third player, after Spain&apos;s Alex Corretja and David Nalbandian of Argentina, to win the tournament without having won a major. Ticket sales have topped 250,000. &quot;It&apos;s incredible,&quot; said Murray. &quot;There is no shortage of interest in tennis and not just around Wimbledon.

Instead, it was the one that launched Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro into the upper echelon of men&apos;s tennis, leaving Murray as the only player in the top five not to have won a major. Having crushed Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals, the 6ft 6in Argentinian with a face as long and lugubrious as Eeyore, brought an end to Roger Federer&apos;s five-year reign as US Open champion, and banished all doubts that he lacked the temperament to scale the sport&apos;s highest peaks. Del Potro has climbed to a career-high No5 in the world, just behind Murray, so there will be an added frisson when the two meet in the opening round-robin match of the ATP World Tour finals on Sunday afternoon. The Argentinian achieved his one win in five against the Scot on clay in Madrid this year, and although he has no great liking for indoor courts he will know that victory in the 02 Arena would be a considerable psychological blow to Murray and a huge lift for himself. At the Australian Open Del Potro \u2013 who was 21 last month, the youngest player in the top 10 \u2013 managed only three games against Federer in the quarter-finals. But in the Parisian spring, with the Swiss closing in on his historic French Open title, the Argentinian took him to five sets in the semi-finals, the weight of history proving just too much for his broad shoulders. Yet even in defeat the vigour and excellence of his challenge underlined his sharp improvement. Prior to Roland Garros, Federer had won their previous five matches without losing a set but under the floodlights of the gargantuan Arthur Ashe stadium in New York, Del Potro struck the great man out for the first time 3-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2. It would be impossible to say of such a tall and conspicuous man that Del Potro had slipped in under the radar, though he undoubtedly benefited from having a whole cluster of Argentinians around him, including David Nalbandian, who lost in the 2002 Wimbledon final to Lleyton Hewitt and a former world No3, and Gast\u00f3n Gaudio, the 2004 French Open champion who had helped lift the nation to the forefront of the game. Del Potro was an outstanding junior, and immediately earmarked for success when he joined the circuit. He became the youngest player in the top 200, then the top 100, and now the top five. Yet he was by no means an instant success, winning only seven matches in his first nine majors, and not winning a tournament until last year when he made an indelible mark with four titles in succession, two on clay, two on hard courts, prior to the US Open where he reached his first major quarter-final, losing to Murray. Much of this success stemmed from his new coaching partnership with Franco Dav\u00edn, a fellow Argentinian. &quot;I worked hard on my serve and my forehand, but I still have a lot of things to work on. I need time and just because I have won a first grand slam does not mean I can stop.&quot; Because he is such a big man, and with a face that could scarcely be described as boyish, it is sometimes a little difficult, particularly on court, to believe Del Potro has only just turned 21. Off court he remains shy and a little diffident, though this did not prevent him having a swipe at Murray&apos;s mother a couple of years back in Rome, when he felt her support was a little more than enthusiastic. Murray was not best pleased, though the two players have since drawn a firm line under that minor spat, both having matured immeasurably. Del Potro&apos;s father, Daniel, a vet, played club rugby. &quot;I don&apos;t have the muscles,&quot; smiled Del Potro Jr, &quot;but I love soccer so my decision to play tennis was perhaps strange. In Argentina everyone loves soccer, and I am friends with [Lionel] Messi and [Carlos] Tevez. When I was younger I was good at it but now I couldn&apos;t run for 90 minutes.&quot; Being so tall has both advantages and disadvantages. Del Potro is perhaps better equipped than any other of the leading players to deal with the acute topspin and steepling bounce of Nadal, though he can struggle against the heavy slice that both Federer and Murray impart. But for a large man he moves particularly well, and his serve is becoming an increasingly potent weapon, as it should given his height. Like Murray he made his debut in the end-of-season ATP World Tour finals (previously called the Tennis Masters Cup) in Shanghai last year, though with nothing like the impact, winning just one of his three round-robin matches, whereas Murray made the semi-finals, beating Federer on the way. At the O2 much more will be expected of the Argentinian, though despite winning the year&apos;s final slam at Flushing Meadows Del Potro does not consider himself as one of the favourites. &quot;No, the favourites are still the same: Federer, Rafa, Novak Djokovic, and Murray. I have to get experience, to learn many things to be like them.&quot; A little too self-effacing? Dav\u00edn, who watched in horror as his former charge Gaudio all but imploded early on in the 2004 French Open final, knows only too well how diffident and lacking in confidence Del Potro can still be: &quot;I constantly have to make him believe that he has earned the right to think of himself as one of the leading players.&quot; His rivals, and Murray in particular, will be hoping that the big man from Argentina remains a little circumspect for a while longer, as given the tidal power of his game he has the potential regularly to blast them all to kingdom come if the strength of his belief ever matches that of his right arm.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro", "Andy Murray", "Sport", "ATP World Tour Finals"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-19T16:49:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/19/london-jan-morris-love-affair", "sentences": ["I know people who swear by the glories of Lagos, Kiev, Shanghai and even Grozny."], "title": "A love affair with a city like London demands much more than an air-kiss | Simon Jenkins", "article": "I once sat next to a woman at dinner who asked me where I lived. When I replied, London, she frowned and said, how simply ghastly for me. &quot;It is an awful place, absolute hell. I hate going there, the people, the traffic, the tube, the dirt. You must be dying to escape.&quot; Stung by hearing my beloved home so abused I asked where she lived. Gloucestershire, she replied. &quot;How ghastly,&quot; I said, &quot;it is an awful place, absolute hell. I hate going there, the people, the horses, the filthy lanes, the boredom. You must be dying to escape.&quot; How extraordinarily rude, she said, and turned away for the rest of the evening. Hating cities is apparently fine, but hating the country is not permitted. Now I read that my old friend, the travel writer Jan Morris, has fallen out of love with London. She proclaimed so in last Saturday&apos;s Guardian: &quot;When once it welcomed me like a dowager to her run-down stately home, now its greeting is more like the air-kiss of a tabloid celebrity.&quot; When Jan steps off the train at Euston, she said: &quot;I find myself entering a different city altogether from the one that used to thrill me.&quot; I take comfort only in the knowledge that disagreeing with Jan is always exhilarating. We have disagreed everywhere, on the slopes of Snowdon, surrounded at Pen-y-Gwryd by mementos of the 1953 conquest of Everest (in which Jan took part). We have disagreed among the Italianate splendours of Portmeirion. We have disagreed on the banks of the swirling Dyfi and in Jan&apos;s stone eyrie upstream from Lloyd George&apos;s grave in Llanystumdwy. Disagreeing with her is more enjoyable than agreeing with anyone else. She has mastered the art of dissent, which is to clothe courtesy in laughter. When Jan shuts her computer, packs her bags and waves goodbye to north Wales, we know she is off to discover, or more often rediscover, some exotic clime and dust it with literary gold. She once claimed that her &quot;final book&quot; was Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere. It was her Tempest, plunged into the Adriatic deeper than did ever plummet sound, and full of life-expiring metaphor. But that was in 2001 and, like Rubinstein, Jan&apos;s last appearances are now annual events. The latest, out this week, is Contact!, a book of word sketches. Great travel writers never just describe places. They report their responses to places and their inhabitants. Some cheat and take along a companion as the butt of their commentary. Laurens van der Post took the hapless cameraman Spode to the Kalahari. Peter Fleming travelled Tartary with the tiresome Kini (who later took her revenge in a Royal Geographical Society lecture). Eric Newby ribbed poor Carless up and down the Hindu Kush, and was equally merciless with his wife on the Ganges. Jan resorts to no such devices. She does not bring human props to feed her narrative. She lives off the land, knowing that for a city to come alive, she must do more than just see. She must form relationships with local humans, perform some ritual of empathy. Her landscapes are peopled, like Constable&apos;s, with dappled ghostly figures to draw the composition into focus. So powerful are these sketches that, to me, they are more than walk-on extras. They are not of celebrities or interviewees, but of passers-by, faces in a crowd, the chance encounters that furnish the room of the solitary traveller. Jan bumps into a man in a hotel door. When he asks where she is from, and she replies &quot;Wales&quot;, he cries: &quot;Wales! How wonderful.&quot; Oh you splendid liar, she says, you have never heard of the place, and they both roar with laughter. Jan winks at a wrinkled Alexandrian cabby, chides an American matron, teases a Polish taxi driver that his Volvo is &quot;not Chopin&quot;. She helps a &quot;hard-mouthed, fast-shoving&quot; blind lady across a Paris street and into a shop, after which the lady remarks: &quot;Now I give you back your liberty.&quot; These flashes of ersatz intimacy colour the monochrome of travel. They bring Jan &quot;close to the meaning of a place&quot;. But they are more than that. They are the city. My early experiences of visiting America coincided with a youthful eagerness for adventure that made every city beautiful, however ugly. Visiting Germany coincided with so many pleasant meetings as to endear me to German cities ever since, just as unfavourable ones coloured my view of France. I know people who swear by the glories of Lagos, Kiev, Shanghai and even Grozny. I recall the mayor of Houston in Texas looking out of his skyscraper office and sighing that I surely had never seen a city as beautiful as his. I choked, until I realised that my ugly sprawl of office blocks and parking lots were his glittering array of acquaintances. For him, as for me, a city is where the friends are. The beauty of friendship surpassed the physical attributes of a place, much as the mind surpasses the beauty of the body. Jan&apos;s falling out of love with London has, I suggest, little to do with London and more to do with Jan and her Londoners. The wartime metropolis of her memory was battle-scarred but indomitable. &quot;I truly loved it then,&quot; she writes, &quot;the proud battered style of it, the blackened and ruined monuments, the posh-and-cockney mixture, the Union Jack flying gamely through the smog upon the Palace of Westminster, the grimy tugs churning up the Thames \u2013 liquid &apos;istory.&quot; That London had the excitement and anticipation of youth, just as it must now convey the tiresome aggression that irks old age. Jan&apos;s accounts of India, Oxford, Venice and a myriad other cities are far more than the application of a cultured mind to bricks and mortar, walls, roofs, trees and water. Each was seen at a different stage in a career and with different human encounters, and therefore struck different chords. London tries to reject my affection. It disfigures itself with ugliness \u2013 now with idiot towers as its mayor, Boris Johnson, vies with Ken Livingstone in their penis envy of New York. It afflicts the visitor with what Jan experiences as she steps from the Euston train, or Gloucestershire deplores as she fights her way across town to Harrods. It afflicts them because they are visitors. My London is one that Jan and Gloucestershire can never love. I do not spend my time in the city, as most non-residents do, enveloped in crowds, shopping and fighting public transport (which is not that bad). I see a city of local streets enlivened by corner shops, bustling pubs, children going to school, parks, squares, museums, theatres. It is a place of intense calm, if I want it. More than that, I love the comforting familiarity of a life lived in one place, of the continuity of things and friends, spiced only sometimes by a dollop of change. The passing Jan can play her game of smiling and winking and joshing to score a response. But it is she who is air-kissing London, not the other way round.

That said, it&apos;s hard not to feel some small twinge of fellow feeling for John Woo, Hong Kong&apos;s onetime bullet-spraying master of the action genre. You may not have heard his name for some time but he was, in the early years of this soon to be ex-decade, still being spoken of as the dominant force of the film industry&apos;s future. &quot;The most influential director making movies today,&quot; The New York Times called him back in 2002, adding, &quot;Woo embodies the globalising forces that have shaped motion pictures in the last two decades.&quot; Which makes it all the more poignant to witness how his star has dimmed dramatically in the west. To wit, this week sees the US release of his vastly-scaled epic of ancient China, the made-in-Mandarin Red Cliff. In China itself, it broke box-office records. That, however, was almost 18 months ago. In the States, it&apos;s now belatedly slipping out in a truncated version that also contains a chunk of its similarly epic sequel \u2013 first on a limited run in New York, then the kind of national release schedule typically enjoyed by mumblecore films. Here in Britain, it crept out this summer and attracted warm reviews for its lavish sense of spectacle. However, its box-office performance means it may be some while before a Woo movie sees the inside of a UK cinema again (the one I saw it in was empty but for me and two men with backpacks).  Depressingly, this is the fate of all manner of foreign language cinema on both sides of the Atlantic. But to find Woo so marginalised is doubly striking given that in another time \u2013 not so long ago but a world apart from now \u2013 he was the director who was meant to reshape Hollywood. That time was the early 90s, the vehicle a body of work assembled in his native Hong Kong that had already half-revolutionised the action movie: bloody, exquisitely choreographed tableaux of gunplay contained within the dizzying likes of Hard Boiled and The Killer. Then, his profile raised by fond tributes from Scorsese and Tarantino, he was all but borne into Beverly Hills by sedan chair \u2013 such was the eagerness of the studios for him to fill the gulf left by the decrepitude of Schwarzenegger and Stallone. It was to be a new age: one in which Hollywood would be regenerated by the energy and imagination of another culture, another country, one that spoke a different language both literally and artistically.  There were not one but two false starts (the generic Hard Target and Broken Arrow, a confused nuclear heist movie involving John Travolta). But by 1997 Woo hit his stride with an awesome panache. The result was Face/Off \u2013 the heroically demented tale of an FBI agent and comically venal terrorist whose features are surgically swapped for reasons that cease to matter after about 30 seconds. The movie had Travolta returning opposite Nicolas Cage in what was probably the most inspired moment in the &quot;Before&quot; stage of the latter&apos;s career (the one with the good films). Drawing out every ounce of Guignol genius from a script with a premise at once LA-loopy and timeless enough to have come from Chinese legend, Woo realised the brilliant concept of a marriage between Hollywood&apos;s steely glitz and the purist grace of his films in Hong Kong. It seemed, in short, to have worked.  Until it didn&apos;t. Because after that, in the space of just six years came the series of missteps that served to undo Woo&apos;s career in the west. The first, as missteps often do, involved Tom Cruise, with Woo taking the greasy baton of Mission: Impossible 2; the result managed not to make its director look bad so much as (far more damagingly) anonymous. Then there was Windtalkers, his portrait of the US army&apos;s second world war Navajo &quot;code talkers&quot; (or at least their guardianship by Nicolas Cage). Fleetingly beautiful, more often dreary, its attempt at broadening its director&apos;s range ended up attracting criticism over the relegation of its Navajo characters to supporting players. That, and losing an estimated $60m.  If that was a long drop to come back from, his next project cut the guide rope completely. Paycheck, a woeful Philip K Dick adaption that starred a &quot;Bennifer&quot;-era Ben Affleck, was the kind of film that serves only to act as a punchline in an episode of Family Guy. From there, the only path left open for Woo was the one he took \u2013 out of the studio lots, and back to Asia. He has now recast himself as a maker of monumental historical epics for audiences in Beijing and Shanghai. There is of course a far worse fate for a director than to be hugely popular in modern China. But still, you can&apos;t help but wonder if Woo occasionally broods on what might have been. Or do the same yourself at the now lost idea of ultra-mainstream Hollywood being shaped by a man inspired by Jean-Pierre Melville and The Wizard of Oz, not Michael Bay and McG.", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Action and adventure"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-20T16:31:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/20/atp-world-finals-andy-murray", "sentences": ["In Shanghai last year Murray had already qualified for the semi-finals before he played the Swiss in his third and final round-robin match."], "title": "Andy Murray relaxed ahead of World ATP Tour Finals challenge", "article": "The world&apos;s leading players shuffled around what used to be County Hall yesterday in their new suits, shirts, shoes and ties like guests who had arrived too early for a wedding. The preliminaries to the end-of-season ATP World Tour Finals are like no other event in the calendar, and for the first time since the tournament&apos;s inception in 1970 the feast has come to London, with more than a quarter of a million tickets sold, making it the biggest ever indoor tennis tournament. Understandably, even with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in the same room, the majority of eyes were on Andy Murray. These days Murray takes such gatherings in his stride. He is used to being at the top table and, by his own admission, the pressure is nothing like as great as Wimbledon. By next Sunday however, should he be undefeated in the initial round-robins, and then win the title, he may be \u00a31m richer, a bigger prize than the All England club offers. &quot;The money does not cross your mind,&quot; he said, smiling, though despite never having yet won a grand slam title he is already an extremely wealthy young man. But he might give it all away for that elusive slam. This end-of-season tournament is undoubtedly special but not comparable to a slam at all, other than the money involved. The players are duty bound to plug the event for all it is worth, and there are always a few exceptional matches, though generally, with the players more than a little weary, and most carrying minor niggles, the standard of tennis can border on the perfunctory. In this respect Murray, having missed six weeks shortly after the US Open with a wrist injury, is a little fresher than most. He may well need to be, for to win the title he might have to beat Federer, the world No1, twice. In Shanghai last year Murray had already qualified for the semi-finals before he played the Swiss in his third and final round-robin match. He could have soft pedalled, but instead went all out for victory, and duly knocked Federer out, the first time the 15 times grand slam champion, and four times winner of this tournament, had failed to make it into the last weekend in six previous attempts. Murray received some criticism, having run out of gas when he played Nikolay Davydenko for a place in the final, but that win over Federer simply meant more to him than the title. &quot;Beating him was one of the biggest wins for me and I would do the same again,&quot; he said yesterday. Murray, who practised at the O2 Arena for the first time in the afternoon with Novak Djokovic, raises the curtain tomorrow afternoon against Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, the newly crowned US Open champion, who may feel this is exactly the right time to play the Scot. The 6ft 6in Argentinian is not at his most effective on indoor courts, unlike Murray, but will hope that the British player may initially be just a touch nervous, given the expectations of the home crowd, many of whom will have travelled down from Scotland. Murray holds a 4-1 advantage over Del Potro, the one defeat coming on clay in Madrid this year, and he will be reasonably confident of victory: &quot;You always get the best atmosphere at indoor arenas. I&apos;m not putting too much pressure on myself, and I might do better because of that.&quot; In Sunday&apos;s second Group A round- robin match Federer plays Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco, then on Monday in Group B Nadal plays Robin Soderling, a late replacement for the injured Andy Roddick, with Davydenko up against the in-form Djokovic who arrived here with back-to-back tournament wins in Basle and the Paris Masters. If Federer were to win the title for a fifth time he would equal the record held jointly by Pete Sampras and Ivan Lendl. As for Murray he is attempting to become only the third player, along with Spain&apos;s Alex Corretja and David Nalbandian of Argentina, to win the title without having won a major.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "Rafael Nadal", "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro", "Tennis", "Sport", "ATP World Tour Finals"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-20T19:32:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/21/lee-westwood-rory-mcilroy-dubai1", "sentences": ["You back your ability.&quot; So will McIlroy, whose recent performances in the final round of tournament play is nothing short of breathtaking: In Shanghai a fortnight ago he closed with a course record-equalling 63 for a share of third spot, and at the Hong Kong Open last week it was a 64 to be runner-up."], "title": "Lee Westwood on course for European title", "article": "As it was in the beginning, so will it be when the Dubai World Championship reaches its conclusion in the desert later today, with all eyes clapped on Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy. But any hope that the pair would spend the last afternoon of the 2009 European Tour season in each other&apos;s company, facing off like a couple of well-remunerated gunslingers, disappeared yesterday when the Englishman produced a Rembrandt of a golf round to open up a decisive lead over the field in general, and his young rival in particular. Westwood&apos;s 66, six-under par, was a flawless effort in the truest sense (bogey free and replete with a succession of great shots) but to play as he did, as he has played all week, knowing what was at stake \u2013 the tournament, the season-long Race to Dubai title and the grand total of \u00a31.6million \u2013 was stunning. How stunning? Well, even Westwood was impressed, and it takes a lot for him to step out from behind his armour-clad moderation. &quot;This is as good as I feel like I&apos;ve swung it almost all year and when I was winning a lot \u2013 in the last century \u2013 I had this kind of attitude,&apos;&apos; he said afterwards. The Englishman will start today&apos;s final round at 15-under par, two shots ahead his third-round playing partner Ross McGowan who, like Westwood, shot a six-under round of 66, albeit with marginally more effort. McIlory, currently leading the Race to Dubai, started the third round two shots behind Westwood and finished it five adrift, which is one way of summing up his day&apos;s work around the Greg Norman-designed Earth course. Another would be to say the 20-year-old Ulsterman, bidding to become the youngest winner of the European Tour&apos;s money list since Seve Ballesteros, blew it. Or blew up. Take your pick. &quot;I have left myself with an uphill task,&apos;&apos; he said after signing for a three-under round of 69 that ought to have been three, perhaps four shots, better. Indeed, at one stage during the afternoon, McIlory, having played the first 15 holes in six under, was leading the field. Then the inexplicable happened, as it so often does in this maddening game. At the 16th hole he hit a wedge an impressive 170 yards. Less impressively, it flew over the flag and tumbled down the bank beyond, stopping just short of the water. From there he could only chip up to 20 feet and two-putt for a bogey. He then three-putted the short 17th for another bogey and, most calamitously of all, stuck his third shot at the par-five final hole into the water before completing a hat-trick of dropped shots. If one didn&apos;t know any better, one might be tempted to say McIlroy, confronted by Westwood&apos;s relentless brilliance, simply got a little tight in the throat. A kinder explanation would be that he fell victim to inexperience. For all his brilliance, and for all that he is on the cusp of a top-10 world ranking, McIlroy is still a kid in professional golfing terms. He has won a big event (in Dubai earlier this year) and he has been in contention in a handful of big events, too, but he is an innocent abroad compared to Westwood, who has won 30 times around the world and has been in contention more times than McIlory has had haircuts. As the Englishman said himself: &quot;I&apos;ve had the highs, I&apos;ve had the lows (he slumped outside the world&apos;s top 250 in 2002) and I am back on a high. I&apos;m enjoying it. I would not be outwardly cocky, but I am just being more confident. I&apos;ve had 30 wins and I think I&apos;ve finished tournaments off more than anybody else on the leaderboard. &quot;I don&apos;t mind putting myself up there to be shot at. You back your ability.&quot; So will McIlroy, whose recent performances in the final round of tournament play is nothing short of breathtaking: In Shanghai a fortnight ago he closed with a course record-equalling 63 for a share of third spot, and at the Hong Kong Open last week it was a 64 to be runner-up. &quot;I&apos;ve still got a shot to win this \u2013 I feel a low round is in me,&apos;&apos; he said. It probably is, although the problem for him that low might not be enough to overcome Westwood in this form.", "tags": ["Golf", "Rory McIlroy", "Lee Westwood", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-21T18:48:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/22/atp-world-tour-finals-tennis-london", "sentences": ["&quot;They absolutely go to show there is a real appetite for indoor sport in this country.&quot; For the ATP, bringing the World Tour Finals to London from Shanghai also has the advantage of ensuring they are played in front of full stands."], "title": "Welcome to the great indoors says the 02 Arena as big tennis names arrive", "article": "Save for a brief burst of popularity for ice hockey in the years that followed the second world war, British sports fans have never taken to watching their heroes perform indoors. Despite, or perhaps because of, our obsession with the weather we have preferred the drizzle of the open terrace, the endless to and fro of the covers at Wimbledon, and mudbaths at Twickenham. Even the biggest boxing bouts have often taken place under open sky: at Wembley, Loftus Road, White Hart Lane, Finsbury Park, Highbury and the Millennium Stadium. There is talk of Ricky Hatton making a comeback \u2013 at Manchester City&apos;s stadium. For the next eight days at the O2 Arena, a total of more than 290,000 people watching the top eight men&apos;s tennis players at the ATP World Tour Finals will act as proof that this is starting to change. Since it opened in June 2007, hundreds of thousands of sports fans have been introduced to a spectating experience on the Greenwich Peninsula that has been second nature to their counterparts in the US for years. But the comfortable seats, good views and refreshments on tap have also prompted the inevitable debate about whether that makes for a corporate, soulless experience or a very good day out. It is the O2 Arena&apos;s biggest sporting event yet \u2013 15 sessions of tennis with 17,500 people at each. The venue&apos;s owner, AEG, had long experience of building similar hybrid arenas in the US, which can be quickly switched between music, sport and other entertainment events. Two days after Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Andy Murray leave the building, Eddie Izzard will take the stage. &quot;We are the world&apos;s most popular music venue and attract the world&apos;s biggest stars. That tends to grab the headlines, but quietly we have been working away at making sure we get a healthy sports calendar,&quot; says Alex Hill, the senior executive director of AEG Europe, who operate the O2. With the pressure on the global music industry, and with the biggest acts tending to tour on two- or three-year cycles, sporting events have become an essential component of its calendar as it attempts to build on its early success in turning a venue that once a figure of ridicule into one of London&apos;s biggest attractions. &quot;If you compare it to our sister company in the States, there is a regular and very popular indoor sporting programme where you have basketball and ice hockey with big national followings. To a lesser degree that also happens in continental Europe and we don&apos;t really have that in the UK at all. You have to be innovative in how you bring in certain types of sports.&quot; That meant helping US sports grow in the UK and introducing domestic sports to an indoor environment for the first time. Perhaps inevitably, given AEG&apos;s big influence in US sport, it started with what works there. The NBA has sold out three annual exhibition games and there are talks underway about hosting a regular season game from next year, while the O2 has also hosted the NHL and a range of boxing bouts. After securing events from those US leagues, the next obvious route was to speak to domestic sports about how they might be able to fill an arena the size of the O2. There are ongoing talks with Fast Track and UK Athletics over the possibility of introducing an event, while other modified versions of existing sports such as Turbo Tennis have been trialled. The recent World Gymnastics Championships, the first time a event has taken place in the same venue it will occupy at the 2012 Olympics, and the ATP Finals, which will return for at least four more years under the existing contract, have &quot;taken things to another level&quot;, Hill says. &quot;They absolutely go to show there is a real appetite for indoor sport in this country.&quot; For the ATP, bringing the World Tour Finals to London from Shanghai also has the advantage of ensuring they are played in front of full stands. While some events on the circuit, particularly those in the Middle East and the Far East, are valuable in terms of sponsorship and growing the appeal of the sport, they do not always provide the atmosphere that players and broadcasters crave. It also offers the opportunity to take tennis to an audience beyond those who habitually enter the ballot or queue for Wimbledon, which also introduced the concept of indoor tennis this year under the Centre Court roof. Murray&apos;s advisors have consciously tried to market him to a younger audience and the publicity campaigns for the ATP event have also aimed beyond the middle-class, middle-aged cognoscenti. Conversely, the O2 also expects to attract an audience that may not have been to the arena. &quot;There are a lot of people who are big tennis fans who will have gone to Queen&apos;s and Wimbledon historically and not had the chance to see a top-class indoor event. We like to think they&apos;ll see us in a good light and come here again,&quot; Hill says. While more effort goes into promoting an event like the ATP tennis from more than a year out, there is the upside of knowing it will fill the arena for eight straight days. Next year is likely to bring David Haye&apos;s first defence of his WBA world heavyweight title and darts will also come to the O2 for the first time in February. The O2 has also been mentioned as a potential venue by those putting together the new World Series of Boxing, mooted as a Champions League-style event that can bridge the gap between the worlds of amateur and professional boxing. &quot;Good, well-run events, be it music or sport, will make good money for the promoter and the venue. We take each on its merits,&quot; Hill says. The success the O2 has had in popularising indoor sport, while still at an early stage, has also come as a boon to London Olympic organisers. In 2012, hundreds of thousands of ticket holders will watch sports, from volleyball to swimming, undercover. If, by then, the experience is less alien to British sporting culture than it once was, it will make those handball tickets all the easier to shift.", "tags": ["ATP World Tour Finals", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-22T00:07:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/22/andy-murray-del-potro-london", "sentences": ["Both players made their debuts in this elite eight-man end-of season tournament last year in Shanghai, with Murray making it through to the semi-finals, and knocking out Federer in the process, while Del Potro managed a single win at the round-robin stage."], "title": "Andy Murray beat Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro 6-3, 3-6, 6-2", "article": "The largest crowd to watch a tennis match in Britain, nearly 17,500, saw Andy Murray win his opening round-robin match at the ATP World Tour Finals yesterday in London&apos;s cavernous O2 Arena, though a considerably lesser congregation in Canterbury cathedral would in all probability have made more noise at evensong.  No matter. Murray appeared pleased enough with the support and, although he was short of his best, this 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro will have increased his confidence for the initial task of reaching Saturday&apos;s semi-finals. The round robin is always slightly problematic in terms of predicting what might happen. &quot;You pretty much have to win two matches out of three to give yourself\u00a0a\u00a0chance,&quot; said Murray. &quot;I kind of expected a scrappy match but I played some great points and was obviously happy to get the win. I thought the atmosphere was good, though I was focused on the match.&quot;  There is always a little extra pizzazz at indoor tournaments, with a multitude of flashing lights and over-excited announcers. Maybe the crowd was simply awestruck. They were certainly not fanatical, though this may change as the week progresses. Initially Murray was dominant, reeling off five straight games. Del Potro, ranked No5 in the world, one place behind Murray, had won only two matches since beating Roger Federer in the US Open final in September, his first grand slam title, and initially struggled for any semblance of continuity against Murray, who scampered round the O2 Arena with an alacrity that was a far cry from his recent weary and slightly careworn performances at the Paris Masters when he was beaten in the third round.  Of course, everybody knew he was saving himself for London and it was important to make a positive start. Both players made their debuts in this elite eight-man end-of season tournament last year in Shanghai, with Murray making it through to the semi-finals, and knocking out Federer in the process, while Del Potro managed a single win at the round-robin stage. At 3-0 Del Potro took a medical time out, suffering a nosebleed: &quot;I have a big nose, that&apos;s the problem,&quot; he said. The old-fashioned remedy was a cold key down the back; Del Potro needed to unlock his mind and remember he was a champion. Having had the blood staunched, he aimed to cauterise Murray and there were signs towards the end of the set that the real Del Potro was beginning to stand up, all 6ft 6in of him. Tall men do not necessarily hit the ball any harder and Del Potro&apos;s serve is still undergoing adjustments but his forehand, when he lets rip, is a shot of immense power that seems to gather pace off any surface.  At Flushing Meadows Federer time and again found himself speared like a fish by the ferocity of the Argentinian and in the second set here it was Murray who was chasing feverishly across the baseline in pursuit of the untouchable. Murray&apos;s first serve dipped while his backhand stuttered and spluttered. The crowd remained strangely detached even when Murray, 3-1 down, roused himself and broke back. At this point a Wimbledon Centre Court would have increased the volume substantially; those in the O2 remained reverentially hushed, as if nobody had introduced them to the word support.  Del Potro, like a blacksmith finishing off a horseshoe, began to hit his forehand with an awesome rhythm that was \u00adundeniable and by the end of the second set this opening match was seemingly finely balanced. It transpired, though, that Murray had more in reserve. A couple more of misdirected backhands at the opening of the third set did not bode well for Murray, who gently chastised himself. Having lost the first five games of the match, Del Potro had won six of the next seven, and Murray knew he could not afford to let him unleash a similar run.  Murray managed to hold serve and then broke to lead 2-0. Del Potro&apos;s resistance wavered again and this time it would prove to be terminal. &quot;Andy played great tennis in the third set,&quot; the Argentinian later conceded.", "tags": ["ATP World Tour Finals", "Andy Murray", "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-22T16:54:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/nov/23/twitter-china-barack-obama", "sentences": ["When Barack Obama told students in Shanghai last week that he had never used Twitter, there were two responses."], "title": "'What's Twitter?' asks China following Obama revelation", "article": "When Barack Obama told students in Shanghai last week that he had never used Twitter, there were two responses.

Now, in a particularly fitting match, two of the most persuasive ideologies of recent times are to unite: the Disney franchise High School Musical is being remade for a Chinese audience. Four years after the first film in the series hit the screens, achieving a staggering popularity among pre-teens worldwide, the US entertainment giant has announced that it is remaking the film with Chinese partners for release next summer. The news comes weeks after Disney said Chinese authorities had approved plans for a theme park in Shanghai. High School Musical, the first film in the series, was launched as a made-for-TV movie by Disney in January 2006 and has been seen by an estimated 225 million viewers in about 100 countries and in more than 30 languages. It has spawned two successful sequels and a vast array of merchandising. The Chinese movie is said to have been inspired by the original, rather than being a straight translation of its screenplay. It will focus on an unlikely couple from seemingly opposite school cliques \u2013 a basketball jock and a science nerd \u2013 brought together in an entirely chaste romance by their love of singing. Although the US film features a song urging teenagers not to &quot;stick to the status quo&quot;, its brand of rebellion encourages nothing more risque than auditioning for the end-of-term school musical, with the doctrine &quot;We&apos;re all in this together&quot;. It seems unlikely that Disney&apos;s Chinese partners will attempt anything more edgy. Jason Reed, general manager of Walt Disney Studios international production, told Variety that Disney had initially contemplated making martial arts the main sport in the film, rather than basketball. Its Chinese partners pointed out that basketball was vastly more popular among Chinese teenagers. Disney said the Chinese version, featuring six newcomers, would be shot in Shanghai. The company is working with the Shanghai Media Group and Huaiyi Brothers Media Corporation on what will be its third co-produced film in China, and its sixth international co-production. The director, New York-based Chen Shizheng, is best known for his stage work. In 1999 he mounted a 20-hour production of the classic Chinese opera piece The Peony Pavilion, and more recently he created the opera Monkey, persuading Damon Albarn to write the music. His first feature film was Dark Matter, loosely based on the true story of a troubled Chinese astrophysics student studying in the US. It starred Meryl Streep and China&apos;s Liu Ye. Disney announced last year that a fourth English-language film in the series was being written, featuring none of the original characters.

Tonight they play each other for a 10th time, both striving to get pole position in the round robin group A. Murray holds a 6-3 lead over Federer, and has won two of their three matches this year. &quot;I know that to win against Roger I have to play great, but more to the point I need to play my way,&quot; he said. &quot;If I try to change my style, I&apos;m not going to feel comfortable, and I&apos;m going to struggle.

There was a whiff of arrogance here. Federer has won 15 grand slam titles and Murray none, while in their only meeting at grand slam level, the 2008 US Open final, the Swiss won with ease. He has every right to suggest that when it really matters he will prevail, although he has an excuse if he is pressed on any of the defeats by the Scot, notably last year&apos;s ATP World Tour Finals round robin match in Shanghai when Murray won in three sets, and knocked Federer out. &quot;I remember going into that match with the highest of hopes,&quot; said Federer after his opening victory over Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco on Sunday evening here, just a few hours after Murray had won against Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro. &quot;I only had a bit left in the tank because I had been sick two days before. So I just said to myself I&apos;ll play aggressive and see what happens. I was playing incredibly well for a set, and it was unfortunate for me not to come through.&quot; Earlier in his career several players regularly gave Federer trouble, notably David Nalbandian, Lleyton Hewitt, and Tim Henman, who won six of his first seven matches against the Swiss, but he turned that around.

There is one scenario whereby Andy Murray could beat Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco in tomorrow&apos;s first match and not qualify for Saturday&apos;s semi-finals and another under which he could lose and still qualify. In the simplest terms Murray is certain of reaching the last four if he wins in straight sets whereas Roger Federer will do so if he beats Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro by any score. It is small wonder that the ATP, the men&apos;s professional ruling body, abandoned its introduction of round robins in ordinary tournaments two years ago after five events. The beauty of tennis is its knock-out formula even if, as Federer said after beating Murray 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 lastnight, &quot;on a bad day you can be out of the tournament&quot;. The round robin allows a player to lose and still progress which, having lost to Federer, is precisely what Murray will be hoping to do. The Scot has a 7-1 lead in meetings with Verdasco, that one defeat coming in this year&apos;s fourth round of the Australian Open. The Spaniard went on to reach the semi-finals, where he pushed his compatriot Rafael Nadal, the eventual champion, all the way. Verdasco has worked hard on his physical fitness, enlisting the help of Andre Agassi&apos;s former physical trainer, Gil Reyes. This has been his breakthrough year, qualifying for this tournament for the first time. He would love not to lose all his three matches, though prudence may demand he reserves as much energy as possible for next week&apos;s Davis Cup final in Barcelona when Spain play the Czech Republic. All the players are trying to push themselves those extra few yards, to eke out diminishing energy levels. &quot;When the adrenaline wears off there&apos;s not quite the same spark in the legs that there was at the start of the year,&quot; Murray said. &quot;I&apos;ve been letting guys back into matches early in the second set. At the beginning of the year I was not giving them those chances.&quot; And the last person he wanted to give a chance to was Federer. Murray was hugely disappointed, having won six of their previous eight three-set matches. But he may be fired up tommorrow afternoon by the thought of perhaps having a second crack at Federer in Sunday&apos;s final. Sweden&apos;s Robin Soderling arrived in London as a late replacement for the injured Andy Roddick and has promptly won his opening two round-robin matches against Nadal and Novak Djokovic, the winner of this tournament last year. Before the French Open, when he knocked out Nadal and went on to reach the final, Soderling was regarded as something of an indoor specialist, so his success is hardly surprising. He beat Djokovic 7-6, 6-1 in today&apos;s opening Group B game, assuring the 25-year-old Swede his place in the semi-finals. It is not unprecedented for a reserve to win the tournament. In 2005 Argentina&apos;s David Nalbandian, on a fishing holiday, received a late call for Shanghai and went on to beat Federer in the final. Soderling is certainly capable of emulating that feat, having now defeated the world No2 and No3 back-to-back. &quot;Sometimes in the past I have put too much pressure on myself but I hope there is more to come,&quot; he said. Soderling&apos;s temper has been both friend and foe to him, though this year, under the influence of his coach and fellow Swede, Magnus Norman, he has calmed down considerably. &quot;But more than anything it has been the improvement in my movement that has been the biggest factor in my success.&quot;", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "ATP World Tour Finals", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-25T21:28:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/26/rafa-nadal-atp-finals", "sentences": ["Soderling, who famously defeated Nadal at Roland Garros, had arrived in London as a late replacement for the injured Andy Roddick and yesterday became the first player to qualify for Saturday&apos;s semi-finals with a 7-6, 6-1 victory over Djokovic, winner of the tournament in Shanghai last year.", "In 2005 Argentina&apos;s David Nalbandian, on a fishing holiday, received a late call for Shanghai and beat Federer in the final."], "title": "Rafael Nadal knocked out of finals with defeat by Nikolay Davydenko", "article": "The pallid form of Rafa Nadal saw him knocked out of the ATP World Tour Finals last night at the earliest opportunity, with a match still to play in his round-robin group.

It is a far cry from the start of the year, which he entered as world No1. When he won the Australian Open in February, his sixth grand slam title and his first on hard court, it seemed he might permanently change the order at the top of the game and hasten the fall of Roger Federer, whom he beat in Melbourne. But since then the Swiss has re-established himself as world No1 while Nadal has found life increasingly complicated. The Spaniard has failed to win a title since the Rome Masters six months ago, after which he was beaten in the French Open for the first time ever, was unable to defend his Wimbledon title because of his troublesome knees and was then thrashed in the semi-finals of the US Open by Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro. He continues to maintain there is nothing substantially wrong with him save a loss of confidence but concerns are growing. Not that he has ever looked really comfortable towards the end of any season. Twice he has withdrawn from this trophy in the last five years because of injury and he has never progressed beyond the semi-finals. More disconcertingly, he has now lost eight of his nine matches against top-10 players since May. In the first set against Davydenko he won only 13 points, looking a shadow of his former exuberant self and, although the fires sparked a little thereafter, he could not put away the Russian, who was having problems of his own.

He won in five sets. Andy Murray failed to reach tomorrow&apos;s semi-finals of the Barclays ATP World Tour finals in the cruellest fashion at the O2 Arena last night. Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro defeated Roger Federer, the world No1, 6-2, 6-7, 6-3, which effectively meant that Murray was knocked out by just one game. Like Federer and Del Potro, he won two of his round-robin matches, but lost out on the percentage of games won over his three matches. Had Federer won one more game in the third set against the Argentinian Murray would have gone through. As it was he was beaten by a fraction. There were moments during the final match when no one, least of all the organisers, seemed entirely clear what might happen should the Argentinian win, such are the delights of the round-robin system that has the capability to leave everybody in a mighty tangle. Murray defeated Spain&apos;s Fernando Verdasco 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 in the first match of the day and then had to wait almost six hours to find out whether he had made the last four for the second year in succession. Last year, in Shanghai, he knocked out Federer in their final round-robin match; this time Federer, by losing, knocked out Murray. The ATP, the men&apos;s professional ruling body, twice changed its mind about the interpretation of the rules prior to the final match in group A, and even as the match progressed the outcome was opaque. If Del Potro had won in straight sets Federer would have been out and Murray through, together with the Argentinian. That possibility went out of the window when Federer won the second set. He may not have known it but the world No1 qualified for the semi-finals the moment he took the first game in the third set, whether he went on to win or lose. Some fans of a mathematical bent, call them geeks if you will, might have found this all very exciting, but any sport that gets itself into such a position to decide who qualifies for the next stage might come to the conclusion that a rethink was needed. Del Potro, for whom this was a second successive win over Federer, having beaten him in five sets to win the US Open, would have gone out had he not broken the world No1&apos;s serve in the eighth game of the final set. First he had a lucky net chord in his favour, then Federer missed a smash, double faulted and finally put a forehand wide. The Argentinian, who had played a wonderful first set, totally dominating the Swiss, held his nerve on serve, and Murray was gone. Federer won the group, with Del Potro, who was watched here by his fellow countryman Carlos Tevez, the runner-up. Murray had long since left, his one aim being to get home and rest his body in preparation for what he hoped would be the semi-finals. But it was not to be, and he will doubtless look back on his match against Verdasco, when he had four chances to break for a 6-5 lead in the second set, and a possible straight sets win, as a huge opportunity lost. But this is the nature of the round robin. The odds seemed to be on Federer winning, which would have solved everything for Murray. But it was not to be. &quot;Anyone know what&apos;s going on? I think I&apos;m [out] but the rules aren&apos;t worded too well,&quot; Murray posted on Twitter, and the same surely applied to many of the 17,500 spectators leaving the arena. Del Potro was interviewed on court but was cut off, with no one at courtside being clear quite what had happened. As well as all three players having won two matches, they were also 5-4 on sets taken. So the count back went to games, with Del Potro sneaking home ahead of Murray by a whisker. Not that he apparently knew. &quot;I asked Juan Mart\u00edn at the net: &apos;Did you make it?&apos; He said: &apos;I don&apos;t think so,&apos;&quot; Federer said. All of the players are feeling the stresses and strains of a long season, and it said much for Murray&apos;s mental fortitude that he managed to dredge up just about enough energy to win his final match. That said, Del Potro was under huge pressure, and came through like the true champion he showed himself to be at Flushing Meadows when he won his first slam title. This was only his fourth win since beating Federer in the final, and it seemed that seeing the Swiss on the other side of the net lifted his level accordingly. Murray will curse himself for letting the second set slip against Verdasco. One of his great strengths over the last year has been his ability to go for the jugular when ahead, but not this time. He won but it was not to prove enough. Del Potro was wonderfully brave, and deserved his place in the next stage of the tournament to the full.", "tags": ["ATP World Tour Finals", "Andy Murray", "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-27T00:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/nov/27/anthony-bolton-investing-china", "sentences": ["But over the past year, the Shanghai Composite index of shares is up 119%, worrying some investors that it might be in line for a correction.", "Edward Chancellor, whose book, Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation, charts financial manias from the South Sea Bubble to Japan in the late 1980s, says China&apos;s overheating stock and property markets are a prime example of a bubble, with banks lending on ever-lower standards amid a frenzied land-grab in places such as Shanghai and Beijing."], "title": "Anthony Bolton is investing in China.

He told Radio 4&apos;s Today programme: &quot;In the long run, the level of the stockmarket must be geared to the level of economic growth. There has been a cost to the financial crisis, and I expect long-term growth in the likes of the UK and US to be held back by governments effectively mortgaging the future to get us out of the crisis. They have done that successfully, but at a cost. &quot;I don&apos;t see that cost in China. The next decade is going to be one of the most exciting for the Chinese economy, particularly the domestic economy.&quot; During his 28 years in charge of Fidelity&apos;s Special Situations fund, Bolton earned an average annual return of 19.5%, compared to 13.5% for the FTSE All-Share index. A lump sum investment of \u00a31,000 would have grown to \u00a3148,200 over the period. He was one of the first fund managers to warn about the credit crunch. In May 2007 he warned that banks were at default risk, telling investors the bull run was over and a correction was &quot;inevitable&quot;. But over the past year, the Shanghai Composite index of shares is up 119%, worrying some investors that it might be in line for a correction. During August it fell by hundreds of points, only to rise back again in September. Charlotte Ryland, who manages Newton&apos;s global funds, says: &quot;The developing world continues to present longer-term investment opportunities, particularly those countries able to stimulate domestic demand such as China, India and Brazil. China looks on track to achieve its targeted GDP growth of 8% this year and to grow by at least at the same rate in 2010.&quot; Bolton&apos;s belief in China is shared by many investment advisers. Darius McDermott of Chelsea Financial Services says: &quot;Bolton has been the very best growth fund manager. Clearly, Bolton could manage a portfolio in whatever geographical location of his choosing, but the fact he has gone for China is a major vote of confidence in the new economic superpower ... private investors should only hope that they will be granted access.&quot; NO It&apos;s a bubble waiting to burst  A growing number of China &quot;bears&quot; warn that the economy is dangerously overheated, citing over-investment, empty shopping malls and feeble exports. Chief among them is Albert Edwards of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who is just back from a research tour of China. &quot;I think the next 18 months will see major ructions in the financial markets,&quot; he warns. China will move into a trade deficit next year, with demand falling as western economies head into a double-dip recession. Tom Becket of Psigma, who runs a fund investing in other managers&apos; funds, agrees the evidence of over- investment is stark. &quot;I&apos;m a Sinophile, but you have to be realistic about what&apos;s going on. I have never seen so many vacant warehouses and offices. There is definite over-capacity everywhere. A lot of things are being built in hope rather than reality.&quot; Yet prices being paid for property in China are close to the levels seen in Japan before 1989. Edward Chancellor, whose book, Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation, charts financial manias from the South Sea Bubble to Japan in the late 1980s, says China&apos;s overheating stock and property markets are a prime example of a bubble, with banks lending on ever-lower standards amid a frenzied land-grab in places such as Shanghai and Beijing. More cautious financial advisers are suggesting a wait-and-see approach before jumping into Bolton&apos;s new fund. &quot;Ardent followers of Bolton will help ensure a successful launch and initial funding.

Even if the impact on the economy proves manageable, the country&apos;s negotiators have now condemned the world&apos;s most populous nation to jargon-filled number crunching and climate geekery for decades to come. During the past six years in China, I can count the number of times I have heard locals talk about carbon offsetting on one finger. They didn&apos;t need to: under the Kyoto protocol, China and other developing nations were not obliged to do anything to reduce emissions. That will all change with yesterday&apos;s announcement, which paves the way for China to establish carbon trading, carbon taxing and, perhaps one day, carbon offsetting. What it will not mean is an overall reduction of greenhouse gases from the world&apos;s biggest emitter. The new target is a 40-45% reduction in carbon intensity (emissions per yuan of economic activity) between 2005 and 2020. That means slowing the rate of increase rather than cutting back. China&apos;s emissions will increase by between 90% and 108% between 2005 and 2020 if the economy grows at 8% per year, according to Arthur Kroeber of Dragonomics Research &amp; Advisory. But it could be a lot worse. According to the Worldwide Fund for Nature, China&apos;s new target will prevent more than 4 gigatons of carbon entering the earth&apos;s atmosphere between 2010 to 2015, in addition to the 1.5 gigatons already saved by the energy efficiency drive during the current five-year plan. There appears to have been considerable coordination between China and the US in announcing roughly equivalent targets within a day of each other. The World Resources Institute calculates that President Obama&apos;s goal of a 17% emissions reduction is worth slightly more than a 40% improvement in carbon intensity. A like-for-like deal seems to have been reached, even though China remains publicly adamant that its actions are voluntary while those of the developed nations are mandatory. Xie Zhenhua, the vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, stressed yesterday that the goal only applies at home. It is not, he said, &quot;internationally binding or subject to international verification&quot;. This may upset some foreign observers, but China has a better record of meeting ambitious domestic targets over the past five years than many countries have managed with internationally binding commitments. A bigger question mark over China&apos;s announcement is the lack of ambition relative to what it has already been doing. The target is less than the country is aiming for in the current five years and less than it achieved in the previous 15 years. Xie acknowledged that China achieved energy conservation gains of 47% between 1990 and 2005. But he insisted the lower headline figure of the new target masked the fact that it is harder to achieve because all the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. There is some truth in this \u2013 over the past five years, China has replaced thousands of small, inefficient power plants, steel factories and cement makers with more modern facilities. It has also invested heavily in renewable energy. Doing so again will be more difficult and costly. But other countries are also pushing themselves hard despite increased costs and challenges \u2013 most notably Japan, which is already one of the world&apos;s most efficient nations but still raised its carbon reduction target 10% this year. China&apos;s vice minister for foreign affairs, He Yafei, has said it is unreasonable to compare developed and developing nations because of the rich world&apos;s historical responsibility for carbon emissions. This is contentious. Data from the World Resources Institute puts China&apos;s cumulative emissions since 1900 at third behind the US and Russia. However, given its 1.3 billion population, the carbon footprint of the average person in China is around a third and a quarter lower than in Europe and the US respectively. In addition, almost a fifth of the emissions that are calculated as Chinese are used to manufacture products for export to countries like the UK. But look forward instead of back and the picture is very different. If current trends continue, China will soon be the number one climate villain in a whole new set of categories. People living in rich cities like Shanghai already have a higher average carbon footprint than people in the Japan, the UK or France. Without stronger action, this will be true of an ever increasing number of people in China. A carbon intensity target does not mean a cut in emissions, it means a slowing of the growth in greenhouse gases relative to the expansion of the economy. This could still means very significant carbon savings. The bad news is that China&apos;s emissions are still likely to increase substantially between now and 2020. But the jargon is clearly coming along. China is very serious about contributing in every way to the global warming debate.", "tags": ["Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Environment", "China", "World news", "Energy", "Global climate talks", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-27T12:15:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/27/rafael-nadal-novak-djokovic-atp-finals", "sentences": ["Just as Andy Murray saw his hopes of qualifying for the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals snuffed out late on Thursday evening, so Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic, the world No3, suffered a similar experience last night when Russia&apos;s Nikolay Davydenko, the runner-up to Djokovic in Shanghai last year, denied him a place in the last four with a 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 win over Sweden&apos;s Robin Soderling."], "title": "Novak Djokovic crashes out as Nikolay Davydenko goes through", "article": "Just as Andy Murray saw his hopes of qualifying for the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals snuffed out late on Thursday evening, so Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic, the world No3, suffered a similar experience last night when Russia&apos;s Nikolay Davydenko, the runner-up to Djokovic in Shanghai last year, denied him a place in the last four with a 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 win over Sweden&apos;s Robin Soderling.

Ever since US homeowners started defaulting on sub-prime mortgages two years ago, the tightening of international lending conditions has put the squeeze on investment bubbles around the world. Some, like Iceland or the British housing boom, popped relatively quickly, but others have been slower to collapse. The common feature is that an excess of cheap borrowing lulls investors into thinking that more permanent wealth is being created. Like any investment bubble, it works well as long as more money is sucked in to keep inflating asset prices, but fails when that new money disappears. The key difference with a debt bubble like the one bursting around us now is that there can be a significant time lag between asset prices beginning to fall and investors acknowledging their losses. Unlike the dotcom share bubble, for example, which drove stockmarkets up and then quickly down again at the turn of the century, credit bubbles often take a while to fully deflate. The developers who built those skyscrapers in Dubai knew it was getting harder to fill them, and that property prices were falling, but as long as they could pay their interest bill to the banks it made sense to try to hang on, in the hope things would improve. The banks had no incentive to foreclose because it would only force more property on to the open market and further depress the price of their remaining assets. If anything, it has become easier to keep hanging on because governments around the world have driven down interest rates and pumped fresh money into the markets. Yet the fragility of Dubai&apos;s castles in the sand was hard to ignore for ever. With little prospect of a new boom to replace the old one, property developers have finally acknowledged the unpalatable truth. The big fear now is that international banks, including many of Britain&apos;s largest, will no longer be able to pretend that these half-empty office blocks are worthy collateral for the billions of dollars of debt that has been extended. Banking analysts at UBS estimate that the emirate&apos;s total debt burden is well above the $80bn-$90bn admitted so far, with sizeable off-balance sheet liabilities lurking in the shadows. Not only does the Dubai crisis threaten to further destabilise the west&apos;s battered banks, but it also points to the danger of thinking that the world economy is through the worst. From Dublin to Shanghai, there are plenty of property bubbles that have yet to fully burst. In Britain, many think the commercial property market is also hiding some painful horrors, with banks unwilling to accept that many developers are insolvent. The Dubai crisis has also thrown a new name into the lexicon of toxic instruments. Just as credit derivatives helped to exacerbate the sub-prime crisis by obscuring who was ultimately exposed to losses, the use of Islamic finance has complicated the reckoning. &quot;Sukuk bonds&quot; are designed to get around religious laws banning the payment of interest for money lending. But one of the most volatile debts in the Dubai World standstill is a $3.5bn Islamic bond due to be repaid in December. Because Sukuk bonds replace interest payments with a promise to share profits, investors are effectively owners of the underlying assets, rather than traditional secured creditors. Default on this scale has never been tested before, echoing the nervousness in derivative markets when the banking crisis first started.

In a decade he will be forgotten; the man who reached for the grand slam top table but never managed to find a chair. Yet when he rushed through the opening set of his ATP World Tour Finals semi-final against Roger Federer in under half an hour, it suddenly seemed that a major upset was about to unfold. While it took some time for that upset to arrive, it eventually did, with Davydenko winning 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.

The Russian could have been excused for beginning the match with a Kremlin-sized inferiority complex having lost all his previous 12 games against the world No1, as well as having had to play the late match on Friday evening, giving him only 15 hours to recover, while Federer had the advantage of an extra day&apos;s rest. &quot;Maybe I start to play better and him not so good,&quot; said Davydenko after his group stage win over Soderling the previous evening, and it certainly looked that way in the opening set when the Swiss served particularly poorly, and rushed his forehand. An uneasy hush settled over the O2 Arena. But this was Federer; arguably the greatest player ever. Surely the six-times Wimbledon champion was not about to lose. When he won the second set, improving his serve and forehand radically, and finally beginning to move with the power and grace of a champion, there seemed no obvious reason to suppose he would let matters slip again. With a 5-4 lead in the final set he was just two points away from victory, but Davydenko held firm \u2013 just. &quot;As the match wore on I felt better and better but I just could not get it done, though the level of the match wasn&apos;t the greatest,&quot; said Federer, with just a smidgeon of bad grace. Davydenko was runner-up last year in Shanghai to Novak Djokovic, though even then he was better known for the longest inquiry ever held into match fixing in tennis. He lost to Martin Vassallo Arguello at the Polish Open in Sopot in August 2007, retiring injured at 6-2, 3-6, 1-2 in a second-round match that attracted nearly \u00a33.5m in wagers on Betfair. The ATP cleared Davydenko of any wrongdoing after their investigation found no evidence of a violation, though the Russian&apos;s lawyer claimed it cost the player thousands of pounds in lost endorsements. After losing his opening round-robin match against Djokovic he went on to beat Rafael Nadal, and was clearly in excellent form, although he finished his match against the Spaniard limping slightly. There was even talk of him pulling out before his final match against Soderling, which he had to win. &quot;It was just a tight muscle, nothing really,&quot; he explained. Federer might have wished to the contrary. This was his chance to win the title for a record-equalling fifth time, placing him alongside Pete Sampras and Ivan Lendl. &quot;It&apos;s disappointing. I missed out at the start again,&quot; he said. Last year in Shanghai he was dumped out in the round-robin stage by Andy Murray \u2013 the first time in the end-of-season tournament, restricted to the best eight players in the world, that he had failed to reach the semi-finals or better since his debut in 2002. That was when awkward questions began to be asked about his future at the highest level, Federer having been beaten in the final of the French Open and Wimbledon by Nadal last year. These questions were notched up an extra level at the beginning of this year when the Spaniard defeated him again in the Australian Open final. Was this the changing of the guard at the top \u2013 were the new order taking over? The answer was no. Nadal&apos;s invincibility on clay fragmented when Federer won the French Open and then, in Nadal&apos;s absence, Wimbledon. Earlier this week he sealed the No1 ranking for the fifth time in the past six years. Better not write him off just yet.", "tags": ["ATP World Tour Finals", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-28T23:42:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/06/xiaolu-guo-films-of-life", "sentences": ["The one that speaks to me of Chinese women Shen Nu (The Goddess) Yonggang Wu (1934) A classic Chinese film about a beautiful prostitute in 1930s Shanghai."], "title": "Films of my life: Xiaolu Guo", "article": "The one that made me want to be an outlaw Bonnie and Clyde Arthur Penn (1967) I grew up in a really isolated village in China where it was all about tradition, morality and everything you can&apos;t do. Bonnie and Clyde was one of the first films I saw after leaving for Beijing. I was 19 and yearning for love and attention and freedom, and robbing banks didn&apos;t seem like a terrible idea. Seeing these two beautiful outlaws being lovers and travelling and breaking the law filled me with energy. Those that resonate with my vision of love Hiroshima mon amour Alain Resnais (1959) I vividly remember the beauty of the French woman and the Japanese man, and how the film switches from their naked, beautiful bodies to images of the war. The film resonates with my vision of love as an abstract thing that lives in the memory rather than in reality. Happy Together Wong Kar-Wai (1997) This is classified as a gay film but it is more generally about how love can be ravaged and ruined by reality, especially when the lovers&apos; existence is as bleak as it is here. All my novels and films are really about this: dispossession and yearning for love. Each time I watch this film, my tears come out at the moment when Leslie Cheung has an argument with his boyfriend after they make love in their Buenos Aires basement, and at the final scene at Iguaz\u00fa Falls, scored by the most beautiful music. The one that speaks to me of Chinese women Shen Nu (The Goddess) Yonggang Wu (1934) A classic Chinese film about a beautiful prostitute in 1930s Shanghai. She is played by Lingyu Ruan, who committed suicide soon after because of vicious newspaper gossip about her private life. It is about the fracturing effect a moral society can have on women. It&apos;s extremely subtle. You don&apos;t see the prostitution act. Instead, you see her high heels walking around at night. Then she comes home and you see she has a man and a baby. Young educated women now play very significant roles in the big cities in China, but in the provinces women are still really suppressed. The one that had a big influence on my work Vivre sa vie Jean-Luc Godard (1962) My recent book, 20 Fragments of a Ravenous Youth, about a young woman&apos;s life in Beijing, is partly inspired by this film. Divided into 12 chapters, it follows a young woman called Nana who is beautiful, wild, romantic, dreamy and totally lost. This woman, and the film&apos;s nervous, fragmentary style, have had a strong influence on my work. The one that chilled me to the core Twentynine Palms Bruno Dumont (2003) Not many people have seen this film, but it&apos;s so powerful. The whole film is just two normal lovers spending their boring holiday in Palm Springs, travelling around and making love. But then it shows the profound violence of their sexuality. I was completely chilled by the view of alienation in our postmodern society. It shadowed my heart for days. The one that shows up shallow Hollywood La jet\u00e9e Chris Marker (1962) I&apos;m very interested in narratives made up of broken memories, like mosaics, and this is a perfect example, composed of black-and-white stills. The way it plays with time and how we tell stories is so imaginative and authentic, it reflects how shallow and boring Hollywood films are. They steal ideas from a film like this and feed them into extremely mediocre narratives. The one to impress me most recently Antichrist Lars von Trier (2009) A very hard film to watch and take inside, but it deals brilliantly with issues of possession and trust between lovers, such important themes. A lot of people hated it, but they have such a creamy, cake-like taste. They just want a nice two hours in the cinema. It&apos;s a bitter film. It disturbs me, but it&apos;s the kind I&apos;d recommend. \u2022 A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers was nominated for the 2007 Orange Prize.

Even supposedly neutral news reporters regularly repeat this sad tale. &quot;Very little is changing for the Palestinian people on the ground,&quot; I heard BBC World Service Cairo correspondent Christian Fraser tell listeners three times in a 45-minute period the other evening. In fact nothing could be further from the truth. I had spent that day in the West Bank&apos;s largest city, Nablus. The city is bursting with energy, life and signs of prosperity, in a way I have not previously seen in many years of covering the region. As I sat in the plush office of Ahmad Aweidah, the suave British-educated banker who heads the Palestinian Securities Exchange, he told me that the Nablus stock market was the second best-performing in the world so far in 2009, after Shanghai. (Aweidah&apos;s office looks directly across from the palatial residence of Palestinian billionaire Munib al-Masri, the wealthiest man in the West Bank.) Later I met Bashir al-Shakah, director of Nablus&apos;s gleaming new cinema, where four of the latest Hollywood hits were playing that day. Most movies were sold out, he noted, proudly adding that the venue had already hosted a film festival since it opened in June. Wandering around downtown Nablus the shops and restaurants I saw were full. There were plenty of expensive cars on the streets. Indeed I counted considerably more BMWs and Mercedes than I&apos;ve seen, for example, in downtown Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. And perhaps most importantly of all, we had driven from Jerusalem to Nablus without going through any Israeli checkpoints. The government of Binyamin Netanyahu has removed them all since the Israeli security services (with the encouragement and support of President George Bush) were allowed, over recent years, to crush the intifada, restore security to the West Bank and set up the conditions for the economic boom that is now occurring. (There was one border post on the return leg of the journey, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, but the young female guard just waved me and the two Palestinians I was travelling with, through.) The shops and restaurants were also full when I visited Hebron recently, and I was surprised to see villas comparable in size to those on the Cote d&apos;Azur or Bel Air had sprung up on the hills around the city. Life is even better in Ramallah, where it is difficult to get a table in a good restaurant. New apartment buildings, banks, brokerage firms, luxury car dealerships and health clubs are to be seen. In Qalqilya, another West Bank city that was previously a hotbed of terrorists and bomb-makers, the first-ever strawberry crop is being harvested in time to cash in on the lucrative Christmas markets in Europe. Local Palestinian farmers have been trained by Israeli agriculture experts and Israel supplied them with irrigation equipment and pesticides. A new Palestinian city, Ruwabi, is to be built soon north of Ramallah. Last month, the Jewish National Fund, an Israeli charity, helped plant 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area the Palestinian planners say they would like to develop on the edge of the new city. Israeli experts are also helping the Palestinians plan public parks and other civic amenities. Outsiders are beginning to take note of the turnaround too. The official PLO Wafa news agency reported last week that the third quarter of 2009 witnessed near-record tourism in the Palestinian Authority, with 135,939 overnight hotel stays in 89 hotels that are now open. Almost half the guests come from the US or Europe. Palestinian economic growth so far this year \u2013 in a year dominated by economic crisis elsewhere \u2013 has been an impressive 7% according to the IMF, though Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayad, himself a former World Bank and IMF employee, says it is in fact 11%, partly helped along by strong economic performances in neighbouring Israel. In Gaza too, the shops and markets are crammed with food and goods \u2013 see, for example, the photos from the Gaza-based newspaper Palestine Today about the recent Eid celebrations in Gaza. These are not the pictures you are ever likely to see on the BBC or Le Monde or the New York Times. No, Gaza is not like a &quot;concentration camp,&quot; nor is the &quot;humanitarian crisis in Gaza is on the scale of Darfur,&quot; as British journalist Lauren Booth (who is also Tony Blair&apos;s sister-in-law) has said. In June, the Washington Post&apos;s Jackson Diehl related how Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had told him why he had turned down Ehud Olmert&apos;s offer last year to create a Palestinian state on 97% of the West Bank (with 3% of pre-1967 Israeli land being added to make up the shortfall). &quot;In the West Bank we have a good reality,&quot; Abbas told Diehl. &quot;The people are living a normal life,&quot; he added in a rare moment of candour to a western journalist. Nablus stock exchange head Ahmad Aweidah went further in explaining to me why there is no rush to declare statehood, saying ordinary Palestinians need the Israel Defence Forces to help protect them from Hamas, as their own security forces aren&apos;t ready to do so by themselves yet. The truth is that an independent Palestine is now quietly being built, with Israeli assistance. So long as the Obama administration and European politicians don&apos;t clumsily meddle as they have in the past and make unrealistic demands for the process to be completed more quickly than it can be, I am confident the outcome will be a positive one. (The last time an American president \u2013 Bill Clinton in 2000 \u2013 tried to hurry things along unrealistically, it merely resulted in blowing up in everybody&apos;s faces \u2013 literally \u2013 and set back hopes for peace by some years.) Israelis and Palestinians may never agree on borders that will satisfy everyone. But that doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t live in peace. Not all Germans and French agree who should control Alsace-Lorraine. Poles and Russians, Slovenes and Croats, Britons and Irish, and peoples all over the world, have border disputes. But that doesn&apos;t keep them from coexisting with one another. Nor \u2013 so long as partisan journalists and human rights groups don&apos;t mislead western politicians into making bad decisions \u2013 will it prevent Israelis and Palestinians from doing so. \u2022 This article first appeared in the Wall Street Journal Europe \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Obama administration", "US foreign policy", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-07T14:47:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/09/ronnie-osullivan-brush-strokes-baize", "sentences": ["His much improved English seems to have made him feel more at home and he is studying for an economics and management degree at Jiaotong University, Shanghai, which he attends when not on the circuit."], "title": "Ronnie O'Sullivan entertains Damien Hirst with brush strokes on baize", "article": "Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan made one century, 114, in taking a 4-0 lead over Peter Ebdon and another, 118, to clinch a 6-2 interval lead but was at times dragged into the sort of attritional battle in which the 2002 world champion revels before securing his place in the quarter-finals of the UK Championship with a 9-3 victory. &quot;It was tough and I was often struggling to get any momentum but I&apos;m coping better with that kind of thing these days,&quot; said O&apos;Sullivan, no doubt remembering the funereal pace of play with which Ebdon shredded his concentration in their controversial 2005 quarter-final at the Crucible. O&apos;Sullivan, whose celebrity supporters include the artist Damien Hirst (who was present) and the boxer Nikolay Valuev (who was not), demonstrated everything from delicate positional brush strokes to heavily punched pack openers. Ebdon once described him as the Mozart of snooker, thus forcing himself into the role of Salieri, a substantial figure in his own right but a genius only in his willingness to take infinite pains. Ding Junhui, the standard bearer of the Chinese snooker revolution, was sharply away to a 4-0 lead over Shaun Murphy and went on to eliminate the defending champion 9-3, sealing victory with a break of 113. Ding, three times a ranking title winner by the age of 19, went another three years before he reached another such final, October&apos;s Grand Prix in Glasgow, but seems to be enjoying the game again, smiling more often than he used to. His much improved English seems to have made him feel more at home and he is studying for an economics and management degree at Jiaotong University, Shanghai, which he attends when not on the circuit. Maybe all play and no work was not giving him enough respite from snooker&apos;s intense demands.

The world No2 travelled to China for the season&apos;s first event, the Shanghai Masters, but was unable to compete because of a torn shoulder muscle. Defeat by Ding Junhui in the last 16 of the grand prix in Glasgow saw his provisional ranking down to seventh with a third of the skeletal ranking circuit completed. Here in Telford he has been coping with the death last week of his grandfather, Paddy, who provided him, as a boy, with a table to practise on by knocking down an inner wall of his house. Maguire&apos;s game exudes class and he has four ranking titles to his name but there is still a sense that the circuit has not seen the best of him in a sustained way. Lines, 40, appearing in his first quarter-final for 10 years, departed with the highest cheque of his career, \u00a316,450, a pleasant change from having to supplement meagre prize-money from a handful of tournaments with bar shifts and brushing and ironing tables at his base, the Northern Snooker Centre, Leeds. Playing on television for the first time for seven years, Lines &quot;didn&apos;t really notice&quot; the television cameras but added that &quot;it was a lot hotter than it was on the outside tables. It was roasting, even when I was just sat in my chair.&quot; Having beaten two members of the top sixteen, the out-of-form Marco Fu 9-3 and the by no means out-of-form Mark Williams, 9-8 on the final black, he still found Maguire a step up in class: &quot;He cues the long ones so sweet,&quot; he said. &quot;Against Marco and Mark I got away with a few mistakes but Stephen punished me for almost every one.&quot; He reduced daunting arrears of 7-2 to 7-5 but Maguire stepped on the gas with a 108 break in what duly proved to be the penultimate frame. Allister Carter, whose defence of the Welsh Open title falls due next month, became the 32nd player to record a century of centuries in competition as his 124 assisted him to a 3-0 lead over Ding but fell 4-3 behind before he led 7-5.

Alastair Cook and Paul Collingwood are at the crease for the tourists, looking to build on the 51 partnership of yesterday that took them to 142 for three at the close.

England are now 148 for four and Ian Bell has joined Cook at the crease. MR  8.50am: While England are looking to build a total in South Africa and we await this morning&apos;s planning meeting to discuss the day&apos;s stories, take a look at Paul Weaver&apos;s article on the South African search for the next Makhaya Ntini. MR  9.28am: Cook&apos;s innings is over, dismissed for 81. He has become the third victim for the left-arm medium-pacer Charl Pietersen, a player who had a pretty uneventful time at Northants three years ago. Now he is proving to be England&apos;s chief tormentor. MR  9.55am: OK, morning meeting update: \u2022 Notts County: The club have said this morning that executive chairman, Peter Trembling, is mounting a management buyout. The club claims that Sven-Goran Eriksson is involved in the buyout, but it is not believed that he is central to the plan, nor that he has been involved in any detailed proposal.

Wiggins, who looked as if he was please to it was out in the open in his news conference earlier today, said this:   &quot;It was always a difficult situation trying to leave Garmin because I had a lot of friends there.

Japan reached the second round when the finals were hosted there in 2002, but failed to win a game in either of their two other appearances, in 1998 and 2006. But Japan&apos;s coach today said:  &quot;The pressure gives us the opportunity to stand tall and prove ourselves. If that pressure is not there you stay weak.

MR  12.44pm: Michael Vaughan says that the pressure is on Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood to score runs in the Test series in South Africa or they could be dropped. A bit harsh on Collingwood, I think, who managed scores of 74, 64, 60no and 54 in the Ashes and was clearly England&apos;s best batsman in the recent one-day series against South Africa.

Valencia, who seem to be doing rather well for such a skint club, have responded to the hoo-haa about Cristano Ronaldo and Kak\u00e1 being absent for Real by pointing out that they will be missing David Silva.

MR  3.22pm: Marcela Mora y Araujo has blogged on Daniel Passarella, Argentina&apos;s 1978 World Cup-winning captain and newly-elected president of River Plate, who is aiming to sort out the country&apos;s problems at club level. It&apos;s a fascinating read. Here&apos;s a taster:  &quot;He always was an hijo de puta (son of a bitch), according to his closest friends, even if they do say it affectionately. After the death of his son Sebasti\u00e1n in a car accident in November 1995 Passarella seemed to rise from the depths of despair with an even more ambitious fire and the air of one who had nothing left to lose. And yet he has a generosity of spirit towards those he loves. His loyalty to less celebrated figures, such as Leopoldo Luque, a team-mate in 1978, whose brother was killed during the tournament, or his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the troubled Ariel Ortega, are no secret. His with-me-or-against-me mentality is particularly suited to football success.&quot;   PW  3.35pm: Eddie Butler&apos;s weekly take on the world of rugby union, the Breakdown, has landed. This week he&apos;s reflecting on Wasps&apos; no-show at Sale, and the rather nasty taste it left him with. Here&apos;s an excerpt (of the excerpt):  &quot;Wasps have got away with their no-show \u2013 again. Just as they were once, slightly too often for comfort, involved in matches that were reduced to uncontested scrums, so they have become the club that doesn&apos;t play if the forecast isn&apos;t kind.&quot;  To sign up to the Breakdown and have the full email delivered to your inbox every week, click here.

O&apos;Sullivan is hoping to win his fifth UK title, Higgins his third. &quot;I&apos;ve always regarded Ronnie as the marker to set myself against,&quot; said the reigning world champion. Higgins trails their personal head-to-head 28-19 but is well clear of his rival at the top of the provisional world rankings. Through frame-clinching breaks of 66 and 75, Ding led 2-1 but missed on 31-0 in the fourth to let Maguire in for a 97. From 2-2 Ding, the 2005 UK champion, opened a three-frame gap before Maguire dominated the last frame of the afternoon. On the resumption Ding obtained the snooker he needed on the late colours in both the first and second frames of the evening only for Maguire to take one with a fine cut of a length-of-the-table black and the other by fluking the blue as he levelled at 5-5. Utterly unperturbed, Ding completed a 134 total clearance to initiate a four-frame winning streak to the line, which he concluded with a run of 69. &quot;I just wasn&apos;t firing. I can play a lot better than that,&quot; said Maguire, who had been hoping to repeat his UK triumph of 2004. Ding, 22, has been China&apos;s top player since he won the world under-21 title at the age of 15 but has had to respond to a growing threat to his domestic pre-eminence from Liang Wenbo, the likely recipient of the discretionary wild card for next month&apos;s Masters at Wembley on the grounds of reaching the final of September&apos;s Shanghai Masters and the quarter-finals here. Ding and Liang do not practise together any more. It also seems that Ding, aftertwo fallow years, has learnt how to shoulder the immense weight of national expectation he has to bear. His profile is within the top half-dozen Chinese sportsmen. With prize money on offer of \u00a323,250 for the losing semi-finalists and \u00a346,000 for the runner-up, the champion&apos;s cheque for \u00a3100,000 is to be supplemented, courtesy of the sponsors, with his weight in Pukka Pies. At the weigh-in Ding scaled 69 kg (276 pies), Higgins and O&apos;Sullivan 80kg (320 each) and Maguire 89 kg (356). The game&apos;s followers could only speculate on what the sponsor&apos;s potential pie liability would have been for the circuit&apos;s heavyweight champion, Stephen Lee, a second-round loser here.

Authorities in Bangkok said today it was unclear where the plane carrying the 35-tonnes of arms, an Ilyushin IL-76 registered in Georgia, was heading. But suspicion immediately fell on Iran, the destination of a previous illegal weapons shipment impounded in the United Arab Emirates in July. Panitan Wattanayagorn, a Thai government spokesman, said the plane had initially planned to refuel in Sri Lanka. For unknown reasons, the crew asked to make an emergency landing in Bangkok on Friday. Sri Lanka denied any knowledge of the arms shipment. There was also speculation in Bangkok that it was destined for Pakistan or Afghanistan. Thai officials, who detained four crewmen from Kazakhstan and one from Belarus, said they acted on tip-offs from US and other unnamed intelligence agencies that the plane was carrying North Korean-made weapons in contravention of a UN security council ban on arms exports. The ban was strengthened in June, after North Korea&apos;s isolated regime test-fired ballistic missiles and detonated a nuclear bomb. The cargo, declared in the plane&apos;s manifest as oil-drilling equipment, was said to include rocket-propelled grenades, missile and rocket launchers, missile tubes, surface-to-air missile launchers, spare parts and other heavy weapons. North Korea is estimated to make about $1bn a year from arms sales, despite the UN ban imposed in 2006. Sanctions were further tightened by last summer&apos;s UN security council resolution 1874, which gave UN members the right to inspect North Korean cargoes at sea or in port. But a UN investigation into the sanctions reported last month that North Korea had built or augmented clandestine smuggling networks. Pyongyang&apos;s top priority was to finance continuing work on its nuclear weapons programme. The report said that illegal arms sales &quot;have increasingly become one of the country&apos;s principal sources for obtaining foreign exchange&quot;. It described how North Korea used reputable shipping lines, the mislabelling of goods, subsidiary companies and circuitous routes to shield its smuggling activities from view. The Bangkok arms seizure followed several similar recent incidents. In July, the French-owned, Bahamian-flagged ANL Australia bound for Iran was intercepted in the UAE after a US tip-off. The ship was found to be carrying containers of small arms made in North Korea, military hardware and sufficient explosive powder to arm thousands of short-range rockets. Also uncovered was a cache of 2,030 detonators for 122mm rockets and other rocket components. The manifest also detailed the cargo as oil drilling supplies. Investigators said the arms shipment had travelled a complicated roundabout route. Ten large containers left the North Korean port of Nampo on 30 May aboard a North Korean vessel, and were transferred three days later to a Chinese ship at the Chinese port of Dalian. They then went on to Shanghai, where they were loaded on to the ANL Australia, turning up in the Gulf two months later. US officials said the ANL Australia was one of five vessels caught this year carrying large consignments of weapons apparently intended for Iran&apos;s militia clients such as Hezbollah and Hamas, or for the al-Quds brigade of Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guard that protects Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities and supports insurgents in Iraq. In three cases, the US said the arms included North Korean or Chinese-made weapons. No evidence has been produced in public to support US claims of Iranian involvement in North Korean arms smuggling networks. Iran has consistently denied supplying arms to Hamas and Hezbollah although it openly supports the two groups. Washington has long suspected Iran and North Korea of co-operating on nuclear and ballistic missile development. North Korea also secretly assisted Pakistan&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. In another incident, US navy vessels tracked a North Korean ship, the Kang Nam, which was spotted in June, apparently en route to Burma, allegedly with illegal arms on board. The ship eventually turned around and headed home, thereby avoiding a search. North Korea says it would regard any direct interception of its ships as an act of war.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Arms trade", "Thailand", "Nuclear weapons", "Iran", "World news", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-13T17:36:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/china-historic-sites-survey", "sentences": ["The Shanghai family home of the famed architect IM Pei, supposedly protected by the city, has gone."], "title": "China loses thousands of historic sites", "article": "China&apos;s aggressive development has swallowed up tens of thousands of historic sites in the last three decades, experts conducting a national survey have warned. Officials from the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) realised that the locations had disappeared while trying to compile a full list of the country&apos;s ancient tombs, temples, homes and other sites. Many have made way for roads and reservoirs, they discovered. One conservation campaigner told the Guardian the damage caused over the last 20 years was worse than during the Cultural Revolution, which in its early stages saw Red Guards ransack religious sites. Swaths of Beijing&apos;s historic courtyard homes have fallen to the wrecking ball in just the last decade. The old town in Dinghai, Zhejiang, has been almost completely destroyed. The Shanghai family home of the famed architect IM Pei, supposedly protected by the city, has gone. In some cases \u2013 such as Qianmen, a centuries-old shopping street in the capital \u2013 historic buildings have been replaced with ersatz versions. In others, sites have vanished entirely. Last month there were reports that illegal mining in Inner Mongolia had destroyed a section of the Great Wall. Shan Jixiang, director of SACH, said it had examined more than 775,000 sites and hoped to complete its inventory by 2011. Previous attempts, in 1956 and 1982, were never completed and only around 225,000 spots had been registered when work began in 2007. The number has soared thanks to a better-trained team and improved equipment, and to a wider definition of cultural heritage. Some 30,995 of the items on the 1982 list have vanished, officials said in a statement. SACH said the decline also reflected inaccuracies in the 1982 survey and new counting methods, which meant that in some cases multiple entries were now registered as a single site. Even so, it warned that the large-scale construction of infrastructure over the last three decades had had a major impact on the country&apos;s heritage. &quot;As our country&apos;s economy developed, major irrigation and high-speed electricity projects started construction. Urbanisation sped up and new village [building] projects were carried out. Though the cultural heritage departments at all levels [of government] have tried hard to protect sites, they still could not avoid the disappearance of some,&quot; the administration said in a statement. &quot;Major natural disasters like earthquakes and floods have also resulted in the disappearance of many cultural heritage sites, while illegal activities and crimes like tomb-robbing destroyed some as well.&quot; Liu Xiaohe, deputy director of the survey, told the state newspaper China Daily that officials were doing all they could to preserve as much as possible. He pointed out that in one case China spent 300m yuan (\u00a326.5m) to relocate Sichuan&apos;s 1,700-year-old Zhangfei temple when the Three Gorges dam was built, rather than see it destroyed. But he added: &quot;We have about 800,000 historical sites in China, but only 80,000 people are working for relics protection. Places like the Palace Museum [better known to foreigners as The Forbidden City] take up more than 2,000 of them, which means some places have no one to take care of them. What we can do now is try our best to protect the significant sites, like the Summer Palace, while for those less important sites I am afraid they should give way to economic development.&quot; Liu said the survey had cost 1bn yuan already and much more was needed because it cost about 300,000 yuan to survey each town. To date the team has covered almost 36,000 towns and districts. The administration will not release details of the sites included \u2013 or those that have vanished \u2013 until the register is completed. Sun Yuexin, founder of the Chinese Cultural Heritage Protection website, suggested that some might not have existed even in 1982. &quot;Some local governments would exaggerate the amount of relics they have, so as to ask for more funds from the central government to protect relics,&quot; he told China Daily. He Shuzhong, of the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Centre, said he believed that the problem was greater than the survey suggested. &quot;The last 20 years have been the worst time for cultural heritage site protection with the rapid development,&quot; he said. &quot;It is even worse than in the Cultural Revolution \u2013 then, most damage was to movable items, but not to ancient tombs or buildings or old towns. For example, many ancient tombs have been robbed and in the [redevelopment] of old towns many old buildings have been demolished. Beijing used to have 25 protection areas and I believe only half of them are still well protected now.&quot; He added: &quot;The key to improving the situation is to improve local people&apos;s attitudes towards protection. The government has made many mistakes in the past and is still making some now, so we need people and the media to play the roles of monitors and critics.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Heritage", "Architecture", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-14T22:52:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/16/browsers-review-firefox-chrome-flock", "sentences": ["Slim Browser At first glance this effort from Shanghai-based Flashpeak looks anything but slim."], "title": "Browsing the browsers: Internet Explorer's rivals", "article": "Internet Explorer has 63.62% of the global browser market, so what are the alternatives that consumers will be offered? Firefox     Firefox logo    Created by the Mozilla Corporation, which in turn is owned by the not-for-profit Mozilla Foundation, Firefox can trace its roots back to Netscape, which was effectively killed off in the so-called &apos;browser wars&apos; of the late 1990s when Microsoft successfully got Internet Explorer pre-installed in virtually all PCs. When Netscape made the code for its Navigator browser available to everyone, a community of developers snatched it up and created Firefox. It was launched five years ago and introduced now de-facto standard browser functions such as tabs. There remains a mammoth developer community behind the browser, ensuring that it is constantly updated so it always allows for safe browsing. Chrome     Still from advert for Google Chrome    Google&apos;s entry into the browser market last year seriously stirred up the internet world not least because Google also has a deal with Mozilla to be the default search box on its Firefox browser. Obviously unhappy with the bloated state of some other browsers on the market, which slows down performance, Google stripped Chrome down to the essentials while still retaining a high degree of security (it maintains blacklists of sites responsible for phishing or malware attacks so users can be warned before visiting them). But as with so many things involving Google, questions have been raised about the amount of information the company retains about what users are doing with Chrome. Safari      Originally designed by Apple for use with its Mac OS X operating system, two years ago the Californian giant launched a version for Windows which many reviewers thought &apos;undercooked&apos;. After several updates, the new version 4 of the browser is reliable and relatively fast \u2013 it is based on the same open source technology as Google&apos;s Chrome \u2013 but lacks the customisation of other Windows-compatible browsers. Apple got into hot water last year when it tried to boost PC users of Safari by bundling it into software updates of iTunes and QuickTime. Opera Now in its 10th iteration and with well over a decade&apos;s worth of innovation and work, Opera has never quite lived up to its potential. It&apos;s a fast \u2013 in tests it has beaten Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox \u2013 and feature-rich browser with a lot of fans despite its relatively modest share of the market. The Norwegian company behind Opera has had more success recently in the mobile phone sector with a slimmed down version of the browser becoming a very popular downloadable &apos;app&apos; this year. AOL Explorer      When the promising marriage between AOL and Time Warner was split last night the new logo was launched Photograph: Public Domain    This browser from AOL, recently spun off from Time Warner, is all about security, in keeping with AOL&apos;s rather nanny-ish character. It&apos;s built on Internet Explorer so users should see no change in the way they view the web, but it is full of security features including pop-up blocking and a Spyware Quick Scan to ensure nothing dodgy gets downloaded from the web. AOL, however, is moving away from browsers and recommends its users download a special tweaked version of Internet Explorer 8. Maxthon Very popular in its home market of China but relatively unheard of in the west, Maxthon is a fast web browser specifically designed for Windows and comes loaded with features which on other browsers the user would have to download themselves including content filtering and ad-blocking. K-Meleon Based on Firefox but designed specifically for Windows users, K-Meleon is almost a decade old and is highly customisable but requires a certain amount of technical knowledge to get the best out of it. Flock Also based on the open source technology that underlies Firefox, Flock is designed to unashamedly jump on the social networking bandwagon. The latest version, launched earlier this year, integrates a range of social networking and other online services \u2013 including MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, Blogger, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail \u2013 directly into the browser through a People bar on the left hand side of the screen. Users can instantly share their web browsing with their contacts by dragging and dropping content to the People bar. It also allows users to &apos;flockcast&apos; \u2013 sending status updates to more than one social network \u2013 straight from the browser. Avant Browser One of the more popular lesser known browsers, tech bible CNet describes Avant as like Internet Explorer &quot;if it were being produced by a small firm instead of Microsoft&quot;. In fact it was originally produced by a Chinese programmer named Anderson Che and leans heavily on the technology that IE uses to render web pages. Browser staples such as tabs, auto form-filling and pop-up blocking are all present but it has some compatibility issues with Microsoft&apos;s Vista operating system, according to reviewers. Sleipnir Designed in Japan and owned by Osaka-based Fenrir, Sleipnir has done very well in its home market and again relies heavily on Internet Explorer for its look and feel \u2013 it also uses the same page rendering technology as IE so users should see no difference in the way that pages appear. Customisation is the name of the game with a wide variety of plug-ins for the browser, including a simple-to-use screenshot generator.

Lantana (Ray Lawrence, 2001) 12.40am, Film4 This beautifully understated, sombre Australian thriller has a cop searching for a missing woman, but it&apos;s much more than a standard detective story. Take the cop: Anthony LaPaglia&apos;s Leon Zat is immersed in midlife crisis, starting a perfunctory affair; it&apos;s a world of muted emotions and blocked longings, where weird coincidences drive the action ironically onwards: a real one-off. Back to top of page Christmas Eve     The Chronicles Of Narnia Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe (Andrew Adamson, 2005) 2.15pm, BBC1 There was much discussion of the overt Christian imagery, but this is a magnificently realised screening of CS Lewis&apos;s classic. While the final battle may disappoint in comparison with The Lord Of The Rings, the snowy Narnian landscapes and its denizens are fantastic creations, with Tilda Swinton icy as the White Witch. Over The Hedge (Karey Kirkpatrick, Tim Johnson, 2006) 4.25pm, BBC1 Another DreamWorks animated adventure, in which RJ, the cynical raccoon (voiced by Bruce Willis) teaches a burrowful of innocent woodland animals to forage off the waste of a housing estate, rather than rely on boring old natural food, before seeing the error of his ways. Plenty of good slapstick fun for kids and cine-literate gags for adults (or vice versa). Shrek 2 (Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury, Conrad Vernon, 2004) 5.45pm, BBC1 A sequel that almost matches the fabulous, fairytale-busting original. The jolly green ogres Shrek and Fiona, again voiced by Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz, now have to visit her folks in the land of Far Far Away where their wedded bliss is threatened by a wimpy Prince Charming (Rupert Everett). Tim Burton&apos;s Corpse Bride (Tim Burton, Mike Johnson, 2005) 6pm, ITV1 Life, in Burton&apos;s typically weird and ghoulish fantasy, is a dull grey affair: death is much more colourful and fun, as young Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) discovers when he is whisked into the underworld by the maggoty Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter). Trouble is, he&apos;s in love with sweet and living Victoria (Emily Watson). Ghastly fun. Slither (James Gunn, 2006) 12.10am, C4 Writer-director Gunn, a graduate of the Troma school of gross-out horrors (The Toxic Avenger and all), concocts a comically gruesome tale of an alien entity that infects the good people of a South Carolina town with parasitic slugs. It&apos;s done with some wit. Back to top of page Christmas Day     The Polar Express Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar    The Polar Express (Robert Zemeckis, 2004) 1.10pm, ITV1 The first film to use that slightly eerie &quot;performance capture&quot; technique employed in 300 and Beowulf. This is much gentler fare, with a young lad boarding a magic train bound for Santa&apos;s grotto at the north pole: the digital business allows Tom Hanks to play five roles, and creates a genuine sense of wonder. White Christmas (Michael Curtiz, 1954) 2.15pm, BBC2 More than 50 years on, this is still the ultimate Christmas movie, thanks to Bing Crosby&apos;s crooning rendition of Irving Berlin&apos;s sloppy title song and director Curtiz going for full-on seasonal slush. It&apos;s a festive near-remake of the 1942 musical Holiday Inn, with Bing reprising his role and Danny Kaye standing in for Fred Astaire, as they woo cabaret girls Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney. The Incredibles (Brad Bird, 2004) 3.10pm, BBC1 The Pixar people behind the Toy Stories, Wall-E and all hit on another sublimely crafted, funny and touching animated adventure with this super tale of superheroes. After years of retirement occasioned by legal writs, Mr Incredible (very strong) and his wife, Elastigirl (very elastic), come bounding back into action, kids in tow, to save the world: part Fantastic Four, part happy families, incredible is the word for it. Happy Feet (George Miller, 2006) 3.40pm, ITV1 An Australian animated movie about a tap-dancing penguin called Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) who&apos;s a social misfit because his singing isn&apos;t up to scratch. As Mumble learns to make friends with humans the ecological message assumes iceberg proportions, but it&apos;s a visual delight. Billy Elliot (Stephen Daldry, 2000) 9pm, BBC3 Daldry&apos;s warm-hearted tale of a young northern lad&apos;s search for self-expression is a sort of musical Kes. Jamie Bell is 11-year-old Billy, who wants to swap his boxing gloves for ballet shoes; set against the harsh background of the 80s miners&apos; strike, it&apos;s nevertheless full of infectious fun and energy, with Julie Walters in her element as his dance teacher. Grey Gardens (Michael Sucsy, 2009) 9pm, C4 In 1976 the Maysles brothers (who directed the Stones-at-Altamont documentary Gimme Shelter) turned their cameras on 79-year-old Edith Beale and her daughter Edie, 56, who, although related to Jackie Onassis, were living in verminous penury in New York. This dramatic reconstruction from HBO puts dramatic flesh on the bones, with Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore thoroughly inhabiting the strange world of the Beales. Journey Into Fear (Norman Foster, 1943) 10.50pm, BBC4 Foster directed, but Orson Welles&apos;s was the guiding hand. This, his first venture into film noir, is an Istanbul-set wartime thriller not a million miles away from Casablanca. Based on Eric Ambler&apos;s novel, it stars Joseph Cotten as a munitions expert on the run from Gestapo agents, but lucky to have leopardskin-suited Dolores del Rio on his side. Welles is typically menacing and mysterious as Haki, the police chief. Gladiator (Ridley Scott, 2000) 11.15pm, ITV1 Scott&apos;s stunning computer-generated recreation of imperial Rome reinvented a dormant genre: it&apos;s a full-blooded epic, full of fiery war and crunching gladiatorial combat, but clever enough to contain political intrigue and undying love too. Russell Crowe&apos;s Maximus, the betrayed general who becomes a gladiator, fighting to avenge his family and to free Rome, is a rock-solid hero, matched by Joaquin Phoenix as the ruthless-but-needy new emperor Commodus. Back to top of page Boxing Day     Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa Photograph: Paramount/Everett/Rex Features    Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath, 2008) 10am, 5.30pm, Sky Movies Premiere The first outing of the animated troupe of wild-ish animals heading from zoo to jungle was pretty forgettable, and so is this. The same crew \u2013 Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) crashland on the savannah, adventures ensue. The barmy flying penguins are fun, though. My Life As A Dog (Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, 1985) 1.15pm, Sky Arts 1 The charming and funny tale of a 12-year-old boy sent to live in a hick village in southern Sweden by his ailing mother. It&apos;s the summer of 1959 and, missing his own pet back in the city, he feels as exiled as the Russian spacedog then famously orbiting the earth. A perceptive study of childhood. Flushed Away (David Bowers, Sam Fell, 2006) 3pm, BBC1 Bristol-based Aardman&apos;s first Hollywood venture (with DreamWorks) lacks the brilliant silliness of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit (see below), but still crafts a fair bit of classy comedy. It has a spoilt pet mouse (voiced by Hugh Jackman) flushed down the loo of his Kensington home into the sewers, where he befriends cute rat Kate Winslet and tackles a malevolent toad (Ian McKellen): now that&apos;s toilet humour. Wallace &amp; Gromit In The Curse Of The Were-rabbit (Nick Park, Steve Box, 2005) 4.40pm, BBC1 This first full-length feature adventure of wacky inventor Wallace and his much smarter dog has the lovable duo running an anti-rabbit business (Anti-Pesto) that gets busy when a supersized bunny threatens the produce at Lady Tottington&apos;s annual Giant Vegetable Fete. It&apos;s a hilarious, heartwarming spoof of antique Hammer horrors, brought joyously to life with old-fashioned stop-motion technology and clay. March Of The Penguins (Luc Jacquet, 2005) 4.40pm, ITV1 They might look pretty comical, but emperor penguins are a heroic bunch: Jacquet&apos;s captivating documentary follows a flock on their incredible Antarctic journey to their frozen breeding ground, and the subsequent hatchings that make it all worthwhile. It&apos;s a tale of stupendous endurance, marvelled at by narrator Morgan Freeman. The School Of Rock (Richard Linklater, 2003) 5.55pm, Film4 Actually, that&apos;s &quot;School of Raaaarrrckkk!!&quot; Jack Black&apos;s slacker Dewey Finn blags a temporary teaching job at a posh prep school, where he starts educating the kids about the glory of the Who, Led Zep and all \u2013 and moulds them into a heavy metal outfit to enter a Battle Of The Bands. A fresh and funny tale. The Third Man (Carol Reed, 1949) 7.15pm, BBC4 Reed&apos;s classic thriller, born out of an elite collaboration with Graham Greene and Orson Welles: the scene is postwar Vienna, shadowy and bare in Robert Krasker&apos;s Oscar-winning monochrome photography, Anton Karas&apos;s zither music in the air; Welles&apos;s black marketeer Harry Lime is a marvellously cynical flourish, Joseph Cotten his loyal old pal. Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World&apos;s End (Gore Verbinski, 2007) 7.30pm, BBC1 Shiver me timbers, but this concluding chunk of the Pirates trilogy goes on: nearly three hours of Johnny Depp&apos;s chancer Jack Sparrow navigating through a mystifying plot that writhes around like the tentacles on Davey Jones&apos;s octopussy-face, with ever more characters chasing each other nonsensically around the high seas. Still, a bit of the original&apos;s dash and fun survives, and it looks fantastic. Angus, Thongs And Perfect Snogging (Gurinder Chadha, 2008) 8pm, 1.10am, Sky Movies Family Another sweet and youthful romcom from the director of Bend It Like Beckham and Bride And Prejudice. Set in a surprisingly cheery Eastbourne, it stars Georgia Groome as the 14-year-old girl on the hunt for a &quot;gorgeous sex god&quot;; it doesn&apos;t break any new ground in the coming-of-age department, but has a light and lovable sense of humour. Australia (Baz Luhrmann, 2008) 9pm, Sky Movies Premiere Luhrmann&apos;s epic romance set in wartime Oz was panned on release, with some cause. Nicole Kidman&apos;s refined cattle-baroness and Hugh Jackman&apos;s rough drover can&apos;t mix that essential chemistry; at three hours it&apos;s demoralisingly long; and the barnstorming action scenes/romantic bits/beautiful Aussie landscape feel like scenes from different movies, tacked together. But there are some glorious scenes in there. Back to top of page Sunday 27 December     The Remains Of The Day Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    The Remains Of The Day (James Ivory, 1993) 3.15pm, Five Merchant and Ivory, masters of empire, give Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s Booker-winning novel a beautifully measured treatment, playing the cruel ironies of the class system for all they are worth. And there are two marvellous performances: Anthony Hopkins, the butler who buries all doubt and all passion deep inside, and Emma Thompson, touching as the new housekeeper who offers love. James Fox is impressively upper-crust as Hopkins&apos;s neo-Nazi master. The Magnificent Ambersons (Orson Welles, 1943) 8pm, BBC4 A frustrated love is the metaphor for the sick spirit of the patrician Amberson family: young Isabel (Dolores Costello) loves car designer Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) but is prevailed on to marry one of the more suitable Minafer clan. Twenty years on, and now a widow, her chance of happiness is again blocked by selfish, snobbish son George (Tim Holt) \u2013 a true Amberson. A magnificent movie, despite the studio-cropped conclusion. The Holiday (Nancy Meyers, 2006) 9pm, ITV1 This anodyne, mildly amusing, barely romantic seasonal romcom has LA mansion owner Cameron Diaz and snowy Surrey cottage-dweller Kate Winslet swapping homes after splitting up with cheating boyfriends. Cameron falls for Kate&apos;s widowed brother, Jude Law; Kate for composer Jack Black. The words &quot;humbug&quot; and &quot;bah&quot; seem unavoidable. Farewell My Lovely (Edward Dmytryk, 1945) 1.45am, BBC2 This adaptation of Raymond Chandler&apos;s novel marked the beginning of 1940s film noir and the reinvention of crooner Dick Powell as a serious actor. Lovingly crafted by Dmytryk, with sharp dialogue, gloomy photography and fine performances: Mike Mazurki was the definitive Moose Malloy, setting the private eye after Claire Trevor&apos;s marvellous Velma. Back to top of page Monday 28 December     Eight Below Photograph: Landmark Media    Eight Below (Frank Marshall, 2005) 10am, BBC1 A gripping tale of survival against the odds: it&apos;s the story of a team of huskies, left to fend for themselves in the Antarctic when the researchers they serve pull out. Based on a true story, the animals stay alive for months while their master, Paul Walker, organises a rescue party. Go, li&apos;l doggies! The Princess Diaries (Garry Marshall, 2001) 1.05pm, BBC1 An enjoyable wish-fulfilment teenie comedy adapted from the novels of Meg Cabot. Anne Hathaway plays Mia, a clumsy San Francisco schoolkid who discovers she is heir to the throne of Genovia, a quaint little European state. Julie Andrews is regal as anything as her grandma, Queen Clarisse Renaldi, who has the job of transforming clutzy Mia into a princess. Pride And Prejudice (Joe Wright, 2005) 4.20pm, ITV1 Bold to challenge the near-mythic 1990s BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, but director Wright and scriptwriter Deborah Moggach create a lucid, lively and enjoyable Austen adaptation. Much of that is down to Keira Knightley; strictly speaking, too obviously beautiful for the role of Elizabeth Bennet, she is full of star-quality spirit and wit in her clashes with Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). Just Like Heaven (Mark Waters, 2005) 6.15pm, BBC2 A ghostly love story in which widower Mark Ruffalo moves into the San Francisco apartment of workaholic doctor Reese Witherspoon, who has been lying in a coma for three months after a car smash; her spirit haunts the flat, and an ethereal relationship begins. Daft, but the smart script and charming leads make it very watchable, rather like Ghost. The Pianist (Roman Polanski, 2002) 11.45pm, ITV1  Adapted by Ronald Harwood from concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman&apos;s memoir of Nazi occupied Warsaw, there is much of Polanski&apos;s experience as a child of the Krakow ghetto in this beautifully crafted, emotionally gripping film. Adrien Brody is a fine, haunted Szpilman, saved from the death camps by a whim and, in hiding, witnessing the relentless destruction of his city and its people. The Wicker Man (Robin Hardy, 1973) 12.45am, ITV4 A staunch Christian policeman (the late Edward Woodward) goes to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to find a missing girl, but uncovers ancient pagan rites as well as wild, wild women such as Britt Ekland, Diane Cliento and Ingrid Pitt, and Christopher Lee presiding as local laird. Anthony Shaffer&apos;s intelligent screenplay slowly stokes up the sinister, erotic atmosphere. Back to top of page Tuesday 29 December      Singin' In The Rain Photograph: Ronald Grant    Singin&apos; In The Rain (Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen, 1952) 3.35pm, More4 An all-time great among Hollywood musicals, in which stars, songs and sets meld into a joyous celebration of \u2026 the Hollywood musical. While the Gene Kelly-Debbie Reynolds romance is airy-light, there&apos;s a hard satirical edge to the portrayals of the studio bosses wrestling with the arrival of sound, but it&apos;s Kelly&apos;s unforgettable pitter-patter through the puddles that&apos;s indelible. Ice Age: The Meltdown (Carlos Saldanha, 2006) 6.10pm, ITV2 Having safely negotiated the Ice Age, Manny the woolly mammoth, Diego the sabre-toothed tiger and Sid the sloth now face the perils of global warming in this technically impressive but less charming sequel. The message is, stick together and we can survive anything (let&apos;s ignore the fact that two of them are extinct). Miss Potter (Chris Noonan, 2006) 6.30pm, BBC2 A wilfully whimsical version of the life of Beatrix Potter that should do no harm to the Lake District tourist industry, or Potter&apos;s publishers. Even if it does cast Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as a pioneering career woman as much as an infantile fantasist, it&apos;s stuffed with cute animated bunnies, awkward Victorian courtship (with her publisher, McGregor) and pretty scenery. The Conversation (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974) 10.55pm, Film4 The ever-dependable Gene Hackman is at his best as surveillance expert Harry Caul: shifty-looking in mac and specs, he is tipped by the nature of his calling into increasingly paranoid suspicions as businessman Robert Duvall draws him, conscience-stricken, into a murder plot. It&apos;s a terrifying, dreamlike world, ruled by technological precision, and yet all sense is garbled. The Big Easy (Jim McBride, 1986) 11.50pm, BBC1 A spicy New Orleans jambalaya of murder, love and sex, set to an exuberant Cajun soundtrack (Professor Longhair and friends). Dennis Quaid is the local cop skimming illicit bonuses; Ellen Barkin the assistant DA rooting out corruption \u2013 but fortunately for him, they fancy the pants off each other. The detective story is mundane, but it&apos;s lathered in old-style Louisiana charm. With Ned Beatty and John Goodman. And When Did You Last See Your Father? (Anand Tucker, 2007) 12.30am, Channel 4 Adapted from Blake Morrison&apos;s book about the death of his father, this moving, heartfelt drama stars Colin Firth as the grown-up Blake visiting his terminally ill Dad (Jim Broadbent) and recalling the crusty, arrogant, overbearing man in his prime, with Juliet Stevenson as his long-suffering mother. An eloquent account of filial love and grief. Back to top of page Wednesday 30 December     There Will Be Blood Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount    There Will Be Blood (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2008) 10pm, Sky Movies Indie Daniel Day-Lewis&apos;s powerhouse, Oscar-winning performance is at the dark heart of this tale of blood, sweat and black gold in 1900s California. His Daniel Plainview, a lowly silver prospector turned oil tycoon, is part violent, obsessive monster, part loving father to adopted son HW (Dillon Freasier): a larger-than-life figure in a true American epic of a movie. Festen (Thomas Vinterberg, 1998) 11pm, Sky Arts 1 A wealthy Danish clan gathers for the patriarch&apos;s 60th birthday. Eldest son Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) has a speech to make: his revelations about his father (Henning Moritzen) are horrifying, and shatter the celebration. On its release there was much discussion of the Dogme creed under which Vinterberg made his film - hand-held cameras, natural lighting and all that \u2013 but aside from this it&apos;s an intense and bitterly funny exploration of the skeletons rattling in the family cupboard. Back to top of page New Year&apos;s Eve     The Magic Roundabout Photograph: Pathe Pictures    The Magic Roundabout (Frank Passingham, 2005) 9.55pm, BBC1 This computer-generated updating of the much-loved children&apos;s TV show is as kooky an adventure as any 60s dopehead could ask for. It&apos;s a colourful tale with a marvellously eccentric collection of voices: Robbie Williams as Dougal, Joanna Lumley as Ermintrude, Kylie Minogue as Florence, Ian McKellen as Zebedee, Bill Nighy as spaced-out Dylan, and Tom Baker as evil sorcerer Zeebad. Romancing The Stone (Robert Zemeckis, 1984) 1.05pm, C4 A frantic, slapstick action movie in the style of Raiders Of The Lost Ark: it&apos;s set in remote climes (a South American jungle); the plot is frugal (hunt the treasure); but it&apos;s rich in fights and flights. What sets it apart is the enjoyably prickly interplay of its heroes, Kathleen Turner&apos;s romantic novelist and Michael Douglas&apos;s soldier of fortune. Easy Virtue (Stephan Elliott, 2008) 6.55pm, BBC2 Alfred Hitchcock originally brought this Noel Coward play to the screen in 1927, so in a sense a remake was long overdue. It&apos;s the jolly story of upper-class British snobs the Whittakers (Kristin Scott Thomas and Colin Firth) whose world is tipped upside down when their son (Ben Barnes) comes back from France with a wife (Jessica Biel) and she&apos;s (quick, pass the smelling salts!) American. An elegant and witty comedy. Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Man&apos;s Chest (Gore Verbinski, 2006) 8pm, BBC1 It doesn&apos;t quite achieve the original&apos;s beguiling blend of cheery spoof and breezy adventure and the plot, involving a search for a key, a magic compass and the mythical kraken, is more or less incomprehensible. Still, there&apos;s Johnny Depp&apos;s swaggering Cap&apos;n Jack, the arrival of Bill Nighy&apos;s octopus-faced Davy Jones and his whelky crew, and some inspired action scenes to enjoy. The Painted Veil (John Curran, 2006) 9pm, BBC2 Adapted from a W Somerset Maugham novel, this slow-burning period romance stars Edward Norton and Naomi Watts as newlyweds relocated to Shanghai. He is a stern scientist, she a feckless socialite, and when he finds she has been unfaithful he spitefully drags her off to a remote, cholera-ravaged village by way of punishment. The two leads are excellent, the Chinese landscapes stunning, and there&apos;s an evocative score by Alexandre Desplat. This Is Spinal Tap (Rob Reiner, 1984) 12midnight, Dave The legendary spoof &quot;rockumentary&quot; that follows the disaster-strewn US tour of ageing Brit heavy metal band Spinal Tap. Filmed in wobbly verite style, it has director Marty DiBergi (Reiner) filming life on the road in all its tacky misery, from duff bookings to the crashing stupidity of giant egos. With Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer. Set the amp to 11 and enjoy. Back to top of page New Year&apos;s Day     SpongeBob Squarepants Photograph: Paramount/Everett/Rex    The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (Stephen Hillenburg, 2004) 7.20am, C4 The wacky, surreally funny underwater world of the cult TV hero makes a splendid splash on the big screen. SpongeBob (&quot;absorbent and yellow and porous is he&quot;) and his starfish pal Patrick have to retrieve Neptune&apos;s crown from the villainous Plankton: a quest of inspired, near-hallucinatory silliness. Quantum Of Solace (Marc Foster, 2008) 10am, 8pm, Sky Movies Premiere Bond is back \u2013 and has he got the hump. His desire to avenge the death of Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale isn&apos;t affecting his work, he tells boss Judi Dench, but throwing people off roofs instead of bringing them in for questioning sort of undermines that argument. Add the obligatory global villain, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), who plans to corner the market in ... water? and 007 has his work cut out in what&apos;s essentially a continuous stream of driving, thumping and shooting that would make Jason Bourne blanch. It&apos;s not Bond as we know him, but Daniel Craig makes it work anyway. Some Like It Hot (Billy Wilder, 1959) 12.30pm, ITV1 Part affectionate pastiche of1930s gangster pictures, part cross-dressing caper, this is Billy Wilder&apos;s comic masterpiece. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are inspired as jazzmen Joe and Jerry, dressing up as girls to hide from George Raft and his mob after witnessing the St Valentine&apos;s Day massacre. Their eyes are popping out, too, at their travelling companion \u2013 Marilyn Monroe&apos;s sexy, sweet Sugar Kane. The Darjeeling Limited (Wes Anderson, 2007) 1.10pm, 8.20pm, Sky Movies Indie Another funny-peculiar comedy from the director of The Royal Tenenbaums; this concerns three brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman) reuniting on the Darjeeling Limited train from Mumbai to the Himalayas: it&apos;s an oddly beautiful, eventful, sentimental journey, venomous snake and all. Shark Tale (Bibo Bergeron, Vicky Jenson, Rob Letterman, 2004) 1.55pm, BBC1 Never mind the animation, DreamWorks must have paid top dollar for the starry voices behind this fishy tale of deep-sea mobsters. Will Smith is the little hero, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese voice the aquatic wiseguys, with Jack Black doing a caring, sharing shark in dolphin&apos;s clothing. But what&apos;s the underwater equivalent of &quot;he sleeps with the fishes&quot;? Superman Returns (Bryan Singer, 2006) 3.15pm, BBC1 Singer brings the sombre mood of his X-Men films to this latest Superman: even the famous cape is refashioned in maroon. Brandon Routh plays the self-doubting hero, returning from a sojourn in space to find that the world, and his love, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), apparently no longer need him \u2013 but Kevin Spacey&apos;s malevolent Lex Luthor soon changes all that. The Good Shepherd (Robert De Niro, 2006) 9pm, BBC2 Matt Damon plays an agent not at all like the indestructible Jason Bourne: his Edward Wilson is a dour young scholar turned CIA man, and through his life the story of the Agency is explored, from the second world war to the Bay of Pigs disaster. Directing his first film since A Bronx Tale, De Niro crafts a hefty, engrossing, well-researched portrait of a shadowy world.

The listing underlines the importance of China to HSBC&apos;s growth as well as demonstrating how the centre of financial gravity is moving east. It has appointed two Chinese banks \u2013 China Citic and China International Capital Corporation \u2013 to advise it on the flotation and is set to add Goldman Sachs as the float date approaches, possibly as early as March. The bank is already well capitalised and does not need the money from flotation, but HSBC is keen to raise its profile with Chinese retail investors as it expands its branch network and looks at buying stakes in rival Chinese banks. HSBC confirmed that it was planning to list in Shanghai, but declined to discuss details and timing. Mike Trippitt, an analyst at Oriel Securities, said: &quot;It will be easier for HSBC to grow its operations in China if people there have a financial stake in the brand. This is all about HSBC raising its profile in a market that is crucial to its success.&quot; HSBC recently signalled its determination to expand in China and across Asia by moving Michael Geoghegan, its chief executive, from London to be based full-time in Hong Kong, where HSBC is already quoted. The bank was founded in Hong Kong and Shanghai in 1865, but shifted its headquarters to London in 1993 after acquiring the Midland Bank. Hong Kong and China accounted for 40% of HSBC&apos;s pretax profits last year and analysts predict this could reach 50% over the next decade. A disastrous foray into the US sub-prime market, where it has been forced to write off billions because of the credit crunch, has persuaded management to return to its roots in the Far East, say analysts. Beijing has let it be known that it is ready to start allowing foreign companies to list on the Chinese mainland, reflecting its ambitions to open up the country&apos;s financial sector and transform Shanghai into an international financial hub to rival London and New York. Lawyers in London say that the China Securities Regulatory Commission is expected to change its laws in January to allow foreign and non-mainland companies to list in Shanghai. But the Chinese will retain a cap of 20% on the proportion of equity foreign banks can acquire in Chinese financial companies. Simon Maughan, an analyst at MF Global, said: &quot;You can&apos;t overestimate the importance of China. If the Chinese were to move towards more open capital markets, perhaps allowing foreign institutions to invest in Chinese government debt, HSBC would be better positioned than any other western bank because it already has such a big presence in Hong Kong. A listing in Shanghai would reinforce its position in the region.&quot; HSBC is already the biggest foreign bank in a country where the market potential is viewed as vast. &quot;Currying favour with the Chinese is both sensible and necessary if you are serious about growing in a nation with 1.3 billion people,&quot; said Maughan.

Many multinationals already have quotes in Hong Kong, which has evolved as a global financial hub since the British took over after the opium wars of the 1840s.  Hong Kong&apos;s economy is rooted in capitalism and characterised by low taxation, free trade and minimum government intervention. The Hong Kong dollar is the 9th most traded currency in the world. Shanghai is struggling to catch up. Chinese companies that wanted access to a deeper and more stable market have tended to drift to the more established former British colony, where broking firms, lawyers and accountants have congregated for decades.  For all Shanghai&apos;s glamour, glitz and easygoing cosmopolitanism, the city&apos;s stock exchange has acquired a poor reputation. Its listed companies have been the target of a wave of speculative buying by retail investors who have piled into property and other assets, much to the horror of the authorities. Although Shanghai was beginning to attract some major Chinese companies prior to the credit crunch, the market has crashed in the past two years and has lost much of its lustre. No wonder the Shanghai exchange is actively encouraging HSBC and other high-profile foreign companies to list their shares in mainland China.

However, the World Bank attributed 70% of the rise to the use of grain for vehicle fuel ethanol. Every means will certainly be needed to raise cereal yields whose annual increase has dropped from over 2% to around 1%, but if fertiliser and chemical use are to be curtailed, the suggestion that inefficient small farms should be incorporated into larger units needs to be treated with caution. The Future of Food TV series (BBC2) showed the vulnerability of current large-scale methods using, as they do, five calories of fossil fuel energy to produce one calorie of food energy. The only ray of hope was shown by a holding at San Antonio, Cuba, where one calorie of mostly human energy managed to produce five calories of food on a very intensive mixed crop and livestock holding It is only in western society that this seems remarkable. Hanoi, Calcutta, Shanghai and Caracas all produce a high proportion of their food from adjacent, intensively small-scale farmed land. They may be in better shape to face the predicted perfect storm in food supply than our cities fed from distant large farms. John Watson Totnes, Devon \u25a0 The science of genetics is not the only answer to food shortages \u2013 there is also the science of ecology (as the planting of the nettles around wheat fields exemplifies), but this requires work on the relation of farm products to each other, both in space (eg minimising spread of disease) and in time (as in crop succession or rotation). The social sciences also are involved, with the inevitable change in farm economics and the possibility of more labour-intensive farming. Further input from social sciences may bear upon whether there should be rationing by price or by more interventionist methods. This, in turn, involves the science of nutrition. And we can learn not only from science, but also from history, not least that of the war of 1939-45. Dr Jeffrey Boss Stroud, Glos \u25a0 Robin McKie mentions, more in passing than in alarm, that the UK&apos;s population is predicted to rise to 75 million in the next 40 years. The consequences of such a rise during the lead up to a period of serious world food shortages needs to be understood. This is an increase of 25% in our population. Not only is this an enormous extra number of people to feed, but it also means that a large additional area of farmland will be lost under urban development. We already lose roughly a moderately sized English county every decade. There seems to be a belief that population increase is outside of the influence of policy, but this is nonsense. Our health, education and immigration policies all have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the numbers of unwanted pregnancies, on how the choices of how many children to have are made, and on the net balance of migration. We can and should take population into account. Without this, pontificating about food shortages is hypocritical. Chris Padley Market Rasen, Lincs \u25a0 A whole page on the coming food crisis(&quot;Why Britain faces a bleak future of food shortages&quot;, 13 Dec), and the only mention of population growth is the bald statement that in 40 years it will &quot;leap... from 6.8 billion to 9 billion&quot;, as if it was written in stone. In fact, it could be anything between 7.6 billion and 11 billion, depending on the actions we take between now and then, since the 9 billion is only the middle of three projections by the UN Population Fund. Did any of your editorial staff watch David Attenborough&apos;s documentary on population in the Horizon series last Tuesday, and if so, why doesn&apos;t this article make any mention of the need to bring down the reproductive rate?

Since the relationship of the People&apos;s Republic will be a key factor in the year (and many more years) ahead, that makes this a core question for the Obama administration and Europe \u2013 and, closer to the mainland, for India and Japan as well. But there still seems to be an almost childish reluctance in the west to accept China for what it is, whatever one may think of what it is. It might be nice if China was more like us, but it isn&apos;t going to be. Expecting it to fit into the paradigm set by the west is not only futile but positively dangerous. The sooner governments start to work out a meaningful China policy rather than depending on wishful thinking, the better. It would make a good New year&apos;s resolution. But I&apos;m not holding my breath. The sad case of Akmal Shaikh, the London man executed in China on drug smuggling charges provides the latest example of how little the conventional approach to China on decent humanitarian grounds yields, just as concern abroad about the fate of Charter 08 dissident Liu Xiaobo did nothing to prevent him being sentenced to 11 years in jail on Christmas Day. China has reacted indignantly to the protests about Shaikh. The argument that China has made a mockery of justice has been made on Cif by Clive Stafford Smith. Less convincingly, we have had the descant of a reminder of the opium wars, as if Shaikh was a reincarnation of the East India Company, and relativists trotting out the tired old fallacy that human rights abuses in the west and executions in the US disbar us from protesting at the way the trial was conducted. Behind this froth, what is plain is that China has once again asserted its determination to protect its own sovereignty whatever the issue, and is intent on doing things its way. Given its economic progress in the past three decades and the immediate effect of its huge pump-priming over the past 12 months in restoring growth (even if the second half of next year may prove more problematic), the leadership and the population feel pretty good about themselves. They are in no mood to take lessons, moral or otherwise, from the west. In this context, the Shaikh case fits into a string of scratchy non-meetings of mind between China and the west over the last couple of months. First there has been the long-running issue of the under-valuation of the Chinese currency. The case for appreciation of the yuan is undeniable. Equally undeniable is that Beijing is going to do no such thing until its exports rise back to their pre-crisis levels. Even then it has large amount of excess capacity to keep employed, and tens of millions of workers to provide jobs for when the current infrastructure programme starts to come to an end in the second half of 2010. So, however well-founded the arguments put it by the treasury department in Washington or the European Central Bank, the leadership stands firm. Then we had the spectacle of Obama&apos;s visit to China, during which his &quot;town hall&quot; meeting in Shanghai was transmitted only by one local television station, and during which the Chinese arranged a programme for him that was heavy on tourism. Yes, it ended with a lengthy list of general agreements to co-operate and assurances that the basis was being laid for long-term relationship. But the beef was missing, and US briefings that the two sides had reached meaningful agreement on climate change were swiftly blown apart by the fiasco of Copenhagen. That conference showed just how western leaders are for understanding how China really works. The idea that, by crashing the meeting of major emerging economies, Obama could reach a last-minute deal with the Chinese prime minister to save the planet would have been laughable if it had not been tragic. Did the US president really think Wen Jiabao had any wriggle room to succumb to his charm and reason? Did he imagine that the prime minister would suddenly jettison 60 years of suspicion of the outside world to allow independent monitoring? Mark Lynas&apos;s much-remarked piece in the Guardian puts the blame squarely on Beijing, but takes no account of how the Chinese system actually operates, seemingly imagining it runs on western lines. The Chinese position would have been set out in advance and approved by the standing committee of the politburo. Wen could not deviate from that, even if he had been minded to do so. He may be prime minister but he ranks third in the standing committee and moves carefully. On such a crucial issue, he would be able to do absolutely nothing that might be seen as jeopardising the domestic economy; China accords importance to the environment but a good deal more to growth. In addition, several key Chinese leaders were out of Beijing at the time and this is a leadership that likes to have everybody in the room when decisions are made and doesn&apos;t believe in long-range teleconferences. So it is safe to assume that China was not in negotiating mode, and that, unless Beijing was being set up as the fall guy, Obama, Brown, Miliband et al should have know this, and negotiated accordingly. The same goes for the currency, human rights and, unfortunately for him, for Shaikh. It is also likely to be the case if trade disputes swell next year, as one must anticipate. That leads to an underlying element which, again, seems insufficiently appreciated by western governments. General Secretary Hu and Wen operate by consensus. They are careful bureaucrats who do not command an automatic majority in the nine-man standing committee. Gone are the days of Mao getting out of bed one afternoon and deciding on a major policy initiative or of Deng Xiaoping imposing himself on those who nominally held positions superior to him. That is, in a way, healthy, but it means inflexibility at the top. Hu and Wen have to deal with factions, lobbies and powerful state companies. For all the liberation of the goods market, the economy is still tightly controlled in key input areas, buttressing the power of entrenched interests. The Communist party knows it needs to reform itself but is terrified of the effect of doing so. All that is a recipe for caution. Not for the kind of reasoned flexibility and give-and-take which the west likes to make the basis for relationships between nations (however fallible this proves in practice). Repeating mantras about the need to revalue the yuan, respect human rights, join in independent monitoring or accept emission targets which would threaten the growth that provides the regime&apos;s prime legitimacy may be necessary for the west&apos;s own self-respect and defence of its own values.

Or will it be another production line of largely lacklustre sequels, enlivened by the odd moment of explosive genius? Time will tell - but if you don&apos;t have enough of that, Gamesblog is here to help. Over the last day of this year and the first of next, we&apos;ll be listing 50 promising titles due out in 2010, covering the obvious &apos;tent pole&apos; releases as well as some lesser-known treats hovering in the background.  With Greg and Jack away, these are all my choices, so this is an entirely subjective list, certain to boast several glaring omissions - but, of course, that&apos;s what the comments section is for... These are all retail releases, by the way - I&apos;ll be dealing with downloadable titles early in the New Year.  Part two is tomorrow...Again (Nintendo, Nintendo DS)This supernatural murder mystery probably won&apos;t be on many &apos;most anticipated&apos; lists, but anyone who&apos;s played developer Cing&apos;s other DS titles - Hotel Dusk and Trace Memory - will surely be ripping open their detective notebooks in anticipation. The action follows an FBI agent who can re-live past events - surely a useful trick when you&apos;re investigating a decades-old unsolved murder spree... The case opens in the UK in March. See the Tokyo Game Show teaser here. Alan Wake (Microsoft, Xbox 360)The psychological thriller for which the phrase &apos;long-awaited&apos; was invented is due in the second quarter of the year. Finnish studio, Remedy Entertainment (previously responsible for the Max Payne series), is promising a riveting mission-based adventure following the eponymous suspense fiction writer as he tracks his missing wife. Elements of Silent Hill, Lost, the X-Files and Stephen King&apos;s The Dark Half are all detectable, and we can apparently expect a TV season-style roll-out of subsequent titles. Aliens vs Predator (Sega, PC, PS3, X360)Eleven years after the release of Rebellion&apos;s excellent PC shooter of the same name, the Oxford-based company is back with more horror FPS action. This time the narrative plays out on the planet BG-386 where colonists have discovered an ancient pyramid teeming with... well, you can probably guess. Players are able to attempt the solo campaign as a marine, alien or predator, plus there are multiplayer options ahoy. APB (EA, PC)An immense open-world MMO, pitching two groups - the criminals and the enforcers - against each other for control of a vast city. Players are able to create absolutely unique avatars before choosing a side and diving into 100-player battles. The real-time branching mission structure and high degree of customisation (you can modify everything from vehicles to sound effects) mark this out as an incredible technical achievement, but it&apos;s the enthralling street fights that&apos;ll have gamers addicted. Think World of Warcraft re-imagined as a Michael Mann urban thriller for the YouTube generation. Alpha Protocol (Sega, PC, PS3, X360)The fact that this modern day espionage thriller has been ricocheting around the Sega release schedule like a molten squash ball might not fill you with confidence, but developer Obsidian Entertainment has solid credentials (Knights of the Old Republic II, Neverwinter Nights 2) and the set up, which sees highly customisable secret agent Michael Thorton traveling the globe extinguishing threats to national security, is promising. Now safely scheduled for a Spring 2010 launch, let&apos;s give it the benefit of the doubt. Army of Two: The 40th Day (EA, PS3, PSP, X360)The original divided critics and gamers alike with its formative co-operative shooting action. Due out on January 15, the follow-up sees &apos;private military contractors&apos;, Salem and Rios, blasting their way through Shanghai. The multiplayer element has supposedly been totally overhauled, featuring four new modes including &apos;extraction&apos; which pits groups of pals against waves of enemy fighters.  Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (EA, PC, PS3, X360)The first game was a delightful mix of sandbox environments, squad-based shooting and destructible scenery. The sequel, due out on March 5, ups the ante on all of those (apparently you&apos;ll be able to bring down whole buildings as your enemies cower inside), as well as adding a weapon customisation system resulting in 200 different firearms, and a bunch of new vehicles including the UH-60 transport helicopter, which can transport your whole unit into the heart of the battle. This is going to be FUN. Bayonetta (Sega, PS3, Xbox 360)Hitting the highstreet on January 8, the latest hyper-kinetic brawler from Hideki Kamiya (the genius behind Viewtiful Joe and Devil May Cry) is a breathless Gothic masterpiece, sporting the most important female lead character since Lara Croft and a combat mechanic so intuitive and enjoyable you&apos;ll instantly re-discover your love of Japanese hack-&apos;n&apos;-slash adventures. Perfect scores from Edge and influential Japanese videogame mag, Famitsu, have added to the pre-release frenzy. Bioshock 2 (2K Games, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)Set for a global release on February 9, this hotly anticipated sequel, set ten years after the original undersea adventure, has a hell of a lot to live up to. Placing the player into the heavyweight boots of the the original Big Daddy prototype is an interesting place to start, and the plot, revolving around a new controller of the doomed Rapture kingdom, promises some typically intriguing twists.      Blazblue: Calamity Trigger (pQube, PS3, Xbox 360)Best known for its hardcore fighting game series Guilty Gear, Arc System Works is back with another cultish 2D pummeler, this time set in a distant post-apocalyptic future. The combat system looks to be one of the most complex game mechanics conceived in this genre for many years, producing a beat-&apos;em-up of genuine depth. Released last summer in Japan and the US, it garnered enough praise to ensure a UK release (March 5) courtesy of lesser known publisher, pQube. Blur (Activision, PC, PS3, X360)On paper, Bizarre Creations&apos; urban racer, complete with superstrength power-ups, pick-up-and-play controls and 50 licensed vehicles doesn&apos;t sound that awe-inspiring. But this is the company behind Project Gotham and Metropolis Street Racer; these guys tweak their driving engines to the absolute limit and playtest til their eyes pop out, so we can expect a smooth, thrilling mix of Burnout and Mario Kart - and who wouldn&apos;t want to give that a whirl? There&apos;s also a clever social networking interface allowing you to build friendships and rivalries with other drivers around the world. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (Konami, PS3, Xbox 360)This cooperative project between Madrid&apos;s Mercury Steam and Kojima Productions is a big re-invention of the Gothic platforming adventure series, revolving around new hero Gabriel seeking to save his wife&apos;s soul - and the planet - from the evil Lords of Shadow. Fans fear that this is a mere hack-&apos;n&apos;-slasher and that Mercury Steam hardly has a glowing back catalogue (er... Clive Barker&apos;s Jericho, American McGee Presents: Scrapland...), but Kojima wouldn&apos;t put his name to any old franchise reboot would he? Crackdown 2 (Microsoft, Xbox 360)David Jones&apos; chaotic open-world shooter returns, this time in the hands of Dundee studio Ruffian Games. Pacific City has been overrun by mutant freaks and the Agency is back to restore order. The single-player campaign should be vast and absorbing, while the multiplayer component seeks to exhume the spirit of Timesplitters with its exuberant OTT violence, offbeat modes and comic book visuals. Crysis 2 (EA, PC, PS3, X360)Crytek has revealed next to nothing about the second title in its trilogy of sci-fi first-person shooters, save that it&apos;ll be using the cutting edge CryEngine 3 technology, and it&apos;s the developer&apos;s first console title. Originally earmarked for a 2011 release on the next generation of console platforms, things have thankfully been brought forward. Allegedly. Dante&apos;s Inferno (EA, PS3, PSP, Xbox 360)Arriving on a flaming chariot next month, EA&apos;s God of War-beater (my words, not theirs) has taken Dante&apos;s allegorical masterpiece and converted it into a sword-swirling horror adventure. With a narrative penned by Will Rokos, responsible for the Oscar Winning script to Monster&apos;s Ball (and man, would that make a bizarre videogame), it is hoped this will be more than just a medieval hack-&apos;em-up with a convenient &apos;nine circles of hell&apos; level structure. Darksiders: Wrath of War (THQ, PS3, Xbox 360)While Bayonetta is getting a lot of the attention, it won&apos;t be the only potential must-buy released on January 8. This enthralling action RPG from THQ&apos;s Vigil Games studio puts you into the cloak and clomping blood-stained boots of War, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, as he explores a post-Armageddon Earth. The game has rightly attracted a Metacritic score of 91 and may be an incredibly early contender for &apos;unexpected gem of 2010&apos;. Dead to Rights: Retribution (Namco Bandai, PS3, Xbox 360)Leamington-based developer Volatile Games has been working on this reboot of Namco&apos;s cop adventure for a couple of years now, and with the company&apos;s high-end BlitzTech engine running the show, expect state-of-the-art 3D visuals. As for the plot, vice-cop Jack Slate and his AI dog, Shadow, must bring down a criminal empire currently dragging the dysfunctional Grant City into the slime. Prepare for lots of guns, unarmed combat and dog bites.      Disney Epic Mickey (Disney, Wii)In an unexpected creative twist, Deus Ex creator Warren Spector (now heading his own Junction Point studio) is conjuring a dark platforming adventure around the eponymous rodent, chucking him into a Cartoon Wasteland ruled over by the sorcerer named Yen Sid. Players can alter the environment by spreading paint or destructive thinner around using the Wii Remote, and must make individual choices about whether to help other &apos;toons or carve their own way through the world. Officially announced in October and slated for an autumn 2010 release, this could be Mickey&apos;s most groundbreaking appearance since Steamboat Willie. Fable III (Microsoft, Xbox 360)Apparently due in &apos;late 2010&apos;, the next instalment in Lionhead&apos;s fantasy adventure series is set fifty years after the second title and challenges you to claim the whole kingdom of Albion as its ruler. Inspired by the story arcs of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Queen Elizabeth I it&apos;s all about revolution and the nature of monarchy. In other words, will you be a nice king or a naughty king? Or a bit of both? Final Fantasy XIII (Square Enix, PS3, X360)Shifting over one million copies within 24 hours on its Japanese release, the latest mega opus in the Final Fantasy series is a typically expansive mythological romp, this time with the floating world of Cocoon at its cavernous centre. A refreshed battle system allows multiple simultaneous attacks to be slotted in on each turn, while the new summon system lets characters combine their skills with those of their Eidolons to immensely destructive effect. Hardcore fans are concerned about the game&apos;s allegedly linear design, but FF XIII oozes atmosphere from every pixel. It&apos;s here on March 9th so adventurers can make their own minds up. Ghost Trick (Capcom, Nintendo DS)From the creator of the beloved Ace Attorney series comes another quirky mystery adventure, this time starring a ghost named Sissel who must use his supernatural powers to protect the innocent living while investigating the circumstances of his own death. Apparently, his key ability is to manipulate objects in the material world, which he uses to prevent the deaths of other characters - a sort of phantasmagorical logic puzzle, wrapped up in an adventure game. The visuals are lovely too. God of War III (Sony, PS3)The final instalment in the mightily successful mythological adventure sees Kratos returning just once more to wreak revenge on the gods and destroy Olympus. Boasts a massively overhauled graphics engine, new weapons, new combat mechanics and rideable giant creatures... Surely one of the key PS3 releases so far? Gran Turismo 5 (Sony, PS3)Oh, you know the drill: the world&apos;s finest race tracks, 1000 of the most beautiful cars, online racing, night racing, aesthetic and mechanical damage, bleeding edge physics and visuals... And it&apos;s definitely, definitely arriving in March. No really.  Halo: Reach (Microsoft, Xbox 360)Autumn will see the latest addition to the Halo mega-franchise, this time a prequel to the original title, apparently set at the fag end of the human-covenant war (specifically, the cataclysmic Battle of Reach). It&apos;s an FPS, of course, and the trailer hints that the game follows a squad of six Spartan supersoldiers, so a team co-op component is likely. Heavy Rain (Sony, PS3)From French studio Quantic Dream, previously responsible for groundbreaking adventure titles Omikron: the Nomad Soul and Fahrenheit this narrative-focused psychological thriller follows a group of disparate, damaged people as they hunt down a serial murderer known as the Origami Killer. With a dense, branching story structure and some intriguing control mechanics Heavy Rain is certainly going to be unlike any other title released in 2010 - make of that what you will...Part two tomorrow!", "tags": ["Technology", "Games", "Game culture", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "Nintendo", "Wii", "PC", "Games consoles"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-31T08:37:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/31/decade-in-sport-formula-one", "sentences": ["Added to which the characterless, standard F1-commissioned circuits issued to every new track \u2013 Shanghai, Bahrain, to name two \u2013 minimise overtaking and look boring."], "title": "THe decade in sport: Formula One in the noughties", "article": "How it changed for the better Judging by the past two years alone, Formula One has never been more competitive, with two seconds covering the entire grid, as opposed to five seconds a decade ago.

The sophisticated aerodynamics and technology - while also having positive effects - mean the cars cannot run in close company and braking distances are too short. Added to which the characterless, standard F1-commissioned circuits issued to every new track \u2013 Shanghai, Bahrain, to name two \u2013 minimise overtaking and look boring. Decade&apos;s top five 1 Ferrari The combination of Ross Brawn and Michael Schumacher and five championships in succession proved why F1 would be much poorer without the charismatic Italian team. 2 McLaren Bland but memorable for consistent excellence and the ability to overcome massive setbacks. 3 Renault Regrouped to become a powerful, colourful force capable of defeating Ferrari in the middle of the decade. 4 Williams Despite not winning a championship since 1997 or a race since 2004, remain a stalwart of stoutly British independence (or as near as you can get these days). 5 Brawn We will never see the like again, not because it was in existence for just one year but because of the remarkable achievement from bust to boom in 2009. Race of the decade Indianapolis 2005, when only six cars started the US grand prix after 14 withdrew at the last minute. A shocking example of how to insult the paying spectator by allowing political agendas to dominate. First public proof that Max Mosley couldn&apos;t give a stuff about the core values his presidency of the FIA was supposed to take care of. Most memorable moment Melbourne 2007 and on the first corner of the first grand prix Lewis Hamilton runs round the outside of former world champions 200 metres into his F1 debut. First exciting sign of a new megastar. 2020 vision Bernie Ecclestone will be 89 and unlikely to be in control \u2013 but you never know with this human dynamo. His absence, whenever it comes, will create a messy vacuum lasting at least a year as several people attempt to do the job of one man. A dictatorship in F1 had its advantages but the moment has passed. Ecclestone&apos;s departure will help F1 rid itself of the insular, unhelpful attitude that embraces making money at the expense of the people who really matter: the race fans.

This seems to be a lightning-in-a-bottle frame of mind: two interviews have been cancelled this week already \u2013 the first because the MC made a last-minute trip to a Manchester recording studio, the second owing to a last-minute flare-up with his new record label, Island, with whom the man Wiley has just signed a four-album deal. None of this will surprise anyone familiar with Wiley \u2013 born Richard Cowie \u2013 who will turn 31 in a few weeks. Since the\u00a0release of his debut album Treddin&apos; on\u00a0Thin Ice in 2004, he has gained a reputation among grime fans as the man who has shaped the sound of contemporary British urban music, but his musical reputation has been matched by one for unpredictability in his dealings, especially with the mainstream music industry. Wiley has left in his wake a trail of scrapped projects, spats with labels, rants on websites. As recently as November, in an ill-tempered interview with Time Out magazine, Wiley declared: &quot;This is my last ever interview \u2026 I don&apos;t want to talk to no one no more.&quot; Today, at least, he claims to have turned over a new leaf, constantly reiterating his intention to &quot;play the game&quot;; he is sincere and contrite about past incidents, though not wholly convincing. &quot;It was just mad stuff,&quot; he says. &quot;When you&apos;re meant to be\u00a0here on that day, or there on that day, but I might just be in the studio. Or in Manchester. Or in another country. It&apos;s just mad \u2013 what my brain said it wanted to do on that day. Like once, it said: I want to go to Jamaica. And then everyone&apos;s calling me, like where are you? And I&apos;m like, oh shit. I&apos;m in Jamaica and I don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll be\u00a0back.&quot; Of course, what Wiley&apos;s brain has told him to do has also often resulted in groundbreaking music. Not that his career makes any kind of linear sense; he has flirted with mainstream success, fallen back amid feuds, burnt bridges and made threats of retirement, returned to become the first grime MC to score a top three hit, and then spectacularly failed to capitalise on it \u2013 and yet has somehow managed to return with a major label deal. Take That, the lead single from his imminent fifth album, tentatively titled The Elusive, is a restatement of intent, reminding the world that Wiley should never be written off. Also slated for release is Never Be Your Woman, a sultry UK funky cut based around White Town&apos;s 1997 No 1 Your Woman and features Wiley adeptly playing the rogue to Emeli Sand\u00e9&apos;s sighing potential love interest: &quot;Sighted with another woman in Shoreditch \u2013 it&apos;s my house, I pay the mortgage,&quot; he snaps, cold as ice. Both tracks illustrate how adaptable and imaginative an artist Wiley can be \u2013 but he has always been a pioneer. The &quot;eski&quot; beat of his early days, in essence, invented grime; his stream of Tunnel Vision mixtapes helped sustain its underground creativity; and he was the first to see the potential of the four-to-the-floor electrohouse beat as a vehicle grime MCs could ride into the mainstream. 2008&apos;s summer anthem Wearing My Rolex provided the template his former proteges Dizzee Rascal and Tinchy Stryder would follow to mainstream pop stardom. Not that he has a negative word to say about either, despite a longstanding feud with Dizzee (one that, these days, seems to ride more on fumes and force of habit than any animosity). Indeed, Wiley says: &quot;I don&apos;t feel I mentored them; I feel they were with me and we shared energy,&quot; which is quite the volte face from a November interview in which he took the position that &quot;I am Tinchy Stryder \u2013 I literally am him.&quot; Reflecting on what the three have achieved, Wiley muses: &quot;Yeah, I&apos;m very, very proud. Can&apos;t wait for the day when we&apos;ve got a round table with 20 chairs round it and we can all sit on them.&quot; Should that ever be achieved, Wiley&apos;s journey will not have been without its missteps \u2013 some self-inflicted, some reflective of the conservatism of the music industry. Instead of building on the breakthrough success of Wearing My Rolex, he suffered a sequence of misfires. A Daft Punk-sampling follow-up, Summertime, flopped (with good reason); Wiley disowned his next single, the Mark Ronson-produced Cash in My Pocket. The subsequent album, See Clear Now, was released against the backdrop of its maker rampaging across internet forums and demanding to cut ties with his label. Now, Wiley says: &quot;It&apos;s an album I didn&apos;t want to make. I got forced \u2013 no, not forced \u2013 told to make it. Really, there was a lot I didn&apos;t like about it. The tracks were all thrown together \u2013 I was just told to vocal this beat, vocal that beat. I never really had much musical input in it, which burnt me inside. And I knew I had to get away from Asylum [his label at the time], otherwise I&apos;d have carried on having to do\u00a0what they were telling me to do. But now I&apos;ve learnt \u2013 it was a stepping stone, so I&apos;m happy I did it. I just wish it was a bit more me.&quot; However, 2008 also saw\u00a0Wiley self-release the unofficial album Grime Wave \u2013 a brilliant, fat-free work that perfectly showcased a lighter electro touch while retaining the essence of grime, and which went all but unnoticed. This, though, has been the way of Wiley&apos;s career: his back catalogue is littered with obscure gems, from the snaking, weaving Asian melodies of his early instrumental Shanghai (dubbed &quot;sinogrime&quot;) to this year&apos;s stark state-of-grime address Where&apos;s My Brother, to the gloriously catchy, propulsive comedy of manners If You&apos;re Going Out, I&apos;m Going Out Too \u2013 the perfect follow-up to Rolex that never was. &quot;When I do tracks, I do them. I do them, then I jump off them,&quot; Wiley says. &quot;I don&apos;t like to ponder them any more.&quot; Thinking about what Wiley&apos;s career could have been is frustrating: the breadth and depth of his talent is such that he could have been to British urban music this decade what Timbaland was to American urban music in the 1990s: an auteur-producer who could make stars out of singers and MCs merely by farming his beats out to them. &quot;Really, someone like me in America would be on the moon,&quot; he acknowledges. &quot;I do so much music I feel valuable, and sometimes people don&apos;t treat me valuable. There&apos;s a way that labels in England can use me so that we&apos;re all bubbling. But it&apos;ll take time to find that way. We have to respect that UK music industry \u2013 that&apos;s where we are \u2013 but we still need to kick a few doors down. &quot;One thing I think England needs to learn from America is \u2013 not copying them, not hoping we can be them, but looking at how they do things. For example, even in my current deal \u2013 I&apos;ll be releasing a single here, a single there. I know I can&apos;t do what I want to do just off that. So I&apos;ll suggest features \u2013 I&apos;ll go to the label and say, &apos;Island, I wanna be a bit bigger than this. I want to be on her single, and her single.&apos; That doesn&apos;t happen in England. And the Radio 1 playlist policy, where the structure is that you can&apos;t be on it more than once \u2013 that whole thing needs to be broken down.&quot; The big question, of course, is whether Wiley can stick to the script long enough to effect change himself. He is a father of two now, and optimistic: &quot;As you get older, you get calmer. I want to break the cycle of Wiley from the bad side. I&apos;ve got the energy and the know-how \u2013 I&apos;ve always had it. But the thing I most regret is not using it. Imagine when I was 21 years old, nine years ago \u2013 I had this in me. But there were times that I&apos;d piss about, walking out of deals and not getting along with industry people. I feel like if I&apos;d started at 21 and stayed to the script, I&apos;d be nine years in by now, and no one would be able to chat to me \u2013 I&apos;d be able to release what I want, have my own label, be millionaired up.&quot; For all his sincerity, it is hard to imagine Wiley, who says he gets his unpredictability from his mother (&quot;She&apos;s an irrational person!&quot;), sticking to the script. He has recently joined Twitter under the name @vneckjumper \u2013 not because it has any significance, but because his own name was taken, &quot;and there was someone on the TV wearing a V-neck jumper. I&apos;m not going to be bringing out a clothing line.&quot; One thing, though, has been decided: regardless of how his latest major-label deal pans out, Wiley has accepted he is never going to step away from making music. &quot;What keeps me making me music is the fact that it&apos;s the one gift I&apos;ve got \u2013 I have to accept that that&apos;s my gift,&quot; he explains. &quot;When you&apos;re growing up, there are all sorts of things you want to be, but one day comes the realisation that I am this. And this is what I have to do.&quot;", "tags": ["Wiley", "Dizzee Rascal", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Grime"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-31T21:35:00Z"}], "docs": 378}
