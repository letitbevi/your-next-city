Feeling delicate? It&apos;s okay - just sit down with a glass of orange juice and lemonade and gently peruse this second selection of promising games grappled from the 2010 release schedule (you can see part one here). I&apos;ve also included ten titles that sort of haven&apos;t actually been confirmed for this year, but might turn up anyway... And don&apos;t forget to correct/criticise my glaring omissions in the comments section! Agent (Rockstar, PS3)Oops, missed this out of yesterday&apos;s list, which was a huge oversight as Rockstar North&apos;s seventies conspiracy adventure may well be one of the key new IPs of the year (if it does indeed make it this year). We know absolutely nothing except that the development team has been influenced by the likes of The Conversation, Parallax View and All the President&apos;s Men, and that Take-Two CEO Ben Feder reckons it will be &quot;genre-defining&quot;. Lost in Shadow (Hudson, Wii)This idiosyncratic 2D-style platformer piqued the interest of many a jaded game journo at this year&apos;s E3. Players control a shadow boy who must navigate a Gothic tower by leaping between the shadows cast by scenic objects. On each screen, you&apos;re also able to control a fairy who re-directs light sources, thereby creating new paths and platforms. Vague comparisons are being made with Ico, so naturally there&apos;s a palpable sense of excitement around it. Here&apos;s a trailer. MAG (Sony, PS3)It&apos;s 2025 and private armies are engaging in a covert war to control the planet. Zipper Interactive&apos;s ambitious online shooter promises huge battles involving 256 players - but it&apos;s not a total free-for-all as sides are divided into squads, platoons and companies, all with commanding officers and mini-objectives. Combatants also earn experience points as they fight and apparently the leveling up system is one of the most exhaustive available. Could be PS3&apos;s multiplayer showcase for the year. Mass Effect 2 (EA, PC, Xbox 360)Commander Shepard is back on another suicidal space mission, filled with rounded-characters, narrative twists and exotic alien sex (well the odd interspecies snog, anyway). In December, Bioware co-founder Dr. Ray Muzyka told journalists that this could be the best game that his company has ever made - and he&apos;s one of those rare industry spokespeople who isn&apos;t prone to ridiculous over-statement. January 29 is the launch date. You might want to stick that in your diary. Medal of Honor (EA, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)In December, EA officially announced its reboot of the massively successful but recently over-shadowed WWII shooter series. However, this time (no doubt in a nod to Modern Warfare) the action takes place in the modern day - Afghanistan to be exact - with players controlling a Tier 1 Operator: a spec-ops soldier who takes on the missions no-one else can handle. Which is ironic, as the task of usurping Call of Duty at the head of the military FPS table would seem to be a similarly challenging. EA Los Angeles and EA DICE are working on the project together, though - a sign that the publisher is taking this battle very seriously indeed.       Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker (Konami, PSP)Set in 1974, at the end of the cold war, Peace Walker is the direct sequel to Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and features a new story penned by series creator Hideo Kojima. It&apos;s typical MGS fare with stealth, gadgets and mad plans for world domination. The exciting addition is a co-operative multiplayer mode (or &apos;CO-operative OPerationS&apos; as Konami would have it) in which participants can do stuff like create decoys while their pals are sneaking about. To say this is the mainstream bright spot on the PSP release schedule is something of an understatement. In my opinion. It&apos;s out on May 28. Metroid: Other M (Nintendo, Wii)Certain to claim prizes for the least exciting subtitle of the year, Other M was briefly showcased at E3 earlier this year, with Nintendo of America chief Reggie Fils-Aime suggesting that we can expect a more traditional Metroid experience from this combined 2D and 3D adventure. Set between between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion, it&apos;s being co-developed with Team Ninja, the chaps behind the awesome Ninja Gaiden. Wii owners looking for more meaty gaming experiences in 2010 should put this straight on their pre-order list. Modnation Racers (Sony, PS3)Given the same &apos;Play, Create and Share&apos; branding as LittleBigPlanet, this kart racer from Vancouver studio United Front Games allows players to customise every element of the experience from the characters and cars to the tracks themselves; creations can then be shared with the community and rated by other users. The look, inspired by urban vinyl art and the designer toy craze, has the edgy kawaii feel of LBP, while the handling and power-ups have drawn favourable comparisons with Mario Kart. It&apos;s due on the starting grid in spring 2010...No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle (Rising Star/Ubisoft, Wii)Anime-obsessed killer Travis Touchdown once again finds himself at the bottom of the international assassins&apos; league table and must wage war on his rivals to reclaim the top spot. The original hyper-stylised action fest earned multiple awards and its wonderfully weird and talented creator, Grasshopper Manufacture, is unlikely to fumble the ball this time round. Red Dead Redemption (Rockstar, PS3, Xbox 360)The Old West is dying, the Mexican civil war is brewing and one ex-outlaw named John Marston has a few loose ends to tie up amid the chaos. Rockstar San Diego&apos;s open-world Western is drumming up plenty of excitement, not least for its absolutely beautiful visuals. GTA meets The Wild Bunch? Yee-harr!      Split/Second (Disney, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)Built around a futuristic reality TV narrative, this turbo-charged racer features a &apos;powerplay&apos; dynamic which lets you set up scenic traps and obstacles for rival drivers: the higher your powerplay meter, the more extravagant and destructive your set-piece becomes. Voted Best Racing Game at the E3 Game Critics Awards last summer, it&apos;s an interesting hybrid, combining the feisty arcade-style urban driving action of Need for Speed et al, with the environmental destruction of a modern shooter.Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty (Activision Blizzard, Mac, PC)Blizzard returns to the epic space war between the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg races in this keenly anticipated sequel. It&apos;s the same intricately balanced real-time battle strategy gameplay we all remember, but now with slick 3D visuals, lots of new units and of course, myriad multiplayer modes. The developer&apos;s Battle.net matchmaking system is also being totally overhauled for the release, so expect seamless online integration. Even better news - this is apparently only the first part in a mammoth Starcraft II trilogy... Star Wars: The Old Republic (LucasArts, PC)Having already triumphed in the Star Wars universe with its much-loved Knights of the Old Republic, Bioware is returning with a hugely ambitious MMO, set thousands of years before the George Lucas movies. Expect a richly realised world (just check out the encyclopedic website) with a strong narrative element as players forge their own path between the Old Republic and the evil Sith Empire. Almost certain to be the game of the year for Jedi fanatics. Super Mario Galaxy 2 (Nintendo, Wii)The arrival of Yoshi as a rideable charcater is surely NOT the main addition to Nintendo&apos;s sequel - it&apos;s just that we&apos;ve not heard much else, and interest is fervid after the heartening brilliance of the original 3D platformer. It also seems that several classic enemies and gameplay elements will be returning from Mario&apos;s previous adventures... Super Street Fighter IV (Capcom, PS3, Xbox 360)Offering eight extra characters, an enhanced Ultra Combo system, extended online play (with Team Battle and Endless Battle modes), rebalanced gameplay and the return of the SF II car and barrel bonus stages, Super Street Fighter IV is more than just an add-on pack - which is why it&apos;s being delivered as a budget priced retail release rather than DLC. Among the fresh fighters are old faves T. Hawk, DeeJay, Guy, Cody and Adon, plus there&apos;s a brand new female fighter - Juri - the first in SF history to use Tae Kwon Do. Bet that&apos;s got you excited. Unconfirmed/possible/rumoured 2010 releases...      The Agency (Sony, PC, PS3)Sony Online Entertainment&apos;s promising MMO thrusts gamers into the murky world of modern day espionage. Like APB it&apos;s effectively a multiplayer shooter taking place in a persistent online world - players can drop in and start taking out other superspies and mercenaries at any point, and there are co-operative options, too. We&apos;re promised a bounty of weapons, gadgets and exotic locations, but what still remains top secret is the release date. 2010 is being apprehensively whispered, but considering the teething troubles that Home went through, we&apos;ll believe it when we spy it. Battlefield 3 (EA, PC)While Battlefield: Bad Company and Battlefield 1943 have introduced console gamers to the delights of DICE&apos;s multiplayer-centric military shooter, Battlefield 3 is the next major leap forward for the series on its home platform, the PC. Little has been confirmed about the game, apart from that it&apos;s in development. We want more intel! Dead Space 2 (EA, PC, PS3, X360)Announced in December this sequel to 2008&apos;s survival horror shooter will see everyman hero Isaac Clarke taking the fight to the Necromorphs as their infection spreads out across the galaxy. Expect new weapons of messy destruction and some big plot twists - though with no firm release date on the event horizon, you may need to wait til 2011... Far Cry 3 (Ubisoft, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)Narrative designer Patrick Redding confirmed at August&apos;s Game Convention that a new Far Cry title was in the &apos;preliminary stages&apos; of development and would probably retain the African setting of its predecessor (more here). As &apos;preliminary stages&apos; now effectively means &apos;the first year and a bit&apos; in development parlance, 2010 might be a bit optimistic... Gears of War 3 (Microsoft, Xbox 360)We know it&apos;s in development, but on what platforms? Epic Games president Mike Capps seemed to hint at the Tokyo Game Show that it might be one for the next generation of consoles, but swiftly denied this later. Meanwhile, series designer Cliff Bleszinski has implied that it may contain RPG elements. But with no official announcements Q4 2010 is looking rather fanciful. L.A. Noire (Rockstar, PS3, Xbox 360)As the title subtly suggests, this is a Film Noir-style open-world thriller, seeking to recreate the Los Angeles of the &apos;40s and &apos;50s. It&apos;s being developed by Team Bondi, a studio headed by Brendan McNamara, the creator of Sony&apos;s gangsta shooter, The Getaway, and centres on a detective investigating a series of gruesome murders. That&apos;s about all we know, despite first hearing about the game in 2006. Rockstar has promised to reveal more soon, but the release date has already proved more slippy and elusive than an underworld crime boss. The Last Guardian (Sony, PS3)The much-anticipated follow up to Ico and Shadow of the Colossus is another mystical take on the third-person action adventure. You control a small boy who befriends a giant feathered creature and apparently must stealthily rescue it from armed guards, before using its abilities to thwart unnamed enemies. It&apos;s all very vague, but of course, the game looks beautiful and contains the elements of sensitivity and companionship that we expect from designer, Fumito Ueda. Given Team Ico&apos;s perfectionist approach 2010 is a probably a longshot. Mirror&apos;s Edge 2 (EA, TBC)Back in June, EA bigwig Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that developer DICE had a small team working on this sequel to one of the most controversial releases of 2008. If the chaps can tame the original&apos;s quirky controls it&apos;s sure to generate the sort of unguarded excitement critics couldn&apos;t bring themselves to apply first time around. Resistance 3 (Sony, PS3)Not officially announced yet, but October saw an interesting teaser - a billboard on the set of forthcoming disaster movie Battle: Los Angeles. With such a prominent piece of product placement, the latest chapter in Insomniac Games&apos; alien invasion FPS series is likely to launch alongside the film, which isn&apos;t due until 2011. But you never know. WarioWare D.I.Y (Nintendo, DS)http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/uorj/index.htmlReleased in Japan in April, but still without an official UK launch date (though the US will get it in March), the latest title in Nintendo&apos;s frantic minigame series allows players to create their own micro-challenges, designing the graphics and sound effects before sharing their questionable masterpieces with other DS users. There&apos;s a brief excerpt from the E3 presentation here. And a few I wrote but didn&apos;t have space for in the Top 50... Just Cause 2 (Square Enix, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)The original sandbox-style shooter, set on a Caribbean island under the rule of a corrupt dictator, pulled in mixed reviews, but this sequel looks to be much improved by Swedish developer Avalanche Studios. Once again stepping into the shoes of deep cover CIA operative Rico Rodriguez, you must now take down a military regime on the island of Panau, using an array of weapons, over 100 vehicles and a vast selection of gadgets. The key USP is a grapple and parachute system that lets you tag a ride on passing aircraft - and the ability to take on missions in any order, from whatever direction you fancy, is extremely zeitgeist-friendly. You can grapple with it on March 26. Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days (Square Enix, PC, PS3, X360)Okay, the first title was a bit of a mess - but it was a mess with a decent premise and some fun moments. The sequel, billed as a &apos;raw and brutal crime shooter&apos; set in the Shanghai underworld, looks to iron out its predecessor&apos;s troublesome control issues and graphical wrinkles, intriguingly opting for a visual style that references gritty documentary films and user-generated content. So lots of grainy, degraded footage of people falling off skateboards? I suspect not. Splatterhouse (Namco Bandai, PS3, X360)Namco&apos;s cult 1988 gorefest was a fast-&apos;n&apos;-nasty sidescrolling homage to slasher flicks like Friday 13th. The remake takes the original&apos;s plot (student hunts for girlfriend in monster-filled mansion) and adds a fresh arsenal of makeshift weapons, new acrobatic abilities, a wider set of locations and, of course, luscious 3D visuals. The development process has been troubled - original studio BottleRocket Entertainment was taken off the project some way in, only to be replaced by an internal team - but you can&apos;t go that wrong with a game that allows you to rip creatures in half while wearing a skull mask. Splinter Cell: Conviction (Ubisoft, PC, Xbox 360)Originally slated for a winter 2007 release, the latest covert-ops adventure from Ubisoft is finally slipping into shops on February 26. This time, Sam Fisher finds he&apos;s been betrayed by the Third Echelon agency and must defeat a major terrorist threat alone, while investigating the suspicious death of his daughter. Two new gameplay features &apos;Mark and Execute&apos; and &apos;Last Known Position&apos; promise to bring some fresh tactical elements to shoot-out set-pieces, while a separate co-op campaign provides a prequel to the single-player missions. It&apos;ll certainly be interesting to see how Ubisoft&apos;s old hero fares in a post-Assassin&apos;s Creed world...", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "PlayStation", "Wii", "Xbox", "PC", "Games consoles"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-01T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jan/03/le-monde-edinburgh-hotel-review", "sentences": ["The reception is made to feel like a drawing room, with just one person on the desk, and along with my room key I was handed a ticket for a complimentary Bacardi cocktail and a VIP pass to the Shanghai nightclub in the basement."], "title": "Le Monde, Edinburgh | Hotel review", "article": "16 George Street, Edinburgh (0131 270 3900; lemondehotel.co.uk) FIRST IMPRESSIONS A black-suited, burly bouncer with an earpiece nodded a hello as I shook my umbrella and entered this converted Georgian townhouse on chi-chi George Street. The reception is made to feel like a drawing room, with just one person on the desk, and along with my room key I was handed a ticket for a complimentary Bacardi cocktail and a VIP pass to the Shanghai nightclub in the basement. Stylish and slightly eccentric, Le Monde offers three choices of bar \u2013 Milan, close to the entrance; the grander Vienna; and Paris, a cocktail bar on the first floor. Milan was buzzing with an early-evening crowd of Edinburgh&apos;s elite. Be sure to make a note of your room number, because you won&apos;t find it on your key and the Bacardi might go to your head. THE ROOMS The great Georgian high ceilings and careful styling make for the sort of bedrooms you really want to hang out in. There are 18 to choose from, each named after a city and decorated accordingly. I had a peek in a few, and particularly liked the bright turquoise walls in Cairo, and the mock Louis XIV furnishings in Paris \u2013 which is a favourite for courting couples and, bizarrely, hen nights. (Apparently the girls pile in and take full advantage of the in-room hair straighteners before heading downstairs to the club). This is definitely a special-occasion hotel, and we were celebrating our engagement in Tokyo, one of its junior suites. It&apos;s a dark, moody room, with black the prevailing colour. Its huge bathroom has a sunken tub \u2013 although I gave up on my second attempt to run a bath as the water was coming out yellow and the battery had run down in the remote control for the bathroom telly. Obviously nobody has had \u00a3195 to stump up for this room for some time. THE FOOD I loved it: it was healthy, aromatic and reasonably priced. As it was a Sunday night, we dined in Vienna. (We could also have eaten in Milan, but the more intimate Paris brasserie is open only on Friday and Saturday nights). Vienna serves bistro-type food (not just sauerkraut and sausage, I&apos;m glad to say) along with an innovative international tapas menu. The latter are keenly priced \u2013 &quot;any three for \u00a35&quot; \u2013 so you could have the very unlikely combination of Stornaway black pudding and chorizo, Thai green curry and mini haggis parcels. We shared a steamed cod from the main menu (\u00a311.95), which came with lemongrass butter and a very green salad of peas, sugar snaps, dill, chervil, chives, coriander and capers. They didn&apos;t bat an eyelid at us sharing, and simply suggested we might want to add a bowl of rosemary saut\u00e9ed potatoes, which made the dish big enough for two. Breakfast was less exciting \u2013 we felt we would have been better off paying the \u00a35 room service surcharge and enjoying our room a bit more before the 10.30am check-out, instead of going to the quiet and, in the early morning, soulless cafe. THE VERDICT Part of the appeal of this hotel is its bars, restaurants and nightclub (an intimate grown-up place with relaxed tunes), and its Sunday night deal is unbeatable \u2013 spend \u00a3120 between two on food and drink and you get a superior room for free. This lets you relax, have fun and use your room like a very posh friend&apos;s spare bedroom after a fabulous house party \u2013 although, given that the club is open until 3am, you could probably do with being allowed a lie-in. THE RATES Superior room from \u00a3135, executive room from \u00a3165, junior suite from \u00a3195, all including breakfast.", "tags": ["Edinburgh holidays", "Scotland holidays", "Hotels", "Restaurants", "Short breaks", "Weekend breaks", "City breaks", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-03T00:05:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/04/south-africa-england-day-two", "sentences": ["I suggest Stuart Wilson moves to Shanghai."], "title": "South Africa v England - day two as it happened | Rob Smyth and Andy Bull", "article": " Preamble Morning. New Year, same old England. Hang on, that&apos;s a good thing. It was noticeable that in, most of England&apos;s most famous series victories during the previous decade, they seemed to have only one (admittedly very effective) way to win a game, and if they start the Tens (that&apos;s a rubbish name, isn&apos;t it?) with a stunning triumph in South Africa, it will probably be along similar lines. In Sri Lanka in 2000-01 \u2013 still the greatest achievement of an England side in my cricket-watching lifetime, a nose ahead of the 2005 Ashes \u2013 they learned to stay in low-scoring games and then wheeze over the line in uncomfortably tight run-chases. In their breakthrough victory in the Caribbean in 2003-04 they won all three Tests with the ball in the third innings. In 2005 they put 400 on the board batting first and let scoreboard pressure and reverse-swing do the rest, just holding on until the finish line as  Shane Warn  Australia roared back. And in 2009 they won at Lord&apos;s and The Oval by effecting delirious Friday-afternoon collapses that decided otherwise even contests. In this series, they have almost accidentally stumbled across a matchwinning template: bowl first in favourable conditions, dismiss South Africa for around 350, bat with cold efficiency to take a big lead, and let South Africa&apos;s mental frailty do the rest. It worked at Durban and, with the perception that batting is at its easiest on days two and three in Cape Town, they have a significant chance to do the same again. South Africa resume on 279 for six this morning, with Jacques Kallis looking particularly ominous on 108. But if England can roll South Africa for no more than they got in Durban - 343 - and pick up a lead of around 100, they might just take an unassailable 2-0 lead. And, let&apos;s be honest, who would have predicted that while they were shambling around the Caribbean nine months ago? The two Andrews - like the two Ronnies only slightly funnier - are deserving of all the man-love you can spare.  Back at work? Me too. Sucks to be us, hah? Anyway, play will begin at 8.15am because of yesterday&apos;s early finish. Come on, look smart.  Idle pre-play thoughts 1. We&apos;ve had Botham&apos;s Ashes, McCague&apos;s Ashes and Flintoff&apos;s Ashes; will this series be catchily remembered as Swann&apos;s Basil D&apos;Oliveira Trophy? If not, and if it all goes down the swanny as of today, I&apos;d like to stress that there is no such thing as an OBO curse. 2. Umar Akmal, eh? Bloody hell. 3. Is this the best pop song of 2010? Yup. Yup it is. 4. Is it so wrong that the sound of Angry Anderson&apos;s Suddenly in Gavin &amp; Stacey brought about a wee nostalgic lump in the throat? Is that so wrong? Is that nostalgia gone mad? Is it really? 5. Jacques Kallis&apos;s first Test innings ended c Russell b Martin. c Russell b Martin! That makes me feel a lot older than my 21 years.  Prediction for the day South Africa 977. England 10-8.  Final pre-play ramble The new ball is only three overs old, so England really need to make this count because batting should be pretty easy with the old Kookaburra on a gorgeous sunny day in Cape Town. Despite their lead, England actually haven&apos;t bowled very well with the new ball so far in the series.  WICKET! South Africa 280-7 (Kallis c Prior b Onions 108) What a start! Onions&apos; second ball of the day, and his first to Kallis, is a gorgeous lifting leg-cutter that seams away sharply and takes the edge on the way through to Prior. That&apos;s a stunning delivery and an incredibly important wicket for England.  84th over: South Africa 280-7 (Steyn 26, Morkel 0) Onions knows how to start a day&apos;s play - remember day two at Edgbaston in the summer, when he nailed two Australians with the first two balls - and his first delivery to Morkel is a splendidly directed bouncer that whistles past Morkel&apos;s nose. &quot;It&apos;s going to be &apos;Teenies&apos; not &apos;Tens&apos;, surely?&quot; says Andrew Kocen. &quot;Horrible I know but inevitable and the sooner everyone gets used to it the better.&quot; The teenies? That doesn&apos;t sound at all weird, or deviant. Why don&apos;t we just call them the &apos;loitering with an intent I can&apos;t even be bothered to disguise outside sixth-form college with the sun-roof down and the sexx mix blaring out of the stereo which cost loads by the way&apos;?  WICKET! South Africa 280-8 (Steyn c Trott b Anderson 26) Now  Angry  Anderson strikes with his first ball! It was full, swinging away a touch, and Steyn snicked an attempted drive to fourth slip, where Trott took a smart two-handed catch to his left. That was lovely bowling from Anderson, the perfect length to a lower-order batsman early in the day, and good captaincy from Strauss too, who has first slip, second slip and then a gap to Trott at fourth.  WICKET! South Africa 281-9 (Morkel c Swann b Anderson 0) This is getting quite silly now. Three balls later Morkel fences at a length delivery that seams across him, and Swann at third slip takes a very fine low catch to his left. More fine bowling from Anderson, making them play where they don&apos;t want to. We&apos;ve had eight balls this morning and  Rob Smyth has  England have taken three wickets!  85th over: South Africa 281-9 (Harris 1, de Wet 0) de Wet has a windy woof at his first delivery and sends fresh air skimming to the boundary as the ball whistles through to Prior. &quot;Funny that you mention good old Digger Martin,&quot; says Stuart Wilson, laughing maniacally. &quot;As part of your (soon to be introduced and soon to be dropped) Where Are They Now feature the last sighting that I heard of him he was working behind the tills at Oddbins in Sandiway in Cheshire. His explanation was that he &apos;was looking to get in to wine&apos;, presumably in the same way that someone looking to get in to music would work at HMV. Good few years ago that though, so perhaps he is now running his own successful vineyard just outside Manchester.&quot; I liked Digger Martin. He was very unlucky to be dropped early in 1996 after bowling beautifully in South Africa the previous winter. In my local they still talk with misty eyes about his spell of 7-7-0-2 in the Port Elizabeth Test.  86th over: South Africa 291-9 (Harris 10, de Wet 0) Harris, backing away nervously after a couple of well-directed short ones, squeezes Onions through the slips for four. He then pushes three into the leg side before de Wet wears a short one on the back. In the commentary box, Nasser Hussain reckons the pitch has quickened up today. &quot;Morning Rob, morning everybody,&quot; chirps Lee Johnson. &quot;How do you do it? I thought your SA prediction of 977 was stupid but, in all honesty, it looks a serious threat now. That&apos;s another day down the swanny.&quot;  WICKET! South Africa 291 all out (de Wet LBW b Anderson 0) Jimmy Anderson claims a well-deserved five-for and concludes a stunning mini-session for England. de Wet groped around an inswinger and, although it was inevitably referred when Tony Hill gave him out LBW, Hawkeye had it striking the top of middle. No arguments there. That really was brilliant bowling from England, who took the final four wickets for just 12 runs in 17 deliveries. Anderson ends with five for 63, only his second five-for in overseas Tests, and England have an incredible opportunity to gain a series-winning first-innings lead. If they bat well. If, if, if.  INNINGS BREAK Anything resembling optimism does not sit at all comfortably where English cricket is concerned, but they have an unbelievable chance here. Batting conditions are very good indeed, once you see off the new ball. So, to summarise the above, England 122 all out. &quot;I&apos;m about to leave work in Beijing to tramp through a snow blizzard, and I better not find out you&apos;re taking the piss when I get home and tune in to TMS!!!&quot; says David Green, half ruining a decent email with excessive use of the ! things. If I was making it up, do you really think anyone other than MJ McCague would have taken all four wickets?  WICKET! England 2-1 (Strauss c Boucher b Morkel 2) Morne Morkel, as close to a nemesis as Andrew Strauss has, will open the bowling - and he&apos;s got him straight away! From the last ball of the over Strauss, driving very loosely outside off stump at the surprise fuller delivery, edged through to Boucher. That was a great piece of captaincy from Graeme Smith - not just to give Morkel the new ball, but to give him the first over so that he was bowling at Strauss immediately. In fact that&apos;s the first time in his Test career that Morkel has bowled the first over on home soil.  1st over: England 2-1 (Cook 0, Trott 0) The key, as Nasser Hussain has just said on Sky, is to leave the new ball wherever possible. That was a desperately poor stroke from Strauss, who swished his bat in frustration. But, well, we&apos;ll let him off after all he&apos;s done in the last year. &quot;Looking forward to a day of struggling with dubious internet feeds/persuading Belfast pubs to open up and show some cricket/lying about in bed with TMS and Rob Smyth,&quot; says Niall Harden.  2nd over: England 3-1 (Cook 1, Trott 0) Now this is interesting: it&apos;s de Wet rather than Steyn to take the new ball. The excellent Shaun Pollock says it&apos;s because Steyn doesn&apos;t always bowl well to left-handers. Cook gets off the mark with a single to fine leg, and Trott gets the bird as he prepares for his first delivery by doing 500 sit-ups. A decent first over from de Wet, who made the batsman play more often than not. &quot;I know women usually flee in terror when you enter the room - but Kallis and the SA tail?&quot; sniffs Neil Stork-Brett. &quot;Have your pheromones reached new levels in toxicity?&quot;  3rd over: England 5-1 (Cook 2, Trott 1) Trott gets the bird again as he prepares to face Morkel by swanning over to square leg and easing his way through War and Peace. Then he gets another break, when the first ball lifts nastily and rams into his elbow. That looked seriously painful. Morkel follows up with a fuller delivery that brings a biggish LBW shout. It was going over the top, but this is outstanding stuff from Morkel. He started this series as a good bowler, but he will end it as a very good and potentially great one. &quot;Following the cricket by OBO in a cab on the way from the airport on a business trip,&quot; says Olsin Commane. &quot;Googled &apos;Teenies&apos; on my phone to see if it has caught on. It threw up lots of hits but for some reason they are all banned here in Saudi.&quot;  4th over: England 12-1 (Cook 2, Trott 8) de Wet drags his first ball down - no point him bowling that length with the new ball - and Trott pulls authoritatively for four through midwicket. de Wet sorts his line out thereafter, and the game of chess continues: de Wet trying to make Trott play all the time, Trott leaving whenever possible. A good delivery turns Trott round as he aims to leg.  5th over: England 14-1 (Cook 2, Trott 10) Morkel is a serious handful. His average speed is just shy of 90mph, and almost everything lifts horribly towards the body. Batsmen (and, later, second slips) used to talk about the &apos;Harmison bruise&apos;, and you can bet a fair few England players will bear the mark of Morkel over the next few days. When he pitches fuller, Trott times a couple through midwicket. He has started very purposefully. The last ball keeps a fraction low but is well wide of off stump. &quot;Teenies could be an excellent name for decade,&quot; says Robert Gee, &quot;as it would give us the bermuda triangle of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The years that time forgot.&quot;  6th over: England 15-1 (Cook 3, Trott 10) Cook, who faced only five balls in the first five overs, is drawn towards a short one outside off stump from de Wet, but he jabs it down and it bounces well short of gully. That&apos;s about it for the over, another decent but relatively harmless one from de Wet, who hasn&apos;t really got the ball to move sideways as yet. No wickets for five overs? What kind of 20th-century Test cricket is this? &quot;Can you please tone down that Morkel fella?&quot; asks Mark Lawson.  7th over: England 20-1 (Cook 4, Trott 14) Morkel goes straight around the wicket to Cook, although Shaun Pollock makes the excellent point that Cook&apos;s judgement of what he can and can&apos;t leave is much dodgier when the ball is slanted across him. If he shoulders arms and loses all three stumps and his dignity next ball it&apos;s not my fault. Cook leaves a few and then tucks a single off his pads, before Trott drives the final ball of the over very confidently through the covers for four. He looks in very good order. &quot;Are we being very English in blaming the success on this tour on the Saffers choking?&quot; asks Rachel Clifton. &quot;I mean, I think we have actually bowled with some kind of plan and intelligence this series - it isn&apos;t all about the batsmen throwing their wickets away?&quot; You are forgetting the golden rule of English cricket: that all defeats are due to our ineptitude, and all victories due to the opposition&apos;s.  8th over: England 25-1 (Cook 9, Trott 14) I&apos;d get Steyn on here, as it&apos;s not quite happening for de Wet. When he drops one short and wide, Cook cuts him economically into the ground and over backward point for four. Good stroke, that. Well done. &quot;Morning Smythinho,&quot; says Chris Rose. &quot;It&apos;s OK to have a lump in your throat when hearing Angry Anderson&apos;s Suddenly; to anyone of our generation it&apos;s an anthem of hope &amp; love &amp; despair and stuff. It is, however, shameful to watch Gavin and Stacey. I only have one question for Corden &amp; Jones: Ou est le funny?&quot; Oh I was only watching because I heard a rumour on FaceTwitterBo that Angry Anderson would be making an appearance. Chris Rose  9th over: England 29-1 (Cook 13, Trott 14) Steyn does come on, but for Morkel, who I presume will switch ends. It&apos;s a decent enough first over, who plays what he has to, including an efficient tuck off the pads for four, and leaves the rest. There is still is little in the way of swing. &quot;I think your correspondent is being a little harsh on Digger Martin,&quot; says Paul King. &quot;My best mate used to work for Oddbins. They actually send their employees on all sorts of wine-training courses to learn about the business, even if they are just manning the tills. I managed to accompany him once to a huge wine-tasting fair at Olympia by pretending to be Oddbins staff \u2013 one of the greatest days of my life.&quot; That&apos;s one for the grandchildren: how one of the greatest days of your life was pretending to work in  a two-bit  an admittedly high-class off-licence chain. Actually Oddbins are quite classy; it&apos;s the only place I know that sells all three flavours of Liver Compromiser, also known as Chimay.  10th over: England 30-1 (Cook 13, Trott 15) It&apos;s de Wet to continue, which shows what I know (clue: it&apos;s the square root of eff all). Cook looks like a fully-functioning Test opener once again and repels another over via the medium of playing as few shots as possible. It&apos;s very sensible cricket. &quot;The whole front page of the Sydney Telegraph was dedicated to Punter today, noting the times of every wicket lost yesterday and the runs scored next to a picture of the Australian captain,&quot; says Kate. &quot;Global warming? Financial crisis? The Aussies take their cricket losses VERY seriously. I&apos;m starting to feel sorry for him. By the way I&apos;m in love with Stuart Broad!&quot; You and  me bot  plenty of others.  11th over: England 36-1 (Cook 14, Trott 20) Trott squeezes Steyn along the ground to third man for four and then slaps a back-cut that would have gone for four but for a fine diving stop from Prince, who saved three runs. At the risk of ruining absolutely everything, England look as comfortable as could be expected after the loss of such an important early wicket. If they don&apos;t get a lead of at least 100 they will want to kick themselves in a very special place. &quot;I came equipped with cans,&quot; says internet TV&apos;s James Richardson to my left. Just as a vision of foaming loveliness enters my head, he pulls out headphones. Little ones, too. iPod ones. They&apos;re not cans!  12th over: England 36-1 (Cook 14, Trott 20) Now Morkel does replace de Wet, but his around-the-wicket angle to Cook is yielding very little. This is a perfect situation for Cook to fully embrace his inner Tavare, and he is doing a fine job: he didn&apos;t have to play at a single delivery in that over and, with the exception of chasing a wide one off the sixth ball, nor did he. In other news, Sky have showed Paul Collingwood&apos;s dislocated finger. I hate stuff like that. It reminds me of how I used to think I was going to die every time I got a nose bleed at school. Mascu-what? &quot;Can we call 2010, 2011 and 2012 the pre-teens?&quot; says Chris O&apos;Connor. &quot;Does that sound so, so wrong?&quot;  WICKET! England 36-2 (Trott b Steyn 20) This is a really tame dismissal. It was shortish and wide outside off stump and Trott, trying to force through the off side with a crooked bat, dragged it back onto the stumps. It maybe came back a fraction but it was still a poor stroke. That&apos;s a shame as he was playing nicely and England had South Africa where they wanted them. Now they are one wicket away from being in a bit of a pickle.  WICKET! England 36-3 (Pietersen ct and b Steyn 0) Pietersen has gone second ball! He pushed nervously on the up at a fullish delivery and checked it back to the right of Steyn, who stuck out his right hand and held a very smart catch. A biut of an odd dismissal, that. I&apos;m not sure why he didn&apos;t control the stroke. Still, what an extraordinary morning this has been: the pitch is a belter and seven wickets have gone down for 48.  13th over: England 36-3 (Cook 14, Collingwood 0) Let&apos;s get this straight: the pitch is not a minefield at all. It has, for once, been all about England. They bowled beautifully this morning but have since played some very shoddy strokes. &quot;That was a collapse of England proportions and no mistake,&quot; says James Crowder, who was actually talking about South Africa. &quot;Do you think one of the Saffers insulted Andersons mother during the warm-up?&quot; Had they done so, that would have made him Angry Anderson. That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.  14th over: England 37-3 (Cook 15, Collingwood 0) Beefy points out that Morkel will try to jar Collingwood&apos;s injured finger by peppering him with short stuff. Quite right, too, and Collingwood would expect nothing else. For now he is able to duck under a couple of imperfect short balls. &quot;I&apos;m in Norwich, in a conference call to Beijing, and writing to you watching England in South Africa,&quot; says Thomas Abbott. &quot;Who can beat that level of connectedness?&quot; I know Kung Fu, which is a song by Ash, who come from Northern Ireland, who played Algeria in 1982 World Cup, who will play America in the 2010 World Cup, who have a player called Howard, who sort of shares a surname with Frankie Howerd, who was pretty funny, which I&apos;m not. Hang on, what game are we playing here?  15th over: England 46-3 (Cook 20, Collingwood 4) How quickly things can change. Two overs ago South Africa were really flat, looking down the barrel of an ignominious series defeat. Now the ground is full of anticipation, but Cook changes the mood a bit with a storming pull stroke through midwicket for four. Then, when Steyn strays onto the pads, Collingwood then gets off the mark with a businesslike crunch through square leg for four. &quot;Hope England can make it into the one hundred and teenies,&quot; writes Robert Gee on his Blackberry, outside a sixth-form college, with the roof down and the love sounds playing loud on his stereo, which has only been out three weeks in Japan, where&apos;s yours?  16th over: England 56-3 (Cook 21, Collingwood 13) Short and wide from Morkel and slapped disdainfully through the covers for four by Collingwood, who has been in brilliant touch all tour. He repeats the stroke later in the over, this time collecting three. He has 13 from eight balls, and this game is moving along at breakneck pace. I don&apos;t like that phrase. It makes me squeamish. &quot;I have a terrible feeling in my waters and it&apos;s not last night&apos;s sloe gin,&quot; says Niall Taylor. &quot;Oh, and you do know that your name is now going to be associated with &apos;pre-teens&apos; and &apos;one for the grandchildren&apos; when you auto-google? Just a thought.&quot; That sounds distinctly preferable to my name being associated with that Rob Smyth&apos;s writing.  17th over: England 56-3 (Cook 21, Collingwood 13) An inside edge negates what would have been a huge LBW shout from Steyn against Collingwood. Then Collingwood chips one just short of Amla at midwicket. It&apos;s a maiden, and Steyn has figures of 5-2-19-2. &quot;We lose wickets every time I get off the tube,&quot; says Kat Petersen. &quot;In the interest of the entire England cricket team, I am prepared to go round the Circle Line all day. Please call my boss and explain how important it is.&quot; I am going to do that if England get to the football World Cup final, although it&apos;ll be more in the interests of my own sanity.  18th over: England 57-3 (Cook 22, Collingwood 13) Kallis replaces Morkel. He bowls at around 80-82mph in that over, and swings a nice delivery away from Collingwood&apos;s tentative grope. &quot;Saffers have really raised the bar here,&quot; says Mark Hooper, &quot;but nice to see England aren&apos;t going to surrender their kings of the collapse title easily.&quot; It&apos;s the fourth day of a new decade and we&apos;re already into England-collapse territory. Happy Teenies!  19th over: England 58-3 (Cook 23, Collingwood 13) It&apos;s a double bowling change, with de Wet replacing Steyn. Collingwood jabs down on one that doesn&apos;t get up as much as he would have expected, and there is a definite sense that this pitch will be genuinely uneven on the final day, should the game go that far. Collingwood then gets in a bit of a tangle against a shortish delivery that jagged back into him. With that closed bat-face of his, he crunched it into the ground and back onto his pads. Eleven minutes to lunch. &quot;Clearance countdown begins,&quot; says former England seamer John Lewis. &quot;Shop now.\u200f&quot;  20th over: England 61-3 (Cook 26, Collingwood 13) Cook works Kallis into the leg side for two and then one. He&apos;s played very responsibly against the new ball, which, as his teammates have shown, is often easier said than done. &quot;If Colly or Cook get out (not unlikely),&quot; begins Neil Stewart, &quot;a chance for Bell to nail his spot once and for all, perhaps?&quot; I don&apos;t normally do this kind of thing, but: LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  21st over: England 64-3 (Cook 27, Collingwood 14) A couple of singles in that de Wet over, and we should have one more before the break. &quot;I hope Kat Petersen is aware that the Circle Line, as we knew and loved, is actually no more,&quot; says Sunil X. &quot;She&apos;ll likely be stuck in a shed in a siding near Olympia.&quot; If it helps Ian Ronald Bell make his first solo hundred, I won&apos;t mind if she ends up on a desert island with nothing other than food, water, and an MP3 player that defiantly refuses to play anything other than Angry Anderson&apos;s Suddenly.  22nd over: England 64-3 (Cook 27, Collingwood 14) Kallis has a muted LBW shout against Collingwood. It was a good delivery, homing in on the special place, but it was clearly going over. And that&apos;s the end of an unexpectedly lively session, in which seven wickets fell for 76 runs and this peculiarly see-sawing series continued to see and saw. Thanks for your emails. Andy Bull will be sharing the love after lunch; I&apos;ll leave you with Chris Fowler. &quot;A decade lasts ten years, from 1st January of the year numbered with a one at the end, to the end of the year with the zero at the end. No year has ever been designated as year zero AD or BC. Therefore, the first decade of this century ends at the end of this year, 2010, giving it 361 days yet to run. Please do not encourage the arithmetically challenged in their attempts to subvert elemental mathematics by insisting that decades begin with a non-existent year zero and end on the year ending in nine. Enough of the noughties, teenies, etc, until the end of the present year. Can&apos;t we establish an island of sanity on this point, at least, in OBO? Please?&quot;  LUNCH  Morning everyone. What a return to the OBO from that Bobby Smyth. Five wickets in five overs. I&apos;m settling in in anticipation of a long afternoon of grinding batting from Cook and Collingwood.  I seem to have caught the tailend of some pedantic debate about when exactly the decade ended, the last word on which can go to Dan Smith: &quot;Chris Fowler may feel pleased with his maths in his email regarding when decades start, but the logical conclusion of what he says is that Italia 90 was the best World Cup of the 80s.&quot; That, I believe, is checkmate, old bean.  Let me take a minute to tell you about the unexpected Christmas hit at the Bull household was the  Super Cricket Action Game, the best thing to happen in the world of table-top cricket simulations since, well, since ever really.  My inbox has become infested by a nest of pedants: &quot;Italia 90 was in the nineties,&quot; [well duh, thanks for that Peter Lucas] &quot;but it was in the eighth decade of the 20th century. Otherwise you&apos;d cheer a batsman for completing a century when he reaches 99.&quot;  Whatever next? A raging debate about whether it is acceptable to split infintives perhaps?  Back to the Super Action Cricket game, as the first Amazon reviewer says: &quot;An absolutely fantastic game you&apos;re guaranteed to be addicted within minutes even before you&apos;ve opened the box. The only really trouble with this game is I haven&apos;t yet let my son have a go!&quot;  And as Ronnie Irani will testify, Amazon reviewers never lie.  If you have a free moment, do follow that last link. I don&apos;t know whether Ronnie reads his own press, but I hope for his sake he doesn&apos;t. Actually, who am I kidding, the man has a skin as thick as rhinoceros hide. I think my favourite reader review of Irani&apos;s book No Boundaries is this one: &quot;Ronald Irani is a cricket leg end. He walked with a limp and rarely bothered to bowl. In the league of beer bellied English all rounders he was the thinnest of the lot. As a sometime opening batsman for his County he could be relied upon to give his team the lead by taking them to 0 for one in the first over. Unfortunately he thought he was playing for Lancashire when captaining Essex - a team he took from the brink of medicority to the depths of division 2. He is a folk zero. I think thats what they call him in Chelmsford.&quot;  The best email of the session has come disappointingly early in the afternoon. &quot;Who led the pedants&apos; revolt?&quot; asks John Gray. &quot;Which Tyler&quot;.  23rd over: England 68-3 (Cook 30, Collingwood 15) &quot;So, Pietersen has been out LBW playing around his front pad quite a bit in recent times,&quot; reflects Alan Synnott as Cook taps the first ball of the session away to leg for two runs, &quot;Do you think his dismissal here was a result of trying to tinker with his technique? Surely that ball would normally have been thrashed through midwicket. Instead, he tries to play it straight and pops a catch up to the bowler. I guess he is a work in progress. Any thoughts?&quot; No, I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s because he has been tinkering with his technique, it&apos;s more a case of the bowler figuring out how to attack him early in his innings, delivering the ball full and straight with, if possible, a touch of swing. It was a good piece of cricket by Steyn.  24th over: England 72-3 (Cook 30, Collingwood 19) Steyn&apos;s first ball of the session is full and straight, and Collingwood squeezes it past mid-off and away for four with a tidy drive. &quot;Try your hardest to never split the infinitive,&quot; emails Niall Taylor, &quot;Never use a preposition to end a sentence with. Avoid cliches like the plague. That the subjunctive be an outdated construction must be remembered.&quot; Did you get the Grauniad style guide for Christmas then Niall?  WICKET! Collingwood 19 LBW Morkel (25th over: England 73-4)  Oh dear. The match snaps back into life. Morkel darts a fuller ball back in towards Collinwood&apos;s pads. He was shaping to play it through the on side, but got his line ever-so-slightly wrong, and the ball cannoned into his back pad. He doesn&apos;t opt to refer it, but troops off the pitch, fully aware that it was as plumb as a dismissal can possibly be. Ian Bell is in then. Gulp. &quot;Has there ever been a player who strikes so much fear and trepidation into the hearts of his own team&apos;s supporters as I.R. Bell?&quot; asks Ian Copestake, &quot;He&apos;s like a reverse Bradman.&quot;  26th over: England 73-4 (Cook 31, Bell 0) Well what a fascinating Test of England&apos;s two fragile young batsmen this is going to be. Fail now, and the team are in a deep, deep hole. I&apos;m afraid that my tools are running treacle-slow at the moment, so if there&apos;s a bit of a lag between overs and updates, please bear with me. &quot;Super Action Cricket, it&apos;s just an updated version of the old school 80&apos;s classic that was Test match,&quot; says Neil Toolan, &quot;The only difference appears to be that the bowler now actually bowls rather sending a small ball bearing down a plastic ramp towards the batsman. It was a highly addictive game back in the day so no surprises the updated version is too. Plus, in what other game can Derek Pringle come in at Number 7 for England and score a double ton against the Aussies?&quot; Quite. You can even tinker with the stance and delivery of the little plastic bowler to vary the line and type of attack. Cook is leaving Steyn&apos;s bowling well alone here, playing out a maiden over.  27th over: England 73-4 (Cook 31, Bell 0) Bell faces Morkel, who seems to have decided to attack England&apos;s nervous young hero with a series of shorter balls, many of them angled in towards the ribs. Bell eases one of them out into the gully, and another away to square leg, playing with soft hands and a cool head. Another maiden.  28th over: England 74-4 (Cook 31, Bell 0) Cook plays across the line at a shorter ball from Steyn, but misjudges the shot and is thumped on the thigh. He and Bell scramble a leg bye, and Steyn promptly whistles a bouncer down past Bell&apos;s helmet by way of greeting. Rob Smyth has just come back from lunch, he had a very special look on his face as he came back to the desk and saw little Ian Bell squinting down the wicket above the scoreline &apos;England 74-4&apos;. His words were, in true Janice fashion, Oh. My. God.  29th over: England 78-4 (Cook 35, Bell 0) Morkel lures Cook into playing at a wider ball, which flies away through third man for four. Otherwise, his exercise in self-denial continues, and he either leaves or blocks the next five balls. &quot;So now Australia&apos;s 130-odd, scored on a grassy, seaming pitch, and the subject of much hilarity yesterday, looks quite respectable compared to England&apos;s current affort on a belter,&quot; points out Karla Taylor from Sydney, &quot;Still laughing Andy?&quot; Yup, pretty much. Heh heh heh. I notice the Aussies were 204 runs behind by stumps, yes?  30th over: England 82-4 (Cook 35, Bell 4) A lovely, confident shot from Bell, stepping out to meet the ball and driving four crisply through cover. &quot;Funny word, wicket,&quot; muses Alex Haslam, &quot;For approximately half a Test match, whenever I read it it causes me to leap up and punch the air with delight; for the other half, it causes me to slide glumly into my chair and rue another wasted opportunity. I wonder how many other words in the English language have such a polar effect on its readers?&quot;  31st over: England 82-4 (Cook 35, Bell 4) The first change of the afternoon brings de Wet into the attack, he&apos;s coming around the wicket to Cook, either firing the ball in towards off stump, or holding it out slightly wider. It makes no difference, Cook is beyond temptation. &quot;What&apos;s all this slagging off Ian Bell,&quot; says John Cameron in a pleasingly pleasant and reasonable opening line, before sadly descending into a slightly lunatic xenophobia: &quot;I&apos;d rather have him batting than that idiot South African batting at no.4. Isn&apos;t it time to say he&apos;s not worth his place?&quot; No. No it&apos;s not. Next!  32nd over: England 82-4 (Cook 35, Bell 4) Again Bell comes onto the front foot to force a drive out to cover. This time though he picks out the man. It is another maiden, the second in an over. &quot;In answer to Alex&apos;s question in the 30th over, I would suggest the words success or money,&quot; writes Stuart Wilson. &quot;When attributable to one&apos;s self they cause glee and contentment. When relating to friends or colleagues they just instil bitterness and ill concealed jealousy. I don&apos;t trust people who claim that they celebrate the achievements of their friend&apos;s as much as their own. I don&apos;t wish my friends failure, I just don&apos;t want them to do as well as me.&quot; Charming.  33rd over: England 85-4 (Cook 37, Bell 4) De Wet&apos;s line drifts too close to Cook&apos;s leg stump, and he sways over to the off to clip the ball away square to the leg side. &quot;0, 49, 69, 8, 32, 44, 40, 81, 31, 0&quot; writes Scott Collier, &quot;Is Kevin Pietersen the new Alastair Cook?&quot; Mmm. His last century was in Port-of-Spain back in the spring, but then the injury really disrupted his year. Smyth was musing earlier about what the long-term effect that losing the captaincy has had on his game. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure that the following words can have the same two effects as WICKET,&quot; writes Paul McMillan, &quot;Goal. Try. Touchdown. Pregnant.&quot;  34th over: England 86-4 (Cook 39, Bell 4) Jacques Kallis comes back into the attack. He too seems content to hold to a line on or outside Cook&apos;s offstump in the hope that he will do something rash. When Kallis does straighten up his line, Cook stands tall and pulls the ball to deep backward square for a single. &quot;Can I suggest while it is still relatively fresh in the memory the word(s) &apos;Christmas Party&apos;,&quot; writes Michael Hunt, &quot;For six months of the year its &quot;we&apos;re already planning the\u2026&quot;, &quot;Are you looking forward to the\u2026&quot;, &quot;Its going to be a huge\u2026&quot; and then it suddenly changes to six months of meetings starting with phrases like &apos;we need to speak about your behaviour at the\u2026&apos;&quot;  35th over: England 88-4 (Cook 41, Bell 4) De Wet, still around the wicket, continues to attack Cook&apos;s off stump. Cook pats all four balls back down the pitch, leaves alone another, and then knocks the sixth out to leg for two runs. England have scored only 22 runs in the 12 overs since lunch and yet this session has been absolutely enthralling. John Cameron would like to explain his remark of a few overs ago: &quot;Please forgive my xenophobia (first time I&apos;ve been called that!), but let me put it another way: I do wonder why certain batsmen are forever being pilloried, no matter how well they play (Cooke, Bell, Collingwood) whereas Pietersen seems to have a divine right to play however badly/foolishly he plays.&quot;  36th over: England 88-4 (Cook 41, Bell 4) &quot;A Chinese friend once told me &apos;happiness is when your neighbour is killed by a roof tile falling from his own house,&apos;&quot; writes Chris Bourne. I suggest Stuart Wilson moves to Shanghai. Meanwhile, Bell is coming from a superb match-winning knock and is facing an oldish ball on a good batting pitch with no time pressure. This is his moment. While nobody really wants to come in on 74-4, I can&apos;t think of a better opportunity to show off his particular skills and add to his comeback credentials.&quot; I second that the second bit, but the first? Is that an old Chinese proverb, or was your friend psychotic? Kallis toils on in the hot afternoon sun, sending down dot ball after dot ball, mixing full deliveries, short deliveries and length deliveries, all in a channel outside off stump.  37th over: England 91-4 (Cook 44, Bell 4) Paul Harris is into the attack for the first time today. I&apos;m afraid I missed most of the over because I accidentally locked myself in the vestibule outside the toilets, but I see Cook has collected three more runs, and England are now exactly 200 runs behind.  38th over: England 92-4 (Cook 45, Bell 4) Kallis continues at the other end. This is as weak as South Africa&apos;s attack is going to get, so England should look to up their run rate a little before the trio of quicks return to the attack. Which isn&apos;t to say that they should take undue risks, only that the runrate of 1.4 an over (which is what they&apos;ve been scoring at since Bell came to the crease) isn&apos;t going to ease the pressure much. &quot;John Cameron is right that two of the three players he lists get undeserved stick,&quot; agrees Ian Copestake, who seems to have gotten out of the right side of bed today, &quot;but the reasons are disturbingly simplistic: Cook is posh, Bell is short, Collingwood is ginger.&quot;  39th over: England 96-4 (Cook 49, Bell 4) Kallis pops off the pitch for a quick bit of treatment on his foot. He seems to having his toenails clipped by the physio. Cook drops to one knee and slog-sweeps four up and over square leg. A good shot, bizarrely accompanied by shouts of &quot;great ball Harris! Great ball!&quot; from the South Africans behind the stumps.  40th over: England 102-4 (Cook 50, Bell 9) After a painstaking run of 21 dot balls, Bell finally plays a shot. And what a good one it is too. He thumps a cover drive away for four through extra cover. That doubles his score and, moments later, a single puts Cook on strike. He flicks another run out to leg and that raises his fifty.  40th over: England 111-4 (Cook 59, Bell 10) My word. Cook does not seem to reckon Paul Harris much; he latches onto the first ball of his latest over and thrashes it through long-on for four. AB de Villiers leapt up to try and cut it off as it flew past, but he didn&apos;t get near. Two balls later, Cook swats four more through mid-wicket. He and Bell then exchange singles with a pair of dainty sweep shots. &quot;May I concur with Mr Cameron on the KP issue?&quot; asks Jonny Oxford [OK, Jonny in Oxford, but I really think the former works better] &quot;Shortly after KP&apos;s arrival on the scene, my cricket-watching friends were obliged to devise the Titometer as an indicator of Kevin&apos;s current performance status. On one end of the scale is the word &apos;showman&apos; and on the other the word &apos;tit&apos;. The arrow seems to be permanently set to one or the other with no half-way point possible. It currently sits on &apos;tit&apos; and has been there for some time.&quot;  41st over: England 114-4 (Cook 59, Bell 12) Bell pushes two runs out to leg in an otherwise quiet over from Kallis.  42nd over: England 115-4 (Cook 59, Bell 12) Harris is now coming around the wicket to Cook, a change of angle which doesn&apos;t stop him sweeping him away fine for one. &quot;We&apos;ve got TMS to blame for our current predicament;&quot; suggests Angus Saunders, &quot;after Bell&apos;s excellent knock last test Aggers suggested that what Bell really wanted was to come in at 74-4 and go on to save the day. Fate: she&apos;s a fickle [bad word] so don&apos;t tempt her.&quot;  43rd over: England 117-4 (Cook 60, Bell 12) Cook eases a single away square. Kallis then concedes a wide, to the great amusement of the Barmy Army. He too has decided to hammer Bell with a series of bouncers - South Africa have clearly decided that he is vulnerable to the short ball. He ducks underneath two, and sways away from another. He must have taken a hit somewhere in there though, because when the over is up he whips off his glove and widdles his finger before deciding to call on the physio for a little magic spray.  44th over: England 119-4 (Cook 61, Bell 12) Harris continues. As does Cook, who pushes a single away to long-on. &quot;Was my friend psychotic? (Over 36)&quot; ripostes Chris Bourne, &quot;Well, she was a sweet Chinese girl and claimed the force of the proverb was that if he&apos;s fated to die, it&apos;s a relief that he doesn&apos;t pop his clogs because you neglected your own roof. In cricketing terms this is surely a bit like changing your bowlers because the batsmen failed? Or perhaps dropping a batsman because of a couple of shocking decisions, but retaining one who consistently gets out in the 30s, flattering to deceive. Ravi Bopara deserves another chance, and I hope he gets one.&quot; The fine art of the segue there, demonstrated by Mr Bourne.  45th over: England 119-4 (Cook 61, Bell 12) Kallis has bust his gut with that barrage of short stuff, and Smith has summoned up Friedel de Wet for his third spell of the day. He has Bell playing and missing at a peach of an away-seamer. Bell stares intently at the pitch afterwards, seemingly trying to rebuke it for deceiving him. De Wet&apos;s first over is a maiden.  46th over: England 123-4 (Cook 64, Bell 15) &quot;Mel Brooks once said &apos;tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die&apos;,&quot; writes Richard Norris, &quot;I think he meant &apos;Tragedy is Alastair Cook. Comedy is Ian Bell&apos;.&quot; Gnomic. Cook and Bell swap two sets of singles off Harris, the last of which brings up the fifty partnership.  47th over: England 131-4 (Cook 64, Bell 23) After eight straight balls in this spell so far, De Wet finally offers a little width, and Bell duly cuts him for four behind point. He repeats the shot later in the over, only this time slicing the ball a little finer. Another lovely-looking shot. &quot;Just to note,&quot; pipes up Alan Vaughan, &quot;I think the original Confucius quote that Mr Bourne&apos;s friend referred to goes: &apos;there&apos;s no spectacle more pleasing than seeing an old friend fall from a roof.&apos; The Germans probably have a name for such things.&quot;  48th over: England 133-4 (Cook 65, Bell 24) The session is drawing to a close now, and Smith has opted to bring on JP Duminy to try and fiddle a wicket before Tea. And he almost does! Cook drops to sweep, but gets it all wrong and the ball loops up and over Amla at short leg. He scrambles back and dives to take the catch, but the ball lands six inches or so in front of his outstretched hands.  49th over: England 133-4 (Cook 65, Bell 24) The last over of the session will be bowled by de Wet. He forces Bell to sway away from a pair of bouncers, and then tries to tempt him with a series of four length balls outside off stump. Bell leaves them well alone, and that&apos;s that.  An interesting session. Only 69 runs were scored in it, but after the loss of Collingwood so early on in the fray, Cook and Bell batted well to play the afternoon out. Rob Smyth will be back here at 1.20pm or so to talk you through the final session. I&apos;ll be back tomorrow. Cheerio for now.  TEA  Evening. Or is it afternoon? I&apos;m never sure with these overseas Tests. It&apos;s bad enough barely knowing what day it is, but when you don&apos;t know what time it is either you really are in trouble. Anyway, for those of us who have never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever doubted Alastair Cook or Ian Bell, this has been a heartening day. When Paul Collingwood was dismissed just after lunch it looked like England&apos;s apparent transmogrification into a decent Test team was just another cock-and-bull story, but then we got a Cook-and-Bell story: a mature unbroken partnership of 60 in 25.3 overs. There is still much to do, with England trailing by 158, but they have played nicely so far. Much more of this and I will have to shelve my plans for a slapstick remake of the popular Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bell.  Baz Luhrmann reckons you should do one thing every day that scares you. For most of us that involves little more than looking in the mirror, or engaging in eye contact, but for Oli Broom it&apos;s something a little different. He is cycling to the Ashes over a 14-month period, a remarkable undertaking that speaks for itself. So please do give generously, as David Brent did.  Here&apos;s an email from my fellow OBOer, James Dart. &quot;Re: your reference of the &apos;Angry&apos; earlier today, I spotted last night that they&apos;d made their way to No79 in the singles chart on iTunes (quite the Sunday night in the Dart household, I&apos;m sure you&apos;d agree). In the spirit of all things RATM, surely it couldn&apos;t take much to nudge them into the top 10? Or would their be a better cricket-themed song that OBOers could suggest as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and stick it to 3OH3 (feat. Katy Perry) or some such garbage? Oh, and there definitely were more gags in Scott and Charlene&apos;s 1987 nuptials than that Gavin and Stacey shambles.&quot; It has to be Angry Anderson. That&apos;s astonishing that he has reached No79 already. Come on all of you: forget Oli Broom and all that charity stuff. 25,000 km? The Proclaimers could walk that! Spend every penny you have on a real cause: getting Angry Anderson to No1.  Here we go then. There are a maximum of 39 overs to come this evening, but I&apos;m sure the light will go at some stage. In other news, I&apos;ve just been given a funny look by the free coffee machine. So far, so normal, but as I processed said look I realised what had happened: I&apos;d been whistling bloody Suddenly by Angry Anderson. No good can come of this, you know.  WICKET! England 133-5 (Cook c Prince b Morkel 65) OH BUGGER. The excellent Morkel has struck with the fourth ball after tea. It wasn&apos;t a great shot from Cook, a kind of dainty flap-pull with one foot off the ground, and it was taken smartly by the diving Prince at square leg. Given how well Cook normally pulls, that was a peculiarly indeterminate stroke.  51st over: England 137-5 (Bell 24, Prior 4) Prior is beaten by his first ball and turned round by the second, which he edges low through the slips for four. This Morkel character gives me the sweats. &quot;It&apos;s now clear why South Africa had to make selectorial changes for this, the first match of a new decade,&quot; says Steve Banjo. &quot;One of their bowlers was considered very &apos;un-Teeny&apos; and had to go. Ha ha ha ha ha. Do I win a prize? Or at the very least a slide trombone?&quot; I love the fact that you had the confidence to put five &apos;ha&apos;s.  52nd over: England 149-5 (Bell 36, Prior 4) Brilliant batting from Ian Ronald Bell, who takes Steyn for three boundaries in four balls. The first was an impudent and classy steer wide of second slip, and the second and third were forced elegantly square on the off side. Can you force something elegantly? &quot;&apos;I&apos;ve just been given a funny look by the free coffee machine&apos;&quot; quotes Will Tucker. &quot;How paranoid are you that you perceive inanimate objects to be looking at you strangely?&quot; I&apos;ve been  drinking a lot of blea  watching a lot of Wonderfalls lately.  53rd over: England 151-5 (Bell 36, Prior 6) This, as Phil Neal liked to say, is a test. It&apos;s a test of England&apos;s counter-attacking lower-middle order. It&apos;s all well and good flogging it everywhere when you have the freedom of the damned or the ascendant, but do they have the courage and ability to do it when a Test and a series are in the balance? In a near identical match and series situation on this ground in 2001-02, Adam Gilchrist played the best counter-attacking innings I have ever seen. Prior has started positively, perhaps even skittishly. After being beaten by a Morkel lifter, he pushes a couple into the leg side. &quot;Chris from the basement has observed that Morkel the man with the Snorkel is not only deadly but by golly, he looks Australian,&quot; says Poppy McNee, who may or may not have had a liquid lunch. I really want to meet Chris from the basement. I imagine him to be a bit like that thing that lurks behind the Winkies in Mulholland Drive, only hairier and less articulate.  54th over: England 152-5 (Bell 37, Prior 6) Steyn has gone around the wicket (&quot;and call the ambulance&quot;, as Steve Kirby used to say) to Bell, with men at short leg and deep fine leg. Bell sensibly employs the Boycottian tactic of playing him from the other end, and then the scratchy Prior is beaten by a hot one that did him for pace. This game is wonderfully poised, with South Africa probably marginally in front. Is it so wrong that, in my head, I&apos;m already compiling a list of away series that England have lost after taking the lead? It&apos;ll never hurt like it did in the Caribbean in 1989-90. &quot;A wicket in the first over?&quot; sniffs Phil Sawyer. &quot;Can we have our Bull back please?&quot;  55th over: England 153-5 (Bell 38, Prior 6) Bell pulls his bat inside a very fine lifter from Morkel before tickling another to fine leg for a single. He has bowled beautifully in this series, and his figures today at 14-2-38-3. &quot;Rob - cycling to\u00a0Australia doesn&apos;t\u00a0scare me, but the bearded fellow who has been staring at me for the past hour from a smoky corner in an internet cafe in Yunak (thats right, pronounced eunuch) most certainly does,&quot; says Oli Broom. &quot;Maybe he&apos;s just waiting for an update on the cricket, although I doubt it.&quot; Maybe it&apos;s Chris from the basement, on the run and afraid of nothing except an Ian Bell century.  56th over: England 154-5 (Bell 39, Prior 6) Bell again gets off strike early in Steyn&apos;s over, pulling the first delivery for a single. Then Prior, fiddling outside off stump, is beaten by another paint-stripper from Steyn. He is hanging on a bit here. &quot;A better Angry Anderson for the English cricket team,&quot; says Evan Maloney. &quot;Can&apos;t be defeated, don&apos;t know the word.&quot; How English is that?&quot;  57th over: England 159-5 (Bell 40, Prior 10) Morkel&apos;s first delivery goes past the inside edge of Bell&apos;s slightly peculiar defensive stroke. This is a beautiful passage of Test cricket: ostensibly attritional, but utterly compelling. Bell and Prior, increasingly aware of how beautifully Morkel and Steyn are being extremely watchful, but when Morkel overpitches just a fraction Prior is able to jump out of his bunker and time a lovely boundary through mid-off. &quot;The gentleman on the right in the picture, is he actually urinating?&quot; wonders Michael Hunt. &quot;The left hand seems to be in a control position, with the knee-bend and slight backward lean of someone who is aiming for height and/or distance. The celebratory right arm suggests he is proud of his aim, possibly hitting the apparent ghost on the near boundary.&quot;  58th over: England 165-5 (Bell 45, Prior 11) Bell gets away with a hopelessly woolly drive at Steyn, the ball skimming in the air but a few yards wide of de Villiers in the gully before zipping away for four. The momentum continues to shift almost impercetibly.  59th over: England 165-5 (Bell 45, Prior 11) Prior edges Morkel just short of fourth slip, scuffs a pull into the ground and fresh-airs the mother of all windy woofs. There&apos;s no need for that, really, as this is the fifth over of Morkel&apos;s spell. Just see the beast off! That was so brainless from Prior as to be almost endearing. &quot;Having sent a tweet to Swanny following the second Test victory to advise him that he is now known by OBO followers as The Swannatron, he tweeted the world after day one of this match to say &apos;The Swannatron apologises for dropping a clanger this morning&apos;,&quot; says Ross Brooks.  60th over: England 167-5 (Bell 47, Prior 11) Steyn&apos;s first delivery follows Bell and slams right into his special place. Bell pulls a couple through midwicket later in the over, and England have - partly by accident, partly by design - almost seen off a very testing spell after tea from South Africa&apos;s best bowlers. &quot;Mr. Hunt needn&apos;t be so impressed by that bloke peeing far,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;There are at least two guys doing it non-handed, and as for that seated woman - she appears to have run out Ian Bell.&quot;  61st over: England 168-5 (Bell 47, Prior 12) Kallis replaces Morkel, whose Garnerish figures of 16-3-43-3 don&apos;t flatter him at all. Nothing happens, and that&apos;s drinks. &quot;I&apos;m following it, but I didn&apos;t actually like cricket, I&apos;m just keeping an eye on it for my old man, who&apos;s not allowed to look at the scores on his work computer,&quot; says Adam Timmins. &quot;We could have a discussion about WWE &amp; TNA going head head-to-head tonight if you like?&quot; WWE? TNA? Are they, like, fashiony or Gossip Girly acronyms? Is there going to be a catfight at the OK Corral?  62nd over: England 174-5 (Bell 48, Prior 17) Steyn&apos;s long spell - this is his sixth over - continues, and Prior flashes hard and high over the cordon for four. That was a false shot but a pretty safe one because he followed Mac Millings&apos; golden rule: if you&apos;re going to flash, flash hard. Six from the over. Meanwhile we&apos;ve had plenty of emails laughing at Australia. I bet you they win that game. I bet you 4p at least. &quot;I explained the Angry Anderson reference to my girlfriend but then wished I hadn&apos;t,&quot; says Daniel Seppings, &quot;as because she&apos;s Spanish and doesn&apos;t know of pre-2005 British culture, I then had to spend ages explaining Scott, Charlene, Neighbours, Stefan Dennis, Kylie being a soap actor and Susan Kennedy to her as well.&quot; You could just buy her the boxset. Imagine if they did Neighbours boxsets. I wouldn&apos;t leave the house in decades. And I bet I&apos;d cry when Clive Gibbons leaves. Again.  WICKET! England 174-6 (Bell c Duminy b Kallis 48) Ian. Ronald. Effing. Bell. This is a horrendous dismissal, absolutely appalling. It was short and wide from Kallis, a long hop really, and Bell slapped it straight to backward point. He knew immediately what he&apos;d done, leaning on his bat in disgust that his concentration had failed him yet again. He had played so well, but England are in real trouble now.  63rd over: England 178-6 (Prior 17, Broad 4) Kallis always finds a way to take wickets, doesn&apos;t he? Important ones too. He might have had another there, but Broad&apos;s edge scuttled to third man for four. Oh, England.  64th over: England 179-6 (Prior 19, Broad 4) Friedel de Wet replaces the excellent Steyn (16-5-55-2). Prior drives classily down the ground, but a diving stop from Morkel at mid-on turns four into one. &quot;Not sure all this Ian Bell bashing (as fun as it may be) is all that valid,&quot; says Jonathan Nimmo. &quot;On today&apos;s innings alone he at least managed to get to within sniffing difference of 50; had Strauss, Collingwood, Pieterson and Trott done the same as him we&apos;d be sitting pretty now!&quot; True, but in many ways it&apos;s more acceptable to get out in single figures than for 48, when you are in and set and theoretically have the measure of the pitch and the bowlers. It&apos;s true that all the England players have got themselves out today, but that was just such a Bellish dismissal. He should trademark it.  65th over: England 180-6 (Prior 20, Broad 4) England must also consider the fact that the new ball is due in 15 overs. They can&apos;t slog willy-nilly, but they need to eat a fair bit of this deficit before then. Prior pulls Kallis for a single, the only runs of another good over. &quot;The Bell wicket was up on OBO remarkably fast,&quot; says James Anderson. &quot;Did you by any chance have it pre-prepared for a cut and paste job?&quot; If you were going to do that, I suppose the words &quot;Ian. Ronald. Effing. Bell&quot; would be a decent place to start.  66th over: England 181-6 (Prior 20, Broad 4) de Wet continues, and Broad defends pretty solidly. &quot;I&apos;d like to say thanks to England for making booze-free January entirely easy,&quot; says Alex Netherton. &quot;Although most of the blame is with Wes Brown at the moment. \u00a0Or Nani.&quot; Geovanni.  67th over: England 183-6 (Prior 22, Broad 4) Graeme Smith goes to the spin of JP Duminy. Prior waves a flighted delivery through the covers for a couple in an otherwise good over. &quot;Your tears at Clive&apos;s departure from Neighbours are no match for my own unbelievable betrayal of my\u00a0masculinity - openly weeping in\u00a0front of my family after\u00a0Hobie&apos;s holiday girlfriend announced that she was dying in Baywatch,&quot; says Iain Gray. &quot;I still look back at that version of myself with a loathing I usually only reserve for England No6 batsmen.&quot; Even when they use a nightwatchman? That&apos;s harsh on Collingwood.  68th over: England 185-6 (Prior 23, Broad 5) Nothing is happening. Prior and Broad touch gloves to congratulate each other on wasting another over with the old ball. &quot;My dog was just sick on the floor,&quot; says Richard Cook.  69th over: England 188-6 (Prior 26, Broad 5) The cut-off time is 4pm, so we won&apos;t get all the overs in. Prior back-cuts Duminy for a couple. He sometimes gets in trouble with that stroke against the offspinner, as against Nathan Hauritz at Cardiff I think, but that was perfectly under control. &quot;There used to be a cartoon called I.M.Weasel, in which the main character was a weasel who was very smart and generally good at anything,&quot; says Jack Street. &quot;His nemesis (such as it was) was known as I.R.Baboon, who was naturally crap at anything and generally as thick as a whale omelette. Which is something I always think about when I hear the phrase &apos;I.R.Bell&apos; - particularly at this moment in time.&quot;\u00a0  70th over: England 193-6 (Prior 27, Broad 9) Paul Harris is going to replace Friedel de Wet (16-3-36-0). As much as anything, South Africa probably want to rush through these 10 overs so that they get a 20-minute spell with the new ball tonight. Prior, who has scarcely middled anything today, top-edges a sweep for a single, and then Broad thumps Harris over mid-on for four. Fine shot. England have seemed extremely confident against Harris since the first Test. It probably helps that their coach played spin as well as anybody in his day. &quot;How about we just let the Shermanator Hug It All Out?&quot; says Rob Lee-Davey. &quot;I had invested high hopes that this was going to be his career-defining innings (I suppose in many ways it was) and do not have sufficient emotional energy left to be angry at him. I cannot believe Bopara would have been able to contribute anywhere near as much, so would appeal to all OBO-ers to give Ian Ronald one more chance. Please?&quot;  71st over: England 197-6 (Prior 30, Broad 10) Duminy switches around the wicket to Prior, who pings him through extra-cover for a couple. England are milking the spinners pretty well now, with Broad premeditating a lapped single to fine leg. Four from the over. Emails please!  72nd over: England 203-6 (Prior 35, Broad 10) Broad escapes a referral for LBW by Harris. It was a slightly odd one, because it was a relatively muted shout in the first place from the bowler - not even that in fact - and given not out, but after a long discussion Graeme Smith called for the review. Hawkeye had it skimming the top of leg stump, so that means the original decision stands. For a few seconds it looked like we were going to have a Daryl Harper Farce (TM), but eventually he signalled not out again. Prior then sweeps fine for four, although that was slightly odd as well: Harris went up for the LBW, Harper gave leg-byes, but then Prior pointed at his bat and Harper changed it to four runs.  73rd over: England 208-6 (Prior 36, Broad 15) South Africa get a bit excited when Prior almost helps Duminy to the diving Amla at short leg, but it was only off the pad. Broad then makes room to carve a boundary to third man. These are good runs for England and I&apos;m not sure Graeme Smith has got his tactics right by bowling the two spinners. &quot;Duminy is not that good a bowler in my opinion,&quot; says Bumble, who once reportedly said &quot;if Nathan Astle is a better bowler than Graham Thorpe, my backside&apos;s a fire engine&quot;. International wickets: Astle 154-2 Thorpe. Call 999-BUMBLE.  74th over: England 209-6 (Prior 37, Broad 15) Smith goes back to seam, which is sensible I think, in the shape of Jacques Kallis. He&apos;s at half ratpower, below 80mph, but he keeps England down to a single, which is why he was brought back on. Admirable stuff. Is it me or is the cricket world finally learning to love Kallis, or at the very least no longer ashamed to admit an admiration for him in polite society. &quot;Today is my first day back at work after Christmas,&quot; announces Elliot Carr-Barnsley. &quot;So ineffective have I been that I have only just realised my coat has been covering my phone since I got in this morning. I only noticed this not because it rang or because I needed to ring anyone, but because I wanted to put my coat on to go and buy a can of dr pepper. Thank goodness I don&apos;t have a deadli\u2026. Oh.&quot; And so ineffective that you couldn&apos;t even be bothered to capitalise Dr Pepper. Show some respect.  75th over: England 213-6 (Prior 39, Broad 17) England milk Harris with something resembling disdain. Four from the over. &quot;Watching the Test in snowy Edinburgh, in a pub playing the world&apos;s worst music, trying to explain to bored scotsman who&apos;s with me that we&apos;re witnessing a tense standoff,&quot; says Dan Boynton. &quot;He doesn&apos;t seem convinced.&quot; If he&apos;s the sort of gentleman who frequents Edinburgh pubs on a Monday afternoon, I suspect it&apos;s the concept of a standoff that he&apos;s struggling to understand rather than the cricket. Just don&apos;t open a packet of crisps when he&apos;s on the black.  76th over: England 217-6 (Prior 39, Broad 21) Broad laces Kallis&apos;s first ball through extra-cover for four, a fantastic and unexpected stroke. As Barney Ronay to my left points out, that was probably the shot of the day, even if that is something of a taller-than-Danny-Devito competition. Kallis responds with a very good short ball that smacks into the side of Broad&apos;s arm. &quot;Harris&apos;s shirt sleeves,&quot; says OBO fashionista Laurence Boyd. &quot;Discuss.&quot; What&apos;s wrong with them? I&apos;ve only been paying attention to bat and ball, consumate pro that I am.  77th over: England 221-6 (Prior 42, Broad 22) We&apos;re into the extra half-hour, and Morne Morkel is revving up for one last burst. Prior, whose bat still doesn&apos;t really seem to have a middle, chokes a drive for a single and later scampers a tight two to fine leg. He would have been out with a direct hit. The Barmy Army, doubtless fortified by plenty of plastic cups of Liquid Fun, are making a bit of a noise. Four from the over. &quot;My two cats reacted quite differently to the situation caused by Mr Bell&apos;s inevitable downfall,&quot; says Mark Allen. &quot;An agonised miaow of desperation from one, whilst the other just scratched himself nonchalantly.\u00a0 In spite of their combined expression of the mixed feelings of the England fan (exasperation of hopes dashed/nonchalance due to inevitability), they&apos;re not getting any more food until Prior slaps one for six to get fifty.&quot; I&apos;ll call the RSPCA now.  WICKET! England 225-7 (Broad b Steyn 24) Dale Steyn returns to the attack and zips a cracking delivery through Broad and onto the top of middle stump. It came back a touch, but more than anything Broad was beaten for pace. That&apos;s a real bonus for South Africa ahead of the second new ball. It sounds daft, but I think England should send out a nightwatchman for their No9 here.  78th over: England 225-7 (Prior 43, Swann 0) That was the final ball of the over. A few of you have emailed in to say that Geoff Boycott has just given out his private email address on TMS! What the hell is that about? &quot;Am I allowed to extol the virtues of Michael Vaughan summarising on TMS?&quot; says Chris Hyde. &quot;Not only is he a particularly good addition to the team, his prediction of the shots players are about to make is awesome. In Centurion, he was reading KP like a book, and was doing the same with Bell in Durban. Given the way he sees what is going on on the pitch makes you think that his captaincy was as much to do with England&apos;s ascendancy in the cricket world as the fact we suddenly had an exceptional cohort of players (which helped, obviously!).&quot; It&apos;s a fair point. I listened to most of the last Test and he was very good indeed. It&apos;s also interesting how many observations were based on instinct, which was always a big part of his captaincy. The England captains of the last 15 years have almost all turned into exceptional commentators.  79th over: England 228-7 (Prior 44, Swann 1) Swann reins in his attacking instincts against Morkel, probably the right thing to do with 15 minutes left. &quot;Nothing good ever comes from being called &apos;Ronald&apos;,&quot; says Leigh Marles. &quot;McDonald, Reagan, Biggs, need I continue?&quot; Burgundy? Inho? Sorry.  80th over: England 229-7 (Prior 44, Swann 2) Swann crunches a full-toss from Steyn into the leg side for a single, the highlight of an over that I&apos;ve already forgotten. &quot;Boycott was very irate about Tony Greig&apos;s sister asking for two &apos;courtesy shots&apos; to be granted to ladies on the golf course,&quot; says Will Horwood. &quot;Someone decided to email TMS with a passage from the rules of golf which proved Boycott right, at which he started whooping and cheering insanely, and interrupted Agnew trying to describe a delivery from Morkel to give out his personal email address for this email to be sent to.&quot; I wouldn&apos;t fancy being that server tonight with the  abuse  insightful emails he&apos;s going to receive.\u00a0  81st over: England 236-7 (Prior 48, Swann 5) Morkel doesn&apos;t take the new ball straight away, which is a big surprise, and Swann drives the old one through mid-off for three. That prompts Morkel to trade it in for a newer model, and Prior pulls it emphatically in front of square for four. That&apos;s the best stroke of his innings. Two overs to go.  82nd over: England 241-7 (Prior 52, Swann 5) From the penultimate ball of the day, Prior reaches his half-century with a cover-drive for two off Steyn. It&apos;s been a very fine innings precisely because he hasn&apos;t been in good nick, and has shown the sort of gumption that hasn&apos;t always been evident in the past. Well played indeed. So England close on 241 for seven, a deficit of 50. It&apos;s been a really good day of Test cricket, with the initiative switching this way and that. Morkel and Steyn bowled superbly for South Africa, taking three wickets, while Alastair Cook and Ian Bell played with excellent discpline before giving their wickets away. I&apos;d say South Africa are fractionally ahead, and it&apos;s set fair for a cracking day tomorrow - the most important of the series, at least until the day after tomorrow. Andy Bull is on the early shift, so join him from 8am. Cheers for your emails.

The government pledged to clean up the dairy industry in autumn 2008, when 300,000 babies were taken ill and six died after drinking melamine-tainted Sanlu-brand infant formula. The issue reared its head again last week when food safety authorities in Shanghai announced they had shut down the Shanghai Panda company after discovering it was producing condensed milk and milk powder laced with the same chemical. The China Daily newspaper suggested today that officials began investigating the company as early as February last year. Chinese press said Shanghai Panda was among more than 20 dairy firms found to have melamine in their products during the Sanlu scandal, but was allowed to resume production after promising to improve product safety. But China Daily reported claims that problems surfaced again in December 2008 and officials began investigating two months later, citing documents from prosecutors in Fengxian district, Shanghai. The firm&apos;s board chairman, general manager and deputy general manager have been arrested. &quot;The case was not allowed to be released to the public,&quot; Shen Weiping, of the prosecutors&apos; office, told the newspaper. &quot;The three executives will be prosecuted in a week for producing and selling fake or substandard products.&quot; Yan Fengmin, of the general administration of quality supervision, inspection and quarantine, told the newspaper that the case was withheld because it was under criminal investigation by police. He said both the administration and the Shanghai government were informed immediately after the case was found, and all harmful products were seized. It is not clear when officials began recalling them. Wang Dingmian, former director of the Dairy Association of China, told the Global Times newspaper that he believed the problem was linked to the earlier scandal. &quot;Some local governments didn&apos;t destroy [tainted products] completely. Some producers recycled and sold them again illegally,&quot; he alleged. Yan denied that such materials were involved in the new case, saying local governments had overseen the destruction of all recalled products. Melamine, used in the production of plastics and fertilisers, gives the illusion of higher protein levels in nutrient tests.

Lapdog Of The Bourgeoisie is a cultural whodunit interplay of significant characters such as The Museum Director, Collectors A &amp; B, The Art Collective and one key protagonist simply named Liam. Mirrored Image: A Volvo Bar draws on Birmingham&apos;s faltering history of car manufacturing. Eastside Projects, to 23 Jan Robert Clark Zhang Enli, London Painter Zhang Enli is an anomaly in contemporary Chinese art. Where the work of his peers tends to ka-ching with politicised pop culture kitsch, his is rooted in commonplace things. Enli moved from the provinces to Shanghai 20 years ago, and was both impressed and alienated by the modern metropolis. His response to the change sweeping old China into an industrial capitalist future is quiet and introspective. As his first London show demonstrates, Enli is adept at using simple subjects to make big statements about memory, time and transition. Cardboard boxes, plug sockets or a lightbulb are rendered in fugitive washes of paint. Drips often run down the canvas like the present trickling away into the past. Hauser &amp; Wirth, W1, Fri to 27 Feb Skye Sherwin Think Tank, Sunderland Taking its impetus from an observation perhaps most topically elucidated by Alain de Botton \u2013 &quot;2009 will be the year when questions of how society should be arranged will cease to be an idle, abstract topic and will enter the mainstream with a vengeance. Everyone will become a political philosopher&quot; \u2013 this exhibition presents collaborations between some of Britain&apos;s social policy thinktanks and leading designers. So the refreshing inventiveness of AOC Architecture is used to picture the Fabian Society&apos;s proposal that we all live more communally. Digital graphic designers Airside embody the DEMOS group&apos;s questioning of how new technologies change the balance of individual and institutional power. Northern Gallery For Contemporary Art, to 13 Feb Robert Clark For The Blind Man In The Dark Room Looking For The Black Cat That Isn&apos;t There, London Confusion might seem a risky topic for a contemporary art show, yet curator Anthony Huberman&apos;s presentation of work by over 20 artists who dabble in disorder is more in a spirit of lively curiosity than frustrating incomprehension. Matt Mullican&apos;s vast wall drawing tries to express all the thoughts pinging around his brain, while Swiss pranksters Fischli and Weiss (work pictured) attempt to eff the ineffable while dressed in bear and rat costumes on a country hike. With references stretching from Socrates to Darwin, it&apos;s a nimble investigation of the beauty of unknowing. ICA, SW1, to 31 Jan Skye Sherwin Objects Of Contemplation, Leeds A small and extraordinary display of Chinese &quot;natural sculptures&quot; or &quot;scholar&apos;s rocks&quot; from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The presentation of these naturally occurring gnarled stones on immaculately staged and exquisitely carved wooden stands is something akin to the modern art tradition of &quot;objets trouv\u00e9s&quot;. After all, if early 20th-century westerners could greet Marcel Duchamp&apos;s infamous urinal with something approaching theoretical awe, the phenomenon of gazing in aesthetic adoration at a curiously shaped lump of rock seems reasonable. In our age of global ecological anxiety, these outcrops and fungal growths might well be culturally treasured as icons of natural belonging. Henry Moore Institute, to 7 Mar Robert Clark Space Invaders, Liverpool FACT, or the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology, continues to flourish with a programme of digitally enabled installations that are always fun, and even at times entertaining, as well as being often emotionally engaging and perceptually almost mind-blowing. So it was to be expected that the gallery would eventually host this exciting show of computer game artistry. We get commercially available virtual reality games such as the high definition &quot;zen&quot; game of Flower as well as an &quot;augmented reality&quot; piece by artist-gamers Blast Theory that is activated by &quot;real world&quot; bicycles. Similarly incongruous machinations are involved in Yuichiro Katsumoto&apos;s samurai game wielding real umbrellas and Riley Harmon&apos;s shoot-&apos;em-up game that bleeds &quot;real&quot; fake blood down the gallery wall. And, intriguingly, video art mystic Bill Viola contributes a predictably slow-moving game whose winning target is some kind of virtual spiritual enlightenment. FACT, to 21 Feb Robert Clark Tris Vonna-Michell, Southend-on-Sea As dizzying and elusive as a Tris Vonna-Michell performance is, they have an energy that&apos;s hard to forget. Pitched somewhere between concrete poetry and an emcee&apos;s patter, his tall tales are backed up by his own photographs and field recordings, and mesh the personal, and often improbable, with wider questions of place and our shifting understanding of the past. In the last couple of years, he&apos;s breathlessly related secret histories of destinations as far-flung as Detroit, Japan and Berlin to audiences all over the world and is now back for an exhibition in his hometown. Exploring his early memories and change in the area, his photos and performance address local landmarks, childhood haunts and family journeys. Focal Point Gallery, Mon to 20 Mar Skye Sherwin Damien Roach, London Damien Roach has developed some ingenious methods to get us thinking differently. Questioning how we interpret the world, an early collage of seaside postcards, lain out like a game of dominoes, literally turned the landscape upside down, and a simple garden trellis sporadically fitted with mirrors seemed to splinter the room into diamond shaped fragments. While the effect is potent, Roach&apos;s lightness of touch is remarkable. For his first London exhibition since 2007, the young artist is ensuring you never get the same experience twice by a rotating selection of works \u2013 including collage, films, sculpture and painting made from Kool-Aid, LSD and potassium cyanide \u2013 within a distorting environment of coloured light and two-way mirrors. A series of events kicks off with an opening night music session followed up by radio broadcasts, talks and performances.

But organisers insist the contest to be held this Friday is a serious business. It is China&apos;s first gay pageant. The event is a striking sign of how far attitudes in China have changed and of gay people&apos;s increasing confidence. Gay sex was illegal until 1997. Homosexuality was classed as a mental illness for four years after that. Now an emerging gay community is busting stereotypes. &quot;We are intelligent, we&apos;re professionals, we&apos;re gorgeous \u2013 and we&apos;re gay,&quot; said contestant Emilio Liu, from Inner Mongolia. &quot;I want the audience to know there are a whole bunch of people like us living in China. It&apos;s a wonderful life and it&apos;s not hidden any more.&quot; These days there are gay support groups and websites helping people to explore their sexuality and meet potential partners. There are gay venues in most major cities; last year, the first government-backed bar opened in Kunming, in south-western Yunnan. Shanghai held the first Gay Pride week and in Beijing, campaigners called for same-sex marriages. Now comes Mr Gay China, reported in approving terms in English-language state media. Eight finalists will take to the stage of a Beijing nightclub to strut their stuff in casual clothes and swimwear, exhibit their talents and answer questions. The winner \u2013 picked for his ability to represent gay issues as well as his skills, personality and looks \u2013 will head to Norway for next month&apos;s finals of Worldwide Mr Gay. &quot;I don&apos;t think people were ready before,&quot; said Ben Zhang, one of the organisers, recalling the &quot;long and painful&quot; process of discovering and accepting his sexuality, less than a decade ago. It would be easy to overstate progress since then. Few of the participants are willing to give their full names and several complain about the stereotyping of gay men as weak or HIV-carriers. Strikingly, all are white collar workers and most have studied or worked abroad. Zhang acknowledges that life is tougher outside the big cities, but says that is why the event is needed: &quot;If this gets seen by some country boy in Ningxia, maybe he will realise &apos;It&apos;s not horrible to be gay and I&apos;m not alone.&apos;&quot; For many, the biggest issue is invisibility. &quot;People want to stay out of trouble so they stay away from anything different ... It&apos;s not necessarily that they&apos;re afraid of it or think it&apos;s bad. They just don&apos;t want to know,&quot; said Liu, adding that a handful of friends cut him off after finding out that he was gay. He said the pressures on gay men in China are different from those elsewhere, not greater, pointing out that there is no religious condemnation and that anti-gay violence is rare. But although Liu,26, says that most friends and family accept his sexuality, he has not come out to his father or grandparents. &quot;China is a very traditional society,&quot; explained Steve Zhang, 30, who works in sales. Relatives have pestered him for years about finding a girl to marry. &quot;When I finally told my uncle I had a boyfriend he wasn&apos;t surprised but said, &apos;Well, that&apos;s not a long term thing,&apos;&quot; Zhang added. &quot;They think having fun with boys doesn&apos;t mean you love them; you will still get married in the end.&quot; The pressure to marry is one reason why some campaigners see gay marriage as a goal, along with legal protection against discrimination. But few expect such changes soon. Official tolerance is highly variable. Activists and grassroots organisers complain of harassment by the authorities. Websites and publications have been shut down. And although Shanghai Pride organisers deliberately kept it low key, with no banners or parade, the authorities forced the cancellation of some events. Despite signs of growing confidence in challenging such actions \u2013 last year, gay men faced down police conducting a sweep of a Guangzhou park \u2013 most opt for a non-confrontational approach. Organisers hope to avoid problems by keeping Mr Gay China low-key and did not invite mainstream Chinese-language media. &quot;Officials could show up and say &apos;your fire hydrant is in the wrong place,&quot; said Zhang. &quot;It is still a sensitive issue.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "LGBT rights", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-10T19:17:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/11/china-mobile-telecomms", "sentences": ["Whether a highly-paid Shanghai \u00adexecutive, or an independent farmer-cum-trader such as Gong, no one can afford to be without a phone \u2013 or a signal.", "&quot;I can contact buyers in Chengdu and Shanghai.", "And TD-SCDMA does have advantages \u2013 easy migration to LTE.&quot; TD-LTE (long term evolution) is a 4G standard offering super-fast downloads, which China Mobile will trial at the World Expo in Shanghai this year."], "title": "State owned China Mobile is world's biggest mobile phone operator", "article": "Until just over a year ago, Gong \u00adKangshun spent much of his life trekking over the mountains around his remote village in south-west China. It isn&apos;t easy to make a living in Xiuxi, a tiny settlement of 58 families deep in Aba county, Sichuan. Gong grows crops on a small plot and sells rare fungi found on the steep slopes nearby. Many young people, including his brother, leave to find work in the factories and shops of China&apos;s east. But a single purchase has shortened his working hours and sent his income soaring \u2013 by helping him to find buyers for his fungi. It has even improved his relationships with family and friends. &quot;I&apos;d panic without my mobile phone,&quot; the 35-year-old admits. Across China, tens of millions have similar tales to tell. Many had never enjoyed phone access until recently. Now, for as little as \u00a320, they can buy a handset, slot in a pre-paid sim card, start calling \u2013 and change their lives. Most, like Gong, can thank one firm: China Mobile. With more than 70% of the domestic market it has 518 million subscribers; more than any other mobile carrier on the planet. It is the world&apos;s largest phone operator by market value and the largest Chinese company listed overseas. Its work on 4G technology and its interest in foreign acquisitions suggest its international profile may soon grow. Already the company&apos;s influence is rippling out across the world, almost unnoticed. The rapid spread of mobiles facilitated by the company&apos;s high-speed network roll-out, is both a product of China&apos;s aggressive development and a contributor to it \u2013 accelerating the pace of life and business, shrinking distances. Some activists are enthusiastic about the potential for mobiles and the internet to expand the flow of information in a country with heavy censorship. They point to cases where camera phones have captured and shared images of unrest or official abuse. The authorities certainly seem to be aware of the potential \u2013 Chinese social networking sites are strictly controlled and overseas services such as YouTube are blocked. In restive Xinjiang text messaging was turned off after vicious ethnic violence. The authorities also use mobiles for everything from political education to monitoring individuals. The social and political effects of new technology are rarely straightforward, but for most people, mobiles are simply a part of their life. Whether a highly-paid Shanghai \u00adexecutive, or an independent farmer-cum-trader such as Gong, no one can afford to be without a phone \u2013 or a signal. China Mobile&apos;s 500,000 base \u00adstations now cover 98% of the population. You can call home from city subway trains, distant fields, or the peak of Mount Everest. &quot;If you have a requirement, we will have coverage,&quot; pledged the firm&apos;s chairman and chief executive Wang Jianzhou, who has more than three decades of experience in the sector. &quot;When we started this business we thought very few people would use mobile phones \u2013 only the rich,&quot; he said. Now he is dissatisfied with a penetration rate of 57%. &quot;I think every adult should have at least one mobile \u2026 they are an extension of human ears, eyes and mouths.&quot; Before the network reached Xiuxi, in late 2008, Gong used the phone perhaps twice a month. Each time he would walk for an hour to the nearest landline to call traders interested in buying the valuable &quot;caterpillar&quot; and &quot;sheep stomach&quot; fungi used in Chinese medicine. &quot;Now, on a busy day, I might make 20 calls,&quot; he said. &quot;I can contact buyers in Chengdu and Shanghai. I can do business sitting at home and buyers can reach me, too.&quot; News from outside His income has risen 50%, to 20,000 yuan (\u00a31,820). And instead of walking seven hours a day to find the fungi collectors, he can call and ask them to deliver. In his spare time, he chats to his younger brother, a chef in Zhejiang province who comes home at most once a year. Villagers hear a lot more news from the outside world these days \u2013 even Gong&apos;s 14-year-old son has his own phone. In 1997, there were just 10 million mobile users in China; by 2005, China Mobile had 240 million. Since then it has more than doubled. The government pushes all carriers to serve the poorest. But since taking charge at China Mobile in 2004, Wang has shown sceptics that focusing on rural areas is a viable business strategy. &quot;Many analysts and investment bankers told me: never go to rural areas because they are low revenue. You will not make a profit,&quot; Wang said, in an interview at his spacious but low-key office in the company&apos;s headquarters on Beijing&apos;s Financial Street. &quot;I didn&apos;t believe that \u2026 with fixed lines, providing rural services is very, very difficult and expensive. [We have] low average revenue per user \u2013 but also low costs.&quot; With a penetration rate of just 37%, there is plenty of room for growth among China&apos;s 700 million rural population. And there is plenty of demand. In Yangcun county, close to Beijing, Chen Fengmei anxiously scrolls through her latest text message: advice from officials on how the day&apos;s weather will affect her tomato crop. Another villager, Li Chunyu, checks the latest market prices for his pigs, no longer needing to trust middlemen or to give them a cut of his profits. &quot;I never need to go anywhere. I can stay on the farm and find out everything,&quot; he said. Some wonder whether China Mobile&apos;s success is down to business acumen or simply that the Chinese government owns a stake of more than 74%. Public investors hold the rest \u2013 the firm is listed in New York and Hong Kong, where it is technically domiciled. &quot;We are all wondering whether China Mobile really has the mojo, or whether whatever position it has is really a government favour,&quot; said David Wolf of corporate advisory firm Wolf Group Asia. &quot;I think China Mobile would argue they have been victims of disfavour in recent years \u2026 the fact the company didn&apos;t simply implode suggests a lot of good inside the organisation.&quot; In 2008, officials reorganised the telecoms sector, strengthening competition and awarding the firm the least mature of the 3G standards. China Mobile had previously snapped up 83% to 88% of new subscribers, said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based telecoms and IT specialist. As its rivals settled down, that share rose. But by October 2009, it had fallen to 56%. &quot;Now there are three players and the market is very, very competitive,&quot; Wang said. &quot;We think its normal that we have a reduced share of new subscribers. But the total market still has big potential.&quot; The costs of introducing 3G and the impact of the global downturn contributed to the firm&apos;s only fall in profits for a decade, in the second quarter of 2009. Although profits have rebounded, the slight year-on-year rise to 28.6bn yuan in the third quarter was less than analysts had predicted. Last week also saw unwelcome news when China Mobile sacked its vice-chairman Zhang Chunjiang, citing alleged serious financial irregularities. He had earlier been sacked by the parent company, according to state media. China Mobile said his removal would have no material effect on the business; reports \u00adsuggest the claims relate to Zhang&apos;s \u00adprevious job. The company&apos;s mid to long-term prospects depend on customers like pig farmer Li making more frequent and longer calls and using data services \u2013 as Wang tacitly acknowledges when he remarks that &quot;we hope all mobile phones will become smart phones&quot;. Li&apos;s 20 to 30 calls a day bring in little income for China Mobile; perhaps 2,000 yuan (\u00a3180) a year. Even that is double the average. &quot;I know you can use mobiles for other things besides calls and texts, but I don&apos;t know how,&quot; he confided. &quot;Sometimes I look at their screens and feel a little dizzy.&quot; The good news for China Mobile is that his children and their friends are using their phones to browse the web, play games and watch videos. But customers may be tempted to turn away from the firm as they trade up. The company is heavily promoting its 3G service, launched last January and in November, almost 3 million people used the network, which serves 70% of cities. iPhone Yet China Unicom, which launched its 3G network in October, is catching up fast, with a million users in its first month. China Mobile must fight off strengthened competition with the domestically-developed TD-SCDMA (time division synchronous code division multiple access) standard. Some wondered if the firm missed a trick when it failed to reach a deal for the iPhone, now available through China Unicom. Wang says it is still negotiating with Apple and highlights a deal for a TD-SCDMA BlackBerry as &quot;very big progress&quot;. Yet he is noticeably unenthusiastic about 3G. &quot;It&apos;s a very difficult job to operate \u00adTD-SCDMA because no other operator has used it before. But China Mobile has big experience in rolling out and maintaining networks,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s difficult but we think we can reach our target. And TD-SCDMA does have advantages \u2013 easy migration to LTE.&quot; TD-LTE (long term evolution) is a 4G standard offering super-fast downloads, which China Mobile will trial at the World Expo in Shanghai this year. Wang foresees 4G products on the market within three years and says overseas operators are already interested. &quot;It&apos;s expected to be a much stronger competitor,&quot; Natkin confirmed. &quot;TD has always been playing catch-up. In the 4G arena China is actually at \u2013 if not ahead of \u2013 the starting line.&quot; China Mobile hopes to extend its reach in other ways. In 2007 it bought Pakistan&apos;s Paktel, now renamed ChinaMobile Pakistan and branded as Zong. Wang describes the telecoms market there as &quot;very competitive&quot; and &quot;difficult&quot;. But he sees the purchase as a first step in international expansion and his eyes gleam at the prospect of snapping up other overseas carriers. The chief executive, who spoke fluent English throughout the interview, has fostered relationships with his peers abroad and watches them closely. &quot;We are trying to find other opportunities for acquisitions, but it&apos;s not easy. We are waiting for \u00adopportunities whether in \u00addeveloped or developing countries,&quot; he said.

The shadow of a palm tree on a sun-smitten wall; light filtering into an empty shower stall through a faded curtain. Grim, hellish light inside a freezer, the\u00a0rust-pigmented frost caked to the\u00a0freezer wall, plastic bags of ice \u00adsnuggled neatly in the lower gloom. Who else would think to photograph this dreary beauty? Eggleston&apos;s new exhibition 21st \u00adCentury, selected from work made over the last decade, opens this week at the \u00adVictoria Miro gallery in London. (The same exhibition also runs concurrently at Cheim and Read in New York, where I saw it a few days ago.) Increasingly the subject of major retrospectives, where individual works are often \u00adsubsumed in the arc of a career that has\u00a0spanned more than 40 years, the Memphis-born photographer&apos;s work is\u00a0both familiar and strange. This is a small exhibition, and the colour photographs are themselves modest in scale. But what riches they contain, however inconsequential their\u00a0apparent subjects. Each one is an entry to the world. Many of Eggleston&apos;s \u00adphotographs dwell on fragments of \u00adreality that might otherwise go \u00adunregarded. One photograph, taken a\u00a0decade ago somewhere in California, shows a page of windblown newspaper among dry grasses and lumps of \u00adconcrete. Imagine the photographer stumbling over a patch of waste ground, watching where he puts his\u00a0feet, his attention lost among the weeds and stones. What he finds there is a parched image, a sunbleached page of the LA Times trapped in a tangle of pale shadows. The newspaper presents an image-within-an-image: a couple of\u00a0girls looking over a bay towards the city of Shanghai, with its far-off skyline of newly built towers. Look hard at the newspaper in \u00adEggleston&apos;s picture and you can read about an American sports bar in \u00adShanghai, where &quot;a pierced-tongued transvestite torch singer croons \u00adGershwin songs two nights a week&quot;. The bar sounds like Eggleston&apos;s kind of\u00a0place \u2013 not that the photographer necessarily noticed the text, and \u00adperhaps wouldn&apos;t care about it if he had. But it is there for us to read. The\u00a0printed Shanghai sky is a chip of washed-out blue against the \u00adCalifornia dirt. The world writhes up from the ground, full and rich and complex. A knack for noticing What also strikes me about his \u00adphotograph is the composition, its symmetries and balance, its air of \u00adrandom fixation. That&apos;s the thing about Eggleston&apos;s work: he tunes your eyes and makes you notice things \u2013 a spoon shining on a Kentucky \u00adwindowsill, a red dumpster against an orange wall in\u00a0Memphis, a rivulet of water on a dirt\u00a0road in Mexico (what makes this particular image is a \u00adflattened plastic bottle on the ground, next to the \u00adpuddle of scummy water). Writing this\u00a0on a winter morning in New York, I\u00a0step out for a moment and the orange traffic cones surrounding a patch of snow are suddenly too vivid; a\u00a0roll of tan carpet dumped on the \u00adsidewalk looks deliberate and posed, rather than\u00a0slumped and arbitrary. Passing the same spot a few hours later, in \u00addifferent light, the scene looks \u00addesolate\u00a0and empty. Colour matters, too. A tearful woman in a black dress crying in a room in Memphis, her face all blotched and red,\u00a0with green walls behind. On one wall is a poster with the word BLUES printed in orange. How does Eggleston see so much, I find myself asking, and drag such sad riches from the world? The camera sees more than the \u00adphotographer; the eye sees more than\u00a0the mind can apprehend. The photograph was the work of a moment, a moment that now goes on and on. I think some people photograph things the better to see what they look like. Photographs crop and contain \u00adreality, but they are as much about \u00adfocus as the things they represent. Look, say Eggleston&apos;s photographs, just look. Juergen Teller recently told\u00a0me that he was with Eggleston \u00adsomewhere, sitting on a bench, and the\u00a0American photographer just raised his camera and shot a picture of a nearby rubbish bin. Teller, who had pretty much the same camera and was sitting at Eggleston&apos;s side, cheekily took a picture of the same subject. \u00adEggleston&apos;s picture was great, Teller told me, his own picture somehow \u00adlifeless and ordinary. Some people seem to possess an \u00adalmost uncanny ability to notice things\u00a0\u2013 and not only to notice them, but to\u00a0\u00adinvest them with meaning and \u00adcomplexity. Intuition, attention and openness to the world are part of what makes a photographer great, an\u00a0ability more certain than luck or happenstance. Whatever it is, \u00adEggleston has it. His \u00adrecent work is \u00addescribed as having \u00adbecome more \u00adabstract, although all \u00adimages are \u00adabstractions. When he \u00adfocuses on nothing more than a stretch\u00a0of vertical louvered curtains, with their pattern of\u00a0red and brown flecks, a small gape in\u00a0the middle \u00adgiving on to a further, \u00adultramarine \u00adgeometric pattern that catches hidden light, I am transfixed by\u00a0the stillness and emptiness of a \u00admoment that amounts to almost nothing. Plaster buttocks and Santa Claus Other images are full of domestic \u00adclutter, or ordered compositions of \u00adverticals, horizontals and diagonals. Where another artist \u2013 the Canadian Jeff Wall, for example \u2013 might contrive an image of a dirty sink and a bar of soap, Eggleston seems to find his \u00adimages with no sense of artifice at all.While his photographs suggest a grounding in a modernist aesthetic, he\u00a0is never clever or self-consciously artful. He can also be funny (a transfer of Santa Claus stuck to a window seems to float in the sky beyond); macabre (an arm holds up a paper target in a shooting range, the well-grouped \u00adbullet holes piercing the silhouetted head); and \u00adformally reserved (rolls of\u00a0printed \u00adfabric, depicting a bucolic \u00adpattern of fox-hunters). A photograph that focuses on the plaster buttocks of a statue seen through a smeary window makes you laugh, even as you are distracted by a plethora of textural detail. A photograph gives you everything all at once, but takes time to unravel. It\u00a0contains more than what&apos;s there in\u00a0the sheen of the paper, in the \u00adchemicals and grain of the printed \u00adsurface. \u00adEggleston&apos;s work makes you want to gaze and gaze again, both at the work itself and the world from which it comes.", "tags": ["William Eggleston", "Photography", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-11T21:35:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/13/google-retreat-china-crackdown-censorship", "sentences": ["In a town hall meeting in Shanghai the US president described himself as a as &quot;a big supporter of non-censorship&quot; and said criticism made him a better president."], "title": "China's internet crackdown forced Google retreat", "article": "Google&apos;s retreat from China comes amid an intensifying crackdown on the country&apos;s internet that has seen websites blocked, an entire region closed down and self-censorship become increasingly widespread. In the past 12 months the Great Fire Wall \u2013 China&apos;s system of restricting foreign content \u2013 has been raised to keep out Twitter and Facebook. Many other sites, such as YouTube, were already blocked. Within China censors stepped up their efforts to limit information available to an increasingly connected nation by expanding lists of taboo subjects, putting pressure on internet service providers (ISPs) and arresting several high-profile journalists and free speech campaigners who refused to toe the line. The Guardian&apos;s Chinese language service, the Weibao, was taken offline without explanation at the end of last year when the site of its translation partner, Yeeyan, was removed by its internet service provider. Last June the government attempted to install &quot;Green Dam&quot; censorship software in every computer that would deny access to sites with pornographic or politically sensitive content. The plan was postponed at the last minute after a backlash by Chinese netizens, computer makers and foreign governments, but the authorities are said to be still keen to introduce such a system. After riots erupted in the far western region of Xinjiang in the summer, the authorities completely shut down the internet in the capital, Urumqi, and restricted mobile phone messaging. Services were only resumed in the past month. Google, along with other companies that operate within the Great Firewall, must follow the orders of the Communist party propaganda department. Their executives meet with Chinese officials who tell them &quot;which way the wind is blowing&quot; on sensitive topics such as Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen and Falun Gong. Many website operators compile lists of terms that might get them in trouble with the authorities and filter them from their content. Almost nothing is made public, which means there is an invisible line between what is acceptable and prohibited. This results in massive self-censorship. Criticism of China&apos;s actions at the Copenhagen climate summit is thought to be off-limits. At least one website operator flags up even the word &quot;China&quot; because stories about the nation are potentially sensitive. Google has been criticised by the authorities and sporadic breaks in its Chinese service have been widely seen as a form of temporary punishment for failing to heed the orders of the censors. It faces unfair competition with Baidu, the local rival search engine that is far more compliant. Censorship was high on the agenda when Barack Obama made his first visit to China in November. In a town hall meeting in Shanghai the US president described himself as a as &quot;a big supporter of non-censorship&quot; and said criticism made him a better president. &quot;I think that the more freely information flows, the stronger the society becomes, because then citizens of countries around the world can hold their own governments accountable,&quot; Obama said. &quot;They can begin to think for themselves.&quot; Many Chinese netizens find ways to &quot;climb the firewall&quot; by using proxies and VPNs to access blocked websites overseas. Some, such as the artist Ai Weiwei, rail against censorship and the sanitised domestic news offerings. The government has tried to scare off such challenges by imprisoning high-profile campaigners. The Tibetan film-maker Dhongdup Wangchen was recently jailed for six years for a critical documentary about Tibet.

The move could result in Google being forced to pull out of China four years after it controversially announced its intention to launch a censored version of google.cn, the local version of its search engine. Faced with a conflict between one of America&apos;s most powerful companies and the Chinese government, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, called on Beijing to discuss the situation. &quot;We have been briefed by Google on these allegations, which raise very serious concerns and questions,&quot; she said. &quot;We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.&quot; Clinton, who is about to begin a tour of Asia and the Pacific, said it was important for businesses and governments around the world to be able to operate online without interference. &quot;The ability to operate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy,&quot; she said. Barack Obama has called internet security a &quot;national security priority&quot;. Clinton is expected to give a speech in Washington next week outlining new policies aimed at curbing online crime. The White House has just appointed a new head of cybersecurity, charged with improving the country&apos;s online defences, which have come under constant attack in recent years. Hackers have attacked government computers in Washington, London, Berlin and elsewhere \u2013 in what some experts say is an orchestrated campaign that is sponsored, or at least permitted to take place, by officials in Beijing. On a visit to Shanghai in November, Barack Obama said filtering information was not compatible with modern life. &quot;Unrestricted internet access is a source of strength and I think should be encouraged,&quot; he said. Google&apos;s strongly worded statement \u2013 in which it said the conflict &quot;goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech&quot; \u2013 may push the issue further. Google&apos;s senior figures have close relations with US government officials. Its chief executive, Eric Schmidt, was an adviser for Obama&apos;s election campaign and last week he was among guests at a dinner with Clinton to discuss how technology could be used to promote democracy. The state department said it had been briefed on Google&apos;s plans but Google&apos;s head of corporate communications, Matt Furman, told the Guardian that the state department had not had any direct involvement in Google&apos;s decision to drop its censored search results. It would not be unprecedented for the US government to intervene. In June, officials in Washington contacted the internet messaging service Twitter asking it to push back planned maintenance so that news from the Iranian protests could spread.", "tags": ["Google", "China", "US news", "Censorship", "Internet", "Hillary Clinton", "Technology", "World news", "Digital media", "Media", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-13T08:19:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/15/mr-gay-china-shut-down", "sentences": ["Shanghai saw the first gay pride festival on the mainland, although some events were cancelled, despite attempts to keep it low-key."], "title": "Chinese police shut down country's first gay pageant", "article": "Chinese police shut down the country&apos;s first gay pageant tonight, just one hour before the event was due to begin. Participants hoped the contest would help challenge domestic stereotypes about homosexuality, classified as a mental illness until 2001, and show the rest of the world that gay people could be accepted in China. But officers arrived at a Beijing nightclub shortly before the Mr Gay China competition started and told organisers it was not properly licensed. They are understood to have told the venue&apos;s owners that it was &quot;a sensitive issue&quot;. The event was to feature a swimwear round and talent section, but contestants would also have been judged on their ability to represent the gay community. The winner was to take part in the Mr Gay Worldwide final in Norway next month. &quot;I&apos;m about to cry,&quot; said Xue Fei, one of the eight contestants. &quot;We really wanted to promote the sunny side of gay people.&quot; He said he believed the pageant had already achieved some of its aims because advance coverage had highlighted gay issues. But he added: &quot;It&apos;s been a long time since China&apos;s reform and opening policies began and I think it really should follow the steps of the international world. &quot;In China, the population of gay people is large, but many of them cannot live in the sunshine. I really hope we can live with our heads held high and face the world happily.&quot; Another participant, Simon Wang, said he was &quot;disappointed, but not surprised&quot;. He added: &quot;I think maybe the reason it was cancelled was because they had too much publicity.&quot; The police officers who came to the venue were friendly and asked questions about homosexuality, said Ryan Dutcher, one of the organisers. He added: &quot;I&apos;m very disappointed because we worked hard for this event, but I don&apos;t see it as a major step back. &quot;Anyone who&apos;s been in China has seen how much the gay community has grown and how people \u2013 even the authorities \u2013 have become more accepting.&quot; The organisers had hoped the contest would be acceptable to officials because of other recent events. Last year, activists in Beijing held a gay film festival for the first time; previous attempts in 2001 and 2005 were shut down. Shanghai saw the first gay pride festival on the mainland, although some events were cancelled, despite attempts to keep it low-key. &quot;I think this is a very stupid decision because showing the beauty of gay people to the world is a very positive thing,&quot; said Wan Yanhai, a well-known gay rights activist, who arrived at the venue after hearing of the cancellation. &quot;It would have fostered a good international image of China and benefited not only gay people here, but also China as a whole, because it would have shown the image of a harmonious society with gay people living happily in China.&quot; Gay sex was decriminalised in 1997, but Sara Davis, executive director of the US-based Asia Catalyst, which supports grassroots activists, said the authorities&apos; attitudes towards gay events were still very mixed. &quot;There are progressive elements which show recognising people as gay is not a threat to the government&apos;s stability, but also very conservative elements who are threatened by this activity.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "LGBT rights", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-15T17:54:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/17/army-of-two-40th-day", "sentences": ["Following on from a fairly dire original, in which you played as one of two masked mercenaries, Salem or Rios, the sequel takes place on a hazardous journey through a disintegrating Shanghai."], "title": "Army of Two: The 40th Day | Game review", "article": "While the debate over excessive violence in computer games turning our pop kids into square-eyed psychopaths continues, what should march up, eyeballing all and sundry, but blood-soaked, third-person shooter, Army of Two: The 40th Day?

While it&apos;s a sizeable sum to most people, in this room \u2013 filled with more than 1,000 bankers sporting black ties and quaffing champagne \u2013 \u00a320,000 seemed paltry, particularly when it was coming out of the pocket of the great survivor of the financial crisis. In just a few days&apos; time, Goldman will hand out bonuses to its staff in what is turning into the most politically charged bonus season in living memory. A \u00a320,000 donation will feel like small change to those individuals, who will walk away with telephone-number-sized payouts after what is expected to be a record year for the bank, barely a year since the financial system hovered on the brink of collapse. Attendees at the dinner faced a dilemma: give too little and look mean, give too much and appear to be flaunting the runaway profits that banks are already achieving thanks to the support of a debt-laden taxpayer. In the end, more than \u00a31m was raised \u2013 funds that bankers joked would at least avoid the chancellor&apos;s 50% bonus tax. The tax, which is deeply unpopular in the City, was the subject of much discussion on the call held by JP Morgan&apos;s chief executive Jamie Dimon as he kicked off Wall Street&apos;s bank reporting season on Friday. It alone could end up with a tax bill of &quot;several hundred million dollars&quot; after giving the first hint of pay levels on Wall Street in 2009: remuneration for its investment bank staff has jumped 21% to $9.3bn (\u00a35.7bn). This year-on-year rise was achieved even though in the fourth quarter the bank dramatically scaled back the proportion of revenue used for compensation from almost 40% in the previous nine months to just 11%. Dimon, who had called Alistair Darling at the end of last year to complain about the tax, also gave the chancellor cause for cheer. The pay restraint shown in the fourth quarter was in part to help the bank pay the bonus tax. As the rest of the US banks report this week, analysts and shareholders will be looking for evidence that the other players with big operations in the City \u2013 particularly Morgan Stanley and Goldman \u2013 also reduce their bonus pool in the fourth quarter as a way of shouldering the burden of the bonus tax. JP Morgan reported just 24 hours after President Barack Obama launched his new tax on banks, which is designed to bring in at least $90bn over 10 years to recoup losses on the $700bn financial-sector bailout. Even as Dimon warned that &quot;all businesses tend to pass their costs on to customers&quot;, Obama made it clear he would not be moved: &quot;If these companies are in good enough shape to afford massive bonuses, they are surely in good enough shape to afford paying back every penny to taxpayers.&quot; Earlier last week, Dimon had lined up beside Goldman Sachs&apos;s chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, Morgan Stanley chairman John Mack and Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan to be sworn in for an appearance before the bipartisan US government commission investigating the origins of the financial crisis. As they raised their right hands at the start of the hearing in the US Capitol in Washington, photographers unleashed a barrage of shutter clicks. The image appeared in newspapers across the world, giving Americans a slate of villains on whom to focus in lieu of fundamental systemic reforms to resolve the problems at the heart of the crisis. The four admitted they underestimated the severity of the financial crisis and apologised for past mistakes. It was a nod to the soaring public anger at Wall Street, whose banks are set to reap record profits as US unemployment remains at a 26-year high. Even so, the bankers were keen not to invite unwanted new oversight or punitive taxes. They sought to shift blame away from their institutions and lay it on mortgage lending practices, under-regulation of the mortgage broking industry and the government&apos;s promotion of home ownership. Created in May by an act of Congress, the inquiry is modelled after the Pecora commission, which was established in the 1930s to uncover the causes of the Great Depression. Its tenacious investigation led to Congress passing the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, which separated commercial and investment banking activities \u2013 reforms whose repeal in 1999 contributed to the current calamity. The panel includes former economic policy advisers to President George Bush and Republican Senator John McCain&apos;s presidential campaign and it held its first session in a chilly room at the Capitol on Wednesday, chaired by Phil Angelides, a former Democratic treasurer of California. In his ringing opening remarks, Angelides said of the disconnection between the taxpayer-funded bailout of the banking industry and the continued huge bonuses: &quot;People are angry. They have a right to be.&quot; The bankers defended their huge pay packages, provoking criticism that they remain obtuse. If Blankfein&apos;s smirks, half-hearted apologies and condescension did not send that message, the numbers do: the world&apos;s biggest investment banks are expected to pay out more than $65bn (\u00a340bn) in salaries and bonuses this month, even as US unemployment holds stubbornly at 10% and the government faces a $1tn budget deficit. Wall Street&apos;s apparent concessions to public outrage include a shift to paying bonuses in company shares rather than cash, some claw-back provisions in case investments and trades go bad in future, and links to performance that critics say are bound to improve if banks are allowed to play the financial system further. The closest the City has to the US hearings is the Treasury select committee of MPs, led by irascible Labour stalwart John McFall. During its session last week, bonuses were also on the agenda, prompting Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester to concede that even his own parents \u2013 both academics \u2013 thought his potential \u00a39.7m pay packet was too much. Hester, who next month will need to negotiate bonuses for 22,000 RBS investment bankers, emphasised that the bank had to pay bonuses to match rivals and for this reason was a &quot;prisoner&quot; to the market. He refused to predict a mass exodus from the City because of the bonus tax. Others, though, cannot contain their frustration. Stuart Fraser, chairman of policy and resources at the City of London Corporation, the City&apos;s local council, criticised attacks on bankers as overdone, and lashed out at the rise in income tax to 50% for higher earners. He said: &quot;As a matter of urgency, we must reassert a consistent tax regime that balances global competitiveness with fairness. The 50% rate of income tax and, in particular, the supertax on bonuses have tarnished our international reputation \u2013 we simply cannot expect firms to operate in a business environment defined by such hostility and uncertainty. These measures must be revisited or, in the case of the supertax, revoked as soon as is practically \u00adpossible.&quot; Fraser was speaking to a gathering of City executives, lobbyists and government officials last week at the London Chamber of Commerce. He said the government should do all it can to get the City back on its feet and retain its \u00adstatus as the most internationally focused banking centre in the world. &quot;If you go to Shanghai, as I do quite often, you could ask for a new tube \u00adsystem and it would be built. If you need a new office building, planning permission will be granted. Nothing gets in the way,&quot; he said. Like many in the room, he believed the &quot;rainmakers&quot; at the major investment banks, hedge funds and private equity firms should be indulged for the benefit of the nation. &quot;A lot of damage has been done by the 50p tax rate. It is targeted at the best and most talented people in the business, the people who make the bank its money, the rainmakers. It is not a fair world. When they handed out intelligence they didn&apos;t give it to me but they did give it to others who will go elsewhere unless they are rewarded.&quot; Simon Walker, head of the trade body for private equity firms, the BVCA, joined the criticism of the taxes on higher earners and non-domiciled residents, which he said have made &quot;London a profoundly unattractive place to do business&quot;. The shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, Mark Hoban, was also at the Chamber of Commerce event as part of a Tory charm offensive that includes meetings and lunches with bankers and major investment houses. &quot;You don&apos;t encourage a more balanced economy by cutting down the tallest flowers \u2013 you allow others to grow,&quot; he said at the London Chamber of Commerce meeting. Hoban is in the difficult position of defending the City, but not its excesses. He is keen to tell his audience that a Conservative government will be kinder, but not have the resources to reverse the extra taxes. Attacks on bankers, he tells them, are also something he and his colleagues will continue while excessive bonuses remain on the table. On the basis of the figures published so far by JP Morgan, the stony atmosphere between banks and the public is likely to continue. Union leader Brendan Barber wasted no time in branding JP\u00a0Morgan&apos;s pay plans as &quot;obscene&quot;, saying: &quot;Banks are meant to support society, but instead taxpayers support guarantees that, whatever happens to the economy, banks will continue to pay gigantic bonuses.&quot; This time, the boos are not just aimed at Goldman.", "tags": ["Executive pay and bonuses", "Banking", "Morgan Stanley", "JP Morgan", "Goldman Sachs", "Stephen Hester", "John McFall"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-17T00:05:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/17/fred-goodwin-royal-bank-scotland", "sentences": ["In Shanghai, Seattle, Singapore and Seoul, they have never been much interested in Fred&apos;s pension pot."], "title": "There's no shame in\u00a0hiring a pariah | Heather McGregor", "article": "Chartered accountancy, banking, architecture? Not a usual career path, certainly. But this is no usual person. Everyone&apos;s agog at the appointment of Sir Fred Goodwin as a senior adviser to the international architecture practice RMJM. Why? What use could he be? Surely the man who led the Royal Bank of Scotland to implosion is unemployable? Even if someone did want to employ him, as Odgers wanted to employ Johnny Cameron, formerly the head of RBS&apos; investment banking division, then would they, like Odgers, feel the wrath of the public and the government and hold back from tarnishing their reputation with his? Does RMJM not understand the meaning of shame? At the risk of being lynched, I have to say that this doesn&apos;t look the silliest move to me. Fred Goodwin became CEO of RBS in 2001, when he was only 43, and oversaw what everyone agreed at the time was a very successful domestic and international expansion. Sure, he paid too much for ABN Amro \u2013 most of the \u00a348bn that the consortium had to fork out for the Dutch bank \u2013 but, again, that was one decision against many acquisitions that other business leaders wished they had secured. He may have made an error of judgment, but which of us has not? Now, Goodwin&apos;s behaviour is held responsible for the loss of thousands of jobs and the part-nationalisation of the jewel in the crown of Scotland&apos;s financial services industry. Like \u00adRijkman Groenink of ABN Amro, Fred is seen as having squandered the national inheritance and is vilified by his countrymen, with some justification. Many of the very same Scots who were proud to host the fifth largest bank in the world \u2013 built, acquisition by acquisition, by Fred Goodwin \u2013 would now cross the road to avoid the man who was once held up as a national hero. But this is not about arguing for someone to be given a second chance. Fred Goodwin doesn&apos;t need pity, and Peter Morrison, chief executive of RMJM Europe, is not in the business of philanthropy. In his mid-30s, he is a young man who, having, with his father, bought into a large and complex architecture practice, is seeking to pursue a policy of international expansion. I am sure that many members of the public will wonder why he would want to sully his \u2013 and their \u2013 reputation by hiring Fred. Objectively, I would say that for him it is a bit of a coup to have someone with Fred&apos;s experience in his toolkit. Fred has probably accumulated more air miles than almost any other businessman of his age. He has an &quot;Alpha grasp&quot; of finance and a keen eye for detail. When RBS&apos;s new HQ outside Edinburgh was being built, he had a cabin set up for him at Gogarburn and involved himself right down to the choice of wallpaper. You might question this level of engagement, but it does suggest that he might be of some use to a firm of architects. Morrison, in the internal memo he sent to his staff, refers to RHJM&apos;s &quot;international expansion strategy&quot; and says that he looks forward to Fred becoming an &quot;integral member&quot; of the team. I can buy that. Fred knows who is important around the world and who is not, how to greet people, how to secure their support and how to be an ambassador for an international company with its roots in Scotland. I suspect that may prove pretty useful to an ambitious thirtysomething who is looking beyond his domestic market. In Shanghai, Seattle, Singapore and Seoul, they have never been much interested in Fred&apos;s pension pot. RHJM is not the first company to recognise the skills and experience of those involved in the financial crisis. Tom McKillop was chairman when the decision was made to buy ABN; does that make him less useful to UCB, where he has recently become a non-executive director? Andy Hornby will only be 43 on Thursday \u2013 Alliance Boots is said to be delighted with its young and energetic CEO and grateful for the experience he brings from having run a large retail bank such as HBOS, even if it did collapse, under his leadership, into the arms of Lloyds. Is there such a thing as pariah status, really? Although I suspect Peter Cummings may be beyond \u00adrehabilitation\u2026 But that may be because I have a personal gripe about Cummings or, rather, his vehicle, the Bank of Scotland. It turned me down when I wanted a loan to buy my business, which, like RHJM, had been set up by two respected practitioners who were \u2013 and still are \u2013 revered both within and without the office walls. Five years on, I still consult those of my acquaintances who are older, and more experienced, in acquiring and running businesses in such a way that you keep the best of the old while introducing the new. That advice is invaluable. Fred had such a mentor in the form of Sir George Mathewson, and will well understand the part he will be expected to play for Morrison. The majority of Britons might be appalled, but I am not, and Peter Morrison will recognise the benefit of working with someone who has faced adversity. The transfer of RBS to majority government ownership might not have been any fun, but it would have taught Fred, the son of an electrician, some lessons. Morrison, by contrast, was part of a wealthy family before he even knew what a bank \u2013 or an architecture practice \u2013 was. His vision in recognising what Fred could bring to his firm is controversial, and brave, but could prove to have been inspired. Like others before him, he looks like he has recognised the talent behind the tarnish. Also, he&apos;ll have got all that experience for what I will wager has been a knock-down price.

A group of environmental exhibitionists \u2013 none of whom had ever met before \u2013 stripped down to their pants and boxers inside a Guangzhou subway carriage yesterday to promote awareness about sustainable consumption. To the astonishment and amusement of watching commuters, the 20 or so men and women then sat down in their seats and continued their journeys for 40 minutes, reading newspapers and listening to music in the semi-nude. The bare-legged subway ride was coordinated on the internet and inspired by similar actions in the UK and the US, organised by the Improv Everywhere group. Though small in scale, it is unusual in China, where climate-related campaigns are rare and the police often take a dim view of unapproved public displays of flesh or political activity. Organisers, who posted an online appeal for participants on local bulletin boards last week, said the action was intended simply as &quot;a bit of fun&quot;, but they were prepared to be taken away by the police. The event, however, attracted far more attention from the media than the security bureau. The TVS1 channel filmed the participants taking off their trousers and skirts. Some, either shy or uneasy about possible repercussions wore sunglasses. Others bore hand-written slogans, &quot;Save the Earth&quot;, &quot;So hot&quot; and &quot;Low-carbon life \u2013 free and easy&quot; either scrawled on paper or their thighs. &quot;Of course I feel a little bit shy, after all we are Chinese. But I think it is OK to promote environmental protection in this way,&quot; a female participant told reporters. The organiser, Liang Shuxin \u2013 an online sales manager \u2013 said the action was deliberately provocative. &quot;In a shocking way, we achieved our goal,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;There has been a lot of debate and some people have criticised me. But this was an avant garde way to draw attention to a low-carbon lifestyle.&quot; Environmental awareness has come late to China, but it is growing fast. Factory pollution, waste incinerators and dam relocations result in thousands of protests each year. In civil society, green NGOs have increased in number and influence. Given the dire state of the air and water, climate change has been a more distant concern until recently. But melting glaciers and worsening droughts and floods have brought home the risks of inaction. The central government has issued its first white paper on climate change and international bodies, including the UK government, the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Greenpeace, have mounted climate campaigns in China. But such efforts are in their infancy and the impact has to be spread over a vastly divided nation. While the average carbon footprint of people in China is half that of people in the UK, the levels in cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing are higher than Britain, France and Germany. And with China&apos;s economy still surging forward at the rate of more than 8% per year, the country&apos;s emissions will double again in the next 15 years. Liang said he was trying to set an example by using the subway more and wearing \u2013 at least for the duration of the campaign \u2013 one less item of clothing, equal, he estimated, to 7kg of CO2 for its manufacture. &quot;Our government has been trying to promote a low-carbon economy, but bureaucratic action is not enough; every citizen needs to get involved.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 19 January 2010.

Once again, the action follows steroid-guzzling mercenary duo Rios and Salem as they blast their way through swathes of identikit bad guys, earning bags of cash and blowing it on customised weapons. For the sequel, however, EA&apos;s Montreal studio has scaled down the idiotic macho banter and reined in the globe-trotting narrative \u2013 now the action takes place over a couple of days in Shanghai as the city is blown to pieces in a mysterious terror attack. Although it&apos;s possible to take this mad ride alone, with AI controlling your partner, the real pleasure of the game is grabbing a friend and tumbling through the maelstrom together, often splitting up to flank enemies, one charging in with an assault rifle, the other hanging back and sniping. Most of these split-up-and-surprise sections are clearly signposted \u2013 as is just about everything in this unapologetically linear adventure \u2013 but they&apos;re thrilling nonetheless, forcing a wonderfully synchronised, closely reliant form of cooperation that regular online deathmatches rarely allow.     Army of Two: The 40th Day video game    But it&apos;s the epic destruction, the sheer incendiary chaos, of the game that keeps you plugging away. As you fight through the city, buildings collapse on each other, aircraft crash, roofs fall away to leave office floorspaces open to the stars and explosions rip apart the floor beneath you. Yet still you fight on \u2013 collecting guns, adding crazy extras to them, and discovering more about the daft story. At times, the chunky control mechanism strains and flounders, the camera becoming jammed behind your bulky character, or the automatic cover system failing to lock in, leaving you ridiculously exposed to enemy fire. And the sections where you have to make serious moral choices about shooting or saving by-standing characters caught in your private war are jarringly incongruous amid the laughable carnage. But this is a trashy masterpiece of brash, brainless fun, jammed with blowout set pieces and awesome weaponry.

We ended up with an adventure that, I&apos;m sure, will stick in our children&apos;s memory for a very long time. Getting started To start with, I turned to the Man in Seat Sixty-One (seat61.com), whose website is a dependable treasure trove of useful information on train services worldwide. What he had to say about China looked promising: fast, modern trains on main intercity routes, with comfortable sleeper cabins and restaurant cars. Best of all, the fares were tremendous value for money: for instance, a soft sleeper from Beijing to Shanghai costs from RMB500 (\u00a345) per person if bought direct from the station in Beijing. Set that against anything from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 per person for a flight, add a night&apos;s accommodation, and you&apos;ve clearly got a bargain. The drawback is that seats only go on sale 10-20 days before the date of travel on the poshest trains, and less than 10 days on other routes. Not only that, but there is no central booking service, so you can only get tickets for a given journey at the originating station. In other words, for the trip that was forming in our minds (Beijing to Xian to Shanghai to Hong Kong) we would have to take pot luck queuing in three different stations to make the journeys we wanted.     Paul Simon and sons at the Beijing Water Cube    That might be OK if you&apos;re travelling independently and don&apos;t mind the occasional unscheduled day should you not get on the exact train you&apos;re after. But my wife Jane and I were travelling with two young boys, so the stress of juggling them and ticket offices was too much to contemplate, let alone whatever language challenges that entailed. Booking with an agent The answer is to book via an agent, who can do the legwork for you. Seat61.com suggested some websites that pledge to take bookings up to 60 days in advance, and have packages on popular routes, throwing in hotels and tours, that are bookable 90 days ahead. But I wanted to tinker with our itinerary to take in a total eclipse near Shanghai and some other places on the way. One site I noted was a joint venture between a Chinese group and the London-based Oriental Travel, so I contacted Oriental direct. It had a host of special packages, and could tailor an itinerary. At long last, we had a plan: three nights in Beijing with a half-day tour of the Forbidden City; sleeper to Xian for one night with a tour of the Terracotta Warriors; sleeper to Shanghai for three nights with a tour of Yuyuan/Old Town; and sleeper to Hong Kong. The package cost \u00a3595 per person based on two sharing in three-star hotels (excluding flights to and from China). We paid extra to see the eclipse and to visit the famous gardens of nearby Suzhou. The trains Beijing West station is vast, but its huge, airport-style departures board quickly separates the masses into a dozen spacious waiting rooms serving one or two trains at a time. For those who don&apos;t read Chinese characters, each train has a number: T43, Z94 and so on.  Jane and I had explained the idea of the sleeper train to our boys, Eddie, seven, and Finlay, five, as a hotel in which you went to sleep in one city and woke up in another. They liked that notion but, really, it didn&apos;t need a hard sell: it&apos;s a train, it&apos;s got bunk beds. When the time came to board and we found our cabin, Finlay&apos;s verdict was unequivocal: &quot;This is bling.&quot; On each of the three train journeys we made, the cabins were the same neat, compact design: four bunks with neatly folded quilts, a small table with a flower vase and insulated hot-water jug, luggage space in a cubby hole above the corridor, a plug socket, and small TV screens at the foot of the beds showing an eclectic mix of films, to listen to with headphones provided.  They also had a public-address speaker on the wall, from which bilingual announcements were piped in, interspersed with Chinese pop hits. It took us a couple of hours to work out that it had a volume button. As we sat in Beijing waiting to depart, we also became aware of a strange knocking sound \u2013 which turned out to be a drinks-seller on the platform tapping a Coke can on the window in a last-minute bid to sell more snacks before departure. Every carriage had a western-style toilet at one end and an eastern-style squat toilet at the other, a bathroom with three sinks for washing and toothbrushing, and a hot-water tap to fill your jug for tea or noodles. As the bunks are divided into fours, solo travellers and couples must share with strangers. Extra fold-down seats are provided in the corridor for private moments, phone calls or a quiet spot of reading.  Having travelled on Indian sleepers before, the lack of chaos was welcome. Our cabin was our own \u2013 no sharing seats here with the hoi polloi before they&apos;re shooed away at bedtime. And there was the added reassurance that what our ticket said \u2013 train, carriage, berth \u2013 was actually what we got.  Language barriers I can&apos;t pretend that the language barrier isn&apos;t an issue in China.Having a go at speaking is tricky, because tone is all. You might, from thepinyin letters in a phrasebook, think you&apos;ve made a good fist of saying&quot;Qing yihe yuan&quot; (Summer Palace, please) but you&apos;ve actually commanded the driver to take you to &quot;horse fish box&quot; or some such. Many Chinese hotels helpfully print the names of top tourist attractions in characters on address cards: I hereby plead with guidebooks to do the same. Journey highlights The Chinese operation is a class act, and every train left bang on time. But it&apos;s not a clinical experience: the staff were friendly and helpful, and quirky things happened on each leg. On the Beijing-Xian train, for instance, the cabin attendant took orders for morning coffee and orange juice for the boys: at 8am sharp, the juice arrived \u2013 hot. Then on the last train, amid the regular trolleys selling food and fruit came an attendant selling a portfolio of stamps. Very peculiar. And because the Hong Kong service didn&apos;t get in until noon, we had time to enjoy staring out at paddy fields, farms bulging with vegetables, oxen pulling ploughs, mountains, rivers, lakes ... and the boys made friends with the children in the next cabin. We wouldn&apos;t have seen much of that whizzing past at 30,000ft. By the time we disembarked in Kowloon, we&apos;d covered 2,500 miles by rail. Practically in our sleep. Getting there Paul Simon and family travelled with Oriental Travel(www.orientaltravel.co.uk; 020-7632 4550). It offers a wide variety of tour packages to China and east Asia, and can also tailor individual itineraries.

Almost a third of the runners who finished in the top 100 have since been disqualified for cheating in the race in the southern port city of Xiamen. Some of them hired imposters to compete in their place. Some competitors jumped into vehicles part way through the route, Chinese media reported, while others gave their time-recording microchips to faster runners. Numbers 8,892 and 8,897 both recorded good times - but only thanks to number 8,900, who carried their sensors across the finish line. Jiefang Daily, the Shanghai Communist party newspaper, said organisers caught the cheats when they scanned video footage. The paper said most of those involved had apologised, but that those showing an &quot;unco-operative attitude&quot; would be prevented them from competing in future events. There was more than just prestige at stake in the marathon. Competitors stood to gain a crucial advantage in China&apos;s highly competitive university entrance exams. Those who finished in under two hours and 34 minutes could add extra points to their score in the gaokao, helping to explain why several of those disqualified came from a middle school in Shandong province. The exams are so crucial to the future of Chinese children that both students and their families will go to extraordinary lengths to guarantee success. Last year, eight parents and teachers were jailed on state secret charges after using communication devices - including scanners and wireless earpieces - to help pupils cheat. Organisers of the international event in Xiamen have vowed to increase surveillance in future, saying that they had only 200 monitors to oversee 50,000 runners in the marathon and accompanying races. The problem is not a new one; in 2007, 19 competitors in Beijing were caught with multiple timing sensors. Nor is such cheating restricted to China. Rosie Ruiz remains infamous in the United States for her victory in the women&apos;s race in Boston in 1980. No one could understand how an unknown amateur runner had triumphed - until it emerged that she had ridden the subway almost all the way, joining the route barely a mile before the finish line. The temptation to cheat in such a long race seems to have existed almost since the introduction of the modern marathon in the late nineteenth century. Fred Lorz easily claimed the men&apos;s title in the 1904 St Louis Olympics with a time of three hours, 13 minutes. Officials soon discovered the secret of his success: the 11-mile ride he received in his manager&apos;s car.", "tags": ["China", "Running", "Athletics", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-21T16:30:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/22/views-on-the-news-cadbury", "sentences": ["Perhaps they can go to Shanghai \u2013 though they execute them in China if you bring down economies and businesses don&apos;t they?&quot; News that US officials will visit the UK to discuss how Obama&apos;s reforms might be implemented in the City did not go down well either."], "title": "Views on the news: Cadbury's deal, while Obama takes it to the bank", "article": "Forget Cool Britannia: any last vestiges of national pride appeared to be dead and buried this week as bloggers lined-up to condemn the UK.

While most businesses sign up with Alibaba to import cheap goods directly from Chinese factories \u2013 from \u00adelectrical appliances, sheet metal and \u00adplastic \u00admouldings to solar panels and oak \u00adflooring \u2013 a large and growing number of UK firms want to sell to China as much as they want to buy. While the debate rages over the damage done to Britain&apos;s industrial heartlands during the recession, Wei&apos;s message is that small and medium-sized businesses around the country rank among the most far-sighted in the world in their drive to trade. In a \u00adcenturies old tradition, they want to sell to the Chinese everything from speciality chemicals to graphic design services, accountancy, engineered car parts and fragrant soap. David Wei, one of China&apos;s most prominent businessmen, says the distinction is crucial. &quot;Most companies sign up on our website to buy cheap goods from China to support their own manufacturing. But the UK is no longer a \u00admanufacturing centre and so it doesn&apos;t need the raw materials or plastic parts sold on our site. It wants finished goods. And it wants to trade. The UK is one of the few countries that wants to buy and sell from other Chinese businesses. We love to see a country that is more involved in trading and sees the relationship on our site as two-way.&quot; Wei runs Alibaba.com from its base in Hangzhou, south of Shanghai. Far from being a pantomime joke, in the last 10 years Alibaba has become a $15bn (\u00a39bn) internet trading platform the largest of its kind in China and widely seen as a gateway into the country by businesses in the West \u2013 an eBay for companies involved in international trade. &quot;If you look at the US, we have 1.9 million users, but more than 96% of them register as buyers only. \u00adCompare that with the UK where 19% have \u00adregistered as buyers and sellers,&quot; he says. Alibaba and its chairman Jack Ma recently sparked controversy in the US after he backed the Chinese government over its spat with Google. Ma, who sold shares worth $35m last September, is willing to comply with strict rules governing access to China&apos;s internet, while Google, smarting from complaints by customers alleging government-backed hacking of their accounts, has threatened to shut its operations. Some analysts believe Ma is happy to see Google shut to clear the way for a revival of Yahoo in China. He runs the Chinese arm after Yahoo sold it in 2005 as part of a deal to acquire a 40% stake in Alibaba. The row put him in conflict with Yahoo, which took sides with Google, but Ma appears unperturbed by disputes with his largest shareholder. His business is now one of the largest and most valuable in China. Ma&apos;s other main offshoot is taobao.com, a consumer auction site that dominates the market after eBay shut its China operation in 2006. Wei believes the financial crisis is behind a sharp rise in online trading. &quot;Businesses wanted to cut costs and find new customers, so they use the online platform to get them through the worst of it and build new relationships.&quot; It recently noticed a big jump in demand for secondhand goods, especially from downmarket retailers in the US and Britain offering cheap products to poor families. They buy secondhand goods in bulk on Alibaba and trade them in their shops. During its 10 years, Alibaba has remained largely unknown to the British public, something the company wants to change. An advertising splurge last year followed the introduction of its AliPay facility to the UK, which attempts to rid its website of fraud (it already has more than 150 million users in China). The introduction of factory inspections next year is designed to go a stage further. &quot;Factory inspections add to our overheads, but they are necessary to cut down on fraud. We can&apos;t eradicate fraud, but it will help. And the situation is not so bad. We de-listed 100 of our &quot;gold&quot; suppliers last year out of 90,000. Wei is aware that much of the unsolicited publicity around Alibaba has centred on the potential for fraud as sellers, often individual factory owners, disappear with buyers&apos; cash without delivering any goods. EBay has suffered similar criticism. The new Alipay system creates an escrow account that holds cash until delivery is complete. It may seem cumbersome, but compared to obtaining a letter of credit from a local bank, it is cheaper and easier to arrange. Wei&apos;s praise for entrepreneurial \u00adBritain is tempered by his criticism of the UK&apos;s bigger companies and their slavish capitulation to the short term demands of investors. It is a timely comment, given the recent takeover of Cadbury for what is widely believed to be a bargain price. He said: &quot;Older industries work for capital markets when capital markets should facilitate industry. You can tell something about a business when you look to see if the shareholder is number one or the customer. We are a business that is completely focused on the customer.&quot; He despairs of the influence held by hedge funds and other short term investors in western markets, especially the UK and US. &quot;People ask me how long they should hold their shares and I tell them if you plan to hold them for three days, there is nothing I can do for you, but if you plan to hold them for three years then I will pay attention to what you say.&quot; Last year, Ma told a meeting of his shareholders to &quot;go invest in other companies that put shareholders first,&quot; if they wanted quick returns. Ma said an internally &quot;controversial&quot; decision to sacrifice his company&apos;s profit margin was needed to save China&apos;s small-and-medium enterprises, which suffered a collapse in exports after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008. Ma cut subscriber fees by 60% to sign up more SMEs. Fees have stayed low because most SMEs have benefited little from a credit boom driven by bank lending to larger Chinese firms. Ma told the same meeting that his goal was not to create &quot;the most profitable company in China or the world,&quot; but to give China a global brand that will match the biggest in the US. &quot;If Alibaba cannot become a Microsoft or Wal-Mart, I will regret it for the rest of my life.&quot; Playing safe Chinese women concerned about the safety of toys made in their own country have bypassed local shops and bought direct from Japanese retailers, according to Alibaba.com boss David Wei. The latest scandal involved Chinese manufacturers substituting lead with the more dangerous heavy metal cadmium in sparkling charm bracelets and shiny pendants. To avoid contamination, mothers have turned to Japan via Alibaba&apos;s taobao.com consumer auction site. Wei said the new middle class also wanted upmarket prams, cots and clothes, which is where the Japanese retailers clean up. Reputation is everything, he said. Chinese women keep up with the latest fashion trends by sourcing clothes directly from Italy and cosmetics by the tonne from Korea. &quot;When Chinese shoppers cannot get what they want on their own high street, or they have a problem with Chinese products, they don&apos;t accept it, they use our site to find what they want. Skin care products from Korea are very popular. &quot;Also, the one baby policy means parents want only the best for their child and that often means buying nursery equipment and baby products direct from Japan,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Business", "International trade", "China", "Recession", "Global recession", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-22T15:53:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jan/23/china-internet-censorship-clinton", "sentences": ["As I argued in a CiF contribution at the end of last year, the west has not got very far in its dealings with a more assertive, self-confident China, as was evident during Obama&apos;s visit to Shanghai and Beijing in November and at the Copenhagen climate change conference."], "title": "Talking tough on censorship | Jonathan Fenby", "article": "For a western audience, Hillary Clinton&apos;s speech about internet freedom and the need to counter hacking was entirely welcome. For China, it amounted to &quot;information imperialism&quot;. For the west, the fact that access to sensitive links from websites in China is blocked on official orders is unacceptable, leading Google to say this week that it will disregard such controls and thus risk having its Chinese language site closed down. For Beijing, there is no censorship in China, which has an &quot;open&quot; internet system. For the United States, hacking of the kind reported into Google&apos;s system with the copying of Gmail messages to unknown addresses is a major infringement on a private domain operation which puts users (including dissidents) at risk. For those authorities in the People&apos;s Republic, the ability to monitor dissidents electronically is more than welcome, while commentators linked Google to the White House, presumably as part of what Li Changchun, the Politburo Standing Committee member responsible for media, calls &quot;hostile forces&quot; seeking to infiltrate &quot;decadent thought&quot; into the People&apos;s Republic through the internet. The gulf between the two sides is enormous, built on different value systems and different political regimes. Whatever the faults of the American way, it has a basic belief in freedom of information. In China, on the other hand, control of information is an essential element in the power structure. For Li, as for remnant Maoists in the 1980s, what used to be called &quot;spiritual pollution&quot; is not only a threat to the facade of puritanical Communist Party rule harking back to the Spartan days in their wartime base (even if it is hugely belied by the extent of corruption by Party officials); it also threatens one of the levers of authority. There is, thus, no way in which China is going to accommodate Google. But, as I suggested in a Cif posting earlier this week, the row has ramifications that reach far beyond this particular case. Clinton&apos;s speech ups the ante considerably. On the day that Obama told the bankers &quot;if these folks want a fight, it&apos;s a fight I&apos;m ready to have&quot;, the secretary of state appears to be sending much the same message to Beijing. If this is the case, it is heartening that somebody as highly placed as Clinton is setting out lines of engagement on the issue of free speech, particularly amid a renewed crackdown on dissidents on the mainland. As I argued in a CiF contribution at the end of last year, the west has not got very far in its dealings with a more assertive, self-confident China, as was evident during Obama&apos;s visit to Shanghai and Beijing in November and at the Copenhagen climate change conference. The Treasury in Washington believed that a softly-softly approach on the currency issue would induce Beijing to raise the value of the yuan, but has achieved nothing at all. There are, of course, very evident difficulties in taking a tougher line. Most other US tech companies operating in China have distanced themselves from Google. The contribution of cheap mainland production to their bottom line in hard times is not something American companies that have set up plants in the People&apos;s Republic want to lose. Nobody has anything to gain from war or a trans-Pacific slanging match that gets out of hand. The G2 concept may be a mirage but China and America have to find ways of working together; one of the big disappointments of the Obama administration to date has been its lack of creativity in seeking to do so. With the US fleet in neighbouring seas, US spy planes patrolling its borders, an edgy relationship with Japan, a potential collapse in North Korea, unrest in Tibet and Xinjiang, the Taliban across the border and the Taiwan issue far from resolved, Beijing has many reasons to feel jittery. A leadership that came to believe Obama had switched to an offensive stance would be even less inclined to compromise with the US than it was in 2009. Mao-era fears of encirclement are never far away. That needs to be taken into account, as does the nature of decision-making in China and the long tradition of rule by law (rather than rule of law), which leads to the automatic conclusion that the likes of Google have to abide by the regulations, whatever they may be, or face the consequences. But the important thing, in this case as in others, is to set out a clear position. Sweet words about shared values have their place. When, as in this case, values are not shared, those who do cannot accept the Chinese leadership&apos;s vision of the nature and flow of information should say so quite clearly \u2013 just as Beijing does on its side.", "tags": ["China", "Hillary Clinton", "Internet", "Freedom of information", "Freedom of speech", "Censorship", "Technology", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-23T19:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/24/beijing-cycling-capital-plans", "sentences": ["It&apos;s much easier to buy and own a car in Beijing than Shanghai,&quot; said Chen Ying, a language teacher who owns two cars."], "title": "Campaign to boost cycling in Beijing", "article": "After wrestling for years with Beijing&apos;s appalling traffic and pollution problems, city planners have come up with a distinctly old-fashioned solution: bicycles. Municipal officials want to boost the number of cyclists by 25% during the next five-year plan, state media reported today. Twenty years ago, four out of five residents in the Chinese capital pedalled to work through one of the world&apos;s best systems of bicycle lanes. But the modern passion for cars has made two-wheeled transport so treacherous, dirty and unfashionable that barely a fifth of the population dares to use lanes that are now routinely blocked by parked cars and invaded by vehicles attempting to escape from the jams on the main roads. Last year, China overtook the United States to become the world&apos;s biggest car market. Increasing affluence brings about a million new vehicles on to the roads every month, choking the streets with traffic and the air with smog. The capital is among the worst affected cities. Since the 2008 Olympics, car owners have been ordered not to drive on certain days each week, but these controls have failed to ease congestion, so the authorities are considering additional measures. According to the Xinhua news agency, the government hopes to improve the infrastructure for cyclists, including restored bicycle lanes and new rental programmes providing 50,000 bikes for hire by 2015. The authorities plan more bike parks near bus and subway stations in the expectation that half the city&apos;s residents will travel to work by public transport in five years. Residents welcomed any improvement on the current system, which is so bad that some businessmen keep a fold-up bike in the boot of their chauffeur-driven cars so they can escape bad snarl-ups. But despite unhappiness about driving, there was scepticism about the likelihood of a return of Beijing&apos;s bicycle culture. &quot;Fewer and fewer of my friends ride bicycles, but the interesting thing is they don&apos;t drive cars either,&quot; said Jiamin Zhao, an internet entrepreneur who still cycles his child to school each morning. &quot;Some people are tired of driving. More are taking the subway or taxis.&quot; Others questioned Beijing&apos;s willingness to prioritise cheap bicycles over expensive cars given the city&apos;s emphasis on economic development and its relatively lax car ownership regulations. &quot;I don&apos;t think they are serious about promoting bicycles. It&apos;s much easier to buy and own a car in Beijing than Shanghai,&quot; said Chen Ying, a language teacher who owns two cars. &quot;When I started driving 10 years ago, it was something special because not many people had cars then, but now everyone has one and the traffic is terrible. If they really want me to use a bicycle, they should build clean and safe bicycle lanes. At the moment, the roads are dangerous and too smelly.&quot; This is not the first time Beijing has promised to regain its reputation as the &quot;Kingdom of Bicycles&quot;. Four years ago, the construction ministry announced that any bike lanes that had been narrowed or destroyed to make way for cars must be returned to their original glory. Civil servants were also encouraged to cycle to work or take public transport. Since then, however, the number of cars in Beijing has increased by more than 25% to pass the 4m mark, while there has been no obvious improvement in conditions for cyclists.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Cycling", "Life and style", "Travel and transport", "Pollution", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-24T18:04:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/jan/25/china-bubble-emerging-markets", "sentences": ["These were just some of the warnings made recently about emerging markets in general and China in particular following their spectacular recovery from the lows of autumn 2008 - Shanghai shares have risen almost 90% while Brazil&apos;s Bovespa is up more than 120%."], "title": "China steers clear of bubble trouble", "article": "China is in a bubble and the crash could be a thousand times worse than Dubai. Investors could come to view the Bric grouping - Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 with as much distaste as TMT \u2013 the telecoms, media and technology sectors - which symbolised the excesses of the boom at the end of the past century. These were just some of the warnings made recently about emerging markets in general and China in particular following their spectacular recovery from the lows of autumn 2008 - Shanghai shares have risen almost 90% while Brazil&apos;s Bovespa is up more than 120%. Should we heed the warnings? Bubble-spotting has become a growth industry as pundits line up to predict which asset will next suffer a correction - and anything rising fast is fair game. But investors don&apos;t seem to be listening. China and other emerging markets were the hot choice for 2010 in fund managers&apos; predictions. Last year, according to Slim Feriani, chief executive of emerging markets specialist Advance Emerging Capital, a record $80tn (\u00a349tn) poured into emerging markets and show no sign of abating. Indeed, Fidelity&apos;s Anthony Bolton, who made his reputation as a star fund manager in nearly 30 years of managing its UK Special Situations fund, has deferred his retirement so he can launch a China fund, which is already being talked about as one of the events of the year. It is not hard to see why emerging markets should be so popular. While western economies will be lucky to show any growth at all in 2009, emerging markets are enjoying rapid growth - between 9% and 10% for China, 4% to 5% for Brazil. Then there are the demographics: while indebted western consumers will have to cut back their spending, China has more than 1.3 billion people, who are becoming wealthier and spending - but not yet borrowing - more. And infrastructure: governments are investing heavily in building power plants, railways and roads to underpin their economic growth. These factors, investment experts say, mean that China and other emerging markets are destined to be the engine of global growth over the next two decades \u2013 indeed, Jerome Booth, head of research at emerging market specialist Ashmore Investment Management, thinks if there is a bubble it is in the UK, US and other western markets, which are in denial about the seriousness of the financial crisis. He points to research showing that economies take at least five years to recover from a banking collapse and says: &quot;China is a safer place to invest today than equivalent markets in the old world.&quot; That does not mean profits are guaranteed. While the long-term prospects are good, all markets will suffer short-term blips. This year could see one in China as the authorities try to rein in the inflationary pressures caused by last year&apos;s wave of infrastructure spending, undertaken to counteract the impact of the recession. China&apos;s stock market suffered some recent tremors on worries that inflation could rise more than expected, forcing the authorities to raise interest rates earlier than they would like. The announcement that Google may end its operations in China because of alleged cyber attacks on some of its users underlines the fact that political risks are still a serious issue in the country - and, with most of its major companies directly or indirectly controlled by the state, it is an issue that investors have to be aware of. Philip Ehrmann, manager of Jupiter&apos;s China fund \u2013 and a 20-year veteran of investing in the region \u2013 has just been on a trip to China and was struck by the united front shown by government officials in their determination to tackle inflation. China had been planning for inflation of between 3% and 3.5% by the middle of the year but that could be reached sooner, which could worry international investors. Ehrmann expects robust earnings growth from Chinese companies to continue, albeit with a reduction in profit margins because of international pressure from the crisis. He dismisses warnings of an equity bubble, saying valuations are similar to their historic averages - &quot;not a bargain&quot; but not bubble territory. While some stocks in consumer related industries do look overvalued, he is concentrating on areas such as education and healthcare, where valuations are lower. There have been concerns about the housing market following recent sharp rises in house prices, and about the level and quality of property company lending, particularly by some of the smaller regional banks. This has already prompted banking regulators to increase their requirements for capital reserves among banks, while the deposits needed for second homes and investment properties have also been raised. Advance&apos;s Feriani agrees that there is no bubble although he is concerned about the scale of the inflows into emerging markets saying that if they continue at 2009 levels it could inflate a bubble. He adds: &quot;We do not try to time things for the short term but to build investment portfolios. On a three-year view, I am relaxed on where emerging markets and equities are going.&quot; Tim Cockerill, head of research at Ashcourt Rowan, thinks that the recent rises in emerging markets have increased the risks of investing. &quot;I would not be surprised to see a healthy correction of 10% to 20% some time this year.&quot; On a five- to 10-year view, however, emerging markets should be a good bet, he says.

A lot has happened since that Sunday afternoon in Shanghai, most notably Lefty&apos;s transformation from the second best player in the golf to the de facto &quot;face of golf&quot;. For this, he can thank his old nemesis, Woods, who after years of making Mickelson look human on the golf course has spent the last couple of months making him look like a saint away from the golf course.  It will be fascinating to hear this week what Mickelson has to say on the subject of Woods. Hopefully, he will do a &quot;Geoff Ogilvy&quot;. Before I explain what I mean by that, I&apos;ll explain what I don&apos;t mean by that, with the help of this entry from Sport Illustrated Alan Shipnuck&apos;s Twitter feed:  Are Tour players edgy these days? I asked @Paul_Casey an innocuous Tiger question today and he said,&quot;Why don&apos;t you just hand me a grenade?&quot;  Call me strange but I found Casey&apos;s response to Shipnuck extraordinary - that, six weeks after the event the Englishman felt unable to answer a straight-forward question about Woods. Was he one of the few people in the golf industry who didn&apos;t have any thoughts on the subject? Was he unable to think of an answer? Did he, as one of the world&apos;s top-10 players, really think he would never be asked about Woods? Contrast Casey with Geoff Ogilvy, who was asked about Woods in Abu Dhabi last week and responded with intelligent, grown-up answers. You can look at the full transcript here, but this was the answer that got most of the headlines:  Q: (Where do you think would be the best tournament for him to return to in that regard). GEOFF OGILVY: I think the least amount of circus he could face would be if he went to Augusta first. That would be the most controlled environment he could be in, but if he truly, truly wants to win Augusta, he&apos;s going to want to play before then. I think he should actually come out in public before not at a golf tournament. I think he should come out away from the golf course, one, out of respect for all of the other players, and two, to diffuse the circus part of it at least before he actually gets to the golf tournament I think would be the best thing for him, and for every other player and for the tournament  There, was that really too explosive? Of course not - except for people who think they are entitled to take all that they can from the sport and give back the minimum in, say, meaningful contributions on issues that affect professional golf Still, admiration for the Aussie doesn&apos;t not preclude making the obvious point that while it is one thing to hear joined-up thinking from his mouth, but quite another to hear it from Phil Mickelson. The Californian is, for the want of a better word, a &quot;superstar&quot;; a mainstream figure in sports-mad America and,as such, has the power to influence the way people think about golf as a sport.  Rightly or wrongly, Woods, by virtue of his brilliance as a golfer, has been allowed to set the tone for the last decade and, frankly, the tone he has set has in large been aloof (no autographs, please!), self-centred and condescending. Where Woods has gone, others have followed because, sadly, many professional golfers are like that; sheep. Ogilvy isn&apos;t. Nor is Mickelson, who has taken the opposite approach from that adopted by Woods. He has always been good at inter-acting with fans and has been pretty good with the media (see this forthright interview with Golf Digest). Its safe to assume, he&apos;ll sign every scrap of paper put in front of him this week. It would help, too, if he was frank and honest when talking about the world No1, if only to prove to that professional golf is capable of treating its audience with respect rather than the disdain that, sadly, has become the norm. This doesn&apos;t mean he needs to be unsympathetic - not that he would be. For all the Tiger-Phil nonsense down the years, any enmity that existed between the two was always in one direction, which is to say from Tiger towards Phil. From Mickelson&apos;s point-of-view there was only ever respect, as well as bemusement that Woods, with whom he has a great deal in common (excluding the racy private life, obviously), could be so personally cold towards him on occasion.  But what Mickelson might want to point out is that this Woods business is not disaster but an opportunity, the chance to re-cast professional golf as something more than the sporting equivalent of Elvis Presley and the Jordanaires. For the last decade the sport has become too dependent on Woods, with all the (obvious) benefits that came with that, like money, and the (less obvious, and less discussed) drawbacks, like the sour mood and tone. A new reality exists in the sport, one where Elvis cedes at least some of the limelight. Geoff Ogilvy appears to understand that.

In October Dikshit - who had previously pleaded guilty to an online betting charge in the US and was fined $300m - had already sold an 18% stake at \u00a3188m. The proceeds will go to his charitable foundation which is mainly active in India. A spokesman for his Crystal Ventures vehicle said there was no link between the sale and the recent news of consolidation moves:  This process started four years ago when he stepped down from the board. In October we sold as many as could, and the time seemed opportune in terms of price [to sell the remainder].

It said:  Comparatively favourable sports results in the fourth quarter of 2009, the recent announcement that the Ladbrokes chief executive will depart this year, and a resilient full year trading update from William Hill have supported a period of share price outperformance from the bookmakers. Notwithstanding this, there remains significant share price upside for both William Hill and Ladbrokes, in our view. We believe that William Hill&apos;s 2010 PE of 10.6 times, a 13% discount to the FTSE All Share (excluding financials and resources) is at odds with its strong track record of operational performance in UK retail, and its focused online growth strategy. We therefore upgrade our recommendation to outperform from in line. We also upgrade our Ladbrokes recommendation, to inline from underperform. We believe that management change is a catalyst for closing the performance gap with William Hill in UK retail.

The state of the game has long been a matter of despair and a source of bitter humour for its followers. Despite China&apos;s sporting excellence \u2013 it took more golds in the 2008 Olympics than any other country \u2013 its football team now ranks number 97 in the world. That position is perhaps unsurprising when, according to the Oriental Morning Post, a bribe of 200,000 yuan (\u00a318,000) could win a footballer a call-up to a match. That is a huge sum, given the low wages earned by most players. Further down the scale, a single trip to the national youth squad&apos;s camp cost 80,000 yuan, while a place at the adult camp cost 100,000 yuan, the newspaper said. It did not say who received the bribes, although football association officials have considerable control over staff and coaching decisions. An association spokesman told the Associated Press he would need permission from higher ranking officials to comment on the report. The fresh scandal came as sports minister Liu Peng warned that growing revenue could create new opportunities for corruption. Despite poor performance and anger at corruption, the 16-team China Super League set a record attendance average of 16,300 a game last season. Nike and Pirelli have made a combined annual commitment of $22m (\u00a313.56m) to sponsor the league. &quot;China&apos;s sports have developed well in the past few years and we are better off now. As the industry grows, there are increasing title sponsorships and advertising revenue so it is becoming a high-risk area for corruption,&quot; Liu told a national meeting of sports bureau chiefs. According to state news agency Xinhua, he added: &quot;We are very sad and deeply shocked by the serious problems exposed recently in football. The roots of the problem go back a long way. It is a warning to us that we have a long way to go to rule out corruption among sports officials.&quot; China Daily said he vowed &quot;no mercy&quot; for those engaged in match-fixing and gambling. The campaign to curb abuses began last August but took off in earnest after China&apos;s president, Hu Jintao, voiced concerns about the sport late last year. Last month more than 20 sports officials were detained on suspicion of charges including bribing or threatening players and referees to determine the outcome of games. That was followed by the arrest and dismissal of officials including football association head Nan Yong, who had earlier condemned match-fixing as a &quot;cancer&quot; which needed to be eradicated ruthlessly. Lang Xiaonong, a former official with the football association, told China Daily the problems were structural. &quot;A small number of top officials made all the decisions on Chinese soccer and determined the destiny of the sport. There was not enough discussion nor democratic decision-making, let alone democratic supervision,&quot; he said. The latest revelations have further depressed supporters. &quot;I have felt more and more disappointed as more and more scandals have come out,&quot; said 29-year-old Ma Rui from Beijing, who has been following football for over a decade. &quot;Even North Korea&apos;s team is now better than ours.

In the 1960s rock&apos;n&apos;roll group Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, his ability to play lead and rhythm guitar simultaneously was a key influence on guitarists from the Who&apos;s Pete Townshend to the Beatles&apos; George Harrison. In later years he was the guitarist of choice for rock&apos;s biggest names, including Paul McCartney, Van Morrison and Bryan Ferry, who remembers him as &quot;a brilliant guitarist with his roots firmly based in the traditions of American rock&apos;n&apos;roll. He had enormous talent and was a man of great humour, sharp wit and generosity of spirit.&quot; According to McCartney, &quot;Mick was one of the original rock heroes. He was a classic rock guitarist with a simple but fabulous style and sound.&quot; Green saw music as his life force, continuing to play \u2013 against doctors&apos; orders \u2013 long after suffering a heart attack while on stage with Ferry in 2005. Born in Matlock, Derbyshire, Green grew up in the same block of flats in Wimbledon, south-west London, as the future Pirates. His father was a cabbie. He devoured skiffle and early rock&apos;n&apos;roll, and his first band, the Wayfaring Strangers \u2013 which he formed with his schoolmates Johnny Spence (on bass) and Frank Farley (on drums) \u2013 came second in a battle of the bands competition to the Quarrymen, an early incarnation of the Beatles. After a stint as the Ramrods, the trio then backed the 1950s rockers Red E Lewis and Cuddly Duddly as the Redcaps. All three joined the Pirates \u2013 formed by Kidd during the 1950s \u2013 in 1962, just after the band had scored a huge hit with Shakin&apos; All Over, with Joe Moretti on lead guitar. Green&apos;s distinctive, staccato style and searing solos made him one of rock&apos;s first guitar heroes. When the Pirates&apos; fortunes faded, he was recruited by Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas \u2013 and was even sought out by Elvis Presley, although the Dakotas&apos; management failed to pass the message on. Instead, when the Dakotas split, Green briefly played in a re-formed Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, continuing for a year after Kidd&apos;s death in 1966. Green&apos;s bulging CV subsequently included spells with the singers Cliff Bennett and Engelbert Humperdinck and a band called Shanghai. But by the mid-1970s, the youngsters who had idolised him were forming their own bands. Wilko Johnson \u2013 whose rhythm and blues band Dr Feelgood took their name from the Pirates&apos; snarling cover of that song and was hugely influenced by Green&apos;s aggressive, slashing style \u2013 remembers the guitarist as &quot;the absolute master&quot;. For Mick Box of the rock band Uriah Heep, Green&apos;s &quot;beautiful Fender Telecaster and air of confidence&quot; was\u00a0the reason he started to play the guitar. The bassist Mick Rudzinski \u2013 who\u00a0played alongside Green in the 1966 Pirates lineup \u2013 describes him as &quot;my all-time hero&quot;. Green was also an influence on punk and heavy metal, and with Dr\u00a0Feelgood covering Green&apos;s song Oyeh!\u00a0and Johnson singing his praises in the music press, he found himself heralded as a godfather of punk and garage rock. When the Pirates re-formed yet again, Green shared the bill with bands such as the Stranglers and the Saints. The Pirates signed to Warner Brothers to produce two acclaimed albums of brash rock&apos;n&apos;roll, Out of Their Heads (1977) and Skull Wars (1978). Other notable assignments included producing for Billy Fury in the early 1980s and recording with Fleetwood Mac&apos;s own legendary guitarist, Peter Green. When McCartney sought a rawer sound for his 1999 rock&apos;n&apos;roll album Run Devil Run and a live return to the Cavern Club in Liverpool, he turned to Green. The guitarist also played on Ferry&apos;s Frantic (2002) and Morrison&apos;s Keep It Simple (2008) and toured with the Pirates well into the last decade. In\u00a0his spare time, he taught guitar privately and in schools. He continued to perform live, despite multiple health problems, with guest appearances with the Animals last year. Shortly before his death, he told me: &quot;When I look in the mirror, I see an old bloke. But as soon as I strap on a guitar, I\u00a0feel 18 again.&quot; He is survived by his wife, Karen, and two sons, Bradley and Lloyd. \u2022 Michael Robert Green, guitarist and songwriter, born 22 February 1944; died 11 January 2010", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-27T19:04:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/28/andy-murray-australian-open-final-opponents", "sentences": ["Murray 6-4 Federer 2009 ATP World Tour Finals London (Round robin) Federer 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 Masters 1000 Cincinnati (Semi-final) Federer 6-2, 7-6 Masters 1000 Indian Wells (Semi-final) Murray 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 Qatar Open Doha (Semi-final) Murray 6-7, 6-2, 6-2 2008 Masters Cup, Shanghai (Round robin) Murray 4-6, 7-6, 7-5 Masters Series Madrid (Semi-final) Murray 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 US Open (Final) Federer 6-2, 7-5, 6-2 Dubai (Round of 32) Murray 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 2006 Masters Series Cincinnati (Round of 32) Murray 7-5, 6-4 2005 Thailand Open Bangkok (Final) Federer 6-3, 7-5 Murray 2-1 Tsonga 2009 Masters 1000 Canada Montreal (Semi-final) Murray 6-4, 7-6 2008  Australian Open (Round of 128) Tsonga 7-5, 6-4, 0-6, 7-6 2007  Open de Moselle Metz (Quarter-final) Murray 6-3, 6-3"], "title": "Andy Murray's potential Australian Open final opponents", "article": "Roger Federer The 28-year-old is the most successful male player in tennis, winning 15 grand slam singles titles, and one of only three players, along with Rod Laver and Andre Agassi, to have won a career grand slam.

Is religion closer to science? Might rational enquiry, based on evidence, share similarities with faith? These questions were raised by Charles Taylor, the distinguished Canadian philosopher, speaking at a Cambridge University symposium (pdf). He suspects that in the modern world we&apos;ve bought into an illusion, one that posits a radical split between reason and revelation. Today, given the tension and violence that arises from misunderstandings about both, is a good time to examine them again. The illusion, if that is what it is, emerged after the Enlightenment, when epistemological authority was questioned. It came to be assumed that you have to chose between one or the other \u2013 or, at least, if you appeal to revelation, its &quot;truth&quot; will only stand if allowed by the court of reason. The new power invested in reason itself arose from the tremendous success of the natural sciences. Physics, geology and the like set a new standard of rational enquiry that is couched in procedural terms. Hence, what is rational has come to be equated with what is logically coherent. Further, it must be derived by proper methods including repeated observation and correct inference. In short, it&apos;s what scientists do. Further, science&apos;s success carries political implications, for it seems that the rational can be disengaged from the specifics of culture, ethnicity and religion. A physicist in Sante Fe can communicate easily and directly with a physicist in Shanghai. From that observation, which is undoubtedly true, comes the dream of a brighter tomorrow: if only humanity could approach all its problems in the same way \u2013 deferring only to evidence and reason \u2013 then perhaps it could solve its problems too, or at least a fair number of them. Moreover, if people would only drop their appeals to revelation \u2013 which conflict, are irrational, and have a marked tendency towards violence \u2013 then perhaps the world would become a more peaceful place. That&apos;s the promise. Who&apos;d deny its appeal? Unless, Taylor continued, it&apos;s an illusion. For when you examine the way science actually works you see that there&apos;s a third factor at play. Philosophers of science call it by different names. Colloquially, it&apos;s the hunch or the eureka moment. More technically, it has to do with an elusive force named intuition. But take, for the sake of the argument, one of the best known attempts to understand what really happens in scientific reasoning, that put forward by Thomas Kuhn. It&apos;s because of him we have the phrase &quot;paradigm shift&quot; \u2013 those breaks between the science of Aristotle and Copernicus, or between that of Newton and Einstein. What happens, he thought, is that there is no procedural appeal to reason in these moments, no patient weighing of the evidence. Instead, there is a rupture, a revelation. Science finds itself teleported to a new world, in which even the questions it asked before now look foolish. What analysis of this kind suggests is that the reasonableness of science is partially true, during periods of what Kuhn called normal science, when puzzles are proposed and solved. However, during paradigm shifts, that evaporates. Science enters a period of flux and uncertainty until a new paradigm is settled. Intellectual wars break out too. Scientists stop talking to one another. They label opponents &quot;heretics&quot;. Then rational discourse breaks out once more \u2013 until the next shift. The challenge is to understand what happens during the shifts. What processes are at play then? There&apos;s a huge debate about this. But it is at least plausible that the rational periods of normal scientific enquiry are only possible because enough scientists have decided to go with the disruptive hunch or intuition. Certainly, they test it. And their tests &quot;prove&quot; it \u2013 until the next shift, that is. So, the suggestion is that you could be forgiven for concluding that science is only possible because scientists are prepared to make a collective leap of faith, a commitment to the prevailing paradigm. Further, science just wouldn&apos;t be possible if scientists always and everywhere adhered to the scientific method alone, the procedures that have come to define what counts as rational. Something other than repeated observations and correct inference is required for progress. To put it another way, the neat distinction between science and religion unravels, for religion involves commitments made on faith too. You might protest: revelation purports to come from God and is untestable, two characteristics that the scientist would certainly reject. Except that regardless of its source, a revelation can only make an impact if it makes sense to people, which is to say that they test it against their lives, that it can account for the evidence of their experience, like a theory. Revelation can only bear the weight of significance when people have engaged with it rationally too. Moreover, a particularly successful religious revelation, or should we call it a &quot;faith hunch&quot;, may come to have global appeal: it becomes a kind of universal language. The Christian in Sante Fe can worship with the Christian in Shanghai. Perhaps in this respect religion is closer to science too. We might take Taylor&apos;s lead and discuss, rationally if we can.", "tags": ["Science", "Religion", "Philosophy"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-31T12:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/31/john-higgins-wins-welsh-open", "sentences": ["Having lost to O&apos;Sullivan in the Shanghai Masters semi-final, Higgins has now beaten him three times in succession, 5-4 in the last 16 of the Grand Prix in Glasgow, 9-8 in the UK Championship (from 8-2 up) and 6-4 in Saturday evening&apos;s semi-final (from 4-3 down)."], "title": "John Higgins captures Welsh Open", "article": "John Higgins secured his 21st ranking title and \u00a335,000 by beating Ali Carter, the defending champion, 9-4 to win the Welsh Open at Newport.

Feng, 55, said he had been denied re-entry to China eight times since June while attempting to return home from a trip to see his sister in Japan. After the most recent refusal, at Shanghai&apos;s Pudong airport on 4 November, he was forced on to a flight back to Narita, where he took up residence on a bench opposite the immigration desks. Airport officials have been powerless to move him, since he has a valid passport and visa to visit Japan. Today, the 90th day of his protest, he said he would talk to the press tomorrow before leaving the airport on Wednesday to spend a few days with his sister, who lives near Tokyo. The details of the agreement with Chinese officials remain unclear, but Feng said he was confident that &quot;this time will be different&quot;, after a third meeting with diplomats at the weekend. &quot;I am looking forward to getting home and seeing my 90-year-old mother,&quot; he told the Guardian by mobile phone. &quot;I also have to look for a new job.&quot; He said he hoped to be back in his hometown, Shanghai, before the Chinese new year on 14 February. Feng has become a minor celebrity in Japan since his protest began in early November.

A very upbeat note on the UK sector from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch explains some of the rise. Analyst Michael Helsby said:  We think bad debts peaked in 2009 and that the funding markets can continue to improve. This is not in consensus. While BIS will add to volatility, in our view it is a dividend issue not a dilution issue. As confidence about the book value and return on net asset value grows in 2010 share prices should re-rate materially - we have an average of over 40% upside to our 12-month price objectives, but think the sector can more than double over the next few years.  He&apos;s right about it not being &quot;in concensus.&quot; Credit rating agency Moody&apos;s and the IMF have both suggested bad debts were not likely to peak until 2010. And some analysts, such as the well respected Jonathon Pierce at Credit Suisse, believe the BIS rules on capital requirements could lead to more fund raising by banks. Still the positive sentiment from Merrill is having an effect. Barclays is now 8.8p better at 298.45p, outperformed in the leading index by only Standard Life, which has climbed 7.4p to 205.1p after forecast beating 2009 sales figures. Lloyds Banking Group is up 1.41p at 55.6p, while Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 0.33p to 36.48p. To complete the picture HSBC is 5.2p higher at 688.7p and Standard Chartered has edged up 0.5p to 1502.5p. On the individual banks, Merrill&apos;s Helsby has the following to say:  Royal Bank of Scotland. Reinstate as a buy, price target 45p. RBS is one of the European banks that is most geared to a recovery in the global economy and credit markets. The credit outlook appears materially better than even three months ago and we think RBS presents an opportunity, a view supported by the bullish stance of our economics and credit strategy teams. Achieving a smooth integration of ABN&apos;s operations alongside a run-off of the \u00a3200bn non-core book is clearly a complex task. If we add to this mix the ongoing uncertainties about the sustainability of a UK economic recovery, political involvement from the major shareholder and the lack of clarity on the future regulation and control of universal banks, then it is easy to see why investors might avoid the shares, but herein lies the opportunity, in our view. Lloyds Banking Group. Reinstate as a buy, price target 80p.The main market concerns surrounding Lloyds remain bad debt and funding, but we think quicker-than-expected progress is being made on both fronts. We are \u00a33bn above the 2010 estimate pretax profit consensus and think the group can achieve a 15% return on net asset value by 2012. We do not think this is in the price. The funding environment has changed materially in the last six months. Funding markets are now open. This is key, as it will remove structural pressures on deposits. Together with a modest pick-up in base rates, this should pave the way for a recovery in deposit spreads and net interest margins. Barclays. Reinstate as a buy, price target 415p.Barclays is trading at the same book multiple as in the mid to late 1980s when bond yields were at 10%. While you can justify this if you expect material dilution, we think that current concerns do not lead down that path. In our view, Barclays can reach a 15% return on net asset value by 2012 as it builds on its strong BarCap franchise, bad debts normalise, and it re-prices assets and deposits to drive net interest margin higher. BarCap increased its revenue margin substantially in 2009; while some of this was industry related, we estimate that a lot more than half came from market share gains and the mix benefits of Lehman. This suggests that 2009 has been more of a platform for growth than the market currently gives Barclays credit for.  He has also slapped buy recommendations on Standard Chartered and HSBC. The latter was helped by an outperform rating from Credit Suisse, which said:  Capital pressures are manageable, but we reduce our expectations for dividend payments. We believe that HSBC can manage through the new BIS proposals given capital earnings generation over the next three years, scope for potential disposals and the likely capital raise associated with the proposed Shanghai listing. However, we believe it is unlikely that given the uncertainties around regulatory capital proposals that dividends will be significantly increased at most banks over the next few years.

The scare led to product recalls around the world. &quot;From September 2008 to September 2009, Zhao Lianhai used &apos;protecting rights&apos; as well as the Sanlu milk powder issue as an excuse to hype and agitate people who did not know the truth to disturb social order ... by shouting slogans and illegal gathering,&quot; said the police statement, published on the blog of a lawyer. The statement also cited Zhao&apos;s backing for a young woman who was raped by a guard while in an illegal detention house. Investigators said he had used her case &quot;as a way to hype and agitate many people who did not know the truth and foreign media [to] gather at the [gate of the Beijing public security bureau], disturbing the area&apos;s social order.&quot; The statement added that evidence included videos, witness accounts and a confession from Zhao. Zhao&apos;s lawyer Peng Jian said it usually took around a month and a half for prosecutors to decide whether to press charges. He added: &quot;I cannot predict what the result will be because I heard the case has got a large amount of evidence, which I haven&apos;t had a chance to review yet. If he ends up being prosecuted we will defend him as not guilty.&quot; Zhao was detained two hours after he and another father whose baby had been taken ill received an official apology from police in Haidian over their previous detention of the other man. Yesterday, China announced a 10-day emergency campaign to root out tainted products \u2013 at least some of which had been confiscated when the scandal first broke out in late 2008. According to the state news agency Xinhua, they had been repackaged instead of being destroyed. Melamine is normally used to make plastics and fertilisers. But when added to watered-down or poor quality milk, it appears to boost protein levels \u2013 allowing substandard products to pass nutrition tests.

Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay by John Lanchester | Book review", "article": "John Lanchester&apos;s Whoops! is a book that made my head spin. That&apos;s partly because of the author&apos;s speed of thought \u2013 here is an explanation of how the global economy works, in 240 blistering pages. And it&apos;s also because of the sheer, dizzying maths of it all \u2013 the hundreds and thousands, the billions and trillions. But it mostly made my head spin out of sheer admiration. I must have read 30 books on the global economic crisis (I&apos;m writing one myself) and this is the best. No question. Lanchester, who grew up in Hong Kong and whose father worked for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, is not a banker himself, but he has a wonderful gift for explaining complex things in a simple way. He says that, if money were alive, it would always be looking for ways to get bigger. Reading this made me see that as mere human beings, we are its servants; we are here, it seems, to facilitate the process. Why did the crisis happen? Lanchester says that it was because of a climate, a problem, a mistake and a failure. When he was a kid in Hong Kong, he says, he lived in a climate of pretty much unfettered capitalism. But Britain and America were different \u2013 the capitalism in western countries was softer and gentler. Why? Because the west was always aware of the communist world. The guys on the other side of the Iron Curtain kept us on our best behaviour. But then communism died. So capitalism, without a Marxist invigilator, started to cheat. Capitalism went wild. Money, which always wants to grow, found new ways of growing. Here&apos;s where the problem comes in. The problem, as Lanchester sees it, was: sub-prime mortgages. Or, to be more precise, the problem was the financial instruments that enabled \u2013 and, in some ways, forced \u2013 financiers to lend money to people who couldn&apos;t pay it back, thus causing the crash. It is here that Lanchester is at his best. I&apos;ve never seen a more concise description of &quot;credit default swaps&quot; \u2013 deals allowing banks to lend the same money over and over by insuring it with a third party. For a while, everybody is happy. The loans flood the economy with money, which increases the price of assets. Soon, if you&apos;re a banker and you&apos;re not doing this, you&apos;re toast. But then the honeymoon ends. People default on their loans. Asset prices fall. The insurance company crashes. Banks seize up. We are screwed. Then there was the mistake. Put concisely, bankers did not understand the nature of risk. That&apos;s partly because they were working from mathematical models. But human beings are not like mathematical models. When your model says that something is so unlikely it&apos;s practically impossible, it&apos;s not. Where humans are concerned, all sorts of things are possible. What is &quot;the most common mistake of very smart people&quot;? It&apos;s &quot;the assumption that other people&apos;s minds work in the same way that theirs do&quot;. In other words, like mathematical models. The failure was one of regulation. As Lanchester puts it, for a while the economy had a funny smell. But the people who should have pointed this out, and done something about it, didn&apos;t. &quot;Mainly,&quot; says Lanchester, &quot;they were funny smells to do with things which were just too good to be true.&quot; But who wants to burst a bubble? Not investors, not politicians, and especially not bankers. So the bubble keeps growing. Until it bursts. &quot;Now what?&quot; asks Lanchester. Well, we have to pick up the bill. And how much do we owe? That&apos;s one of the problems \u2013 nobody knows for sure. In April 2008, Alistair Darling thought the &quot;projected deficit&quot; for the next year would be \u00a338bn. In November of that year, he thought it would be \u00a3118bn. In April 2009, it had grown to \u00a3175bn. Pain will follow. That, says Lanchester, is &quot;because we in Britain are, to use a technical economic term, screwed&quot;.", "tags": ["Business and finance", "Books", "Culture", "Business", "Recession", "Financial crisis", "Politics", "Alistair Darling", "Financial sector"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-07T00:05:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/10/rio-tinto-bribery-charges", "sentences": ["The four Rio staff were detained last July and are being held in a prison in Shanghai."], "title": "China charges Rio Tinto employees", "article": "China dramatically raised the stakes with Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto today when it charged four of the company&apos;s employees with industrial espionage and bribery.

Boris&apos;s 2008 election campaign majored on the themes of Livingstonian arrogance, grandeur and waste, and at first those &quot;embassies&quot; in not only India but China and Venezuela too were depicted as prime examples. That changed abruptly during a mayoral hustings in the glistening offices of super-accountants KPMG. The occasion was distinguished by the company&apos;s then-chairman Ian Barlow getting to his feet to defend Ken&apos;s &quot;foreign policy extravagance&quot; as being rather good for London business. The Boris line veered audibly. Barlow is now on the board of the London Development Agency, chairs the inward investment agency Think London (which the LDA partly funds) and sits on the mayor&apos;s Promote London Council, formed last June to consider how to concentrate the marketing of London with the 2012 Olympics much in mind. With both London&apos;s Chamber of Commerce and London First, which speaks up for the capitals&apos; larger employers and its universities, expressing concern, the mayor&apos;s office asks me to inform you that although its &quot;ambassadors&quot; in India have not been replaced since both separately resigned some months ago, Think London is still represented in Mumbai and it shouldn&apos;t be assumed that the Delhi office won&apos;t be revived. And while the Venezuela office was closed by Boris straight away, those in Shanghai and Beijing remain. It was stressed that a wholesale review of promotional strategy is ongoing. That might mean generating &quot;more for less&quot; and people are worried about losing their jobs. But a review is not the same thing as a purge. Boris has warmed to the art of bigging up the capital in other ways. An early cut in his contribution to tourism body Visit London has been followed by a \u00a32m lump sum to plug the capital&apos;s charms on a global scale. The Only In London campaign, it is claimed, helped bring in an additional 200,000 visitors and \u00a3100m in cash. The exchange rate might have had a bit to do with that too, but it&apos;s still no a bad return. More recently, the value-for-money mayor has coughed up half a million for the consultants Saffron to rejuvenate and unify the branding of the full range of organisations through which London makes connections with the rest of the nation and the world. That might seem a bit a steep given that Saffron appears to be planning to simply (though no doubt artfully) extend the re-fit it provided for Visit London a while ago to everyone else, including City Hall and Transport for London. The mayor no doubt, would invite you to regard it as the most cost-effective option as well as the most attractive. Whatever, it&apos;s not the move of a man averse to the costly subtleties of marketing. And why should we expect anything else? Boris is, after all, nothing if not a salesman. And although it might be disrespectfully observed that the product he is most eager to promote is Boris Johnson himself, that&apos;s not entirely inconsistent with a large part of the job of any mayor, which is to get London noticed and liked.

I can assure you, as I assured them, of this: there is nothing romantic whatsoever about your sliced hand spilling boudoir-red blood across a pristine white tablecloth like a burst pipe in a dye factory. As was the case from my recent cack-handed attempt at home to shuck an oyster using just a Swiss Army knife and not a little of my own well-seasoned stupidity. But with the flow staunched and my girlfriend placated, goddamn it if that oyster wasn&apos;t worth it. It was, if anything, improved by the struggle.And it&apos;s not just oysters which require some effort to enjoy and which are decidedly easier on the palate than they are on the eye, or the hand for that matter. Take Xiaolongbao, also known as Shanghai dumplings. A steamed dim sum dish, these pork balls carry a translucent soup within their dumpling casing which explodes with flavour on the tongue. But they&apos;re liable to burst in the bamboo steamer, leaking their prize across the table or over your trousers having been pierced by a clumsy chopstick technique en route to your mouth. Chinese food might not always look the most appealing, nor be the easiest to eat, but for those who enjoy dim sum on a Sunday the mess is a key part of the experience. But then many Asian foods tend to favour taste over appearance. In the UK, any chef worth their salt will tell you the importance of presentation on the plate. The micro-leaves arranged just so, the roast beef sliced and fanned out to maximise the impression that you&apos;re eating pretty much the whole beastie, the copper-bottomed saucing pan dispensing rich jus to cap it all off. Hell, even sheep&apos;s-bladder haggis is paraded around on silverware each Burns Night to the shrill of the bagpipes \u2013 it&apos;s in the presentation, see. That&apos;s why most prospective romantics head to somewhere French like Morgan M rather than noodle-chain Wagamama. Have you tried slurping ramen with chopsticks and a bamboo ladle? It&apos;s rarely attractive. My girlfriend did on an early date at Wagamama and soon gave up, her fitted top awash in unseemly broth. I thought she was just one of those people who didn&apos;t finish their food, ie a dream date where you pay for both and actually get to consume nigh-on all the food. She isn&apos;t, she just couldn&apos;t face another blow to the face from an errant noodle. But then, imagine how we both might have struggled with the food at Dans Le Noir where your meal is served in the pitch dark by blind staff. Their ethos is to dispense with pretensions of presentation to focus on flavours, which is surely what great food is all about. Anyone who&apos;s ever collated a top-drawer fajita, complete with griddled chicken, a punchy jalape\u00f1o salsa and zesty guacamole only to watch it collapse onto the plate midway to the mouth knows that even enjoyed in pieces, fingers dripping with sauce, it&apos;s a sheer joy. One thing it&apos;s not, though, is pretty. With so much of what we eat if the appearance doesn&apos;t suck the romance out of a meal then the provenance of the ingredients probably will. There&apos;s the obvious extreme exoticism in the form of snake bile from Hong Kong, but even when diners would struggle to pick out the crocodile, peacock or kangaroo from a line-up of more de rigueur meats at restaurants like Archipelago, they still might feel slightly queasy. What about elegant ingredients which are often ungainly on the plate, but invite handling for that close liaison between you and your food? Snails have a wonderful earthiness to them like the best truffles, and frogs&apos; legs, despite their diminutive size, give a real sense of what it is to eat French. Surely there is romance and intimacy in the handling of food, such as the Ethiopian habit of eating we&apos;t (meat or vegetables in hot pepper sauce) without cutlery, scooping it up with an edible tablecloth of a flatbread called injera instead. The Asian hotpot favoured in countries like China, Korea and Vietnam encourages diners to practically cook their own meal from scratch. Presented with platters of unattractive assorted raw meat, you cook it in heated broth on a gas burner at the table, add herbs and spices and fish it out when it&apos;s cooked to your liking. There&apos;s the sight of raw meat to contend with and the boiling broth dominates the table, but to my mind there&apos;s an intimacy to cooking food like this which is far more romantic than any Michelin-starred straitjacket. And if one of you seems to be doing more of the cooking on your romantic night out, well then it&apos;s probably best to know sooner instead of later. Tell us of your own duels with food.

Recreational users are bingeing on ketamine, cocaine and methamphetamine to keep them playing into the early hours. This time it is not the young and reckless fuelling late-night tours of nightclubs. Instead, says a state newspaper, retired and middle-aged residents are turning to drugs to stay awake through marathon sessions of mahjong. Zheng Yuqing, spokesman for the Shanghai anti-drug commission, warned of a &quot;significant increase&quot; in cases among 40- to 60-year-olds. &quot;The drug-taking mostly occurs among groups in card rooms, a place popular among the elderly where they can get together and play cards. The addicts are often friends who have known each other for years,&quot; he told China Daily. The newspaper said many took cocaine and other stimulants during card-playing and mahjong sessions that often lasted all night. The games frequently involve gambling, which is illegal on the mainland. &quot;Most of the older victims are unemployed or retired and so have plenty of spare time. They are often not well-educated and have little awareness of the harm caused by taking drugs,&quot; Zheng added. While most users are teenagers or youthful professionals, the proportion of drug addicts who are under 35 has declined from 77% nationwide in 2001 to just under 60% last year, the paper reported. &quot;More and more middle-aged and older people take drugs because they feel lonely and empty after retiring or losing their jobs,&quot; said Li Luyan, secretary-general of Shanghai Sports Association for the Aged. &quot;Their children and society in general should show more care to these people to keep them away from drugs \u2026 they need more activities, such as sports, to fill their spare time.&quot; Drug abuse among mahjong players will be disappointing to sports officials, who have tried to clean up the game&apos;s image in recent years.

The company is in the spotlight following the arrest of four of its employees in China. They face charges of bribery and industrial espionage and have been languishing in a Shanghai jail since July. Beijing&apos;s move has strained relations with other foreign companies in China and prompted criticism from Canberra, as one of those detained is an Australian national and China is Australia&apos;s biggest trading partner. Today Rio turned its attention to its financial results for 2009, which showed a turnaround at the company, which entered the recession with a mountain of debt. In the last year, chief executive Tom Albanese has halved borrowings to $18.9bn (\u00a312bn), thanks mainly to a $15.2bn rights issue and asset sales worth more than $10bn. Albanese said he was optimistic that demand for base metals would be strong in the years to come. &quot;Despite the volatility of the past year, we still believe that we are experiencing a secular uplift in demand for commodities,&quot; he said. &quot;Our long-term outlook remains strong, as China, followed by India, continue to urbanise and industrialise over the next two decades.&quot; Net profits rose to nearly $5bn from $3.7bn in 2008, which the company said was achieved thanks to record volume sales of iron ore and a significant increase in copper and gold production. The revival in Rio&apos;s fortunes follow a tumultuous year when the Anglo-Australian multinational bowed to City pressure and spurned a $19.5bn investment offer from Chinalco, China&apos;s state-run aluminium company. Instead, Rio opted to raise funds via a rights issue and to forge an iron ore alliance with BHP. Rio&apos;s ties with China have been strained since the Chinalco snub and observers believe that the arrest of the Rio Four was a retaliatory move, as it happened a few weeks after the deal was called off. Today Rio went public with its concerns over its four employees being held by the Chinese. Sam Walsh, chief executive of Rio Tinto&apos;s iron ore division, said the mining company was extremely worried about the four staff, who were yesterday formally charged by China in a move that dramatically raised the stakes between the two sides. &quot;We are very concerned about the nature of these charges, however, as this is part of an ongoing legal process, it is inappropriate to comment any further,&quot; said Walsh.

The man himself only appeared in darkness, with his voice distorted. This was both tricksy self-portrait and cheeky docu-scam, satirising contemporary art craziness. Blanked-out tongue somewhere in his pixelated cheek, Banksy tells us the story of his supposed relationship with a hyperactive French videographer, one Thierry Guetta, who has, it seems, been following him around \u2013 Boswell to Banksy&apos;s Johnson. A few years back, allegedly encouraged by Banksy, this man apparently suddenly stopped being an amateur cameraman and suddenly turned into a self-taught street artist called Mr Brainwash, flogging his suspiciously accomplished Warhol-Banksy knockoffs in LA for tens of thousands of dollars. And these works do exist; you can buy them \u2013 which is more than you can say for the creations of Nat Tate, that mysterious individual playfully chronicled by William Boyd in 1998. Though little known to the common herd, &quot;Mr Brainwash&quot; may come to be accepted as an important artist, the way Andrew and Imogen Quest became revered socialites in Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Vile Bodies. Anyway, Mr Brainwash is one of Banksy&apos;s most enjoyable creations.           Exit Through the Gift Shop is an entertaining guide to Banksy&apos;s exploits, which are endlessly gripping and hilarious. He has gloriously mocked Israel&apos;s West Bank wall with his graffiti; he has ripped a London phone box in half and he has apparently fabricated boxfuls of \u00a310 notes with Princess Diana&apos;s face on them, so realistic that they could get him imprisoned for forgery. Is it true? Is the story itself a forgery? Or is the point that Banksy&apos;s art inhales the spirit of forgery, making free with established images, brand currencies and the emblems of power? Who knows? Banksy&apos;s film is an enjoyable stunt: not quite Man On Wire, but Man Completely Wired. On a more serious note, the festival gave us the colossal premiere of the restored Metropolis by Fritz Lang, returning in its complete form \u2013 after lost footage was discovered two years ago in Buenos Aires \u2013 to the city where it was first unveiled in 1927. The new two-and-a-half-hour Metropolis was performed with a live orchestral accompaniment, and the rediscovered segments were obvious for being fizzier and grainier than the rest, as if viewed through heavy rain. Lang&apos;s bizarre sci-fi dystopian fairytale noir now looks bigger, madder, absurder and more fascinating than ever. Its story of a city serviced by underground slaves is even more satirically relevant in 2010, as we witness the disintegration of the urban fantasy of Dubai, built on credit and globalised labour. Metropolis is a bad-trip premonition of the 20th-century&apos;s ideologies of class and race, and the &quot;stadium&quot; scenes of super-fit patrician sportsmen running really do look like something by Leni Riefenstahl, who has a tiny resemblance to Lang&apos;s heroine Maria. Maria, of course, fervently expects the appearance of a messianic Mediator who will save this corrupt city-state, a Mediator she calls &quot;Mittler&quot;. Did Germany&apos;s collective unconscious mis-hear that name? The festival&apos;s official opening film was a surprisingly low-key choice, but still outstanding: Apart Together, by the Chinese director and former Golden Bear winner Wang Quan&apos;an. Berlin is a festival which loves its stars and red-carpet glamour, and the decision to open with this quiet, heartfelt movie from a relatively little-known name, rather than the headline-grabbers such as Roman Polanski&apos;s The Ghost Writer and Martin Scorsese&apos;s Shutter Island which were also on the bill, was criticised in the German press here. But in my view, Berlin could not have got off to a better start than with this outstanding movie: a wonderfully gentle, intimate, wonderfully composed family drama that, like Hirokazu Kore-eda&apos;s Japanese film Still Walking, might contribute to a new world cinema trend: neo-Ozu. Ling Feng plays Lui Yangsheng, a former soldier in the Kuomintang, who was exiled as a young man to Taiwan, forced to leave behind the woman he loved and their baby. He remarried, but now as a very old widower, Lui returns to Shanghai to make contact with his lost love Qiao Yue (Lisa Lu), who herself married long ago and is now a grandmother. His re-appearance causes excitement and then astonishment and outrage in Qiao Yue&apos;s family when it becomes clear that this stranger has never stopped loving her, and now wishes to take her back with him to Taiwan, offering up to the family his (modest) savings and pension. Everyone is disturbed, except, it seems, for Qiao Yue&apos;s husband \u2013 a terrific performance from Xu Caigen \u2013 who remains heart-rendingly friendly and polite to the stranger, apparently on the grounds that his wife once loved him. But is there something more complex, more enigmatic going on in this man&apos;s heart and mind? A trio of outstanding performances makes this film one of the gems of the festival. Sadly, the only way was down after this, with the awful Howl, by Rob Epstein, a documentarist much admired for his 1984 non-fiction film about Harvey Milk. James Franco plays Ginsberg, apparently chatting to an off-camera interviewer at the very moment that his publisher, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, was fighting a censorship battle in court: Jon &quot;Mad Men&quot; Hamm plays the goodie defending attorney and David Strathairn plays the baddie prosecutor. We get toe-curlingly embarrassing &quot;animated&quot; sequences \u2013 which I can only describe as a sexed-up version of the twee cartoons that used to accompany prog tracks on the BBC&apos;s Old Grey Whistle Test \u2013 supposedly dramatising the passionate swirl of Ginsberg&apos;s poetry. This is endlessly, boringly, declaimed and re-declaimed. Reams of stuff re-appear. Sometimes we see Franco doing the declaiming, at a live reading, to an irritating collection of nodding, smiling and generally appreciative cap-wearing hipsters, who made me long for the re-introduction of national service. The film is quite extraordinarily repetitive and dull, with no real insight into Ginsberg&apos;s life, sexuality or writing. The festival&apos;s new German cinema sidebar offered Renn, Wenn Du Kannst or Run, If You Can, by Dietrich Br\u00fcggemann: a serio-comic twentysomething relationship picture, starring Robert Gwisdek as Ben, a young man who has been confined to using a wheelchair following an incident which is not fully revealed until the last act. He is smart, acid, cynical, secretly despairing, having fallen in love with a woman that he has whimsically encouraged his long-suffering volunteer carer to chat up. There are shrewd, painful insights here about the relationships possible, and perhaps not possible, between disabled and non-disabled people. But I felt that a small, sharp, real film had got lost inside a bigger, more unfocused heart-tugging comedy. Thomas Vinterberg, the Danish Dogme veteran, had a new film at Berlin: Submarino was the story of two brothers who were traumatised as boys by a neglectful and alcoholic mother, a formative agony which lays the foundation for a tragic adulthood on both. The movie is presented in dramatic-diptych form, passing from the story of one brother to the other: it was heartfelt and engaging, well acted and put across with power. Like Susanne Bier&apos;s Danish film Brothers, this could well find itself being remade by Hollywood. The New Romanian Wave saw another new and important contributor emerge in Berlin. If I Want to Whistle, I Whistle, by the first-time film-maker Florin Serban, is set in a grim youth prison, where Silviu \u2013 a great performance from 19-year-old George Pistereanu \u2013 has only five days to go before release. Yet he is tipped over the edge by an unexpected visit from his kid brother, a crisis which results in violence and a gripping hostage situation.

British designer Thomas Heatherwick, known for distinctive works such as Manchester&apos;s The B of the Bang, has created a 20 metre high building made up of 60,000 transparent acrylic filaments, each of which holds a seed from Kew Gardens&apos; huge Millennium Seed Bank \u2013 a worldwide project to preserve a quarter of the world&apos;s plant species. The government, which has stumped up most of the \u00a325m cost of the project, hopes that as the 7.5 metre long spikes sway gently in the breeze, potential Chinese investors will be inspired to bring their business to Britain, UK exporters will be inspired to strike up new contacts, and Chinese students will be attracted to the idea of studying here. &quot;The Chinese view of Britain is a rather old-fashioned one; it&apos;s all to do with Britain as being a heritage country, a traditional economy \u2013 there&apos;s an awful lot of cobblestones and fog,&quot; said Sir Andrew Cahn, director of UK Trade and Investment, which has the job of promoting Britain abroad. &quot;We think of Britain as a cutting-edge, forward-looking country.&quot; Having just returned from seeing the pavilion almost completed in Shanghai last week, Cahn said he was uncharacteristically passionate. &quot;I&apos;m a world-weary 58-year-old civil servant not given to enthusiasms, but I got very excited about this building.&quot; Heatherwick said the brief laid down by the Chinese organisers of the Expo was, &quot;Better City, Better Life,&quot; and he had been inspired by the fact that \u2013 despite its reputation for fog and Victorian grime \u2013 Britain pioneered public parks and botanical gardens. &quot;Each of these tiny little seeds has boundless potential - to feed us, to cure disease - and that seemed to be a good symbol for the British contribution,&quot; he said.

First came the idea to premiere his long-planned sequel to The Phantom of the Opera, Love Never Dies, on three continents simultaneously \u2013 in London, New York and Shanghai. That turned out to be hype, and by the time an official announcement was made last October, it had settled into the traditional route of opening in London first, with a Broadway premiere to follow soon after; Shanghai was replaced by Australia. This week, the show is finally due to begin previews at London&apos;s Adelphi Theatre \u2026 or maybe it isn&apos;t. Confusion has replaced mystique: ticket holders have officially been told that the first preview, scheduled for Saturday, is cancelled \u2013 but also that they may be admitted, depending on how things are going. Nor is the press night fixed. Lloyd Webber&apos;s producer Andre Ptaszynski recently wrote to critics to suggest that the production might follow Legally Blonde&apos;s lead and invite them to previews ahead of the first night \u2013 but, then again, it might not. The producers won&apos;t be able to confirm what&apos;s going on until the first two or three previews have happened. Not that this has stopped the publicity machine grinding into gear, and last week&apos;s Sunday Telegraph saw Lloyd Webber presiding over its Seven magazine as guest editor, which basically meant writing a foreword, granting a three-page interview and seeing six extra pages of editorial devoted to his show. He has already proved adept at using the BBC as a prime-time promotional tool for his productions of The Sound of Music and Joseph and the Amazing Techicolor Dreamcoat, and now he&apos;s got the national press in on the act, too. The day before, the Independent&apos;s David Lister breathlessly told readers that Lloyd Webber had allowed him to hear his new musical &quot;and be the first journalist to write about it&quot; (Lister duly declared &quot;the composer back on top form&quot; and dubbed the score &quot;one of the most dramatic he has written&quot;). Meanwhile, critics have been sent a personally watermarked copy of the double CD, should we want to follow suit. Then there have been the taster previews of the big Phantom love ballad, performed at the press conference launch by Ramin Karimloo, and the title track, performed at the final South Bank Show awards by star Sierra Boggess last month. Despite (or because of?) this blitz, some fans don&apos;t seem too impressed. A Facebook group called Love Must Die insists: &quot;We feel strongly that Love Never Dies is a completely misguided venture that is a detriment to the story of the original The Phantom of the Opera novel and musical of the same name and that, contrary to the information being reported by the Really Useful Group and perpetuated by the ill-informed media, is not in the interest of nor desired by the story&apos;s many fans.

According to the New York Times, security experts investigating a string of hacking attacks on American companies have linked them to origins in mainland China. The story, which quoted anonymous sources close to the investigation, said that the so-called Project Aurora attacks appeared to originate from Shanghai Jiaotong University and the Lanxiang Vocational School in Shandong province. Jiaotong is well regarded as a centre for computer studies, and has an extensive information security programme that boasts its &quot;high-level talent&quot; and has links to military research projects. Lanxiang, around 250 miles south of Beijing, is a prominent school that has developed some reputation for developing computer skills. The report suggested that intelligence agents working on the case had linked the strikes to a specific class taught at Lanxiang. While the Chinese authorities have not commented on the report, a female member of staff from Lanxiang told the Guardian that the school was not aware of the attacks on Google. &quot;We did not know Google was hacked before the New York Times contacted us \u2013 when they called, we told them we know nothing but they still made the story up,&quot; she said. &quot;Our students are middle school graduates, and we train them to use software like Photoshop. If our students are so skilled they can hack Google, then what are they here for?&quot; She also urged caution against drawing the conclusion that Chinese schools were training hackers to attack American targets. &quot;I hope the media can be cautious about this report,&quot; she said. &quot;We don&apos;t want to worsen US-China relations or draw national attention.&quot; Google, which has continued investigating the source of the attacks since going public, did not respond to a request for comment. It has been more than a month since the internet company revealed that it had been targeted in a series of strikes aimed at uncovering personal details of Chinese dissidents and stealing elements of its software. At the time the company threatened to stop censoring its Chinese search engine in protest at the attacks, which it called &quot;highly sophisticated&quot;. &quot;This information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech,&quot; said the company at the time. &quot;These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China.&quot; The company has not yet acted on its threat to stop censoring its search results \u2013 a move which would be likely to result in its expulsion from the country \u2013 but has drawn support from the US government. Google and a number other companies hit by the Aurora attacks have been investigating its origins, and have linked up with America&apos;s National Security Agency as they attempt to pinpoint the culprits. It is not the first time that such attacks have been attributed to Chinese hackers. In 2007 investigators said they were tracking the activities of a notorious gang of Chinese hackers known as Titan Rain, linked to the military and responsible for raids against western governments \u2013 including the US defence department, British Foreign Office and the Houses of Parliament. And yesterday it was revealed that another attack had struck around 75,000 computers worldwide in an attempt to steal sensitive personal and financial data. The so-called Kneber botnet \u2013 consisting of millions of PCs that had been infected with a piece of malicious software \u2013 struck nearly 2,500 companies and government agencies around the world. Although the extent of the damage was not clear, experts suggested that the strike \u2013 which is believed to have been in operation for over a year \u2013 was far broader than the targeted attack on Google and others. &quot;While Operation Aurora shed light on advanced threats from sponsored adversaries, the number of compromised companies and organisations pales in comparison to this single botnet,&quot; said Amit Yoran of NetWitness.", "tags": ["Google", "China", "US news", "Technology", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-19T07:56:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/feb/20/carmelita-jeter-sprinter-too-fast", "sentences": ["Last year the Los Angeles-born sprinter ran 10.67sec in Thessaloniki, and then 10.64 in Shanghai \u2013 the latter making her the second-fastest female 100m sprinter in history, behind Florence Griffith- Joyner, who ran 10.49 before the introduction of mandatory random drug testing.", "&quot;I was just looking at him like, &apos;What is he talking about?&apos; But I went to Shanghai and ran 10.64 and I was like, &apos;OK this guy knows what he&apos;s talking about.&apos;&quot; Jeter speaks with a southern drawl \u2013 &quot;Everybody is like, &apos;Where are you from?&apos; I&apos;m like, LA!&quot; she laughs."], "title": "Carmelita Jeter bears the burden of being the fastest woman alive", "article": "The fastest woman alive stirs four sachets of sugar into her breakfast grits and dips three hash browns into a pool of ketchup: a veritable champion&apos;s breakfast.

Last year the Los Angeles-born sprinter ran 10.67sec in Thessaloniki, and then 10.64 in Shanghai \u2013 the latter making her the second-fastest female 100m sprinter in history, behind Florence Griffith- Joyner, who ran 10.49 before the introduction of mandatory random drug testing. That day in China, Jeter stole some of Usain Bolt&apos;s limelight, something no female sprinter has managed since his world-record-breaking performances. It also made up for finishing third at the World Championships last summer. Jeter, &quot;the Jet&quot;, smiles at the memory. This afternoon, at the Birmingham Grand Prix, she hopes to add a fast 60m indoor time to her CV; the achievements make up for years of injury. &quot;Oh gosh that was the worst,&quot; she says, rolling her eyes. &quot;It made me want to quit. I pulled my hamstring after the 2004 Olympic trials and I was literally laying on the track crying.&quot; A year of rehabilitation followed \u2013 &quot;I was having deep-tissue massage twice a week for months&quot; \u2013 but it was not until 2007 that Jeter regained her form, winning bronze in the 100m at the World Championships. Even then the road has not been smooth. &quot;I ran so well in 2007 I kind of got a big head, you know? My 2008 was not good. I was thinking I was guaranteed to make the US [Olympic] team and then I didn&apos;t and I got a reality check. But that was the best thing that could have happened to me. I came back in 2009 and I was just so hungry, I never wanted to be beaten again. I never wanted to have that feeling of being left behind again. That hurt.&quot; Jeter changed coach at the end of 2008 and began working with John Smith, best known for coaching Maurice Greene to multiple world and Olympic titles. It was Smith who, she says, &quot;literally ripped my race apart and put it back together again&quot;. At the beginning of last season he predicted Jeter would run 10.6, when her previous best was 10.97. She did not believe him. &quot;I was just looking at him like, &apos;What is he talking about?&apos; But I went to Shanghai and ran 10.64 and I was like, &apos;OK this guy knows what he&apos;s talking about.&apos;&quot; Jeter speaks with a southern drawl \u2013 &quot;Everybody is like, &apos;Where are you from?&apos; I&apos;m like, LA!&quot; she laughs. It&apos;s not the only assumption made about her. Being the fastest woman alive in a discipline so tainted by drugs invites a measure of scepticism and Jeter coolly pre-empts the inevitable questions about doping. &quot;I got so much negative press after I ran 10.64 like, &apos;Is she clean? Is she this? Is she that?&apos;&quot;. She is realistic enough to concede that running faster than the convicted drugs cheat Marion Jones and closest to Griffith-Joyner is going to raise eyebrows \u2013 perhaps even among fellow competitors. After the Beijing Olympics the Jamaican Veronica Campbell said even 10.6 was out of reach. &quot;How many have even run 10.6 in the past 20 years since Flo Jo set that record?&quot; she asked. The answer, before Jeter did so, was only the disgraced Jones. &quot;You know that&apos;s honestly the first thing I heard after that race,&quot; says Jeter now. &quot;It was like &apos;Well she&apos;s faster than Marion and a little slower than Flo-Jo, hmm.&apos;&quot; She purses her lips. &quot;I look at it like this, I surround myself with people that care about me. They know I&apos;m going to practise every day, that I&apos;m in the weight room every day, that I&apos;m working my butt off. The other people I don&apos;t have time for. You can whisper under your breath all you want but I don&apos;t give an s-h-i-t. It&apos;s unfortunate that I work this hard and I don&apos;t get the credit I should get but that&apos;s life.&quot; Being thick-skinned is her only option. In the online forums, speculation over her improved performances \u2013 prior to 2008 she had not run below 11 seconds \u2013 is rife, with bloggers comparing before and after photos of her musculature. The comments are hurtful. &quot;My grandmother called me one day, crying. She watched one of my races on YouTube and she read the comments underneath it. She said, &apos;Why are these people calling you this and that?&apos; I was like, &apos;Grandma stop reading the comments please&apos;. She was very emotional, she was a mess. I had to calm her down. That day was the worst, she had me crying.&quot; But from her family she gains her strength. &quot;My dad always says when people stop talking about you that&apos;s when you&apos;re not doing nothing. In 2008 I wasn&apos;t running good and there was nobody talking about me. When you start running well everybody will talk about you. Good and bad your name&apos;s in somebody&apos;s mouth, so I&apos;m like, &apos;Hey, keep my name in your mouth!&apos; When you stop talking about me that&apos;s when I&apos;m going to worry. &quot;I can&apos;t be upset about those questionsbecause we have a person who everybody adored for years and then she got caught in a scandal [Jones].

But there&apos;s nothing I can do about it. What do you want me to do? Run slow?&quot; She laughs. As she lines up for the 60m sprint in Birmingham this afternoon, nothing will be further from her mind. There is still the US team to make for next month&apos;s World Indoor Championships, and then the fastest indoor performer of the year to beat in the Virgin Islands&apos; LaVerne Jones-Ferrette.

Reports last week suggested that the source of the strikes had been traced to Shanghai Jiaotong University and the Lanxiang School, a large vocational training centre in Jinan. Today a report in the Financial Times suggests that US officials have tracked the individual they believe authored the computer code used, and have linked his work to Chinese officials. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported that the two schools had nothing to do with the strikes, dubbed Operation Aurora by security experts. &quot;We were shocked and indignant to hear these baseless allegations which may harm the university&apos;s reputation,&quot; Xinhua quoted a Jiaotong spokesman as saying.

Given the highly developed network technology today, such a report is neither objective nor balanced,&quot; the spokesman said.

Major General Huang Yongyin said China needed to match the defensive efforts of other major nations, arguing: &quot;For national security, the internet has already become a new battlefield without gunpowder.&quot; Writing in the latest issue of Chinese Cadres Tribune, a magazine published by the Communist party&apos;s influential Central Party School, he said: &quot;Lawless elements and hostile forces at home and abroad have increasingly turned to the internet to engage in crime, disruption, infiltration, reactionary propaganda and other sabotage activities.&quot; The internet attacks, first revealed in January but which have been taking place for some time, led Google to threaten that it would stop censoring its Chinese search engine, and have raised concerns about diplomatic relations between the US and China. US officials have been working with representatives from the companies affected \u2013 believed to include Adobe Systems, Yahoo and Northrop Grumman \u2013 as well as experts from the National Security Agency, the US surveillance and codebreaking agency.

That possibility led the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, to request clarification from the Chinese government, which denied any involvement.

Antony Sher in An Enemy of the People", "article": "After a \u00a315m refit, Sheffield&apos;s Crucible theatre has finally reopened to the public. While they wait for the snooker world championships to begin in April, new artistic director Daniel Evans has decided to entertain them with some Henrik Ibsen. Which, despite what you may think about the whiskery Norwegian proto-modernist, has proved to be an excellent choice. Indeed, in the opinion of almost all the critics, this staging of An Enemy of the People with Antony Sher playing Dr Stockmann has proved to be almost as entertaining as Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s 147 break against Mark Williams in 2008. &quot;A harsher, more unsettling Enemy of the People than I&apos;ve yet seen,&quot; declares Benedict Nightingale in the Times. &quot;Sher&apos;s tough, bold acting combines with Christopher Hampton&apos;s tough, bold translation to leave you feeling that the small-town doctor has been transformed by injustice into, well, a man who might blow up a plane, Tube or bus.&quot;  The trigger for this transformation, you will remember, is Stockmann&apos;s discovery that the new baths in his town are dangerously contaminated, which receives a sceptical response from his brother, the mayor, and the ungrateful population. Soon, this thwarted righteousness descends into distraction, a state Sher portrays, by all accounts, with some vigour, even by his standards. &quot;[He] is at his wilful best as the whistle-blower,&quot; Susannah Clapp says in the New Observer. &quot;Even his good humour has an alarming edge.&quot; And if that does not paint a clear enough picture for you, Nightingale is there. &quot;Imagine a Dalek morphed into Brecht&apos;s Arturo Ui [\u2026] and you&apos;ll have the impression,&quot; he says, somewhat optimistically. &quot;This Stockmann ends up mottled, stricken, half-mad and dangerous to himself, his family and everyone else, but also morally in the right.&quot; It is a powerful performance which, in Kate Bassett&apos;s Independent on Sunday description, takes Sher from one emotional extreme to the other. &quot;Welcoming the press and leading tradesmen into his family home, he beams with scatty bonhomie,&quot; she observes. &quot;By the end, he&apos;s reduced to a suicidal pariah [\u2026] The good doctor&apos;s climactic rant about the stupidity of most people and the disastrous consequences for democracy, and about a culture that dismisses expert opinion, is electrifying.&quot; But if this sounds about as cheerful as Peter Ebdon versus Ken Doherty in the opening round of the Shanghai Masters \u2013 to pluck an example at random \u2013 you should think again. &quot;What&apos;s remarkable [\u2026] is that there are also many moments in this production that make you laugh out loud,&quot; says Charles Spencer. &quot;This is a great star performance,&quot; he adds, &quot;but there is terrific support too, with particularly fine work from John Shrapnel as the town&apos;s corrupt mayor [\u2026], Lucy Cohu as Sher&apos;s loving wife and Trystan Gravelle as a particularly repulsive journalist.&quot; Not everyone is convinced, however. &quot;I feel that Sher, under Daniel Evans&apos;s direction, overplays the idea that there is something psychotic about Stockmann&apos;s notion that mankind is divided into mongrels and pedigrees,&quot; Michael Billington says. &quot;[It] lets both Stockmann and Ibsen off the hook: the truth is that the author rather chillingly approved his character&apos;s ideas about government by an intellectual aristocracy.&quot; Thank God for British democracy, eh?

Shoppers have been asked to think twice before buying products made by Carlsberg, Hitachi, Phillips, Motorola and more than a dozen other firms linked with factories that have polluted or failed to disclose emissions data. Supported by 34 prominent NGOs, the campaign is seen as an important step towards a green consumer movement \u2013 a long-awaited development in China, where the spending power of the middle-class is an increasingly important factor for the global environment. The country&apos;s consumer power has been particularly evident in the runup to the start of the lunar new year \u2013 a peak of shopping similar to the pre-Christmas splurge in the UK and US. In the &quot;golden week&quot; for retailers ahead of the Year of the Tiger, sales rose 17.2% as revellers stocked up on decorations, cigarettes, alcohol, clothes and food. Spending on mobile phones and jewellery \u2013 particularly tiger pendants and gold bars stamped with the Shanghai exhibition logo \u2013 rose even faster, according to the ministry of commerce. Beijingers welcomed in the new year with noisier and more colourful fireworks \u2013 and air pollution \u2013 than ever. Street cleaners swept up 80 tonnes of fallen rockets, exploded firecrackers and burnt out sparklers on the first day, an increase of 11 tonnes on the pyrotechnic refuse for the ox year of 2009. But amid the festivities, the country&apos;s growing green movement said it was time for consumers to use their power responsibly by punishing polluters at the checkout. &quot;Domestic consumption continues to grow and stimulate ever-expanding production. If production processes continue to violate basic discharge standards, it will lead to unimaginable damage to the ecological environment,&quot; the organisers said in a statement. &quot;But if purchasing power can be leveraged in a responsible manner, green consumption will provide massive pulling power for environmental causes.&quot; Twenty companies have been named and shamed in the first &quot;green consumer choice report&quot;, including China&apos;s biggest instant noodle maker, Master Kong, the detergent giant, Wipp Seagull Hallier and Shineway meat products. Several foreign firms made the list, after pollution spills or allegedly failing to meet legal requirements on transparency about their emissions. Among the alleged offenders were Hitachi, which according to the organisers of the campaign failed to meet discharge standards on four occasions, and Dali Beer \u2013 taken over by Carlsberg \u2013 which pumped untreated waste (PDF) with seven times the accepted level of chemical oxygen demand into waterways in Yunnan. Contacted by the Guardian, Carlsberg said it had cleared up the problem, which occurred in 2008, and invited environment officials to conduct an assessment, but this was delayed by the spring festival. &quot;Carlsberg will carry out more detailed environmental assessment before taking over factories in order to prevent any similar misunderstandings from happening again,&quot; said a spokesman. Five companies have responded to the campaigners, including Master Kong, which provided partial data about its emissions, and the Carlsberg-owned Dali Beer, which said it was in the process of collecting the requested information. Though average consumption levels in China are far lower than in Europe and the US, they are increasing rapidly, particularly in cities. Organisers of the campaign say a long-term goal is to reduce wasteful consumption and to encourage law-abiding, clean firms by pricing the products of their dirty competitors higher to reflect the impact they have on the environment. &quot;We are starting out by alerting consumers about products made by factories with bad pollution records, but this also raises awareness about how expanded consumption puts pressure on our environment,&quot; said Ma Jun, of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. &quot;In future, I think this could bring in new kinds of thinking.&quot; Several leading websites, including Sohu, Taobao, Southern Weekend and People&apos;s Daily, have published the list. But few consumers appear to have noticed. &quot;I haven&apos;t heard of the green consumption campaign yet. But I&apos;m very interested in checking it out, and will avoid buying products from the polluters,&quot; said Viola Chen, a senior auditor in Beijing, who says she normally shops for organic food and energy-saving lightbulbs. &quot;When I&apos;m shopping, the priority is the quality which normally means the brands, and the second is whether they are green products.&quot; Feng Yongfeng of the Green Beagle NGO said the list had not made much of an impact during this year&apos;s spring festival, but it would be stepped up in future as more people became involved and more polluting firms were named and shamed. &quot;We believe only the consumers can touch the nerves of these enterprises,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to involve more NGOs and we need to allow some time for consumers to change their habits.&quot; \u2022 Additional reporting by Han Ying", "tags": ["Pollution", "Waste", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "China", "World news", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Hitachi", "Food & drink industry", "Food & drink", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon footprints", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-23T11:35:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/23/china-denies-google-cyber-attacks", "sentences": ["Last week, the New York Times reported that the attacks appeared to originate from Shanghai Jiaotong university and Lanxiang vocational college, citing an anonymous source close to the investigation."], "title": "China denies links to Google cyber attacks", "article": "Beijing has denied claims that a cyber attack on Google had links to Chinese colleges or the government as &quot;groundless&quot;, fighting back against reports that investigators are drawing closer to hackers in China.

They had a lot of time to think about architecture and landscape. Today, we rush \u00adeverything, but architecture is slow, and the landscapes it sits in even slower. It needs the time our political systems won&apos;t allow.&quot; Impeccably mannered and \u00adquietly spoken, Pei, now 92, has walked an \u00adarchitectural tightrope for half a \u00adcentury. Marrying ancient and modern, he has created buildings as influential as the trapezoid-shaped east wing of Washington&apos;s National Gallery of Art, as ambitious as the Bank of China&apos;s soaring HQ in Hong Kong, and as controversial as the Pyramide du \u00adLouvre in Paris. He has won pretty much every prize his profession has to offer; last month he was presented with the prestigious royal gold medal for \u00adarchitecture, a gift of the Queen, \u00adpresented by the Royal Institute for British Architects. &quot;A wonderful honour,&quot; he says, when we meet in London&apos;s Mandarin Oriental hotel, &quot;for someone who hasn&apos;t really built here.&quot; Born in Canton, south-east China, in 1917, Pei is the son of a banker and an artistic mother, who would take him to see dreamy Chinese gardens and \u00admountainside shrines. &quot;These have always been the most important \u00adinspiration to me as an architect,&quot; says Pei. &quot;I have never forgotten those gardens: wonderful marriages of \u00adman-made and natural design. I&apos;ve come back to them again and again; they are my guide as much as the work of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, who I admired as a young architect newly arrived in the US.&quot; Despite being offered a place at \u00adOxford, the lure of America proved too strong for the young Pei. &quot;I liked the America of Bing Crosby, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton \u2013 it was all a dream, of course, but a very alluring dream for a young man from Canton.&quot; It drew him to San Francisco, and from there to a string of east coast universities, where he studied under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. His intention had been to return to China, but war broke out and he stayed on to become a US \u00adcitizen, setting up his own practice in\u00a01960. A rose-red vision in the Rockies Pei&apos;s reputation was made with the opening, in 1967, of his bold laboratories for the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. Clad in local stone that goes from pink to rose-red to ruddy brown with the passing sun, these geometric labs look and feel like an extension of the Rocky Mountains; yet they are defiantly man-made, right down to the slits and chutes cut into their walls. &quot;When I first came to this awe-\u00adinspiring landscape,&quot; says Pei, &quot;it was as if I was standing with my mother again, on a sacred mountainside in China.&quot; This being Colorado, though, he looked for inspiration locally. &quot;I\u00a0\u00advisited the nearby Indian pueblos,&quot; he says, referring to the 13th-century Native American cliff dwellings, &quot;and absorbed their forms and structure.&quot; Pei was 50 when the labs opened; architecture, as he says, shouldn&apos;t be hurried. &quot;As a young man, of course I had been looking for something new, even revolutionary. I knew what Le Corbusier was doing. I wanted to go his way. But, after some years, I began to think differently. I became interested in a modern architecture that made connections to place, history and \u00adnature. Modern architecture needed to be part of an evolutionary, not a \u00adrevolutionary, process.&quot; The infamous Louvre pyramid Pei went from strength to strength with commissions for Washington&apos;s National Gallery of Art and the John F Kennedy Memorial Library in Boston. The former exhibits the powerful, elemental forms that characterise his mature work; the mere fact of being commissioned for the latter shows Pei&apos;s standing in his adopted country. His most charismatic work, though, was commissioned far from America. Twenty years ago, Pei unveiled two of his finest buildings: the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, and the underground lobbies of the Louvre in Paris capped with his famous (some might say infamous) pyramid. The tower is one of the most exciting and elegant of all recent skyscrapers. Intended as a symbol of the new, ultra-capitalist People&apos;s Republic, the building was a special one for the architect. His father had worked for the Bank of China long before it was taken into state control, while Pei, educated by Christian missionaries at Shanghai&apos;s St John&apos;s Middle School, had long sided with Chinese \u00adnationalists rather than Mao&apos;s communists. Shortly before the opening of the tower, Pei wrote a powerful editorial for the New York Times condemning the \u00adTiananmen Square massacre of 1989, which he saw as a sign that the image China wanted to project to the world \u2013 partly through his cool, modern tower \u2013 was \u00addrastically out of step with the reality of life for the country&apos;s people. Yet the tower, with its beautifully expressed, zig-zagging steel frame, rises out of the density of Hong Kong with a confidence and \u00adelegance that places it above the brutal nature of \u00adpolitics. It was the island&apos;s tallest building when it opened in 1990, and it still ranks among the finest \u00adadditions to the city, a \u00admajestic peak in an urban mountain range. The Louvre pyramid stirred even deeper emotions, and huge \u00adcontroversy. Commissioned as one of President \u00adMitterrand&apos;s grands projets in 1985, this ingenious structure \u2013 at once ethereal and crystalline, ancient and \u00admodern \u2013 has slowly won over most of its \u00addetractors. The tip of an architectural iceberg, it forms the entrance to the cavernous Pei-designed lobbies below. &quot;I hoped the controversy would die down quickly,&quot; says Pei. &quot;Perhaps I was a little optimistic. But, you know, the choice of the pyramid was not some personal idiosyncrasy. Paris is a city of pyramids, from the time when \u00adNapoleon [after whom the court the pyramid rises from is named] became fascinated by Egyptian architecture, after his military campaign along the Nile.&quot; What&apos;s more, the Cour \u00adNapoleon is the urban equivalent of a desert plain. Pei&apos;s pyramid rises from it as purposefully and fittingly as its massive stone predecessors do from the sands of Giza. Today, steering well away from \u00adcontroversy, Pei is working quietly on a Shinto temple in Kyoto, close to the extraordinary Miho Museum, which sits half-buried in the rugged, misty landscape of the Shiga mountains. &quot;It will be a fusion of ancient feeling and contemporary design,&quot; he says. &quot;You know, the first decent \u00adbuilding I did with my own practice was a chapel in Taiwan.&quot; This was the Luce Memorial Chapel. Designed in 1954 and \u00adcompleted nine years later, it&apos;s a \u00adstunning, tent-like concrete structure with overlapping roofs that look like stylised leaves falling from the canopy of some sacred grove. &quot;I think I must be coming full \u00adcircle,&quot; says Pei. Perhaps he is. From a Christian chapel in Taiwan to a Shinto temple in Japan, via some of the most impressive and \u2013 albeit unintentionally \u2013 \u00adcontroversial buildings of the past 50 years, Pei, the most \u00adunpolemical of men, has met the \u00adchallenges of \u00adarchitecture at all levels. Somehow, though, I think he would still like to design a garden \u00adstudded with modern \u00adpavilions that would \u00adcomplement (he is not \u00adinterested in rivalling or \u00adbettering) the place that has so \u00adinspired him, the Taoist Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou, with its \u00adpoetically named buildings: the \u00adStanding-in-the-Snow Hall, Faint \u00adFragrance Dim Shadow Tower and True Delight \u00adPavilion. He acknowledges this by simply saying: &quot;In \u00adanother life, I might be a gardener. How wonderful it must be to design such gardens.&quot; Pei says his toughest ever \u00adcommission was the Museum of \u00adIslamic Art in \u00adQatar, which opened in 2008. How could he distil \u00adcenturies of Islamic \u00addesign into one building? He found the answer when he visited the serene, ninth-century mosque of Ahmad ibn Tulun in Cairo. Its ancient elemental forms, and its \u00adprecise use of shadows thrown by the baking sun, found a new life in Pei&apos;s hard-edged, geometrically bold \u00admuseum, set on an artificial island 60\u00a0metres off the Doha waterfront. Pei, after all, is a great believer in continuity. Married for nearly 70 years, he has four children, two of them \u00adarchitects. As we talk, he displays a huge \u00adadmiration for the \u00adlongevity of his \u00adfellow royal gold medal \u00adwinner, Oscar Niemeyer, the \u00adBrazilian designer of \u00adcities the world over. \u00ad&quot;Oscar is still a radical,&quot; he says. &quot;He&apos;s still at work, every day, at the age of 102.

Touching down for shows in foreign parts can mean just a quick hit of local colour between the anonymous airport lounge and airless hotel room. Yet it&apos;s in this state of constant flux that he has staked out his artistic territory. From fantastically vibrant paintings to images of indifferent asphalt, Ackermann uncovers a planet besieged by fear and desire, where terror is the underside of tourism. When Ackermann first arrives in a new place he makes a drawing \u2013 a form of &quot;mental map&quot; recording his impressions, small enough to be packed in his luggage. Back in his Berlin studio, he recreates these images in enormous paintings, many including fragments of architecture \u2013 a jutting skyscraper here, a motorway flyover or horizontal lines of a modern apartment block there. While these paintings are highly colourful, what he records in another medium, black-and-white photography, is anything but: an identikit concrete jungle of city architecture. It was in the early 1990s that Ackermann first turned to travel as a way to create painting as an act of living. He cites the Luxor massacre of 1997, when an Islamist group attacked a popular Egyptian sightseeing destination, as a turning point. And though they&apos;re often acid-bright and as graphically brilliant as Japanese manga, Ackermann&apos;s paintings are charged with more than a little apocalyptic energy, reflecting the sense that tourism is increasingly a target for global terrorism. For last year&apos;s Tate Triennial, he created an installation of paintings, piles of clothes and cages that resembled interrogation cells; it was entitled Gateway\u2013Getaway. Similarly, his current exhibition at London&apos;s White Cube bristles with signs of surveillance, dominated by a huge painting in which a figure watches over the show through enormous, apparently all-seeing goggles. Why we like him: The painting installation Faceland III, created for the Venice Biennale in 2003, depicted the city&apos;s unique architecture amid a building site of churned earth. Safe for drinking: Ackermann relates that his first mental maps were created while journeying from Hong Kong, through Shanghai, across Mongolia to Russia, where travellers washed their teeth with vodka because it was cheaper than water.

British embassy officials say that the Belize-based peer &quot;called upon&quot; China&apos;s ministry for foreign affairs&apos; Latin American department to discuss his adopted country within 24 hours of accompanying Hague to meetings with senior government officials. The disclosure will prompt demands for the Conservatives to explain whether Lord Ashcroft used an official opposition trip to further his own interests. Until now, it was not known that Ashcroft had attended formal talks with Chinese government officials or then held meetings to discuss Belize. It comes as Hague comes under increasing pressure to explain why Ashcroft, the party&apos;s biggest donor and deputy chairman, is allowed to accompany him on trips to meet foreign dignitaries across the world. Ashcroft owns Belize&apos;s biggest bank, has extensive business interests and owns at least one home in the impoverished Central American state. Caroline Flint, the former Europe minister, demanded to know why Ashcroft is allowed to attend meetings with overseas government officials and whether he used any of these contacts to further his own private interests. &quot;Tory foreign policy is for sale, and Ashcroft is buying it. As he is not a member of the Conservative foreign affairs team, why on earth is he in these foreign policy meetings with foreign governments? Why is a man who hasn&apos;t paid tax on his foreign holdings being granted a seat at the Tory top table for foreign affairs? &quot;The Tories should immediately clarify Lord Ashcroft&apos;s role in the Tory party. If he is a de facto lead on their foreign policy, the public have a right to know, especially if he is seeking to further his own money-making,&quot; she said. The official visit to China took place in September 2006 when Ashcroft used his private jet to fly himself and Hague to China and Kazakhstan. (The shadow defence secretary, Liam Fox, flew separately and met the others in China.) During their stay in Beijing, they met a number of Chinese government officials including the national people&apos;s congress vice chairman Litie Ying.

The result is that there are many Orsons; everyone who came across him adds another, and each insists that theirs is the real one. To the swelling genre of what might be called &quot;My Orson&quot; books, In My Father&apos;s Shadow, by Welles&apos;s daughter from his first marriage, is a new and uncommonly valuable addition. When I interviewed her in 1989, only four years after her father&apos;s death, Welles Feder spoke to me almost apologetically about the fact that he was more of an absence than a presence in her life. Her book makes it clear that she was then just beginning to come to terms with the degree to which he had in fact dominated her life. Her parents broke up when she was three; her mother, Virginia Nicholson, married again shortly afterwards, to a very close friend of Welles&apos;s, but then that marriage failed too, and Chris was packed off to stay with Welles&apos;s surrogate parents, his former headmaster Skipper Hill and his wife Hortense, for two years. Then she travelled to Rome to join her newly remarried mother. At this point, her life \u2013 interesting and varied, if not especially stable \u2013 took a sharp turn into nightmare. Her new stepfather, Major Jack Pringle, was a cold, harsh autocrat who saw it as his task to tame the bubbly, opinionated child he had reluctantly inherited. After Rome they went to live in South Africa, where the iniquities of colonial life shocked the liberal little girl. In due course she was sent to finishing school in Switzerland, to learn to type and get a husband, on the basis of her stepfather&apos;s conviction that she was neither interesting nor intelligent enough to go to college or have any sort of independent professional career. &quot;You&apos;re a very ordinary person, and the sooner you accept that, the better off you will be,&quot; the major tells her. Through all of this, she is allowed occasional glimpses of the father she adores. At first, her mother encourages him to be part of her life. She is swept up by him and taken for fabulous holidays, staying in five-star hotels with lakeside views, but then he has to go off and do things, and she is left, more often than not, with the secretary. Now and then she is allowed on to film sets. In The Lady from Shanghai he creates a scene for her that will never be in the film, but in Macbeth she gets to play one of Lady Macduff&apos;s murdered children. Welles shoots the scene over and over again, oblivious to her bruises. For the most part, though, he is adorable to her. She is his darling girl, clever and funny. &quot;I am the happiest girl in the world at the moment,&quot; she writes to her grandmother. &quot;I have seen a wonderful amount of my wonderful father.&quot; But it appears that, as in every other area of his life, his approach to parenting is Don Juan-like: his thrill is conquering her, winning her love, after which he disappears. Her life with her mother and stepfather is hellish; and Florissant, her Swiss finishing school, is deadly dull. Her longing for her father begins to become an obsession. On one of her visits to him, he promises her that she can leave Florissant and go to the Sorbonne instead, while staying with him in Paris. When she hears about this, her mother turns, Welles Feder writes, into a witch, forcing her to choose between Orson and herself. &quot;I can . . . brush aside your disloyalty to us as the by-product of your pathetic schoolgirl crush on Orson,&quot; she says in a letter, &quot;but one thing I cannot tolerate is having a daughter who is a bloody fool.&quot; Orson, she tells her, will promise her the sun and moon and then leave her high and dry. Chris is stunned by this reaction, and further shocked by her kindly headmistress&apos;s intimation that her feelings for her father are &quot;not natural or desirable&quot;. Finally she calls Orson and tells him that she can&apos;t see him for a while. It is some years before father and daughter are reconciled. His death knocks her sideways, but she realises that a great burden has been lifted. She gradually begins to participate in Wellesian commemorative events, seeking to reclaim her heritage; she meets Welles&apos;s mistress, Oja Kodar, and they form a bond. It is hard not to feel that once again she has fallen prey to feelings that are not natural or desirable: &quot;With Oja&apos;s hand in mine, I thought no one has loved him more generously or understood him more profoundly than the two of us. We saw, without malice or envy, what a towering figure he was .\u00a0.\u00a0. We are the ones who trace his silhouette against the sky.&quot; Hers is a curious, somewhat disturbing and often very touching story. The book is intended partly to assert the success of her struggle for personal survival, partly to give the world her father as she knew him. The account of Welles she offers is genuinely revelatory: it shows him for the first time in the domestic situation, and there is nothing quite like that for exposing a man&apos;s complexities. The dynamics of his emotional life were, like everything else about him, unique. At the climax of his attempts to reclaim his daughter, the familial forces ranged against him were formidable, all roundly telling him off, a very common experience for him. There&apos;s something quite odd about this huge man being almost permanently on the carpet. Welles Feder tries to defend him, but can&apos;t quite make it stack up. &quot;No matter how it might appear to my mother and others who saw him living it up in expensive hotels, he had little available cash to spend on himself or me,&quot; she writes, almost in the same sentence as describing his lakeside suites at the St Moritz and his use of the Tour d&apos;Argent as his canteen. She thinks &quot;he hasn&apos;t got a mean bone in his body&quot;, and then describes acts of casual cruelty and shamelessly manipulative behaviour. She has chosen to recount her journey largely in dialogue, and admits that &quot;while I may not have remembered them word for word, all the conversations I have recreated here took place in real life . . .&quot; Sharp intake of breath from biographer. These worked-up conversations are rather flat and plodding, and are required to convey a great deal of background information. The book suddenly becomes much more gripping when Welles Feder is of an age when she can quote from contemporary letters she has written or received, giving riveting extracts from Welles&apos;s letters and contemporary journals. And she can write very well herself. The prologue vividly reports Welles&apos;s shabby, disorganised funeral in Los Angeles, and the first line of her first chapter is a cracker: &quot;The first time I saw Rita Hayworth, my father was sawing her in half&quot;; the book is full of illuminating details. But at the end, the hyperbole can&apos;t be held back. In 2005, Welles Feder stands up at the Locarno festival and tells the audience what Welles had said to her, which proved to be the exact truth: &quot;They may turn their backs on me now, but you wait and see, darling girl. They&apos;re gonna love me when I&apos;m dead!&quot; After the tsunami of applause this provokes has died down, she adds that the president of the festival had described Welles as &quot;one of the greatest creative forces of the 20th century. And I agree!&quot; The crowd screams its approval. Welles himself, who had a very shrewd idea of his own significance, would have been embarrassed. But the Wellesolators persist in ratcheting up his status to boost their own importance. And so it is, in the last analysis, with Chris Welles Feder: &quot;I could feel waves of love rolling toward me, and it felt as though my whole life had been an arduous journey to this moment \u2013 but now I was here. I had arrived. Of course I knew that the ovation was for my father, but it was partly for me.&quot; This mawkish solipsism is indicative of the uncertainty of purpose of the book, but it remains an indispensable document.

The Australian government in particular has been angered by the arrest of Rio&apos;s staff last July, because one of those detained was Australian national Stern Hu, who was in charge of sensitive iron-ore price negotiations between China and global producers. Almost all criminal cases that go to trial in China end in conviction. The maximum penalty for commercial espionage is seven years in prison, if the case is found to have caused &quot;extreme damage&quot;. The four are accused of using improper means to obtain commercial secrets from the country&apos;s steel industry, and using that information as a bargaining chip to drive up the price that China pays for its iron ore imports. Rio has denied that any of its employees have been involved in wrongdoing and has called on the Chinese authorities to bring the affair to a speedy conclusion. Other western companies with interests in Asia have been watching events unfold and have been alarmed about the possible implications for the security of their employees based in China. As the world&apos;s biggest steel producer and consumer of iron ore, China is seeking to convince Rio and other suppliers to give its mills lower prices than those paid by Japanese, South Korean and other competitors. But the charging of Rio&apos;s employees has cast a shadow over negotiations, which have been dragging on for months. Stern Hu and his colleagues will appear at the Shanghai No 1 Intermediate People&apos;s Court, according to Hu&apos;s defence lawyer Zhai Jian, but the hearing is unlikely to be open to the media or the public. Australia has issued a statement saying officials from its consulate would attend open sessions of the trial involving alleged acceptance of bribes. It has asked the court to reconsider its decision to keep sessions dealing with charges of infringing business secrets closed. A statement issued earlier by the court charged the four with allegedly &quot;taking advantage of their position to seek profit for others, and asking for, or illegally accepting, huge amounts of money from Chinese steel enterprises&quot;. In the City of London, some investors have alleged that the arrest of the &quot;Rio Four&quot; was a straightforward act of retaliation on the part of the Chinese authorities, as it came only a few weeks after Rio turned down a huge investment offer from Chinalco, China&apos;s state-owned aluminium group.

Manganese Bronze, which assembles the TX4 cab \u2013 used widely in London and by several cab companies nationwide \u2013 at its factory in Coventry, said it had suffered a 30% collapse in sales since the credit crunch in 2007, provoking a slump in profits. Chief executive John Russell said many cab owners had spent the last two years holding back from upgrading their vehicles. He said the company was considering offering Geely shares at 70p to give the Chinese group a controlling stake; shares in Manganese Bronze have been trading at about 85p since the end of January. Russell also announced plans to source bodies and chassis for the TX4 from Shanghai rather than the Coventry area, where its chief supplier is due to shut down. &quot;This is a bit of a turning point for us,&quot; Russell said after the group posted a pretax loss for 2009 of \u00a37.3m. &quot;Seeing the immediate benefits of our relationship with Geely coming through in the TX4, we are now at a point where we can think about building a closer relationship with our Chinese partner.&quot; Manganese Bronze has already sought to dramatically reduce costs by producing parts in China in a joint venture with Geely. The company said shifting body and chassis construction to Shanghai would result in about 60 redundancies in Coventry. But the TX4 will continue to be assembled in England. Geely, China&apos;s largest privately owned carmaker, is also in talks to buy Volvo from its owner Ford. Analysts at Collins Stewart suggested Geely was coming to the rescue of Manganese Bronze, which has struggled with vehicle recalls and falling market share. Geely is expected to inject \u00a314m of cash and reduce the group&apos;s dependency on loans. Manganese Bronze said that the British market, especially London, continued to be challenging but that it had high hopes for international sales. Russell added that the two companies were also discussing bringing a saloon-style cab to the market, although this might not happen until at least the end of 2011. Shares in Manganese Bronze, which fell sharply from around 110p at the end of January this year, were not traded on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.

Just look at the images in the media we all adore", "article": "Growing up in 1950s Britain we learned that there was something dodgy about glamour. My home-loving mother pursed her lips at the bright blond hair and confident up-slick of black eyeliner sported by a friend&apos;s mum who was into amateur theatricals. To the headmistress of our all-girls grammar school, fashion was at odds with high-mindedness. She was famous for not allowing her teaching staff to wear lipstick. In the 1950s she waged guerrilla warfare against the wearing of &quot;paper-nylon&quot; petticoats, designed to give a sticking-out effect to the skirts of summer dresses. These were frequently confiscated from sixth-formers and hung like scalps on pegs outside her study, a shameful warning to those lower down the school. Glamour got a girl into trouble. There was a great deal of gender confusion in the academic girls&apos; schools of that time. What Germaine Greer called an &quot;absurd version of masculine uniform&quot; was often policed with vigour: gymslip-type tunics over collared shirts and masculine ties, precise regulations stipulating skirt lengths and the thickness of stockings. Yet we were still supposed to be &quot;ladylike&quot;, to dress quietly and neatly and always to wear hats and gloves in the street. The stringent rules generated a sub-culture of opposition. Could you get away with a black bra, pale pink nail varnish or Clearasil on adolescent acne? Many girls breathed a sigh of relief when they left school and could pile on mascara with abandon. But just as glamour was losing the allure of the forbidden, along came second-wave feminism, warning about the dangers of turning ourselves into sex objects. Glamour has gone in and out of fashion since the late 1960s. It was back with a vengeance in the 1980s, albeit against a backdrop of the considerable gains women made in education and the labour market during that decade. Was this a &quot;backlash&quot; or something different? Naomi Wolf and, most recently, Natasha Walter have argued that, bolstered by the beauty industries, the pressures on young girls to look good can be damaging and relentless. It is tempting to ask whether glamour, once an escape for women, has now become a prison? But adult women aren&apos;t simply prisoners, dupes or victims, and there can be a playfulness around glamour, exemplified by many women performers, for instance: Mae West, Marlene Dietrich, Madonna, Courtney Love, and currently, the gloriously bonkers Lady Gaga. As soon as you think or write about glamour you enter dangerous territory. Are we talking about artificiality and the lure of false values? About gold-digging seducers or women on the make? What about the ethics of fur or diamonds; or cosmetic surgery and the problems of body dysmorphia in the young? Is the idea of glamour exclusively western and white? The word glamour wasn&apos;t used much before 1900, and originally meant something akin to sorcery, or magical charm. It became a buzz word in the early 20th\u00a0century, often associated with exotic places, and new forms of fast travel. Men could be glamorous, as well as women: one thinks of pilots (RAF crew were often known as &quot;glamour boys&quot;), rally drivers, Rudolph Valentino, or Ivor Novello. But by the 1920s and 1930s the idea of glamour was tightly bound up with modernity, and particularly with Hollywood. Its screen stars wore slinky dresses in lustrous satin, sparkled in lam\u00e9, diamonds and sequins, muffled themselves in soft fur. Think of the women cocooned to the tips of their ears in fur, drifting through the foyer in the film Grand Hotel (1932), or Marlene Dietrich, memorably described as &quot;a Venus fur-trap&quot;, in Josef von Sternberg&apos;s Blonde Venus. An alternative to wrapping yourself in fur was writhing on it. Another stock image pictured stars at their dressing tables, in silk kimonos and surrounded by an array of cosmetics and perfume bottles. Hollywood cinema exercised a potent influence on young women in Britain between the wars. No wonder the &quot;picture palace&quot; was described as a &quot;dream-factory&quot;. Aspirations, patterns of courtship, clothes, hairstyles and makeup were all influenced by the cinema. New magazines such as Girls&apos; Cinema, Miss Modern, Film Fashionland and Woman&apos;s Filmfair brought the latest fashions from the United States to Britain and carried adverts for Hollywood-inspired cosmetics. Moralists were uneasy about the appeal of American glamour, but it was unstoppable: &quot;factory girls looking like actresses&quot; became a sign of the times. During and after the second world war the research body Mass Observation explored new trends in clothing and appearance. Observers were dispatched to the East End of London where they spied on young girls hanging around the &quot;toilet&quot; counter in Woolworths, or applying makeup in the ladies&apos; lavatories in Stepney. Fashions in fur, nail varnish, hats and even hair clips (&quot;red or diamant\u00e9 and shaped like ribbons or bows&quot;) were carefully recorded. &quot;Glamour is the keynote&quot; to the appearance of women in the East End, one observer noted, and &quot;the Hollywood influence is much in evidence&quot;. Cinema, then, acted as a powerful kind of informal education in the inter-war years. It widened horizons and raised aspirations. In the words of film historian Annette Kuhn, it &quot;extended imaginings of what a woman could be&quot;. Female audiences were entranced by strong, sexually confident women, often ambitious and powerful, certainly aware of their charms. Actresses such as Barbara Stanwyck, Jean Harlow and Dietrich played some wonderfully assertive \u2013 sometimes transgressive \u2013 roles. Dietrich&apos;s performances in the Sternberg films were a high point of cinematic glamour. Whether resplendent in jet and coq-feathers, sashaying down the corridor of the night train in Shanghai Express, or alluring in feathery fronds that positively pullulate in The Scarlet Empress, Dietrich&apos;s sexual self-possession was inescapable. It was clearly born of experience (&quot;It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily&quot;), which put it firmly beyond the pale of respectability and conventional virtue. Glamour&apos;s slide away from respectability continued after the war. With the impact of Christian Dior&apos;s New Look in the 1950s, class and elegance were in, and glamour started to look tacky. The coronation of Elizabeth II encouraged nostalgia for old-fashioned forms of femininity. Women&apos;s magazines became obsessed with the ceremonial attire of princesses and peeresses; class, debutantes and deference gained a new lease of life. Domestically oriented magazines tended to avoid using the word glamour, which was becoming tarnished by its growing associations with cheesecake photography, pin-up nudes, or scantily dressed models in soft-porn magazines. Many in middle-class England looked askance at the bosom-flaunting antics of Diana Dors or Sabrina, oozing disapproval of &quot;good-time girls&quot; who might be dismissed as &quot;no better than they looked&quot; or &quot;all fur coat and no knickers&quot;. Young ladies were not supposed to draw attention to themselves, and what was glamour about if not self-assertion? &quot;Don&apos;t make yourself look cheap&quot; was the advice given by many a mother to a daughter bent on cosmetic makeover at the end of the 1950s. In the 1960s, with the cult of youth, dolly birds, duffle coats and Carnaby Street, the signs and symbols of what was now regarded as old-fashioned glamour \u2013 red lips, ample curves, rich furs and complex, musky perfumes \u2013 were discarded by the young as outdated, or worse, as suggestive of &quot;kept woman&quot; status. Fur became environmentally and ethically suspect and lips went a whiter shade of pale. Feminism&apos;s critique of glamour gained momentum, although it was never an uncontested orthodoxy. One black activist, Claudia Jones (founder of the Notting Hill carnival), had promoted beauty contests as a way of validating non-white standards of appearance. Even so, the Miss World competition at the Albert Hall in 1970, where (white) feminists famously disrupted the proceedings, hurling flour, stink bombs and plastic mice at the compere, Bob Hope, has achieved the status of a landmark in history. Does glamour empower women, or turn them into objects? It is important to remember that women practise glamour, they are not simply the object of the male gaze. And, historically, glamorous women were just as likely to be seen as dangerous to men as victims themselves. Glamour can represent self-assertion, sexual confidence, playfulness, pleasure and delight. But in the end, nothing empowers women so much as a good education and a well-paid job.

The arrests came a few weeks after Rio turned down a huge investment offer from Chinalco, China&apos;s state-owned aluminium group, which holds nearly 8% of the company and wanted to more than double its shareholding. Instead, Rio decided to raise funds via a rights issue and to set up an iron-ore joint venture with its rival BHP Billiton. Some in the City believe the two events may not be unconnected.

The men also face charges of violating commercial secrets, which are likely to be heard tomorrow. Foreign companies will be watching the trial closely. Lawyers have warned that it highlights both the opaque nature of the Chinese legal system and potential grey areas of the law. Tao Wuping, the lawyer for Liu, said all four defendants pleaded guilty. Calls to Hu&apos;s lawyer, Duan Qihua, were not answered. The Sydney Morning Herald said it had been told by lawyers for two of the other defendants that Hu had been represented by lawyers they had never seen before, rather than Duan, a well-known figure. Tom Connor, the Australian consul general in Shanghai, told reporters that Hu was accused of taking bribes of 1m yuan (\u00a397,800) and $790,000 (\u00a3527,000) and had &quot;made some admissions concerning some of those bribery amounts&quot;.

He said Wang was accused of taking 70m yuan in bribes. But Zhang described $9m of that as legitimate profit from an iron-ore deal, adding: &quot;There are plenty of reasons to argue against the rest of the amount.&quot; Ge is thought to be accused of accepting about 6.9m yuan. The guilty pleas were unexpected. Rio Tinto has repeatedly said that its employees did nothing wrong and acted properly and ethically at all times. The trial is scheduled to last three days, but verdicts can come weeks or months after a hearing. Few Chinese prosecutions end in acquittal. Foreign media were not allowed in the court and Australian diplomats will be excluded from those sections of the trial relating to secrets, despite protests from Canberra. The Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, told reporters recently: &quot;China has a different legal system to Australia. China has a different legal system to the rest of the world. The world will be watching very closely how the trial is handled.&quot; Last week a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the trial was about business issues and should not be politicised. The secrets charge carries a sentence of up to three years in prison, or seven years in &quot;especially serious&quot; cases. One lawyer told Reuters that the bribery charge could carry a sentence of up to 20 years, although others suggested the maximum term was five years. The men were detained last July, amid tense negotiations over ore prices. Australian officials said they were told that Hu was detained in connection with suspected state secrets offences, but those charges never materialised. Their detentions came shortly after Rio pulled out of a multibillion-pound deal that would have seen China&apos;s state-owned metals group Chinalco raise its stake in the mining conglomerate to 18%. But last week the two companies signed an agreement to jointly develop an iron-ore project in Guinea. As the trial got underway, Rio&apos;s chief executive, Tom Albanese, told a conference of officials and business leaders in Beijing: &quot;This issue is obviously of great concern to us. We respectfully await the outcome of the Chinese legal process.&quot; He went on to note that China accounted for almost a quarter of Rio&apos;s revenues in 2009 \u2013 a figure that has risen sharply in recent years. &quot;Only in the last year have we come upon some difficulties, which we are working hard to resolve,&quot; Albanese added, according to a copy of the speech released by the company. A Chinese researcher in a thinktank run by China&apos;s ministry of commerce said there was a strong case against the Rio employees. Mei Xinyu wrote in the Chinese-language Shanghai Securities News: &quot;The Australian government and public need to calmly and rationally consider this question: should the government waste such a large amount of political and financial resources to pay the bill for certain companies&apos; immature and even illegal ways? &quot;What Rio Tinto and Stern Hu did would be utterly taboo in any host country.&quot;", "tags": ["Rio Tinto", "Mining", "China", "Australia news", "Business", "World news", "Espionage", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-22T14:50:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/mar/22/google-china-live", "sentences": ["7.52pm: In the comments, user Shanghainese - presumably in Shanghai - says the Hong Kong Google site is blocked."], "title": "Google stops censoring Chinese search engine: How it happened", "article": " It&apos;s more than two months since Google first threatened to lift the veil of censorship from its Chinese search engine after it came under attack from hackers. But after weeks of protracted negotiations with the government in Beijing, it now it appears that the internet&apos;s most powerful company is taking its first concrete steps to withdraw from China. Just a few minutes ago, Google&apos;s Chinese search engine - Google.cn - started redirecting to the company&apos;s service Hong Kong, in what seems to be the first major signal of a pullout. What does that mean? How does it affect the millions of Chinese citizens who use the web on a regular basis? What are people saying on all sides? Those are the big questions in this developing story, and we&apos;ll be documenting what it means, how people are reacting - and whether the change is working - here.  7.24pm: The first indications that the change was happening came in reports overnight, and a statement from US state department official who suggested that Washington was &quot;aware that there are strong indications of an announcement by Google this afternoon&quot;.  In fact, Google started making the changes a short while ago: now the company has now published a lengthy statement on the issue.  7.28pm: In Google&apos;s statement, the company said it is now sending Chinese users to the Hong Kong service - which, thanks to its unique cultural and political history - is not censored by the government for political content. &quot;Earlier today we stopped censoring our search services\u2014Google Search, Google News, and Google Images\u2014on Google.cn. Users visiting Google.cn are now being redirected to Google.com.hk, where we are offering uncensored search in simplified Chinese, specifically designed for users in mainland China and delivered via our servers in Hong Kong. Users in Hong Kong will continue to receive their existing uncensored, traditional Chinese service, also from Google.com.hk.&quot;  7.30pm: What does that actually mean for users in China? Well, for starters the Hong Kong service seems totally uncensored. I&apos;ve just gone to google.com.hk and looked up \u516d\u56db\u4e8b\u4ef6 - June 4th incident, as the Tiananmen Square massacre is referred to. The first result is this Wikipedia entry, which prominently features a picture of the famous &quot;tank man&quot; confronting a column of soldiers holding only a bag of shopping. Not much in the way of punches being pulled there.      The question is how the Chinese government reacts. Will Chinese users outside Hong Kong be able to see these results?  7.39pm: Google&apos;s statement says it has &quot;been hard&quot; working out how to stop censoring search. &quot;We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement,&quot; it says.  It says the result is &quot;entirely legal&quot; and that company officials &quot;very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision&quot;. It also points out that Google has no intention of dropping its research and development operations in China and will maintain a sales team in the country - though it admits that the size of that team depends on whether Chinese citizens can access google.com.hk. &quot;Finally, we would like to make clear that all these decisions have been driven and implemented by our executives in the United States, and that none of our employees in China can, or should, be held responsible for them. Despite all the uncertainty and difficulties they have faced since we made our announcement in January, they have continued to focus on serving our Chinese users and customers. We are immensely proud of them.&quot;  7.42pm: Google&apos;s move comes just hours after a group of angry Chinese citizens wrote an open letter addressed to the government and to Google asking them to reconcile their differences so that ordinary web users are not blocked from accessing useful online services.  &quot;If Google.cn were to no longer exist, or if China were to further block other Google services, has the Chinese government considered how their blocking of foreign websites and censorship of domestic websites violates Chinese citizens&apos; right to scientific, educational, environmental, clean energy and other information?&quot; it says. The letter also asks for greater transparency to help the public and businesses operating in China to understand the rules of censorship. &quot;We support necessary censorship of internet content and communications, whether it is on Google or any other foreign or domestic company,&quot; it said.  But, it adds, understanding exactly what it is that the government wants is the only sensible way to allow companies to comply. A translated version of the letter is here.  7.48pm: As Caroline Davies reports, the change could affect up to 340m Chinese citizens, the world&apos;s largest single population of web users. What impact will this have on Google&apos;s business? Unlike the rest of the world, where it is the dominant force in web search, the Californian company can only boast around a third of the Chinese market (it falls behind Baidu. My feeling is that we&apos;re going to see a lot of speculation as to whether this hinders Google&apos;s long-term success.  7.52pm: In the comments, user Shanghainese - presumably in Shanghai - says the Hong Kong Google site is blocked. &quot;Are you writing this from within China? I&apos;m guessing not. I just tried the same search for the certain incident you mention on the hk site and got an error page. Google won&apos;t load at all for me now.&quot; As pointed out, I am writing this from San Francisco (see my name at the top of the article) but our correspondent in Beijing is trying to find out what is and isn&apos;t filtered for her. The government&apos;s application of internet filtering is notoriously spotty, often left to local law enforcement agents so that blocks vary wildly from city to city.  8.04pm: I&apos;ve just been talking with our Beijing office, who say that the veil of censorship has not disappeared - even though there is some access to the Hong Kong service. Dan Chung, the Guardian photographer who works out of China, says that &quot;some searches are blocked, as you would expect&quot;.  8.09pm: Reaction so far is a little muted - not least because it&apos;s still unclear what this move means - but the general consensus seems to be that Google is doing the right thing by following through on its threat. In the comments, Madridophile says &quot;it seems like this was absolutely the right thing to do, at least for now&quot;, while jhb15 captures quite a lot of public sentiment by saying that &quot;I didn&apos;t think they were serious when it was in the news before&quot;.  Over on Twitter, it&apos;s much the same. &quot;Good for them,&quot; says @RiskMgmt. &quot;Dignity &gt; profits&quot;. @Spencerstweets calls it &quot;bold&quot;, but @JussiAhlroth is sceptical: &quot;Don&apos;t be silly and think this is about ethics&quot;.  8.15pm: So how much is this move going to cost Google exactly? Nobody is sure, According to Enders Analysis, Google.cn takes about 20% of the money from paid search advertising in China, which is a little bit lower than its market share. That might not seem like a vast amount, but when you&apos;re talking about a business as large as online advertising it&apos;s hardly pocket change. &quot;We estimate the revenue foregone over 2010-15 from closing Google.cn to be between $2-4bn,&quot; say Alice Enders and Ian Maude in a note that arrived by email.  While two billion dollars is nothing to be sneezed at, it&apos;s not a great deal of money for Google - which is making money hand over fist at the moment. Basically, it puts the five-year cost of dropping out of China somewhere between 8.5% and 17% of the money it made last year alone.  Perhaps the biggest cost could be in the lost opportunity, or the amount of money the company has sunk into establishing itself in China, says Enders.  8.25pm: Not in China but want to know what it&apos;s like to surf the web there? ChinaChannel, a plug-in for the Firefox web browser, lets you see.  On the other hand, Google also runs a status board for its various services - right now, it says that YouTube and Blogger are entirely blocked in China, while photo application Picasa and document-sharing service Google Docs have some problems.  8.40pm: Looks like those reports that the Chinese government is still blocking are accurate. Tania Branigan, our China correspondent in Beijing, has the following to say: &quot;Initial tests suggested that the Chinese government&apos;s own filtering system will stop mainland users from seeing the results of many sensitive searches in any case.&quot; &quot;And while google.cn now redirects visitors to google.com.hk, the Chinese government&apos;s own internet filtering system \u2013 &quot;the Great Firewall&quot; \u2013 prevented results from being returned when searches were conducted using sensitive words and phrases.&quot; &quot;The use of English and Chinese phrases such as &quot;Tiananmen Square 1989&quot; on google.com.hk resulted in the internet connection being reset.  8.46pm: Considered reactions are starting to come in.  The Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit group based in Washington that pushes for an open internet, said that Google was doing the right thing. &quot;CDT applauds Google for following through on its commitment to protect human rights and for its continued effort to enable China&apos;s people with unfiltered access to robust sources of information from all over the world,&quot; said Leslie Harris, the group&apos;s president and CEO.  &quot;Whether the Chinese people will be able to take advantage of Google search now rests squarely with the Chinese government. If China allows access to unfiltered search, it will be a substantial win for global Internet freedom and for the Chinese people. If China blocks access, it will finally make clear to the Chinese people who is pulling the levers of censorship in the country.&quot;  8.52pm: Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Journalists, which has lobbied for greater access to information in China, said it was a useful step for pushing Beijing in the right direction. &quot;We welcome this stand against censorship and hope that all Internet companies operating in China take a similar principled position,&quot; said CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney.  &quot;Google&apos;s decision to stop censoring search results will put Google on the wrong side of the Great Firewall. In the long run, however, we hope that it ramps up pressure on the Chinese government to allow its citizens to access the news and information they need to be informed and engaged citizens.&quot;  9.03pm: Some more sceptical messages coming through, as people wonder whether Google is trying to make the best situation out of a decision to pull out of a market that it was getting beaten in. Well, here&apos;s some more on the business side of things: American financial analysts Jeffries &amp; Company says that while the move may not cost it a huge amount in the first instance, it is almost certain to be a long-term negative: &quot;China today has the world&apos;s largest internet user base and one of the fastest-growing commerce markets. We believe that Google captures around 30% of China&apos;s traffic, making China the second-largest traffic-generating country for Google behind the US. Shutting down Google.cn, which we estimate generates 80% of the total China traffic, would be a strategic loss for the company.&quot;  Google&apos;s dominant position elsewhere in the world could buy it some breathing room, however:  &quot;That said, exiting China would not be too damaging for Google, since the company is the market share leader in most non-domestic markets, where search usage and monetisation opportunities still abound.&quot;  9.15pm: More noises from the human rights community, this time from Index on Censorship, who asked Google&apos;s UK spokesman, Peter Barron, what was going on. His succinct response: &quot;It was clear that if we stopped censorship on Google.cn we wouldn&apos;t be operating within Chinese law \u2014 so we redirected to our Hong Kong servers which are not subject to Chinese censorship law.&quot; As mentioned previously, that&apos;s very different from lifting the censorship altogether: Google is hoping that it can still serve from inside the Chinese state - albeit a corner that has previously had more lax censorship.  But to all intents and purposes, Beijing treats Hong Kong as a foreign outpost. And if a Chinese surfer tries to visit a controversial site in Britain or the US, they are blocked. Is it any different when the internet routes through Hong Kong?  9.34pm: I spoke briefly to somebody at Google who pointed out that the company runs a number of other web services in the country beyond search. Most of those are still in operation, despite this tangle with Beijing, and it&apos;s unclear how these are affected in the longer term. Will the Chinese government block them, too?  9.46pm: Now Chinese officials are starting to react. In an article from Xinhua, the state media service, a senior official lets rip, calling out Google for breaking the rules. &quot;Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks,&quot; Xinhua quotes the official as saying. &quot;This is totally wrong. We&apos;re uncompromisingly opposed to the politicization of commercial issues, and express our discontent and indignation to Google for its unreasonable accusations and conducts.&quot;             9.53pm:Here&apos;s a video report from our team in Beijing.  10.16pm: In our report from Tania in Beijing, she points out that the timing of the news seems timed to catch Chinese officials on the hop. &quot;The announcement came at 3am in China, meaning that there has been no response from officials as yet. Rebecca MacKinnon, visiting fellow at Princeton&apos;s Centre for Information Technology Policy, said: &quot;It appears they are not doing anything that violates Chinese law \u2013 google.cn has ceased to exist. What they are doing in Hong Kong is in bounds of the law there.&quot;&quot;  10.57pm: Sorry for the radio silence: I was writing a piece that we&apos;ll publish shortly about some of the internal conflict at Google ahead of this decision. I&apos;m not the only one who&apos;s been bashing his keyboard into oblivion: search blogger Danny Sullivan - one of the most respected names in the Google-watching business - has posted his thoughts on what this means. He calls Google&apos;s shuffle an attempt to perform an &quot;end run&quot; on the Chinese government, and isn&apos;t sure that it would succeed. &quot;By moving to a Hong Kong domain \u2014 which is run under Hong Kong law \u2014 Google seems to believe that it can do an end-run around Chinese censorship requirements. Google has run a Chinese-aimed uncensored search service on that domain for several years without being blocked. Now it believes it can send everyone in China to that domain and meet Chinese law.&quot;  11.22pm: In a brief interview with the New York Times, Google co-founder Sergey Brin explains a little bit about the move. Most intriguingly he says that the switch to Hong Kong - which I&apos;ve been told was a compromise agreement negotiated between the two sides as a way to avoid the internet equivalent of nuclear warfare - was never actually given the go-ahead by Beijing.  The shift of its Chinese service to Hong Kong, Mr. Brin said, was not given a clear-cut stamp of approval by Beijing. But he said there was a &quot;back and forth&quot; with the Chinese government on what to do. &quot;There was a sense that Hong Kong was the right step,&quot; Mr. Brin said.&quot;   11.30pm: It&apos;s still only 7.30am in Beijing, so Chinese web users are only just starting to wake up to the situation. The press there is unlikely to give Google much love, however: the past few days has seen the intensity of media attacks on the company increase. This Reuters report details some of the allegations: that Google is a foreign company interfering in Chinese business, exporting its values unfairly and undermining the authority of the government. It&apos;s using political tricks, according to China Daily.      Whatever the case, it&apos;s as much a hot topic there as it is elsewhere and should generate plenty of interest as the day goes on. To keep you going in the meantime, here&apos;s a picture of a Google China security guard trying to hold a small gaggle of journalists at bay.  11.42pm: Time for some context. I&apos;ll start by showing you through a number of articles we&apos;ve published - you can always find more at our Google+China page. The first news came in the middle of January, when Google revealed it had been attacked. It soon turned out that plenty of other companies were victims too, and the hunt was on. Early indications pointed to origins inside China, but the government said  it had nothing to do with them. Still, Hillary Clinton went on the warpath and lashed out at Chinese censorship online, a stance which officials said could damage diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, at the end of January, Bill Gates stirred the pot by suggesting that censorship efforts there were &quot;very limited&quot;. In February, Google linked up with the US National Security Agency, one of its old foes, to look further into the origins. But when the New York Times reported that the attacks could be traced to two Chinese schools, a source from one of those accused told us that it was unlikely. Shortly afterwards, a report in the FT suggested the author of the code was working for the Chinese government - something that China, again, denied.  12.01am: For a sense of severe China&apos;s feelings towards Google are at the moment, it&apos;s worth taking a look at this piece from AFP, which points out the suggestion that Google is linked to the US intelligence services.  There is of course, a long history of mistrust between all sides here - going back centuries. Indeed, writing on Salon, Andrew Leonard makes the point that moving to Hong Kong taps into a deep vein dislike that goes back to the opium wars:  &quot;If Google wanted purposefully to adopt the mantle of the Britain&apos;s most notorious symbol of colonially arrogant capitalism, it could have done no better than to announce it was setting up shop in Hong Kong, there to broadcast its search results to all and sundry.&quot; Meanwhile Tom Foremski at Silicon Valley Watch makes a similar point, before suggesting that &quot;I like Google&apos;s stand against internet censorship but its dealings with China have become very messy&quot;.  12.10am: Rebecca Mackinnon sums up the situation as it stands - though, as she points out, it is only the insomniacs who were active during the night in China. &quot;The ball is now in the Chinese government&apos;s court in two ways,&quot; she says. &quot;Whether they will block all of google.com.hk, which until now has not been blocked [and] whether they allow Google to retain its ad sales and R&amp;D businesses in China&quot;.  Index on Censorship has also published an interview she conducted with Google&apos;s legal chief, David Drummond several months ago that is worth reading.  12.23am: So here&apos;s where things currently stand: Google has redirected its google.cn search engine to the uncensored equivalent in Hong Kong. That site, which like all sites in Hong Kong is basically considered to be foreign, is subject to the usual filtering by the Great Firewall. This means that Chinese surfers may see controversial listings in their results - but they can&apos;t actually see the blocked pages themselves. Google seems to suggest that it has discussed this solution with China, and hopes that it works - but the Chinese do not seem pleased with this answer. In the meantime, however, this effectively puts Google back to where it was in 2006, before it launched a censored version of the search index. Except now the internet&apos;s most powerful company has upset Beijing, angered millions of people and taken four years to decide that censoring search contravenes its &quot;don&apos;t be evil&quot; policy. I&apos;m signing off for a little bit. We&apos;ll be back when there&apos;s more response to add.  5.10am: It&apos;s now early morning in Britain, lunchtime in China and the night is drawing to a close here in San Francisco - so just time for a few updates before I sign off.  First of all, here&apos;s my background piece on how this all blew up - looking at how Google got to this point, and how the internal politics at the company has left it on the brink with the Chinese government. Important things to note:  \u2022 There is a rift inside Google about how to deal with this issue that has been around for a long time, and Eric Schmidt - the chief executive - seems to have been on the losing side.\u2022 Google went ahead with this plan because it let them try and win without giving up on its ideals entirely. Except, as Sergey Brin has admitted, it did not know exactly how the Chinese government would respond.\u2022 And it turns out Beijing has strongly condemned this move. Ouch. The ripples are starting to spread.  5.21am: What seems to be developing is a basic split between the story as it appears inside and outside Chinese borders. Inside China, the entire situation is being played down. Looking at the front page of the news sites, this story isn&apos;t even mentioned. But outside China, everyone is lining up to pat Google on the back. That includes scads of human rights groups, such as Amnesty, whose director, Kate Allen, said: &quot;Amnesty has consistently called on companies operating in China to stop collaborating with the Chinese authorities&apos; censorship requirements, and to respect the right to freedom of expression for web users in China. It&apos;s very welcome news that Google appears to be moving back towards these principles. This now lays down the gauntlet to other internet companies operating in China.&quot;  5.32am: There&apos;s some interesting discussion going on in the comments: feel free to chip in if you&apos;ve got something to add. So far reaction seems divided between those who think Google&apos;s doing the right thing (a majority) and those who think it&apos;s serving itself and is making a business decision. One point I wanted to pick up, from user tteng that relates to the split between the company&apos;s founders and the chief executive that I mentioned earlier. &quot;Google&apos;s charter guarantees that its co-founders will never be removed of their positions by its board, thus Mr Brin can afford to make decision based on his belief, not necessarily on company&apos;s bottom line.&quot; That&apos;s true. Ttseng goes on: &quot;As happened, Google has already been punished by the US stock-market after its January statement. In this instance, Google is making a moral choice at the expense of its stock holders.&quot; That&apos;s not quite true. While Google did experience a drop in its share price on the news about China in January (and is down around 0.5% today), it is very hard to argue that it is being punished by the market. Here&apos;s a graph of Google&apos;s stock price over the past five years:     Google stock prices from 2005-2010    As you can see, it&apos;s taken a bit of a dip since it reached a high in October 2008. But it&apos;s recent travails have had a pretty minimal impact on the share price.  5.36am: As mentioned earlier, not every Google service has closed in mainland China. It&apos;s largely hitting web search and news (which covers the vast majority of Google&apos;s traffic). However, the block doesn&apos;t seem to cover everything: SF Weekly reports that uncensored results are available on Google&apos;s mobile site. That&apos;s an indication that the Great Firewall isn&apos;t blanketing everything - though, of course, this is subject to change.  5.40am: The AFP is now reporting that Washington officials are &quot;disappointed&quot; that Google did not come to an agreement with China, in what sounds a little like a step back from the strong rhetoric of recent months. &quot;We are disappointed that Google and the Chinese government were unable to reach an agreement that would allow Google to continue operating its search services in China on its Google.cn website,&quot; the story quotes National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer as saying. Hammer added that relations between the two countries were &quot;mature enough to sustain differences.&quot; (compare that to the speech given by Hillary Clinton in January)  5.47am: China Daily - which is reporting Xinhua&apos;s line on the government&apos;s response - is also dredging up the details of a copyright spat with Chinese authors.  Meanwhile Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong billionaire who owns one of China&apos;s most important websites, Tom, has cancelled a deal for Google to supply web search, according to BusinessWeek. No surprise really - after all, if the government is blocking search results, Tom is only get a part of the service. But it&apos;s a blow nonetheless.  5.50am: I&apos;m signing off now, but I&apos;ll give the last word to foreign relations expert Minxin Pei, who argues that Google has simply run into the enormous machinery of the Chinese state and had the misfortune to have &quot;committed a double offense&quot; along the way.  &quot;Its search technology poses a clear and present threat to the party&apos;s regime security, while its capacity to dominate the Internet search business would deprive China of its own national champion, Baidu (which, although a private business, is easier to control).&quot; &quot;Google&apos;s senior management may have learned a thing or two about dealing with a one-party regime through its unhappy foray into China. It&apos;s unclear, though, whether other Western firms have learned anything at all at Google&apos;s expense.&quot;", "tags": ["Google", "China", "Internet", "Censorship", "Technology", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-22T19:23:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/mar/22/investigative-journalism-layer-reporting", "sentences": ["A blogpost by a Canadian living in China kicked off the reporting about contaminated pet food from the US brand Optima, which was then picked up by the Shanghai Times and later by the Associated Press."], "title": "How investigative reporting makes use of the internet", "article": "With the help of reporting readers the political blog Talking Points Memo revealed the political pattern behind the sudden departures of United States attorneys in the Bush era, as readers accumulated evidence from around the country on who the axed prosecutors were.  A blogpost by a Canadian living in China kicked off the reporting about contaminated pet food from the US brand Optima, which was then picked up by the Shanghai Times and later by the Associated Press. And the tweets that the Guardian journalist Paul Lewis sent out about his investigation regarding the death of Ian Tomlinson helped to collect material showing the involvement of the police in Tomlinson&apos;s death.  Investigative reporting has changed with the internet as more and more reporters use it to get hints and help with fact checking. They inform their community about their investigation; asking what is known to them, or whom it might be good to talk to.  &quot;After every good investigative story, the reporter usually gets calls saying: great story, but here is what you&apos;ve missed,&quot; says Dan Gillmor, author of the book We the Media, who has also done investigative reporting during his journalistic career. He says that the best outcome of an investigation is reached by announcing that it is going on. &quot;Like in every investigation, much of what will come in using a crowdsourced technique will be useless, and some will actually send you down the wrong path, but at the same time plenty of evidence will come from that.&quot;  Making investigative reporting into a process rather than a product to be delivered is not a new aspect for veteran journalists. There is rarely a bigger investigation without a followup. However, tweeting and blogging have added further possibilities that allow journalists not only to publish what has been investigated, but to turn the investigation into a public conversation and ask for hints.  &quot;I wasn&apos;t convinced about Twitter at first, but it quickly turned out to be quite useful for investigating&quot;, says Paul Lewis. &quot;Twitter is not just a website and not micro-blogging, it is an entirely different medium - like email, fax ore even newspapers. The way in which information travels on Twitter - the shape of it - is different to anything that we&apos;ve previously known.&quot; Lewis, who in 2009 has won the Bevins Prize for outstanding investigative journalism, thinks that the value you get from people knowing that you are working on a story, trumps the slight disadvantage that your rivals also know.  The longstanding religion correspondent for the Times, Ruth Gedhill, started using the internet early on as a research facility, and had her own website in the 90s. She launched her Times blog &quot;Articles of Faith&quot; in 2006 to explain news stories further, link to sources and to engage with her readers.  &quot;Often stories come to me through the blog, but I still find that getting out is the best way to get stories. That you can do so much on Google doesn&apos;t mean that you shouldn&apos;t go out there,&quot; Gedhill says, but adds: &quot;Sometimes my readers contact me with stories, often really strong stories. Even if readers comment with pseudonyms, you get to know them after a while.&quot;  Engaging with readers is part of this new &quot;frontier&quot; style of journalism, as a community needs to be built first. &quot;If a reporter wants to use crowdsourced journalism, it requires that you have a strong enough relationship within a community,&quot; explains Paul Bradshaw, a senior lecturer in online journalism at Birmingham City University.  Bradshaw founded the crowdsourcing project &quot;Help me investigate&quot; last year as journalists and interested citizens can&apos;t just open a Twitter account and post that they are looking for information \u2013 nobody would listen. As with all sources they need to establish trust with their community.  Paul Lewis, whose investigation revealed the truth about the death of Ian Tomlinson, the newspaper vendor who died on his way home from work during the G-20 summit protests after being hit by the police, uses his Twitter account to keep readers informed about the topics he writes about. Lewis picks up ideas from other tweeters as much as he asks for thoughts, for help with identifying people on pictures or to submit material for his stories: &quot;Most of the journalists that are scepitcal about Twitter think they already know, what they need to find out. But I need to find, what to know.&quot; Asked if the internet has made a difference to investigations, Gedhill gives it much thought.

But next came an unexpected step: they cut off internet access across the vast north-western region of Xinjiang. Controlling the information flow was as crucial as controlling the streets, it seemed. Eight months on, the net remains largely inaccessible in Xinjiang, though officials claim it will soon be restored. The small number of sites that were recently unblocked are heavily censored; only a severely restricted email service is available. The internet blackout is partly an anomaly, made possible by the region&apos;s poverty and remoteness. It is hard to imagine the authorities gambling with Shanghai or Beijing&apos;s internationalised economies. But it also reflects the government&apos;s wider approach to the internet: real fear at the speed with which information or rumours can spread and people can organise. And an absolute determination to tame it. The cut-off lies at the extreme end of a spectrum of controls that experts say constitute the world&apos;s most sophisticated and extensive censorship system \u2013 and one that is growing. Google&apos;s decision to shut its mainland search service rather than continue to self-censor has highlighted a crackdown that has closed thousands of domestic websites over the last year and blocked many hosted outside. Casualties included Yeeyan, a community translation website that was running a collaborative experiment with the Guardian, publishing stories in Chinese. Though it was later allowed to reopen, it no longer translates foreign news media. Other measures have included attempts to introduce real name registration and install controls on individual devices via the controversial Green Dam software \u2013 though the latter has been seen off by users, at least for now. &quot;A lot of people are very optimistic that the web will bring us &apos;glasnost for China&apos;, but the determination to control it is stronger than ever,&quot; said David Bandurski of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong. Few, even those who deal with it regularly, can explain exactly how the censorship system works. Chinese officials say that most countries control the internet and that Beijing does so according to law. The state proscribes up to 11 kinds of content, which range from spreading obscenity to &quot;disrupting national policies on religion, propagating evil cults and feudal superstitions&quot;. The difference is not only that China outlaws far more content than other countries, but it does not state clearly what is off limits, why, and who made the decision. &quot;The special nature of Chinese censorship is that it has no transparency and is very random,&quot; said Wen Yunchao, an outspoken Guangzhou-based blogger better known as Beifeng (North Wind). &quot;When my blog has been closed or deleted or blocked, I have had no notice. After I find out there is no way to petition for its return. No netizens know which department made the decision; no one knows how the system works. We only see the results.&quot; The first element is the so-called Great Firewall. Internet police bar access to services hosted overseas by blocking URLs and IP addresses and through keyword filteringhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/23/google-china-firewall-censorship-internet. Although many internet users find ways to scale the firewall \u2013 such as proxies and virtual private networks \u2013 most either do not know how or cannot be bothered. But the second element is just as crucial: domestic censorship. And here the authorities do not rely on controlling companies \u2013 but on making sure that they control themselves. In evidence to a US House of Representatives hearing this month, Rebecca MacKinnon, a fellow at Princeton&apos;s Center for Information Technology Policy, wrote: &quot;Much of the censorship and surveillance work in China is delegated and outsourced to the private sector \u2013 who, if they fail to censor and monitor to the government&apos;s satisfaction, will lose their business licence.&quot; Punishments can also include fines \u2013 or having sites closed, without warning. The decentralisation of censorship means that it is highly uneven. The transparency of filtering, content censored and methods used all vary. When MacKinnon tried to post 108 pieces of content on 15 different blog hosts, the most vigilant censored 60 posts; the least, only one. That is one reason why the system is hard to understand. Another is that it is deliberately opaque; at least one journalist, Shi Tao, is in jail for disclosing a propaganda directive. It is unsurprising that so few people want to discuss the system. But conversations with bloggers, industry sources and experts allow one to build up a portrait of it. Most sites depend on both mechanised and human observation. Filtering software rejects posts outright or flags them up for further attention, but humans are essential to catch veiled references and check photographs, for example. Sources suggest a huge portal \u2013 such as Sina, which runs not only news, but a microblog service and discussion forums \u2013 could employ anywhere between 20 and 100 censors. These people take orders from a complex apparatus that briefs them about what is permitted, orders changes or deletions to content, and punishes them. At the top are the party&apos;s propaganda office and the information office of the state council, China&apos;s cabinet. These deal with the biggest issues and set out a general approach; and they are replicated downwards through the levels of the bureaucracy. They have their own monitors who usually work as a single, city-level team . They focus primarily on news-related websites, though this may include blog platforms, for instance. They shape content as well as removing it. Separately, there are internet police, dealing primarily with security and crime-related issues \u2013 though in China these are interpreted very broadly. Usually they order deletion or site closures, rather than issuing directives in advance. It is thought they focus on social websites, such as bulletin boards; and their work veers towards information that may have offline repercussions for police \u2013 perhaps complaints that could lead to unrest \u2013 and investigations. These three groups form the bulk of the official censors. Within their ranks dedicated teams watch major sites such as NetEase or Sohu. Like the firms&apos; own monitors, they work round the clock. Others will run searches on keywords, or check out tips from the public. Increasingly, they are investing in technology such as text mining software. But there are numerous other entities overseeing parts of the internet \u2013 the broadcasting administration deals with videos, for instance. Although they coordinate and cooperate, responsibilities overlap and turf wars can result. Additionally, each government department or agency keeps an eye on its own patch, with education officials monitoring student discussion forums. Usually these bodies will act via police or information and propaganda officials; sometimes, they call websites directly. It is not clear if they have the right to order deletion of content, but companies usually comply rather than take the risk. &quot;Literally, pretty much every government office \u2013 national, provincial, city level \u2013 will try to contact you if they have your number,&quot; complained an industry figure, joking that senior staff hate to give out business cards as a result. Depending on the sensitivity of content and where it appears, orders arrive in different ways. Censors may tell a site to delete content, or tell an ISP to pull the plug. Sometimes a data centre informs a company they have been told to shut a site; sometimes they act without warning or explanation. Almost always, the information is delivered informally. Authorities will call major players to meetings to brief them; otherwise, they will ring up, send a text message or use online chat services. In a normal week, a major site can expect to receive at least tens of instructions. Smaller sites often rely on word of mouth. But companies usually maintain logs to keep track of these unwritten injunctions and occasionally these leak, offering a rare glimpse into the complex and sometimes baffling decisions of the censors. One, said to have belonged to Chinese search giant Baidu, included banned sites, off-limits topics and sensitive words or phrases including Aids, migrant workers, reactionary and even Communist party; not problematic in themselves, but in certain combinations. The censors&apos; decisions can be baffling \u2013 allowing tales of official abuse to remain while apparently innocuous subjects are erased; one list translated by the New York Times this week included an order to delete references to a rare flower. According to Buddhist folklore, it blooms only once every 3,000 years; someone feared it would encourage superstition. &quot;The rest of us have to guess their likes and dislikes,&quot; complained one of those struggling to keep up. Officials do not only prohibit content. They dictate how stories are reported; or if reader comments should be allowed; or set a ratio of &quot;positive&quot; news on sites. &quot;In the past it was about deleting. Now they do much more[proactively] \u2013 saying what we should put on the headlines,&quot; added the industry source. &quot;They are smarter. People open the home page and see tabloid-style or party news and lose interest. They don&apos;t bother to scroll down to the interesting stuff.&quot; There is one more port of call for Chinese authorities: the individual.&quot;They don&apos;t haul in everyone,&quot; said Phelim Kine, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. But &quot;discussion of the Chinese government&apos;s monopoly on power; the need to examine 1989; calls for open elections \u2013 those are red flag issues and can get people a knock on the door from the public security bureau&quot;. Then there are the &quot;grey lines&quot;; topics and discussions acceptable today but perhaps not tomorrow. A summons to an intimidatory chat with police; detention; or even jail could be the result. Amnesty International calculated last year about 30 journalists and 50 others were in prison &quot;for posting their views on the internet&quot; \u2013 often, because officials suspected they were seeking to organise others. But the deletion of content, the closure of sites and the jailing of individuals have a chilling effect that goes far beyond those immediately affected.&quot;Because people don&apos;t know what they are not allowed to say, they kind of guess and take down or stop saying whatever might possibly not be permissible,&quot; said Wen Yunchao. The system&apos;s effectiveness can be judged not by the number of censors, the sophistication of its technology or the information suppressed \u2013 but by what it has not done and does not need to do.

The report is Charting our water future: Economic frameworks to inform decision-making; it was put together by consultants McKinsey &amp; Company on behalf of the 2030 Water Resources Group, an alliance of concerned bodies including the World Bank Group and big private interests such as the Coca-Cola Company, SAB Miller and Standard Chartered Bank. The headline point of the report is that by 2030, unless substantial changes are made to conserve water and build new supplies, there will be a 40% gap between projected water demand from a bigger, richer global population, and &quot;accessible, reliable&quot; supplies. The really astonishing statistic though was this: that 42% of all projected water demand \u2013 yes, nearly half of all the water for homes, industry and agriculture \u2013 will be required by just four countries. Four. China, India, Brazil and South Africa. Read it for yourself on page 15 of the Executive Summary. I know China and India are big, and getting bigger, fast. But still ... To avoid future water crises, we&apos;re told that gargantuan investment is needed in water infrastructure. Some of this will be big desalination plants and dams; much of it \u2013 as McKinseys stress \u2013 will be smaller, cheaper and potentially hugely beneficial improvements to irrigation ditches and pumps, to leaking pipes and the types of seeds farmers plant. The big question is not really what will help, but how to get it done. Water pricing is the single biggest factor that would make a difference, but few politicians will campaign, or even govern, for a mandate to put up bills because water is essential. Which is, of course, the reason why they should. It may be true that the global water problem is made up of a series of local water issues. But if 42% of demand is in China, India, Brazil and South Africa \u2013 all of which are already suffering water stresses \u2013 then perhaps the world needs to put a much, much greater focus on these four countries.

Romcoms may be hugely popular, but that name is misleading \u2013 in real life, relationships are seldom funny. Love can be hard work, and it can hurt.

The authorities were requisitioning their farmland for development. Wang Shuai believed the scheme was illegal, but officials refused to discuss it. He tried journalists, but they thought his story both too common and too sensitive. That was when he turned to the internet. &quot;It was the choice of having no choice,&quot; he said. &quot;But I had read complaints about injustices on the net before and I knew some cases had worked out. There were reports like officials who used public money for holidays; when they appeared, the nation began investigating.&quot; The authorities had launched an &quot;anti-drought initiative&quot; which included chopping down fruit trees \u2013 conveniently allowing them to slash compensation to families turfed off the land. &quot;Great tactics for fighting drought in Ningbao village!&quot; Wang headlined his post. Underneath, he added pictures of the tree stumps. It would indeed grab attention; but not quite as he had expected. Wang&apos;s story exemplifies the growing power of the internet in China: the airing of grievances; the ability to reach a wider audience; the use of satire to discuss serious topics. While China has the world&apos;s most sophisticated internet censorship system, it also has almost 400 million internet users \u2013 at least some of whom are challenging those restraints with increasing boldness. Controls mean that almost everyone self-censors to some degree. But some have used the variations and gaps in the system to stake out spaces where they can find or share viewpoints that are not officially sanctioned. In fact, the internet is arguably more important than in other countries since the mainstream media is still more firmly controlled. The Chinese have even invented a word \u2013 &quot;wangmin&quot; or &quot;netizen&quot; \u2013 that captures this sense of the internet as a space for social and political discussion. It is also a space for enjoyment. &quot;The internet community is diverse, lively, and contentious, full of fun and dynamism,&quot; said Guobin Yang, author of The Power of the Internet: Citizen Activism in China. &quot;This aspect of Chinese internet culture is not well understood by the general public in the west. &quot;[The internet culture is] capturing more and more things, good or bad, political or non-political, and then weaving them into all sorts of new creatures \u2013 new languages, new relationships, new images \u2026 despite and perhaps because of political control.&quot; Users are increasingly creative in the ways they elude restraints \u2013 perhaps using analogies to discuss topics \u2013 and increasingly open in their mockery of them. Deleted sites have &quot;been harmonised&quot;, in reference to President Hu Jintao&apos;s calls for a &quot;harmonious&quot; society. Censors are referred to as &quot;river crabs&quot;, because in Chinese those two words together form a homophone for &quot;harmony&quot;. Heavy-handed propaganda is ridiculed. Take the reaction to last month&apos;s Chinese new year gala on the state broadcaster, which featured a paean to the Communist party using the Uighur word yakexi, or good; this, months after vicious inter-ethnic violence tore through Xinjiang, home of the Uighur minority. &quot;Now the nation has abolished the agricultural tax \u2026 Ah! The Chinese Communist party central committee&apos;s policies are yakexi,&quot; the singers enthused. Within hours, the word yakexi was popping up all over the internet. Han Han, the country&apos;s most popular blogger, launched a contest for the best rewrite of the lyrics. Others wrote about the &quot;yake lizard&quot; \u2013 &quot;xi&quot; is a homophone for lizard \u2013 which &quot;enjoys arse-licking&quot; and survives only in China, North Korea and Cuba. Evade the Great Firewall Because they are outspoken, articulate and keen to engage with the outside world, the numbers of the liberal, socially aware users prepared to poke fun at those in power are easy to overestimate. &quot;Maybe there are much less than 100,000 people concerned about those issues and maybe only 2,000 who are active,&quot; suggested Ai Weiwei, a leading artist and vociferous social critic with 25,000 Twitter followers. Most of these will use software such as virtual private networks and proxies to evade the Great Firewall \u2013 allowing them to read articles or debates outlawed at home, or to post controversial material on blog platforms hosted overseas. Like their counterparts around the world, the majority of China&apos;s internet users have little interest in seeking such debates: they want entertainment, shopping and other services. And even among those who want to debate current affairs, there are plenty of pro-government voices, sometimes paid \u2013 known as the &quot;50 cent party&quot; \u2013 but sometimes acting independently. Yet between the highly motivated and the largely uninterested poles lie many more who are not overtly politicised but whose attention is piqued by a story, or who suddenly find a means to be heard, like Wang or Tang Xiaozhao. Tang is a Shanghai businesswoman in her 30s and began to blog on opera in 2005. She had decided Chinese politics were &quot;too cruel&quot; to worry about, but what she read online reignited her interest and soon she was writing on current affairs. When articles were deleted, she opened blogs at other sites. She learned to use homophones to evade the censors. Then she posted Charter 08 \u2013 a groundbreaking call for reforms which angered officials and led to its co-author being jailed for 11 years. Each time she put it up, censors quickly deleted it \u2013 but not before perhaps a few hundred users had had a chance to read it, she noted. Instead of intimidating her, the repeated disappearance of her articles spurred her into signing the charter herself \u2013 and, later, into blogging about her resulting brush with police. Last year, no fewer than nine of her blogs were closed down. &quot;We cannot see what we want to and cannot speak as we like. But if 10 people speak and they are censored, five of them will keep talking. And China is a huge country. There will be new people who want to speak,&quot; she said. As the reaction to Charter 08 shows, the government is genuinely alarmed by the internet. It fears both that it will be used to organise real-world action, and that it will spread unsuitable political and social influences, such as porn. Many citizens share at least some of these concerns; studies have shown that support for government controls on content is higher in China than elsewhere. Yet officials permit a far wider range of discussion on the internet than in other media. &quot;[The authorities] are becoming increasingly sophisticated in how they handle dissent,&quot; said Phelim Kine, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. &quot;They have realised they do not need to round up everyone making rude jokes about someone&apos;s son online.&quot; The internet allows people to vent frustrations and to feel that their voices can be heard. The authorities can track the public mood and monitor individuals or groups. Netizens can help officials to push forward an argument in the face of opposition from other interest groups or even countries. And for higher authorities, it can be a useful way of keeping local cadres in check. But many officials do not relish such scrutiny, as Wang Shuai discovered. Authorities from his hometown in Henan sent police 750 miles to Shanghai to detain him for defamation \u2013 a criminal and civil offence in China. He was taken back in shackles and held for eight days, until he confessed to libelling local officials. Then he was bailed. &quot;I thought using the net would help to protect me; I thought it was harder to track me down. When they came to me I was shocked,&quot; said Wang. Angered, he wrote another post; this time, a newspaper journalist spotted it. The resulting article spread rapidly, with readers piling in to denounce Wang&apos;s treatment, which they saw as emblematic of official injustices. Rule of law Eventually, in spring last year, the provincial police head apologised and Wang received compensation. The authorities abandoned the development project. Without the mainstream press, his story might not have garnered much attention. But without the internet to publish it initially, and then amplify the effect of the news article, he believes he would never have received the apology and compensation. The net has obvious appeal to citizens with few means to hold authorities responsible for their actions. But that does not mean it brings true accountability. A hurried reaction to the whims of netizens does not advance the rule of law. At worst, it may mean rule by mob. Take the &quot;human flesh search engines&quot; \u2013 internet users who band together to track down and expose miscreants, such as abusive officials. It is not always clear if the accusations they face can be substantiated. Yet quite apart from the online vilification, such campaigns can have real-world repercussions. When a young woman killed herself, blaming her husband&apos;s adultery, the human flesh search engine quickly mobilised. First he was harassed at home and on the street; then his parents&apos; home was daubed with abusive messages. He complained that he was forced to resign after people began targeting his office. He is now thought to be in hiding, well over a year after the hunt began. Similarly, the apparent victories for netizens are not so clear cut. Wang struggled to find work after his detention and now regrets posting his complaint. &quot;Of course I wouldn&apos;t do it again. It cost too much to protect my rights,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought I was a hero and was doing the right thing, but it ended up like a tragedy.&quot; Many in the west see it as self-evident that an increased flow of information will make officials more accountable and encourage people to challenge them. Yet studies of the internet&apos;s impact in China are inconclusive. One found that people with access to unofficial information and the internet actually held a more favourable view of inequalities and the party&apos;s justification of them. Another showed that blog posts on subjects such as political reform and freedom of expression were increasingly frequent, even when controlling for the rise in bloggers. Government fears Certainly, users like Tang believe the internet is slowly changing society. She admits to being petrified when police summoned her for informal questioning. &quot;But the influence of that experience is now very small,&quot; she said. And she continues to blog. As long as the government fears the net, it will attempt to tame it. But, said an experienced industry source, it faces hundreds of millions of users with their own ideas and feelings and ambitions. &quot;With so many brains, how can you control them? Nobody can win this battle,&quot; she said. CASE STUDIES: OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE NET Green Dam  What: Last year the government ordered computer companies to install filtering and surveillance Green Dam censorship software on all new devices. Internet users reacted angrily \u2013 particularly when they discovered its security flaws and the fact that many keywords were political \u2013 and official media also ran criticism, possibly signalling parts of the government had concerns too. Who won: Netizens saw off the plans, helped by the protests of businesses and perhaps internal opposition. But schools and internet cafes will still be required to use Green Dam. There are fears officials could seek to reintroduce similar controls in future. Deng Yujiao  What: The waitress was arrested after she stabbed an official to death last year, alleging he had tried to rape her. But when a blogger publicised her case it sparked an outcry from internet users, who dubbed her a heroine and saw her story as a classic case of the struggle of ordinary people against abusive officials. It resulted in an estimated four million posts about her case and coverage in the mainstream media \u2013 though censors later ordered websites to remove related content. Who won: Deng was charged with intentional assault, not murder, and freed because &quot;she had suffered a mood disorder&quot;. Her lawyer described the case as a victory for public opinion. Panyu protests What: Demonstrations against opposition to plans for a waste incinerator in Panyu district, Guangzhou, southern China, in November last year. Residents fear it poses a health risk. Hundreds of residents surged into government offices and staged a sit-in outside, with numbers rising as word spread by mobile phone and internet, and participants tweeting a blow-by-blow account. An example of how social media can be used to fuel and publicise real world events. Who won: Officials called police, who dispersed the crowd. The local government promised an environmental impact assessment \u2013 but plans to push ahead with the project.", "tags": ["China", "Internet", "Censorship", "Media", "Human rights", "Google", "World news", "Technology", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-24T19:38:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/26/beijing-rubbish-deodorant", "sentences": ["According to Chinese media reports, at least six incinerator projects have been put on hold due to public opposition, including Panyu in Guangdong province, Jiangqiao in Shanghai, and Liulitun and Asuwei in Beijing.", "Incinerator projects that have been held up by public protests June 2007 - Liulitun, Beijing June 2007 - Liulitun, Beijing Early 2009 - Jiangqiao, Shanghai September 2009 - Asuwei, Beijing October 2009 - Wujiang, Jiangsu November 2009 - Panyu, Guangzhou December 2009 - Tianjingwa, Nanjing \u2022 Additional reporting by Han Ying"], "title": "Beijing to sweeten stench of rubbish crisis with giant deodorant guns", "article": "     Beijing is to install 100 deodorant guns at a stinking landfill site on the edge of the city in a bid to dampen complaints about the capital&apos;s rubbish crisis. The giant fragrance sprays will be put in place by May at the Asuwei dump site, one of several hundred tips that are the focus of growing public concerns about sanitation, environmental health and a runaway consumer culture. Municipal authorities say they will also apply more plastic layers to cover the site in response to furious protests by local residents who have to put up with the stench when the wind blows in their direction. The high-pressure guns, which can spray dozens of litres of fragrance per minute over a distance of up to 50m, are produced by several Chinese firms and based on German and Italian technology. They are already in use at several landfill sites, but they are merely a temporary fix. Beijing&apos;s waste problem - and China&apos;s - is expanding as fast as its economy, at about 8% each year. With millions more people now able to afford Starbucks, McDonald&apos;s, Kentucky Fried Chicken and other elements of a western, throwaway lifestyle, the landfill sites and illegal tips that ring the capital are close to overflowing. According to the local government, the city of 17m people generates 18,000 tonnes of waste every day - 7,000 tonnes more than the capacity of municipal disposal plants. &quot;All landfill and treatment sites in Beijing will be full in four years. That&apos;s how long it takes to build a treatment plant. So we need to act right now to resolve the issue,&quot; said Wang Weiping, a waste expert in the city government. &quot;It&apos;s necessary to restructure the current disposal system. We cannot rely on landfill anymore. It&apos;s a waste of space.&quot; Less than 4% of Beijing&apos;s rubbish is recycled \u2013 the UK recycles 35% \u2013 but is still near the bottom of the EU recycling league. Two per cent of Beijing&apos;s rubbish is burned but the rest is dumped in landfill sites, which cover an area of 333,000 sq m. Cities throughout the country face a similar problem. There are more than 200 legal and illegal sites around Beijing, according to Wang Jiuliang, a photographer who has spent the past year recording and plotting the wastelands using GPS systems and Google Earth. Together, they form what he calls &quot;Beijing&apos;s seventh ring&quot;, where the city meets the countryside with smart new ring roads, expensive housing complexes and the detritus of consumer culture. &quot;People are forced to use these places for dumps and landfills. There is no better place,&quot; he says. &quot;China has become a consumer society over the past 10 or 20 years. The authorities are working hard to solve the garbage problem, but it has emerged too quickly.&quot; Environment authorities in cities throughout the country are struggling to keep pace with this burgeoning problem. According to the government, about 20m tonnes of urban garbage went unhandled in 2008. They want to deal with the waste by burning it. But government plans to build 82 incinerators between 2006 and 2010 have encountered an increasingly hostile &quot;not-in-my-backyard&quot; movement. According to Chinese media reports, at least six incinerator projects have been put on hold due to public opposition, including Panyu in Guangdong province, Jiangqiao in Shanghai, and Liulitun and Asuwei in Beijing. The number of rubbish-related public complaints in Beijing increased by 57% last year, according to the Municipal Petition Office. Many residents have safety fears about incineration facilities despite reassurances by the government. In an attempt to win public confidence, the managers of a new 800m yuan incinerator in Gao&apos;antun set up a giant display screen earlier this month that contains real-time data on emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. But it continues to raise concerns because there are no figures for dioxins - the toxins released during the burning of plastic and other synthetic materials. The plant has had to scale back operations in the face of public opposition. In the longer term, the government plans massive investment and new legislation to double the capacity of waste disposal facilities, increase the incineration rate to 40% and to cut the growth in the volume of rubbish to zero by 2015 through recycling. There is a long way to go. Currently, even when waste is separated by schools and companies, it is often just crammed back together by refuse collectors. A Beijing News report last month noted that distribution and disposal plants are not designed to deal with separated waste. &quot;We just compress, pack and then bury everything directly,&quot; said staff from Mentougou district waste transfer station. Efforts to promote recycling have a long way to go. Public litter bins offer two options - marked recyclable and non-recyclable - but few people are aware of the distinction because there has not been an adequate public education campaign. &quot;I am willing to take time and money to separate and recycle my rubbish, but there&apos;s just no such system here,&quot; said Beijing resident Cui Zheng.

It has always been my favourite Jewish holiday. What child doesn&apos;t like a party, and in our house growing up, the seder, the festive dinner which marks the first two nights, was celebrated as the mother of all banquets. Seders at home seldom had fewer than a dozen people around the table: grandparents, aunts, uncles, unmarried friends of my parents \u2013 and when we lived in Memphis, far from the rest of the family, a complement of Jewish sailors or airmen from the naval base at Millington. (It is in part the presence of Jesus and his twelve disciples around the table at their Passover seder \u2013 better known to Christians as the Last Supper \u2013 that gave rise to the superstition that thirteen is unlucky.) But what I really loved were the seders hosted by my Aunt Anna and Uncle Morris, who&apos;d made enough money in the not-entirely-legitimate business of supplying pinball and slot machines to local taprooms to be able to hire out the Lancaster (Pennsylvania) Jewish community centre, where my mother&apos;s entire very extended family \u2013 at least 100 people \u2013 would gather to eat, drink, schmooze and kvell over how gorgeous the grandchildren were. Perhaps because Anna and Morris had no children of their own, we were allowed to spend hours running up and down between the tables with our cousins, playing marathon games of hide and seek or tag, cadging sweets and sips of wine from the grownups (and silver dollars from Uncle Morris). At the head table, an island of calm amid the chaos, my father and the older uncles would drone their way through the Passover Haggadah, which tells the story of the Exodus from Egypt and sets out the order (seder is the Hebrew word for order) of the evening&apos;s festivities. Fast forward 20 years, and my girlfriend and I are living in Brooklyn, hosting our first seder as a couple. Along with the predictable problems \u2013 whom to invite? What to cook? How long should we wait for my (chronically late) father before giving up and starting without him? \u2013 there loomed the whole issue of the Haggadah. Like most observant American Jews, I had grown up using what we always called the &quot;Maxwell House Haggadah&quot; \u2013 given out free in grocery stores wherever matzos and gefilte fish are sold. (And here&apos;s something that has always puzzled me: Maxwell House reportedly printed and distributed 40 million Haggadahs. Yet there are only about 6 million Jews in North America. And Orthodox Jews are forbidden to throw away any document with the name of God printed on it.) And so began my love affair with the Haggadah. Because what I realised, late one afternoon in the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary \u2013 this was back in the days when spam was just a non-kosher snack, and you needed actual books to find stuff out \u2013 was that there are Haggadahs for every persuasion: not just Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist (or United, Masorti, Liberal and Progressive), and not just Ashkenazi (northern European Jews) and Sephardi (Jews from the Mediterranean and the Middle East). And not just for Jews, though our dispersal over the centuries means there are Haggadahs in Marathi (for the Jews of Bombay), Japanese, Chinese (for the Jews of Shanghai), Amharic, Arabic, as well as most European languages. There is even a Haggadah for fundamentalist Jews who want to re-enact the Temple sacrifice of the Paschal lamb! But there are also feminist Haggadahs, vegetarian Haggadahs (in which the lamb is liberated along with the Hebrew slaves), Kabbalist, secular and Christian Haggadahs and a Haggadah for African Americans (which points out that Martin Luther King&apos;s initials, MLK, are the Hebrew root for King). The Passover story, of course, has long been an inspiration to liberation movements around the world. The African-American slaves who demanded &quot;Let My People Go&quot; were singing from the same hymn sheet as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, whose original design for the seal of the United States showed Pharoah and Moses on the shores of the Red Sea over the motto &quot;Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.&quot; But you can&apos;t really understand the Passover story without getting to know the Haggadah. And so on Monday and Tuesday on Cif belief I&apos;ll be blogging on how to read the Haggadah. Until then two things to bear in mind: first, the Haggadah is not the Bible. Although some Jews believe some parts of the Hebrew Bible to be divinely inspired, everyone agrees that the Haggadah is a collection of texts, assembled by human beings over many centuries. Beyond that, though, the agreement ends \u2013 which is where you and I come in. Although I&apos;m a Jew (and not merely Jew-ish, in Jonathan Miller&apos;s happy formulation) I&apos;m no rabbi and pretend to no religious authority. Instead I&apos;ll be approaching the Haggadah as an avid reader, using the skills of a historian and journalist. If I get something wrong, I assume you&apos;ll let me know.

China is the world&apos;s biggest stamp collecting market, with 20 million collectors and 50,000 government-sponsored philatelic societies, ahead of the US. Under Mao, it was illegal to collect stamps but since his death in 1976 there has been a surge in collecting, especially among the new wealthy elite. &quot;What we&apos;re seeing is a repatriation of stamps back into China,&quot; said Stanley Gibbons chief executive Michael Hall. &quot;Practically every month a new record is set for Chinese stamps.&quot; Stanley Gibbons hopes to break into the Chinese market through a partnership with a local company, and has already shortlisted a number of companies based in Shanghai or Hong Kong. China could also be big in autographs, said Hall. One of the firm&apos;s biggest clients in autographs is Chinese and collects famous signatures like Marilyn Monroe&apos;s scrawl. A relaunch of Stanley Gibbons&apos; website is planned later this year. The firm will make its printed price guides for 700,000 rare stamps around the world available online for the first time and wants to set up an eBay-style market place where collectors can buy and sell stamps. The company is also gearing up for the launch of the world&apos;s first rare stamp investment fund, targeted at rich individuals and institutions, in the autumn. It expects that the International Stamp Show, a once-a-decade event which is being held in London in May, will spark renewed interest in stamps, especially British ones. The company recently sold a Robert Burns bible for \u00a325,000 and the earliest signature of George Washington for \u00a360,000. The most popular historical figure remains Henry VIII, whose signatures fetch \u00a345,000 to \u00a355,000. Stamps and autographs have held their value well during the recession, with the GB30 rarities stamp index up 7% so far this year. Stanley Gibbons today raised its annual dividend by 5% to 5p a share.

Almost 25 hours later, but at 9.30pm the same day, it will finish on the other side of the international dateline in the Galapagos Islands, where scientists will share a candle-lit dinner with several hundred residents and environmental activists. In between, Earth Hour , the annual worldwide call for action against climate change, will spread darkness across all seven continents, drawing in 120 nations, 1,700 municipalities and hundreds of millions of people. In the UK, many hotels and restaurants will be offering special candle-lit dinners where guests will be able to see well-known sites plunge into blackness, including Big Ben, Edinburgh castle, the Millennium stadium in Cardiff, Belfast city hall, Durham cathedral, St Paul&apos;s cathedral and the London Eye. Now in its fourth year, the event organised by WWF, has spread an ever widening expanse of hour-long darkness. Two million people took part at the first switch-off in Sydney in 2007. Last year, hundreds of millions participated in 88 countries. This year, organisers expect the figure to be close to a billion. Beijing&apos;s Forbidden City and London&apos;s Houses of Parliament, the Eiffel Tower, the Hiroshima peace memorial, the Empire State Building, Rio de Janeiro&apos;s Christ the Redeemer statue, and the world&apos;s tallest building, Burj Khalifa. will all plunge into darkness. Nations that have signed up for the first time this year include Saudi Arabia, long seen as resistant to climate change action, Mongolia, Nepal and the Czech Republic. Another debutant is a first group of participants from Antarctica: the Davis Research Station, which is home to several dozen scientists who presumably will not be also switching off their heaters in -10 degrees Celsius.James Leape, international director general of WWF, said the worldwide event was particularly important after the disappointment of the climate conference in Copenhagen last year. &quot;There was a sense after Copenhagen that we, as a world, had lost momentum,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the important things about this year is that it is a chance for people to say &apos;Hey, we are still concerned about climate change.&apos; A lot of people are looking for an opportunity. If they speak out by themselves, it may not make much of an impact, but through this shared action of Earth Hour, they have a platform to speak.&quot; Leape is in Beijing to attend a darkening ceremony at the Forbidden City, the 600-year-old symbol of Chinese power. Last year, China&apos;s support for Earth Hour clashed, time-wise, with the anniversary of the Tibetan unrest in 2008, prompting some organisations, including Peking university, to warn students not to get involved. This year, with no such complications, participation is enthusiastic. Fifteen Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Dalian, have signed up. Pandas in Sichuan will be involved, along with cartoon characters in Hong Kong, and rock bands in Xiamen. Chinese organisers are using the event to kick-off a &quot;low-carbon lifestyle week&quot; aimed at persuading consumers in the world&apos;s most populous country not to follow the wasteful example of developed nations. The message is catching on at the grassroots. Among the events in the former Chinese capital of Xian, will be a free unplugged music concert. Across the world, people are expected to mark the event in ways that reflect the diversity, creativity and inequality of the human population. In cities like Tokyo, Seoul and New York, netizens are being asked to record landmark buildings&apos; switch-off on their mobile phones and upload them online. In Zimbabwe, hundreds of children will join a candle-lit picnic at Victoria Falls. In Canada, an Earth Hour Blackberry application has proved a hit. Elsewhere, the world&apos;s highest paid supermodel, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and World Cup-winning footballer Francesco Totti will act as spokespeople for the event, along with South Africa&apos;s archbishop Desmond Tutu. Not everywhere is going dark. Tanzania initially did not sign up because few would notice a switch off in Dar es Salaam and other cities where only 10% of people have electricity. Instead, WWF organised a &quot;switch on&quot; of solar energy for a local school last year. It will scale this up to 20 schools this year.In Madagascar, 99% of the country has no electricity and people are frightened to be on the streets after dark because of the instability that has followed the political crisis. But WWF says residents have asked to participate. &quot;There are only 12 street lights on the Chatham Islands and for safety reasons these will remain on,&quot; said Pickles. Organisers said locals would enjoy making the news, but the event would have to compete with a 21st birthday party at the one hotel in town. &quot;A lot of people will be there,&quot; said Lee Barry, Earth Hour Project Manager in New Zealand. &quot;Hopefully someone will remember to turn the lights off.&quot;", "tags": ["Earth Hour", "Energy", "Climate change", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "World news", "WWF"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-26T16:09:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/27/kick-ass-aaron-johnson-comics", "sentences": ["As a child, he appeared in adverts for Persil and McDonald&apos;s, made a movie with Jackie Chan (2003&apos;s Shanghai Knights), and paid his actor&apos;s dues with appearances in Casualty and The Bill."], "title": "Aaron Johnson's new superhero movie is Kick-Ass", "article": "Even for an actor, Aaron Johnson hasn&apos;t had a normal life. He made his stage debut at six years old, playing a ghost. As a child, he appeared in adverts for Persil and McDonald&apos;s, made a movie with Jackie Chan (2003&apos;s Shanghai Knights), and paid his actor&apos;s dues with appearances in Casualty and The Bill. In his mid-teens, he moved out of the family home, became a modest pin-up, played John Lennon, fell in love with a woman twice his age, and is now expecting his first child. He turns 20 this summer. The woman, is, of course, Sam Taylor-Wood \u2013 his director on the Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy \u2013 and, until now, this is how most people know Aaron Johnson: the red-carpet toy boy. But now, he&apos;s about to make an impact on his own terms. This week sees the release of Kick-Ass, the hotly anticipated comic-book adaptation in which Johnson stars as Dave Lizewski, a mild-mannered New York schoolboy with no superpowers whatsoever, just the determination to don a mask and a uniform to fight inner-city crime. Co-written by director Matthew Vaughn with Jane Goldman, Jonathan Ross&apos;s wife, it&apos;s a fast-paced, funny, blood-and-guts action-adventure romp, in which our would-be vigilante hero crosses swords with a vicious gangster before being bailed out by the superhero team of Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl, a perky, murderous 11-year-old assassin. It&apos;s a wild ride, and much of it plays out in front of Johnson&apos;s wide, doe-like eyes: he plays this male ingenue to perfection, just nerdy enough to be charming with it, but never straining our sympathy or, more importantly, our credulity.     Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass    It&apos;s hard to believe that Johnson was 18 when he made Kick-Ass and Nowhere Boy back to back, and the footage of him in his tux \u2013 suave and distinguished \u2013 at the Baftas suggested that this once goofy teen had become middle-aged overnight. In the flesh, though, Johnson is very much his age. He&apos;s surprisingly shy, his articulacy comes and goes, and he swears like a trooper, to the extent that we&apos;ve toned down his potty mouth in this piece to spare his blushes. He is, however, quite compellingly handsome. No one has noticed it yet, but there is something of the young De Niro, circa Mean Streets, in his face. Johnson would be thrilled by the comparison: he loves Scorsese&apos;s films, and Tarantino&apos;s too, having been introduced to Pulp Fiction by his big sister at the age of four. &quot;I didn&apos;t understand a fucking word,&quot; he grins. &quot;But I loved it.&quot; We meet in the film&apos;s PR company&apos;s offices. He&apos;s wearing a light-blue trilby, which he keeps on throughout, even when his Nando&apos;s burger arrives. The buzz surrounding Kick-Ass \u2013 financed privately by Vaughn then sold to the highest bidder \u2013 hasn&apos;t quite registered yet. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to really sink in until it comes out,&quot; he muses. &quot;It&apos;s quite odd. I remember we were joking about it on the set. We&apos;d say to Matthew, &apos;So who&apos;s distributing this, then?&apos; And he&apos;d say, &apos;Well, so far, no one. So this could be one of the most expensive home videos you&apos;ll ever see.&apos; But it never really crossed my mind how it would go, because it never does. To be honest, Nowhere Boy and Kick-Ass are the only films that have ever really kinda surfaced properly, that I&apos;ve ever done. Usually, the best hope for me is that it might end up on Sky Movies Plus 2 at four in the morning.&quot; He admits that he went into Kick-Ass blithely unaware of its commercial prospects. &quot;I loved doing it, and the creative part is what I love doing most,&quot; he says. &quot;It will do what it will. But I never really understood what it was going to be setting itself up for. It wasn&apos;t a commercial superhero movie \u2013 it&apos;s Superbad meets Kill Bill. Most people in the States who wanna see it can&apos;t, because it&apos;s R-rated, so it&apos;s hard to tell what&apos;s coming. I just knew what it felt like; and it felt real.&quot; &apos;I can&apos;t think of anything worse than trying to schmooze someone with the idea that you&apos;re an actor&apos; Johnson shifts a lot while we&apos;re talking. Was acting something he did to overcome nerves? Some actors take up &quot;the craft&quot; as a shortcut to meeting girls, but he&apos;s not one of them. &quot;I never used it for attention from girls,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;Quite the opposite. I can&apos;t think of anything worse than trying to schmooze someone with the idea that you&apos;re an actor.&quot; He laughs: &quot;It&apos;s like writing &apos;cunt&apos; on your fucking forehead! No, I just enjoyed it.&quot; So he&apos;s never been a show-off? &quot;No. And if I was, I&apos;d have got clipped around the ear &apos;ole. I was never a kid that would brag about anything.&quot; Growing up in Holmer Green, between the wilds of Chesham and the urban ghetto that is High Wycombe, Johnson looked to American films for his inspiration. &quot;And that was it,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess my love for film \u2013 or my idea of what film was \u2013 fed into the theatre work I was doing. I&apos;d look at Michael Madsen and think that if you squinted your eyes and frowned a lot, somehow it would make sense. Same with De Niro, or Harvey Keitel. They all had fucking mean faces, they all had fucking scowls on their faces, and I&apos;d always try to copy them!&quot; His inner bad guy, however, is yet to surface. Instead, Johnson&apos;s opted for a series of roles that have taken him perilously close to teen heart-throb status, something he&apos;s seen in Robert Pattinson&apos;s career and would rather not emulate (&quot;That seems like hell,&quot; he shivers). The closest he came was with Gurinder Chadha&apos;s Angus, Thongs And Perfect Snogging, which he took because &quot;it was a good script, for that age group&quot;. It was an experiment, he says now. &quot;When it came out, I had, like, Sugar and Bliss magazines knocking on the door, saying, &apos;We want to do a poster shoot.&apos; I was, like, &apos;Ahhh, fuck \u2026&apos; And that&apos;s when I went to America. I was trying to find something bizarre and different. And then Kick-Ass came along. The idea that I would be playing some kind of nerdy, nobody kid, who couldn&apos;t get girls and was the complete opposite of a heart-throb \u2026&quot; He pauses: &quot;I thought, &apos;YES!&apos;&quot;     Thomas Sangster as Paul McCartney (left) and Aaron Johnson as John Lennon in Nowhere Boy.    Since making Kick-Ass, his showcase follow-up, Nowhere Boy, has come and gone in the UK, though its US release is scheduled for the autumn. Was he disappointed? Despite its flaws, the film was a handsome bet, yet pretty much tanked, taking less than \u00a31m. &quot;I don&apos;t really think that much about it,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;I also don&apos;t really care. As much as I&apos;m really proud of Nowhere Boy, and proud of Sam, and want people to see it, I don&apos;t know if it hurts me too much.&quot; He cites the Christmas release date, which saw the film opening against Avatar, Sherlock Holmes and some hideous weather. &quot;You ain&apos;t gonna get bums on seats, man,&quot; he says. &quot;And the producers \u2013 well, that affects them more than it affects us, because they get the money.&quot; He sighs: &quot;It&apos;s all lingo and figures.&quot; Though he laughs at comparisons with Brangelina, and admits that the pair got off lightly in press coverage of the Baftas, Johnson doesn&apos;t believe that his romance with Taylor-Wood has been accepted by the media yet. &quot;It&apos;s funny, because they&apos;re all these faceless \u2026 cowards, almost, that come out of nowhere,&quot; he says. &quot;Anyway, I don&apos;t read any of it, and neither does Sam. It&apos;s just bullshit. We never tried to hide anything, because we knew if we did there&apos;d just be more interest. We&apos;re together, and that&apos;s it. Now shut up and fuck off!&quot; But soon, of course, Hollywood will be calling. As a young father-to-be, does Johnson have any regrets about missing out on a misspent youth? &quot;The thing is, you know what, I&apos;ve done all that,&quot; he decides. &quot;All the messing around I got out of my system earlier on, when I was 16 and working away from home. In the film industry you work hard and you play hard. I did all that, got it all out my system. And LA? There isn&apos;t a fantasy Hollywood. There isn&apos;t one. Whatever it is, it ain&apos;t there. LA&apos;s just where my work is. It&apos;s so business-orientated and soulless, it&apos;s all about figures.

Steel magnate Du Shuanghua head of metals company Rizhao, was named during the proceedings at a Shanghai court where the British multinational&apos;s employees faced hours of questioning. Du, China&apos;s second-wealthiest man in 2008 according to the Hurun rich list, allegedly gave $9m (\u00a36m) to Wang Yong, one of the Rio executives, the court was told. Wang&apos;s lawyer denied wrongdoing and said the money was a loan to buy shares in companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Observers said that allegations against China&apos;s businessmen, who have grown ever richer as state capitalism has flourished, are not unusual. Huang Guangyu, the richest man in 2008, is to go on trial soon on accusations of bribery, insider trading and illegal business dealings. He has been detained for two years. However, the naming of Du by one of the accused executives added an extra dimension to a trial that is politically and economically sensitive. Zhang Peihong, Wang&apos;s lawyer, said his client&apos;s case turned on allegations he accepted a $9m bribe from Du, who owns a big stake in Rizhao Steel, one of the country&apos;s largest steelmakers, or whether the money was paid for other purposes as he claimed. Steel companies have pushed in recent years to secure supply contracts with big miners, such as Rio, as the contract price has often been lower than the global spot price for iron ore. According to the Financial Times, Du has also been involved in a battle to retain control of Rizhao, after coming under pressure to sell a majority stake in his company to a state-owned rival. In an interview in a Chinese magazine, Du said his objectives were not limited to having the largest steel enterprise in Shandong province. He wants to expand into port construction and develop metals technology. Former premier Deng Xiaoping might have declared that getting rich was glorious three decades ago, but China&apos;s millionaires have every reason to shun publicity. When a Forbes Magazine survey of China&apos;s richest appeared in 1999, observers called it the &quot;death list&quot; after a tax crackdown targeted many of those mentioned, with scores jailed and several executed. Du grew up in Hebei province, near Beijing. His father headed a department at a steel plant and he worked there, leaving at 22to set up his own factory making steel tubes. Du Qinghe, the party secretary of his home town, told a Chinese newspaper: &quot;He could not afford to hire a crane \u2026 He moved bricks himself and ate steamed bread with workers on the ground.&quot; Business boomed and more plants followed \u2013 until a steel shortage in 2001. Du spotted his chance and moved into the industry, catapulting him into the big league. It reportedly took him less than six months to build his first mill and start production. While Rizhao has suffered during the recession, it has out-performed many state firms. But in September last year, state-owned Shandong Steel bought 67% of Rizhao, and Du dropped 39 places on the Hurun rich list. That does not mean his story is over; he is looking for opportunities \u2013 and Hurun still estimated his assets at $2.3bn.

It is a telling outsiders&apos; view of the country, with the wall serving as a potent symbol for the insularity of the Chinese. Recently, however, western business executives have been given reason to wonder exactly how welcome they now are behind that stonework. China continues to expand aggressively overseas, hoovering up natural as well as economic resources. Within the country, the government&apos;s long-term plans to create a legion of homegrown business champions across crucial sectors of industry are bearing fruit. But it is sparking howls of &quot;protectionism&quot; from foreign rivals, and the threat of tit-for-tat trade barriers being thrown up in retaliation. Policymakers, especially on Capitol Hill, are also sabre-rattling about the resistance of the Chinese authorities to revalue the yuan, -\u2013 undervalued by as much as 40% \u2013 with the Obama administration set to label China a &quot;currency manipulator&quot; in a treasury department report next month. The increasingly chilly business climate, coupled with the continuing existence of the regime&apos;s less savoury side, from repression of free speech to the use of prison labour, means some companies are having to ask themselves what they are getting out of the country or whether they might not be better off pulling out. That is not a move most would contemplate lightly, and businesses are aware that investing in China is a long-term enterprise. &quot;Obviously in any territory, and China is no exception, where there is rapid social change and rapid economic change then it is bound to have some stresses and strains along the way,&quot; says Nigel Rogers, chief executive of contract manufacturer Stadium Group and a man who has been doing business in China for well over a decade. &quot;But over the longer term it remains an extremely good place to do business.&quot; China has weathered the global economic crisis surprisingly well. Its export-led economy was hit hard, but Beijing, with the luxury of its vast foreign currency reserves, cranked up a $585bn spending package, and ordered banks to pump out credit. These measures were so successful the biggest worldwide downturn since the Great Depression made barely a dent in China&apos;s growth rate. Exports have rebounded strongly, and the Chinese authorities are now busy withdrawing the stimulus. Some economists are concerned that China&apos;s response to the crisis has only succeeded by inflating unsustainable bubbles in other areas of the economy \u2013 the property market, for example. Not everyone buys into that view. Mark Williams, senior China economist at Capital Economics, says: &quot;The talk of bubbles is overdone. Property prices nationally are up a little bit more than 10% year-on-year, but that&apos;s in a country where incomes are growing faster than that.&quot; Diana Choyleva, of consultancy Lombard Street Research, believes China&apos;s state-owned banks could be sitting on huge non-performing loans, as the Japanese financial sector was during the final years of the 1980s boom. That&apos;s fine as long as the Chinese public keep the merry-go-round moving by pouring their savings into the banks; but if inflation gets out of control, and consumers lose their appetite for saving as they watch their bank balances being eroded, she says the entire &quot;house of cards&quot; could collapse. Qu Hongbin, China economist at HSBC, reckons the authorities have a good chance of wrestling inflation under control, pointing out that premier Wen Jiabao highlighted the social consequences of rapidly rising prices as his primary concern at the recent National People&apos;s Congress \u2013 and most of all, the recent rise in prices results in food inflation. He says the latest budget, which included a sharp slowdown in the pace of public spending growth, should help to bring the economy back under control, and has just upgraded his growth forecast for China this year to 10%. But the difficulties businesses can face have been highlighted by the recent conflicting decisions made by Google and mining giant Rio Tinto. Google last week shuttered its controversially self-censored Chinese search engine, transferring all traffic to an unexpurgated site in Hong Kong in the expectation that at any moment the authorities would block Chinese web users from visiting the site. Tomorrow judgment will be handed down in the case of four Rio Tinto workers charged with bribery and stealing commercial secrets. Many back in the Square Mile believed it was no coincidence that the arrests followed on the heels of the mining giant&apos;s decision to reject the offer of investment from Chinalco, China&apos;s state-owned aluminium group \u2013 a move that annoyed the Chinese authorities. Rio Tinto instead raised cash from shareholders and jumped into an iron ore joint venture with rival BHP Billiton. But despite having four men in the dock, Rio earlier this month signed a $2.9bn deal with Chinalco to develop an iron ore mine in the west African state of Guinea. The case has thrown the spotlight, once again, on corruption in China. In a move that raised eyebrows among watchers of the country, state-controlled Sinopec, Asia&apos;s biggest refiner, last week laid the blame for corruption at the door of western companies, claiming that one of its employees received a bribe from German carmaker Daimler, which is currently the subject of an anti-corruption investigation in US. &quot;We urge and hope that the government will encourage a normal market environment and good business conduct by working to severely punish audacious challenges from multinational companies and lawbreaking business people,&quot; Sinopec said in a statement. Cynical observers might suggest the contrasting approaches of Rio Tinto and Google are symptomatic of the realpolitik practised by the extraction industry compared to the trendy dotcom set. In reality, both companies had their eyes on the bottom line when deciding how to deal with China. For Rio Tinto, China is too large a market to ignore and is a market to which it is already heavily exposed. Some two-thirds of its iron ore finds its way to Chinese customers, helping to fuel the building explosion that has created Shanghai&apos;s crane-filled skyline. For Google, however, it may be the largest internet market in the world \u2013 with over 400 million people plugged into the web \u2013 but it represents just a tiny fraction of its $24bn a year business. Analysts reckon it makes just 1% or 2% of its revenues \u2013 $250m to $500m \u2013 from China. Crucially, only about half of that is advertising revenue generated from within China itself: in other words, Chinese companies using Google to advertise to Chinese citizens. The rest is money spent by Chinese companies to advertise on Google sites outside China in order to attract foreign customers \u2013 and that cash will still flow. . As for China&apos;s internal online advertising market, despite having been in the country since 2006, Google has not made much of an impression on a sector dominated by homegrown rivals such as Baidu. Better to return when conditions are more favourable \u2013 that way, Google gains kudos for not yielding to the regime and can smooth ruffled feathers among its own staff, leaving &quot;collaborators&quot; such as Microsoft&apos;s Bing and Yahoo to deal with the ire of campaigners. In essence, the difference between the two approaches is that the web will outlast the regime in China, but the world&apos;s iron ore deposits may not. But Google&apos;s withdrawal, which has so angered the administration that the State Council Information Office has even clamped down on its reporting within the country, highlights the continuing uneasy relationship between the country and western businesses. It is a relationship that has become even more tetchy in recent months because China&apos;s push for what the government terms &quot;indigenous innovation&quot; \u2013 put in place by Beijing&apos;s 15-year Science and Technology Plan in 2006 \u2013 is beginning to create national champions who foreign rivals believe are getting an unfair leg-up. Myron Brilliant, the international head of the US Chamber of Commerce, the world&apos;s largest business federation, last week sounded a warning to an audience of senior Chinese dignitaries. &quot;As we approach the 10-year anniversary of Congress awarding China permanent normal trade relations status, there is palpable and rising concern that China is becoming less friendly to foreign firms,&quot; he said, adding that policies which discriminate based on nationality of investment not only put overseas companies at a disadvantage, they also undermine China&apos;s goal of becoming an innovative economy by 2020. &quot;The Chamber pledges to resist protectionist approaches in the US,&quot; he said. &quot;But, make no mistake, pressures are mounting, particularly in this election year.&quot; His comments were all the more surprising because Brilliant has done much to rein in the worst excesses being demanded by headline-grabbing politicians in Washington DC. But looking at the figures, China is swinging against outside investment: a recent survey by the US Chamber of Commerce showed that more than a quarter of technology firms who responded reckoned they were losing out in China because of the &quot;indigenous innovation&quot; plan. And, in a country with a government procurement budget of 600bn yuan ($90bn) a year and state-owned companies that have a combined turnover of 22.5 trillion yuan, Beijing has some pretty powerful levers to pull for its own side. Some British companies in the region, however, are more sanguine. &quot;If you look at history then protectionism usually follows a period of turbulence in the world economy,&quot; points out Nigel Rogers, whose company runs a factory in the Guangdong province of China. &quot;In that respect, it is inevitable that some people will see protectionism as a means of achieving their aims. But in the longer term, global trade is dependent on dropping barriers and increasing the overall volume of trade. Ultimately, I think that the groundswell of enthusiasm for global trade will win the day but there may be pockets of protectionism along the way as a result of what has happened over the last 18 months in the world economy.&quot;", "tags": ["Investing", "China", "Rio Tinto", "Business", "World news", "Google", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-28T00:06:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/29/rio-tinto-four-jailed-china", "sentences": ["Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto has fired four executives in China after a Shanghai court sentenced them today to between seven and 14 years in prison on bribery and secrets charges.", "The Shanghai intermediate people&apos;s court sentenced Hu to seven years in prison for accepting bribes and five years on the secrets charges, but said he will serve 10 years.", "&quot;Clearly it&apos;s a different legal system, but we have to respect that as we would in any other jurisdiction.&quot; Although the firm had no representatives in court, the Australian consul in Shanghai was present for the sessions dealing with bribery and reported back to the company."], "title": "Rio Tinto four jailed for up to 14 years by Chinese court", "article": "Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto has fired four executives in China after a Shanghai court sentenced them today to between seven and 14 years in prison on bribery and secrets charges. The verdicts come eight months after the detention of Australian citizen Stern Hu and his three Chinese colleagues shocked the international business world. Hu headed the firm&apos;s iron ore sales in China. Australia&apos;s foreign minister Stephen Smith described Hu&apos;s sentence for bribery as &quot;very tough&quot; and said there were &quot;serious unanswered questions&quot; about the secrets conviction because that part of the trial was held behind closed doors. The foreign minister said he did not believe the case will have any adverse implications for the relationship between the two countries but that China had missed the opportunity to &quot;bring some clarity to the notion or question of commercial secrets.&quot; The four men pleaded guilty to accepting bribes in a three-day hearing last week, but said they had not taken the amounts alleged. It is thought that one admitted stealing commercial secrets while the others denied the charges. It is very rare for defendants to be cleared in criminal cases in China. In an extremely unusual move, reflecting the international attention on the case, it allowed foreign reporters into the building to see the verdict via a video link between courtrooms. Rio Tinto said in a statement that it could not comment on the secrets charges since they were heard in closed sessions. But Sam Walsh, chief executive of Rio Tinto Iron Ore, added: &quot;We have been informed of the clear evidence presented in court that showed beyond doubt that the four convicted employees had accepted bribes. By doing this they engaged in deplorable behaviour that is totally at odds with our strong ethical culture. In accordance with our policies we will terminate their employment.&quot; The firm&apos;s chief executive, Tom Albanese, commented: &quot;Ethical behaviour is at the heart of everything we do. &quot;I am determined that the unacceptable conduct of these four employees will not prevent Rio Tinto from continuing to build its important relationship with China.&quot; A defence lawyer told Reuters last week that the men had all said the company was not aware of their actions. The four executives were detained shortly after the collapse of a multibillion-pound deal under which China&apos;s state-owned metals group Chinalco would have raised its stake in the mining conglomerate to 18%. But this month the two companies signed an agreement to jointly develop an iron-ore project in Guinea. The Shanghai intermediate people&apos;s court sentenced Hu to seven years in prison for accepting bribes and five years on the secrets charges, but said he will serve 10 years. Wang Yong was sentenced to 14 years, 13 of which were for accepting bribes, after testimony from a steel tycoon who said he had paid the executive $9m (\u00a36m). He must also pay a 200,000 yuan (\u00a319,500) fine and will have 5m yuan of assets confiscated. Ge Minqiang was sentenced to eight years and Liu Caikui to seven. Both men face substantial fines and asset confiscations too. Initial Chinese media reports suggested the men were being held in connection with state secrets charges. But after protests from Australia, and amid intense concern from foreign executives, the men were charged with lesser offences. Even so, many legal experts expressed concern about the case. A key piece of testimony \u2013 from steel magnate Du Shuanghua, who said he gave Wang a $9m bribe to ensure a steady supply of ore at a fixed price \u2013 was given in writing. Defence requests for Du to appear in person were dismissed. The well-known lawyer expected to represent Hu was absent from court, to the surprise of other defence barristers, who said they did not recognise his representatives. Ann Kent, of Australian National University&apos;s college of law, told Reuters: &quot;Outstanding issues remain as to the conduct of the trial, including the lack of detailed information on the nature of the charges, the lack of transparency about the material evidence, the failure to reveal the reasons behind the apparent guilty pleas, and the lack of cross-examination of the witnesses.&quot; A spokesman for Rio Tinto in London said: &quot;We have seen sufficient evidence against the four regarding the receipt of bribes \u2013 such as bank transfers and cash moves and so on \u2013 that we were not privy to before. &quot;Clearly it&apos;s a different legal system, but we have to respect that as we would in any other jurisdiction.&quot; Although the firm had no representatives in court, the Australian consul in Shanghai was present for the sessions dealing with bribery and reported back to the company. He was not allowed to attend those related to secrets charges.

Do you detect a note of worry in the wording? It&apos;s almost as if the message were &quot;Global warming is unstoppable&quot; or &quot;Kiss goodbye to your weekends in the country&quot;. But it might have been better written this way: &quot;Urbanisation is the greatest design challenge we face in the 21st century.&quot; The story was about UN-Habitat&apos;s latest report on the state of the world&apos;s cities, in which the agency predicts that some metropolises will join up like blobs of mercury to create &quot;mega-regions&quot;. One of these is in west Africa, where the cities of Lagos, Ibadan, Lom\u00e9 and Accra are threatening to merge. Which is fine, except that the amalgamation would sprawl across the national borders of Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana.  For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in the countryside. By 2050, three quarters of us are expected to be urbanites. That&apos;s a lot of people heading for the bright lights. But here&apos;s the scary part: most of this growth is happening in places where millions of people already live in slums. Mumbai, Delhi, Karachi, Shanghai, S\u00e3o Paulo, Kinshasa: these are the fastest-growing cities in the world, most of them destined to have populations of more than 20 million by 2025. Between now and then, Lagos will have to make room for 67 new arrivals per hour. If we don&apos;t start designing for these new inhabitants now, then the potential for human misery is all the greater. The cities we love most are slow burners, layered accretions of history \u2013 London, Paris or Rome, for instance. Yet here we are, in the position of having to manufacture new urban spaces, as though cities were just another type of product. The philosopher Henri Lefebvre anticipated this situation in the 1960s, when he argued that urban space was the new commodity. He saw that it wasn&apos;t just stocks and shares that were being speculated on but pieces of city. Lefebvre&apos;s theory was that industrialisation \u2013 the story of the last 150 years \u2013 was being replaced by urbanisation. Today, we talk about having moved from the industrial age to the information age. But this is also the urban age.  The commodification of urban space has come on in leaps and bounds since Lefebvre&apos;s day. The same deregulation that relieved the banks of any compunction to behave responsibly has also been changing the visible face of the city. The free-market agenda is what makes public spaces in so many cities nothing more than places to shop at chain stores or drink at Costa Coffee, often under the supervision of private security guards. The privatisation of public space, like that of public services, is one way that governments can avoid their democratic accountability. Yet even Lefebvre didn&apos;t predict the extent to which cities would become products. These days a client can order a new metropolis simply by picking up the phone to a famous architect. Take Masdar, the eco-city in Abu Dhabi designed by Norman Foster, or the oft-cited eco-cities in China, such as Dongtan, designed by London-based engineers Arup (currently on hold), or Tianjin. With China expecting 300 million new urban dwellers in the next 20 years, it has no choice but to adopt the build-it-and-they-will-come approach. Of course, city production has a history. There was Ebenezer Howard&apos;s Garden Cities movement at the turn of the last century, which resulted in new towns such as Letchworth; and New Urbanism in the US, which yielded places such as Seaside in Florida, used as the setting of The Truman Show. But these were escapist fantasies designed by people who hated cities. More relevant are those created as heroic emblems of political will, such as Brasilia in Brazil, Astana in Kazakhstan or (the example that trumps them all) Dubai. Some of the shine may have sloughed off Dubai since the recession, but there has never been such a glaring example of the city as a product \u00ad\u2013 as a brand, even. The brand consultant is the \u00e9minence grise of the modern city. Sometimes it&apos;s the mayor, and sometimes it falls to cult designers of Joy Division covers such as Peter Saville, who a few years ago was appointed creative director of Manchester. Or take the Canadian design guru Bruce Mau, who is called up with requests such as: &quot;Can you provide a vision for the future of Mecca?&quot; This has come to be known as &quot;design thinking&quot;, and it is ever more important to cities in a competitive global environment where lucrative awards such as the Olympics, European Capital of Culture and World Design City are on offer. Cities, the engines of the world&apos;s wealth, are sometimes more important than the countries they are located in. The question is this: how do we create cities that are not just containers for tightly-packed populations, but pleasant and equitable places to live? Someone once described the identical high-rises that ring so many capitals as the easyJet of urban living, because they offer everyone affordable access to the city; but they&apos;re not what you could call idealistic. The segregation and social polarisation of cities is getting so extreme that a violent future may be inevitable. The UN report has said as much. Now that city-making has become a priority, politicians need to have faith in designers. Because if there&apos;s one lesson to be learned from the last quarter of a century, it&apos;s that we need to shift our focus away from liberty and the free market, and move towards equality.", "tags": ["Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "Housing", "Society", "Communities", "Urbanisation", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-29T13:39:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/29/rio-tinto-china-secrecy-viewpoint", "sentences": ["So, the &quot;Rio Tinto four&quot; are guilty and the company accepts the verdict of the Shanghai number one people&apos;s intermediate court."], "title": "Rio Tinto suffers China syndrome", "article": "So, the &quot;Rio Tinto four&quot; are guilty and the company accepts the verdict of the Shanghai number one people&apos;s intermediate court.

It was not that the McLaren team principal was disappointed with his drivers in race here. Lewis Hamilton produced another stunning drive, moving from 20th to 12th on the opening lap, and Jenson Button made up ground after a ponderous start. But because of the farce surrounding their qualifying effort on Saturday, they could manage only sixth and eighth and lost ground in the drivers&apos; championship. McLaren and Ferrari were guilty of looking at each other as the rain started to fall, instead of concentrating on beating the weaker cars. Whitmarsh said: &quot;Do I feel frustrated by the outcome? Of course. We have learned lessons. The primary one is that in Q1 [the first qualifying session] we are not racing Ferrari, the other big boys. We just need to get through to Q2 and cover the slow cars in those changeable conditions.&quot; With three poor teams among the 12, Hamilton and Button merely have to beat six cars, plus one another, to avoid being among the seven cars that are eliminated before the third qualifying round. Whitmarsh said: &quot;We have to make sure we get it right in China. We have some more things coming through for the car which I believe will make us a few tenths quicker. If we develop the car quicker than our competitors we can win this championship. We are up in there. Red Bull look very strong \u2013 and they won&apos;t stand still \u2013 and so do Ferrari and Mercedes. &quot;We have proven we are a good team at developing the car and we will push hard to do that. We put our hands up and said qualifying was a disaster for us. There is no point in being defensive about it, but we did go out before the guys who finished first and second. Jenson did qualify for Q2 before he went off. Our style is not to defend ourselves, it is to say the outcome was a disaster. Could we have got it better? Yes. &quot;But if I played you through the weather radar and showed you what it showed us you would see why we did what we did. The mistake was that at this end of the pit lane we expect to be at the front in each session.&quot; Button feels encouraged that while he and Hamilton trail in the championship, it is still close. &quot;It is early in the season, but it is incredibly tight,&quot; the reigning world champion said. &quot;We have all evened out now. It is weird. It is like the season is starting. Nobody has got away. I lost some points to a few people like Nico Rosberg, Felipe Massa and Sebastian Vettel, who is in front of me now, but we are still close. &quot;There are a few issues I need to solve, but there is no team like this team for solving issues.&quot;", "tags": ["Formula One", "McLaren", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-05T12:59:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/apr/13/rich-recession-designer-luxury-brands", "sentences": ["But the growing power of the Chinese consumer was implicit in LVMH&apos;s success: sales at the jewellery business were up 75% in Asia and 18% at Louis Vuitton with two stores to open in Shanghai."], "title": "Acting rich: recession sees roaring trade in champagne and Louis Vuitton handbags", "article": "Recession was supposed to call time on conspicuous consumption but LVMH, the world&apos;s biggest luxury goods firm, said austerity chic was out and bling was back as it reported soaring demand for its Krug Champagne, designer handbags and diamond-set Tag Heuer watches. The Paris-based maker of Louis Vuitton handbags took analysts&apos; breath away with a 13% jump in first quarter sales as consumers around the world start to loosen the purse strings after two years of sobriety. The biggest surprise was the rip-roaring trade enjoyed by LVMH&apos;s drinks&apos; business where sales jumped almost 20% on renewed demand for champagne. LVMH tried to keep a lid on the excitement, as some analysts interpreted the performance as evidence the global luxury goods market is on the mend after suffering its worst slump in two decades, with Chris Hollis, its financial communications director, pointing to signs of recovery in the US, Asia and Europe but cautioning: &quot;It would be premature to declare the beginning of an upturn.&quot; There was no such reserve from investors intoxicated by the French company&apos;s bumper sales which included a 33% increase in champagne volumes from a cellar that includes prestigious brands such as Mo\u00ebt et Chandon, Don P\u00e9rignon and Krug. The group&apos;s sales growth, double what analysts had expected, saw LVMH&apos;s shares touch \u20ac92.36 \u2013 its highest sine September 2000 \u2013 with the feelgood factor extended to peers such as Gucci-owner PPR, Richemont and Christian Dior, whose shares also gained ground. Dennis Weber, luxury goods analyst at Evolution, said LVMH&apos;s performance chimed with its rivals such as Richemont and Bulgari, which reported a better start to this year than last. &quot;The mood of the luxury goods customer has changed, particularly in markets such as China,&quot; he said. LVMH said demand for Hennessy Cognac were up 13% in part due to demand in Asia during the Chinese new year. Weber also said Swiss export data suggested a pickup in demand for its biggest export \u2013 its watches. That trend was borne out at LVMH&apos;s watch and jewellery business where sales surged 34%. Demand for its brands, which include Chaumet and Tag Heuer, had sagged last year as consumers shied away from wrist candy such as a diamond-studded Tag Heuer Classic which retails for more than \u00a35,000. The luxury goods sector had suffered as not only customers held back at the nadir of the downturn. So did stores, with buyers placing cautious orders and focusing on selling products in their storerooms \u2013 the practice known as destocking. Analysts said the huge sales gains posted by LVMH in its drinks and watch business reflected retailers and wholesalers replenishing their stocks as they anticipate that the trend of improving consumer confidence would continue. &quot;There are signs of improved demand from consumers but it is difficult to measure precisely ... it is too early to draw conclusions about the demand for the balance of the year,&quot; said Hollis. All parts of the LVMH empire, which encompasses fashion, drinks, jewellery, perfume and cosmetics, posted a sales growth of more than 10%, with Fran\u00e7ois-R\u00e9gis Breuil, a luxury goods analyst at Oddo Securities, suggesting that pointed to &quot;an end of destocking&quot;, adding: &quot;These figures bode well for the entire sector.&quot; While LVMH&apos;s comments were assiduously cautious, its actions suggested it was feeling confident as it flagged plans to expand its luxury hotels business with two new properties in the Middle East. It also hailed a &quot;remarkable&quot; performance at Louis Vuitton with sales at the fashion brand, which featured Madonna in its latest campaign, up in the &quot;double digits&quot;, and a strong start to the season from Fendi. Sales at its cosmetics division, which includes Parfums Christian Dior and Benefit, were up 11%. Using LVMH&apos;s sprawling empire \u2013 it had sales of \u20ac17bn last year \u2013 as a barometer of consumer confidence around the world, demand was strongest in the US and Asia, with sales up 20%, and Europe posting an 11% gain. Japan remained in the doldrums with sales down 7% as consumers continued to feel the impact of the crisis. Prior to the global recession, luxury goods companies were riding high on the back of soaring demand from emerging markets such as China and India. But the growing power of the Chinese consumer was implicit in LVMH&apos;s success: sales at the jewellery business were up 75% in Asia and 18% at Louis Vuitton with two stores to open in Shanghai. &quot;The recovery started at Christmas when trading was much better than expected,&quot; added Weber. &quot;The question is, will it last?&quot;", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Global economy", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Recession", "UK news", "Business", "World news", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-13T18:58:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/15/iceland-volcano-ash-flights-cancelled", "sentences": ["David Lees, 51, a businessman who was due to fly to Shanghai with a colleague, said the trip had been &quot;completely disrupted&quot; by the volcanic eruption."], "title": "Iceland volcano eruption leaves holiday plans in ashes", "article": "Thousands of confused and angry passengers wandered around Britain&apos;s becalmed airports today trying in vain to find out how long the disruption caused by the ash cloud might last. Airports across the UK came to a standstill after the air traffic control company Nats decided that the climatic conditions posed a serious threat to aircraft. Heathrow normally hosts around 1,300 flights and 180,000 passengers every day, while Gatwick would expect to handle 679 flights carrying 80,000 passengers. Yesterday, only 168 flights passed through the Sussex airport. At Heathrow, travellers dragged their luggage around the terminals, many of them queuing at customer information desks in a bid to rearrange flights. Lines also formed for payphones and the internet as people attempted to contact relatives and find out more information. Many were angry that all flights had been cancelled, with some saying the Nats decision was an over-reaction. David Lees, 51, a businessman who was due to fly to Shanghai with a colleague, said the trip had been &quot;completely disrupted&quot; by the volcanic eruption. &quot;We couldn&apos;t even fly from Manchester this morning so we have already had to shell out \u00a3300 for a train,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a total nightmare, but what can you do?&quot; There were similar scenes at Gatwick. Johann and Carrie Sikora, from Kent, had been due to fly to Verona at noon, for the wedding of two friends on Friday. She is the bridesmaid, while he is the best friend of the groom. &quot;It&apos;s not really sunk in yet, but I&apos;m gutted,&quot; said Johann. He was however, phlegmatic about the reason for the disruption: &quot;If we&apos;d missed the flight because of the traffic I&apos;d have been have been disappointed, but this morning when I turned the TV on I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes.&quot; The couple said they would try to reach Verona by train. Airlines, insurance companies, the Civil Aviation Authority and the EU all reminded passengers of their compensation rights following cancellations. Those who were unable to fly today \u2013 and anyone in the same position tomorrow \u2013 should be offered either a refund or the option of rebooking on a new flight by their airline. If the flight was part of a package deal, and the alternative flight offered would make a big difference to a holiday, travellers should be entitled to cancel the whole deal and get a refund. However, those who have booked only a flight will not be eligible for a refund from the airline for money lost on accommodation or transport arranged at their destination. Anyone travelling on Friday is advised to check the status of their flights on the internet or contact the airline directly. The upheaval caused by the ash cloud could also have serious implications for the economy. The British Chambers of Commerce said the cancellation of thousands of flights in and out of the UK would not help the country emerge from the global economic downturn. &quot;This is the right action to take,&quot; said David Frost, the group&apos;s director general. &quot;However, it comes at a difficult time. Business is just recovering from deep recession and we are seeing for the first time in some years an improvement in our exports. Our recovery depends on British business searching out new overseas markets and getting cargo across the globe.&quot; Patricia Yates, director of strategy and communications for VisitBritain, described the cloud as &quot;a truly unexpected event&quot;. She said: &quot;As for economic impact such a short-term measure would tend to balance out with some inbound visitors unable to arrive but others enjoying an extra day of our sunshine and spending in our hotels, restaurants and attractions.&quot; Despite the chaos caused by the cloud, a volcanologist stressed that it posed no threat to people&apos;s health. &quot;Ash can cause serious health problems but the high altitude of the current plume above the UK means it is air traffic and not humans on the ground that will suffer,&quot; said Dr Dougal Jerram of Durham University&apos;s department of earth sciences.", "tags": ["Iceland", "Air transport", "Transport", "Weather", "Flights", "Travel", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Europe", "Volcanoes"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-15T19:44:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/16/iran-nuclear-fuel-uranium-bomb", "sentences": ["The US is lumbering towards a new round of sanctions, but with China&apos;s concerns about its future supplies of oil and Shanghai-based companies fulfilling Pakistan&apos;s former role as a supplier of dual-use equipment, it is doubtful how effective sanctions will be."], "title": "Iran: Bridgeable differences | Editorial", "article": "From every conceivable viewpoint except Tehran&apos;s, the International Atomic Energy Agency is no closer to defusing the crisis over Iran&apos;s continued enrichment of uranium. President Obama&apos;s deadline has come and gone. The offer to process the majority of Iran&apos;s enriched uranium in Russia and France is still on the table, but as Iran does not trust a US-backed process to deliver the reactor fuel it says it needs, it has begun its own production of 20% enriched uranium. This takes it closer to becoming a nuclear break-out state, capable of producing a bomb. The Senate Armed Services Committee heard on Wednesday that Iran could produce enough fuel for one bomb in a year, but would need from two to five years to manufacture a workable warhead. The US is lumbering towards a new round of sanctions, but with China&apos;s concerns about its future supplies of oil and Shanghai-based companies fulfilling Pakistan&apos;s former role as a supplier of dual-use equipment, it is doubtful how effective sanctions will be. President Hu Jintao said this week he would join negotiations over sanctions, but he did not say he would back them. There is only one sign of progress. Each time US generals talk about the military option, which Israel has pushed for, they are more dismissive of it. And if Centcom really believes that enduring hostilities between Israel and its neighbours represent &quot;distinct challenges&quot; to the US ability to advance its interests in the Middle East, how much truer would that proposition be if you are a US soldier in southern Iraq or Afghanistan, in the aftermath of a strike by Israeli jets on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities? The crack that has begun to open between Israel and Washington on the stalled peace process would overnight become a canyon. Two analysts at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) have argued that the international community should accept Iran&apos;s current counter-offer, which is to have the fuel swap (low-enriched uranium for fuel elements)\u00a0but keep it on Iranian soil. Ivanka Barzashka and Ivan Oelrich say that in haggling over details we are losing sight of the goal, which would be to make it more difficult, not easier, for Iran to build a nuclear weapon. The breakthrough was Iran&apos;s\u00a0agreement to a fuel swap, not where it should happen. Agreeing to a fuel swap on Iranian soil would be a way of stopping the Iranian nuclear countdown, provided it stopped production of 20% uranium. And if it didn&apos;t, it would be more evidence both of Mr Obama&apos;s commitment, and of Iran&apos;s real intentions. Both would be useful\u00a0in\u00a0persuading China and\u00a0Russia. There are both political and technical problems with this approach. It would be another concession, another &quot;final&quot; offer, which might well induce Iran to think it could extract more \u2013 such as allowing its fuel to be handed over in batches rather than in one go. There would be contingent problems over timing and transparency. However, the longer the current impasse continues, the more it plays into the hands of those who push for extreme solutions. The US and Iran are currently engaged in an international beauty contest. After Mr Obama&apos;s attempts to close down the channels of nuclear proliferation, Iran is to host its own conference on nuclear disarmament, entitled &quot;Nuclear energy for everyone, nuclear arms for no one&quot;. China, Russia, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela, Oman and Turkmenistan have already confirmed their participation, but it should be interesting to see at what level. The proof of US attempts to isolate Iran should come at the review conference of the non-proliferation treaty next month. We are back to a familiar game of diplomatic brinkmanship, but one cannot help thinking that if sanity were to break out it would be in a form not too far away from the FAS&apos;s version. The gaps are bridgeable.

It is as dry and black as a bag of coal, befitting the Anglophile he is. When his Swissair flight here from Zurich developed engine trouble on the runway he had to change planes and was delayed four hours. &quot;But we were only on the runway,&quot; he grins. &quot;It was like practice in Formula One. It wasn&apos;t the real thing. It might have been different if we were up in the air.&quot; The winner of the last grand prix in Malaysia \u2013 and the winner here a year ago \u2013 prides himself in knowing rude words in 30 languages but, even though his Red Bull was outpaced by the McLarens and the Mercedes in both practice sessions today, he did not employ a single one. He must have been tempted for weeks now because he, rather than Felipe Massa, should be leading the world championship. Vettel&apos;s car has been the quickest of all in this embryonic season but it was betrayed by unreliability in Bahrain and Melbourne. &quot;Felipe is leading the championship,&quot; Vettel says. &quot;That&apos;s the story and we can&apos;t change it. We will fight hard here and it&apos;s still a long hard season ahead.&quot; He is not only an Anglophile, he is also a retro one and has been seen trawling through vinyl in Heidelberg looking for old examples of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. When he saw someone walking through the paddock in a Beatles T-shirt recently his face burst into a wide smile and he raised his thumbs in approval, an unusual study in relaxation in this travelling circus. The youngest driver, at 19, to score points in the championship, and also the youngest to win pole position, Vettel is the most prominent of the gifted young Germans who make the current scene such an interesting one with Nico Rosberg, Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Adrian Sutil and Timo Glock the others. Baby Schumi is what they call Vettel. He currently looks a likelier champion than the older German and is more popular too, for the severity and ruthlessness of Michael Schumacher has caused many to begrudge his undoubted gifts. &quot;He hates to be compared with me,&quot; Schumacher admits. &quot;But he&apos;s a winner. And he&apos;s going to be a great one.&quot; Everyone is saying it. Britain&apos;s David Coulthard says: &quot;The thing I really like about Sebastian is that he&apos;s very down to earth. He hasn&apos;t let anything that he&apos;s done go to his head.&quot; When Vettel recorded his first victory, driving a Toro Rosso at Monza two years ago, he was asked whether it was the greatest moment of his life. &quot;You obviously weren&apos;t there when I lost my virginity,&quot; he replied. The easy style disguises a private man. Vettel is not to be seen hanging around on or off the track and after the race he heads straight home to Switzerland, where he has just bought a new farmhouse. He had a week off after Malaysia and returned to Europe while other drivers preferred to remain in the east. Last year&apos;s runner-up, Vettel is convinced he can go one better this season. &quot;I think we will be up there this weekend,&quot; he says after afternoon practice today. &quot;I&apos;m only 22 but I already learn that there are no guarantees in life. We have one of the best cars, which is something we can be proud of, but still we have to work hard. &quot;I like this race. I not only won here last year but had a very good race here in 2007, finishing fourth in the Toro Rosso. So I have a lot of good memories of this place. China seems to like us. &quot;It&apos;s always nice to come to the next grand prix with a very good result at the back of you. You have that extra bit more self-confidence. And so has the team.&quot; The chill in China has come as something of a shock. &quot;No one expected the cold weather. Usually where Formula One goes it is summer. The last race in Malaysia was 30 degrees warmer than here, which is quite a lot. I think it will get a bit warmer but the weather is unknown so it can rain any time and most likely on Sunday. &quot;There&apos;s supposed to be a bit of moisture floating around on Sunday afternoon, so it looks like the fans will yet again be given an action-packed race. I think qualifying is going to be tight again.&quot; Vettel looks well set for Shanghai, even if the Ferraris and McLarens provide a more resolute challenge than they did in Kuala Lumpur. He envies McLaren&apos;s F-Duct system. &quot;There is no easier way to gain lap time than driving the car on the straight,&quot; he says.

Hamilton was given a warning by the race stewards after he weaved on the main straight to fend off a challenge from Renault&apos;s Vitaly Petrov at the Malaysian grand prix two weeks ago and the issue was raised at a heated drivers&apos; meeting today. Hamilton was also criticised by Rubens Barrichello of Williams and Renault&apos;s Robert Kubica, but the McLaren driver remained defiant. &quot;I wasn&apos;t cutting him up. He was a good car&apos;s length behind me and I was trying to get him out of the tow,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t feel it was dangerous but we&apos;ll see. I thought it was good racing and it didn&apos;t affect anyone else. I am relaxed about it.&quot; The Briton also hit back at Mark Webber, whose Red Bull ran into the back of him in the second race, the Australian grand prix, possibly costing him a place on the podium. &quot;Maybe they should raise Mark Webber&apos;s incident in Melbourne,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t raise that. I have spoken to a couple of drivers and my feeling is that if you are defending into a corner and you weave more than once, that is illegal. But I am not aware that trying to break the tow was illegal.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s case has the full support of McLaren, whose team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, said: &quot;The stewards looked at this and decided not to penalise Lewis. Lewis was seeking to break the tow, not prevent an overtaking move. As always Lewis drives and races passionately, but always seeks to be entirely safe.&quot; McLaren feel that as Hamilton has twice been cleared by the FIA, the sport&apos;s governing body, both after the incident and again this weekend at the regular review of the previous race, the matter is closed. But Barrichello kept the heat on here when he said of the incident: &quot;I don&apos;t think this is the right thing to do. When I saw it I was by myself watching the TV and I was quite critical of it. If he was beside me I would have given him some bollocking because it wasn&apos;t right. &quot;There are arguments to cover that, to say that he was under acceleration, not in the braking area. There are so many things that they could come up with, but the drivers have a verbal agreement, nothing that has been signed, that you should move only once during the protection of your line. So that, for me, was a Formula Ford thing. It shouldn&apos;t have been done.&quot; Kubica joined the controversy when he said that Hamilton should have been penalised in Penang because the rules were clear. &quot;Reading the regulations, I&apos;m clear,&quot; he said. &quot;Watching Malaysia, I&apos;m not so clear. I think there were too many moves during that race \u2013 not only from one driver.&quot; The controversy did not put Hamilton off his driving here, though. He was fastest in the second practice session, ahead of Nico Rosberg and team-mate Jenson Button as he planned a repeat of his win two years ago. In the morning session Button was fastest, ahead of Rosberg with Hamilton third. Michael Schumacher was fourth fastest in each session. Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One commercial rights holder, has no doubts that the Chinese grand prix \u2013 the Shanghai contract expires this year \u2013 will remain on the schedule despite the shortage of local support. &quot;The contract is ongoing here,&quot; he said. &quot;We can&apos;t have contracts for more than five years, we renew it and it will go on. &quot;It is a shame [about the low crowds] because the whole venue is super.

While the McLarens have produced a competitive race pace in the three previous rounds they have often left themselves with too much work to do, and so it was again today.

Vettel said: &quot;I was very happy with that lap, particularly as I felt unhappy with the car at the start of qualifying.

Once almost invisible in Latin America, China has seen its trade here rise from $10bn a year in 2000 to well over $100bn today. Latin officials are rolling out the red carpet to Chinese delegations and hopping on planes not only to Beijing but also Guangzhou, Nanking and Shanghai. Unlike the Russians, who grab attention by sending warships to visit anti-US leaders, such as Venezuela&apos;s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, but struggle to deliver economic deals, the Chinese are all business. They are importing soy from Argentina, copper from Chile, iron ore from Brazil and zinc from Peru, and export clothes, cars and electronic equipment across the region. The trade helped Latin America to weather the global economic crisis, but there is concern about a &quot;neo-colonial&quot; pattern in which the region&apos;s commodities are sucked abroad while industry loses out to cheap imports aided by China&apos;s undervalued currency. When Argentina accused China of dumping goods, Beijing bared its teeth and banned Argentine soya oil, citing safety concerns. After China&apos;s earthquake, Hu cut short his trip to Brazil and cancelled visits to Chile and Venezuela, where he was due to sign an oil deal. The premier would come another time, said Ch\u00e1vez. Venezuela&apos;s leader has declared himself a Maoist, but that scarcely matters to the Chinese. They just want the oil.", "tags": ["China", "Brazil", "International trade", "World news", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-17T23:05:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/18/volcanic-ash-home-grand-prix", "sentences": ["But for the rest \u2013 spectators, mechanics and media people \u2013 there was the prospect of more time in wet and cold Shanghai, although some were opting for holidays in the US, Hong Kong or Malaysia."], "title": "Volcanic ash leaves fans battling to get home from Chinese grand prix", "article": "The Formula One drivers were not the only people going around in circles here today as thousands of others were making desperate plans to beat the volcanic ash that has resulted in the cancellation of flights back to Europe.

Pupils and teachers on school trips were expected to return to the UK over the weekend, ahead of the first day of the summer term today. But many have been unable to travel because of the Icelandic volcanic eruption that has made flying perilous. In Hertfordshire, 352 children are stranded overseas on school trips in 11 countries, from Iceland to Hong Kong. Some 40 pupils and four teachers from Orleans Park School in Twickenham, south London, are stranded in Shanghai, China. At Stoke Newington secondary school, in north London, a &quot;significant number&quot; of staff are stuck abroad and classes for year 10s have been cancelled today. Mark Southworth, headteacher of Woodcote high school in Croydon, said 12 of his teachers were stranded overseas \u2013 14% of his workforce. Wellington college, a private school in Berkshire, is posting homework and mock exams to its 109 students stranded abroad. The college is running lessons and tutorials by email and on the telephone. Students have been told to find an internet cafe to continue their studies. Dr Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington college, said exams were weeks away and he was leaving nothing to chance. He said: &quot;Our students have been trying very hard to come back, and where they&apos;ve been unable, we are providing this online support \u2013 which will be a precursor of the way education will go in the 21st century.&quot; A primary teacher, Joanne Wallace, used a webcam to conduct assembly to pupils at Parson Street primary school in Bristol. A hundred students stranded in Hangzhou and Beijing, China, are unable to return to the UK for a fortnight. They have been on a government-funded programme that gives students an experience of the country. Danielle Dodds, 20, a Northumbria University student, said: &quot;We have dissertation deadlines, exams and other commitments which we will not be able to fulfill. Our visas will run out this week and we have been told that, in order to extend them, we will each have to open a Chinese bank account and put the equivalent of \u00a32,000 in it \u2013 which few of us have.&quot; In Buckinghamshire, seven schools have school trips stranded abroad. Sue Imbriano, Buckinghamshire&apos;s director of children&apos;s services, said: &quot;We are in contact with the groups and can assure families that the young people involved are being well looked after. We will continue to monitor the situation and keep parents and carers informed.&quot; At Northampton school for boys, 24 pupils are stranded in Japan on a school trip, 16 are being kept in Trinidad and Tobago on a cricket tour, and a further 50 are unable to return to the UK from their holidays abroad.  Some 13 of the school&apos;s teachers are stranded overseas, nine of whom are with pupils on trips. This is more than 14% of the schools&apos; teachers. Mike Griffiths, the school&apos;s headteacher, said he was expecting to spend \u00a38,000 this week on supply teachers. &quot;We have managed to get eight supply teachers for today. It is obviously not ideal. That is a lot of our supply budget. We will be looking to reduce this and ask teachers to do more supply cover. &quot; He said Spanish GCSE orals were being postponed from this week. &quot;We have staff looking at what exams might be affected. We are concerned that students haven&apos;t got the materials they need to revise.&quot; The City of London academy in Bermondsey, south London, has closed to years 7 to 9, and will reopen on Thursday. Hanham Abbots junior school, in South Gloucestershire is closed because eight of its members of staff are stranded. It is likely to reopen tomorrow when five teachers return. A message on its website says: &quot;Due to flight restrictions and eight members of staff stuck in Europe, we will be unable to open the school to pupils tomorrow. We will let you know about Tuesday as soon as possible.&quot; At the City of London academy in Southwark, 21 of the school&apos;s 90 teachers are stranded abroad, including the principal, Martyn Coles. Coles was visiting the academy&apos;s sister school in New York with two other teachers. The school has decided to cancel classes for years 7, 8 and 9 so that it doesn&apos;t have to employ supply teachers. Martin Edwards, the school&apos;s communications officer, said: &quot;It was a decision to do with the quality [of supply teachers]. Everyone will need supply teachers, and we would be in the queue with everyone else.&quot; Universities UK, the umbrella group for university heads, advised any students who were stranded to contact their institution directly as soon as possible. Simon Higman, the University of Southampton&apos;s registrar, posted a comment on the university&apos;s website stating that &quot;a number of students and staff&quot; were stranded.  &quot;Steps will be taken to ensure that any students unable to return to Southampton on Monday as a result of the disruption to air traffic will not be disadvantaged academically.&quot; Chris Keates, general secretary of the Nasuwt teaching union, said primary schools were most likely to close. She said: &quot;Schools do have contingency plans to deal with these sorts of problems because, whether it is a flu epidemic, severe weather or volcano ash, the impact on the school is the same. However, this is so widespread, I can see that schools could close, the most likely being primary schools.&quot; Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: &quot;There are definitely schools where a significant number of teachers will be unable to make it into work so there will inevitably be closures. It is regrettable that it will potentially be expensive for schools if they have to engage supply staff, but I see no reason why teachers who are stranded abroad should not be paid as normal in these unforeseeable and entirely blameless circumstances&quot;. Teachers in Coventry have told the Nasuwt that their local authority is threatening to dock their pay if they do not turn up for work. Coventry City Council has denied this. A spokesman from the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) said: &quot;Schools have contingency plans in place and headteachers are best placed to decide how to cover for absent staff effectively and support pupils forced to miss classes in catching up quickly.", "tags": ["Schools", "Teaching", "Education", "Air transport", "Iceland", "Weather", "Travel", "UK news", "World news", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Flights", "Europe", "Volcanoes"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-19T10:15:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/19/volcanic-ash-stories-from-stranded", "sentences": ["Chinese organisers have offered extra language lessons to those who stay in the city, but the student is hoping to make the best of the enforced delay by visiting Shanghai."], "title": "Volcanic ash: stories from the stranded", "article": "\u2022 Rita Moussa, 30, a special needs teacher who lives in north-west London, was travelling around Macedonia with a friend. &quot;We had a flight on Saturday from Skopje to Budapest and from Budapest to London, but that got cancelled. We&apos;re now looking at a 24-plus-hour bus ride to Germany, where we&apos;ll probably be stuck as well. There&apos;s not much media coverage of the situation in the country we&apos;re in; you don&apos;t have as many options as you would in France or Germany. We&apos;re making it up as we go along, trying to get to a country where things are a bit more accessible. I had to text my headteacher to tell her that I wouldn&apos;t be back for school and she told me to let her know when I had more information. Apparently, there&apos;s quite a few of us having trouble getting back. My friend is a headteacher in another school, so she&apos;s got a lot of responsibilities. But at the end of the day, we can&apos;t do anything about it. The most difficult thing is that we don&apos;t have much news information. If we were in a different country, then we could probably get news about what&apos;s going on. We just don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on and it&apos;s very difficult to get anywhere. We&apos;ve just been trying to get information. In the meantime, we&apos;re shopping around, doing tourist sights and trying to pass the time. We&apos;re just trying to get on that bus tomorrow.&quot; \u2022 Ruth Corney, photographer, 44, from north London, was on holiday with her husband, Mark Bloom, 46, and their kids, Joe, 14, and Lilah, 9, in Barcelona: &quot;We were supposed to be getting the plane back on Saturday. But on Thursday night, my husband came upstairs and told me the news. We weren&apos;t sure what to, but we&apos;re lucky because we&apos;re staying in the same hotel as all the BA staff. We&apos;re going to get the coach to Paris tonight, so we&apos;ve got a 10-hour journey ahead of us. We can&apos;t get any further through the coach company, but we&apos;ve managed to get on a Eurostar tomorrow night. It&apos;s been a real pain; the coach is costing \u00a3235 and the Eurostar will be \u00a3720. The there&apos;s the extra for the hotel we&apos;re staying in \u2013 about \u00a3300 \u2013 so we&apos;re just dreading the bill. We&apos;ve been trying to go easy on the money and buying our food at the market. We&apos;ve amused ourselves by making cushions from things we bought at the market. We want to get back because Lilah is singing at the Albert Hall on Wednesday \u2013 it&apos;s a big thing with all the primary schools in our area. She&apos;s been dying to do it and they&apos;ve been working on it for months.&quot; \u2022 Nikita and Chris Ferdinand, who are both doctors from London, have been stranded in Dubai since Friday and told they could be there for another fortnight. The couple and their 22-month-old son, Ashton, were on their way back from a holiday in India and a visit to relatives in Sri Lanka. They got the first leg of their Emirates flight home in the hope that when flights re-start they will be closer to getting to London but so far they have not been able to get beyond Dubai. Chris&apos;s parents remain stranded in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The Ferdinands&apos; airline is refusing to help pay for food or accommodation and the young family is spending \u00a3100 a night to share a holiday apartment with distant relatives also stranded in Dubai, whom they found on Facebook. They are calling the airline every four hours as instructed and have been told the earliest they can fly home is 4 May \u2013 meaning they could face a bill of some \u00a32,000 just for board while they wait to get back. Their travel insurance company has indicated it may cover around \u00a3600 of that. &quot;There is a real shortage of places to stay. The hotel near the airport we had the first night was reluctant to take us as people who had just checked out there were coming straight back from the airport to check back in. The hotel said we couldn&apos;t stay on but we have found a little apartment. It is a \u00a320 taxi ride from the airport and supermarkets and we need milk and nappies for Ashton,&quot; said Nikita, a 29-year-old trainee GP. &quot;I know the airline is in a difficult situation but there is no continuity between anyone there. Friends from home text and say to make a holiday of it but we can&apos;t. We can&apos;t relax and we are constantly on the phone waiting to find out what is happening and making sure we are still on waiting lists. It&apos;s really hard for Ashton, he&apos;s so restless and is not sleeping well.&quot; She is worried about work building up at the clinics where she works and for Chris, a GP in south-east London. &quot;Chris&apos; practice are being understanding but he would have had a fully booked working week. They are covering with a locum but then the question arises of whether he will have to take unpaid leave.&quot; \u2022 Moira Hickson, a 21-year-old student from Norwich, is stuck in a Moscow hotel room after trying to return home after visiting her aunt in Thailand. She is in contact with her boyfriend, Chris Thurmott, via email and the odd phone call. &quot;She got to Moscow on Thursday from Bangkok,&quot; said Chris. &quot;It was meant to be a three-hour wait for the transfer, but they found out that outside Moscow, British airspace was closed. As a result, they don&apos;t have visas.&quot; Moira and 30 others, most of them British, are being kept in a hotel in Moscow amid tight security. &quot;There&apos;s someone stopping them going downstairs or leaving the hotel. There are security cameras on only one floor in the hotel \u2013 the one where they are \u2013 and there are security guards guarding them 24 hours a day. They&apos;ve been pushed from pillar to post into the hotel. No one in the party speaks Russian and no one at the hotel speaks English, so they don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. The British ambassador was allowed in [on Sunday]. The main problem is that they&apos;re not being allowed their luggage, which would allow them to have their toothbrushes and a change of clothes. Moira said that some of the people in the hotel have their medications in their luggage \u2013 because you&apos;re not allowed to take liquids in you hand luggage \u2013 and that they need it. They&apos;ve been given some deodorant, which made them smile because they can finally smell nice. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a very desirable position to be in. They&apos;re only allowed out \u2013 on to a balcony \u2013 for 15 minutes a day. I think Aeroflot didn&apos;t think it would last this long. It&apos;s just ridiculous, it really is. Someone had an asthma attack and the people at the hotel tried to give her medication without her mother&apos;s consent. But the medicine was out of date. When the mother saw that it had expired in 2009, she got upset and was physically restrained by a guard. Aeroflot have refused to sort out a train to try to get them out. They have offered flights to Rome and Nice, but after they get there, they&apos;re on their own. They&apos;re just getting people&apos;s hopes up. Moira sounded a bit weary, but they&apos;ve been trying to organise a quiz to keep their spirits up. People are just starting to crack.&quot; \u2022 Laura Shearer should be about to complete her degree in film studies and English literature at Queen&apos;s University in Belfast. But instead the 21-year-old is stuck in Beijing, worried she may not return in time to finish crucial assignments. &quot;I&apos;m in my final year and basically if I don&apos;t get home I won&apos;t graduate in June \u2013 I have deadlines for the start of May and exams from mid-May. That would mean the place I have on an MA programme would have to be deferred for a year,&quot; she said. Like her friends, she is anxious that even if she gets home soon she will be jetlagged and have lost precious revision time. Shearer travelled to Beijing on the three-week government-funded Study China programme and was due to return this weekend. But the earliest dates for rescheduled flights are in early May, and Shearer says she has been unable to get any information about when she can travel. &quot;British Airways turned me away when I went to the airport on Saturday \u2013 they told me to contact my travel agent at home,&quot; she said. Chinese organisers have offered extra language lessons to those who stay in the city, but the student is hoping to make the best of the enforced delay by visiting Shanghai. &quot;When we have got visas sorted out we are planning to travel \u2013 but that all takes money. After this I won&apos;t be able to [afford to] travel for a long, long time, so I might as well use my savings,&quot; she said. In the meantime, five of the female students are crammed into a room meant for two because they are running short of money. Even if she gets home soon, her studies could still be disrupted, she added. &quot;I&apos;ve contacted my lecturers \u2013 and some of them are stuck in Los Angeles.&quot;", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Transport", "Rail transport", "Road transport", "Air transport", "UK news", "Travel", "Flights", "Rail transport"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-19T17:16:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/20/arsene-wenger-arsenal-chelsea-wages", "sentences": ["Lapthorne&apos;s legacy The departure of Sir Richard Lapthorne from McLaren has clearly not disadvantaged the Formula One team from a sporting point of view, after Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton provided the constructor a Shanghai grand prix one-two on Sunday.", "Of course he has sought no credit for the one-two finish in Shanghai but the suggestion in his resignation statement that his &quot;work is done&quot; after precisely a year in post seemed odd."], "title": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's Chelsea wage remarks are a bit rich", "article": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s comments about the money spent on players&apos; wages at Chelsea on Sunday were a bit, er, rich. Although the Arsenal manager&apos;s record has been very strong despite the financial constraints imposed by the construction of the Emirates Stadium, he is now believed to command comfortably the third-biggest wage bill in the Premier League. According to analysis by the Arsenal Supporters Trust of the club&apos;s accounts released last November, the Gunners&apos; wage commitments have risen to around \u00a3120m. By contrast Chelsea&apos;s were swollen by \u00a312.6m in compensation payments to the two most recently departed managers, Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe Scolari. Strip those out and Chelsea&apos;s total is, according to their most recently available accounts, a very comparable \u00a3137m. Sure, Arsenal&apos;s is all self-generated income rather than owner subsidy. But to add some context to Carlo Ancelotti&apos;s competitive advantage over Wenger, Arsenal&apos;s wage bill exceeds the total annual 2007-08 revenues of all Premier League clubs except Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, according to figures compiled by Deloitte. Meanwhile it is believed Wenger&apos;s transfer budget this summer will be subsidised not by any shareholder contributions but through the success of the stadium redevelopment. As recently as last summer Alisher Usmanov&apos;s partner, Farhad Moshiri, was complaining the project could undermine Arsenal. But it is believed that by the time the transfer window opens all the club&apos;s debts associated with it will have been paid off, ensuring that the tens of millions Wenger has at his disposal can be spent on transfer fees and wages. Chiles starts a ripple The defection of Adrian Chiles, below, to ITV has set tongues wagging at his old employer. Many at the Beeb had suspected ITV would take advantage of the unpopular relocation of the sports department to make an offer to Gary Lineker \u2013 one that would guarantee he could stay in London. Lineker and the ITV head of sport, Niall Sloane, have been close friends since their shared time at Match of the Day. Instead, in a move ordered by the ITV&apos;s director of television, Peter Fincham, Chiles moves to take over a broad portfolio including fronting the channel&apos;s World Cup coverage and anchoring the revamped GMTV. Sloane has already had a strong influence on Chiles&apos;s career, having been responsible for the former business journalist&apos;s move into sports coverage at Football Focus, then Match of the Day 2. But the switch has rather upset the World Cup plans of Sloane, who had expected Steve Rider to present the coverage from South Africa. ITV says it is in talks to beef up Rider&apos;s presence elsewhere but now Auntie&apos;s gossips anticipate Rider will return to his alma mater to front the golf coverage and play a key role in broadcasting the 2012 Olympic Games. A charitable wage The Youth Sport Trust, a registered charity that raises about 90% of its income from public funds, is advertising for a \u00a370,000-a-year director of communications. The successful applicant would become the seventh YST employee on more than \u00a360,000 a year. But he or she should perhaps beware of cross-party plans to cull spending on NGOs and quangoes. Lapthorne&apos;s legacy The departure of Sir Richard Lapthorne from McLaren has clearly not disadvantaged the Formula One team from a sporting point of view, after Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton provided the constructor a Shanghai grand prix one-two on Sunday. Of course he has sought no credit for the one-two finish in Shanghai but the suggestion in his resignation statement that his &quot;work is done&quot; after precisely a year in post seemed odd. Lapthorne replaced the embattled Ron Dennis when the man who had micromanaged McLaren for decades stepped down from any sports involvement. During Dennis&apos;s time in charge a $100m fine over &quot;Spygate&quot; and a corrosive spat with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile through the Formula One Teams Association exposed the fissures in McLaren&apos;s relationship with the sport&apos;s authorities. But the team has breathed a collective sigh of relief at the period of relative serenity under the chairmanship of his friend \u2013 who despite the undeniable glamour of the role is understood to prefer gardening to motorsport \u2013 and there is confidence the problems of a turbulent past will not return.", "tags": ["Arsenal", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2009-10"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-19T23:21:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/apr/21/iceland-volcano-uk-flights-resume", "sentences": ["Hours after their flight took off from Shanghai last night, it was still being suggested they might land in Scotland, or Amsterdam, or Barcelona."], "title": "Iceland volcano - UK flights resume", "article": "     6.04pm:  That&apos;s it for today, just time for a bit of a round up: Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control agency, said 21,000 of the continent&apos;s 28,000 scheduled flights were going ahead Wednesday. Almost all restrictions in Europe have been lifted by air traffic controllers, however there remain some closures of airspace over parts of Britain, Ireland and France. Elsewhere today Giovanni Bisignani, head of the International Air Transport Association, called the economic fallout from the six-day travel shutdown &quot;devastating&quot; and urged European governments to examine ways to compensate airlines for lost revenues, as the US government did following the 11 September 2001 attacks. He said it would take three years for the industry to recover from the week of lost flying time. Airlines lost $400 million each day during the first three days of grounding, Bisignani told a news conference today.

We welcome the call for similar efforts across the rest of the travel sector. Separately, the companies have met with the Civil Aviation Authority and recognise their efforts in engaging with manufactures which has resulted in the new guidance issued yesterday, that has allowed air space to reopen.&quot;  And now they&apos;ve stopped criticising the government, transport secretary Andrew Adonis has recognised the &quot;great efforts&quot; made by travel companies. His statement:  &quot;I recognise the great efforts that tour operators are making to bring their customers home as quickly as possible and I want to see similar efforts made across the rest of the travel sector.&quot; &quot;Tour operators make a huge contribution to UK Plc. I have held productive discussions with the industry leaders today and will maintain a continuing dialogue over the coming hours and days.&quot;   5.40pm:  Severin Carrell has forwarded a statement from Highlands &amp; Islands Airports - which runs all Scottish airports north of Aberdeen and Glasgow - that serves as a reminder that the ash isn&apos;t completely gone yet.  &quot;HIA regrets to advise that all scheduled Loganair services from the current time until at least 13:00 hrs local time on Thursday, 22 April have now been cancelled. &quot;The continued presence of significant levels of volcanic ash in many parts of Scottish airspace \u2013 including &quot;no-fly&quot; zones ordered by the CAA and National Air Traffic Services which now cover Stornoway, Shetland and Orkney \u2013 and the forecast for tomorrow shows no material change for Loganair&apos;s operations.&quot;  &quot;This means all its islands services to the Inner Hebrides, Western Isles and northern Isles have been cancelled,&quot; says Severin.  5.24pm:  My colleague Andy Pietrasik emails:   EasyJet will today and tomorrow operate 15 special rescue flights to and from the UK to bring home passengers whose flights have been cancelled over the last week due to airspace closure. The airline has chartered additional aircraft over the next few days to collect passengers from Sharm El Sheikh, Madeira, Malta, Malaga and Alicante from its UK hubs. It says this will allow it to carry an additional 3,000 passengers who are stranded abroad. The flights are only for passengers who have previously had their booking cancelled. They should go to easyJet.com and log into the &quot;My easyJet&quot; section to transfer on to the new flights.   5.06pm:  Upbeat video/slideshow from fionahawthorne charting her family&apos;s journey to London from the south of Spain via &quot;hire car, coach, metro, train and ferry...&quot;  Set to the music of &apos;Red Plastic Bag&apos;.             .  4.38pm:       Sam Jones has been talking to people at Heathrow:  &quot;Mick Cutler&apos;s journey home may not have been quite such an odyssey, but the event that preceded it certainly was. Cutler, a 38-year-old NCO in the RAF, had just finished a 14-day, 1607-mile bike ride from San Diego in California to Galveston in Texas with five air force friends when the cloud put paid to their homeward plans. &quot; We should have been flying back on Saturday, but we got out in the early hours of Tuesday and we missed the open airspace last night and got diverted to Nice. Then we were put up overnight in Nice and looked after very well by BA. Being away for three weeks with a family waiting at home was tricky, then there was the uncertainty of not knowing when we would get here. We just had to make the best out of a bad situation really, but we were all anxious to get home as quickly as possible. British Airways picked up a lot of it. They were looking after us but there were the odd bits and pieces \u2013 like toiletries \u2013 that we had to buy, and obviously there was our washing and things like that. I probably spent about $150 and then about 100 Euros in Nice as well. I&apos;m looking forward to meeting up with the family. I&apos;ve got two young boys who kept asking when I was coming home. I&apos;m lucky that I have a very understanding wife. She&apos;s over the moon now.&quot; The scene upstairs in departures, under Terminal 5&apos;s massive steel and glass roof, was a little different. Huge electronic screens advising people to check their flights online did not seem to have stopped hundreds of travellers from turning up and trying their luck. Others had no choice. Conrad Seidel, a 23-year-old student from Stuttgart, was passing the time by playing slaps with his new friend Anna Schwalm, 20, from Frankfurt, who he had met while they were stranded in Vancouver. Although they were on the first flight back into Heathrow last night, which touched down at ten to 10, the young Germans were still a little way from home. &quot;We were always on standby in Vancouver - for five nights,&quot; said Conrad. &quot;We got here on the first flight \u2013 at 10 o&apos;clock last night. I should have been at university a week ago; I thought I&apos;d get there last week, but I got stuck. We slept here last night.[British Airways] gave us blankets and I wrote all my professors and they said it was fine. We&apos;re exhausted. I really want to emphasise that BA did a great job. It wasn&apos;t their fault \u2013 it wasn&apos;t a strike or anything. They kept us up to date and gave us a hotel and food vouchers and came to out hotel to tell us what was happening. British Airways honestly did a really, really good job. I would definitely go with them again. Other airlines just said: &apos;Ring this number.&apos;&quot;   4.22pm:  My new Twitter friend lefran, stuck in Japan, has some advice for anyone trying to get hold of KLM:      @lefran @adamgabbatt nothing worked for me until i contacted KLM on twitter, i&apos;d suggest everyone flying with KLM to get in touch with them on twitter because it took me 2 hours to get hold of them on the phone for them to say they wouldnt help, 10 minutes on twitter!  4.12pm:  Just been on the phone to the Guardian&apos;s Sam Jones, who&apos;s been at Heathrow Terminal 5 today.  &quot;The Sun has a couple of &apos;page 3 stunners&apos; welcoming people back into the country and giving them a little carrier bag with a copy of the Sun in.  This afternoon I met people who got the first flight in from Vancouver at 9.50pm last night, but were still having to rough it in the airport until they could catch their next flight out.  It doesn&apos;t feel very busy at all in arrivals, photographers and members of the press aside, but it&apos;s a bit busier upstairs in departures. But overall it&apos;s very calm, with not many people about.&quot;   4.01pm:  James Meikle has forwarded me a handy FAQ by Stewart John, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and past President of the Royal Aeronautical Society. &quot;The problem is like riding a motorbike with your mouth open and seeing how many flies you catch.&quot; \u2022 How do we know how much ash an engine can cope with? &quot;No-one knows the answer to this. The problem is like riding a motorbike with your mouth open and seeing how many flies you catch. Some ash will go straight through the engine without having any effect whilst some will get caught up. The speed, density of ash cloud, size of ash particles, temperature and wind all have an impact \u2013 in short there are just too many variables and it&apos;s extremely difficult!&quot; \u2022 Does ash affect the fuel efficiency of an engine? &quot;Ash only affects fuel efficiency if it starts clogging up the airways. The engine would fail before fuel efficiency became a real problem.&quot; \u2022 What has been learned from the test flights? &quot;Everything! They are what have shown that the flights are safe. They are the ultimate practical test and if there can be any criticism of this it&apos;s that there weren&apos;t test flights being done under controlled conditions right from the moment this crisis started.&quot; \u2022 On what evidence are the new CAA rules based? &quot;They&apos;re based on the results of the test flights. It&apos;s essentially a case of suck it and see.&quot; \u2022 What ash-damage checks will airlines have to make? &quot;Ash-damage will be checked extremely carefully. From the outside they will look at the fuel, air and oil filters. As well as this they will use borescopes to assess any internal damage to the engine. They have very sophisticated methods for doing this now and engines are designed with holes for borescopes for use in routine inspections. All these tests are objective tests that can be tested factually rather than subjective ones, so it&apos;s extremely rigorous.&quot; \u2022 Why can we fly now when days ago the advice said &apos;no tolerance for any ash whatsoever&apos;? &quot;The rules that said don&apos;t fly through ash were put in place a long time ago and it&apos;s basically been a case of updating them. You&apos;ve got to remember that thirty years ago no-one would have considered flying a twin engine across the Atlantic \u2013 you&apos;d have had to have four engines. New rules were made as part of EROPS (Extended range over water Operations) and at first twin-engine aircraft were never allowed to be more than 60 minutes from land, then 90 and eventually 240. Recently I was in a twin-engine plane that made the 16 hour flight to Hong Kong. Even 10 years ago we&apos;d never have done this. We&apos;d never faced this ash scenario before and it&apos;s been a case of learning to update \u2013 rules change as we get more confident and learn more about what we can do. It&apos;s just like a baby learning to walk. You move with the times as you gain confidence.&quot;  3.51pm:       Severin Carrell has an update on the situation in Scotland:  Aberdeen airport is still &quot;very much open and operational&quot; despite a new flying ban now affecting northern Scotland and the North Sea, a BAA spokeswoman has said.Three airports, on Orkney, Shetland and at Wick in Caithness, have been closed since 1pm after national air traffic control warned of a new ash cloud. The same plume led North Sea helicopter operators to suddenly ground all their oil and gas platform flights from Aberdeen after two Bond helicopters found ash coating their windscreens.But Sarah Campbell, a BAA spokeswoman at Aberdeen, said that only the far north of Scotland was affected; helicopter flights had now started again to the east and south-east. The only passenger flights grounded were to Lerwick, Kirkwall and Wick.&quot;Aberdeen airport is still very much open and operational. This afternoon a couple of routes have been affected by conditions to the north so there have been some cancellations but the majority of our routes are normal just now,&quot; she said.   3.39pm:  The Board of Airline Representatives in the UK, which represents over 90 airlines, has called on the UK government to tackle the EU Commission over unfair EU Regulations against member state airlines. Mike Carrivick, BAR UK chief executive, said today that regulation that forced airlines to provide for passengers during the disruption should not have been applicable in this case. He said the regulation was never meant to &quot;wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time&quot;. Full statement:  &quot;The eagerness of the EU and the UK government to publicly state that airlines have a responsibility under EU Regulation EU261/2004, to accommodate and feed passengers booked on flights cancelled by the volcanic disruptions, is a misuse of the regulation. &quot;Regulation EU261/2004 was intended to apply when airlines had individual delays or cancelled flights. It was never intended to apply to wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time. It is also relevant that airlines cannot immediately resume normal services from the moment that the airspace restrictions are lifted. This Regulation, when used in this way, is draconian, disproportionate and often impractical. &quot;In this particular situation, passengers have in all probability been delayed a lot longer than they might have been and airlines have lost millions every day as a result.&quot;   3.31pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Thomas Cook has confirmed that one of a rescue flight to Crete had to return to Manchester airport today after a technical fault. It insisted that the reason for the return was &apos;purely a precaution&apos; and had nothing to do with ash, but the pilot remarked on the &apos;intense&apos; smell of volcanic ash before the flight was sent back.  &apos;For information we got the smell of the ash from about 16,000ft in the climb,&apos; the pilot said in a recording spotted by Airline Industry Review.  A Thomas Cook woman said: &apos;Safety is of paramount importance to us so when the Thomas Cook Airlines TCX 952P developed a minor technical fault with its air conditioning, we took the decision to return the aircraft to Manchester as a precautionary measure. The development of the fault categorically had nothing to do with volcanic ash and whilst there were no customers on board, at no point were our crew or the aircraft in any danger. The plane will be back in service later today and will join the many Thomas Cook Airlines rescue flights currently returning stranded passengers to the UK.&apos;&quot;  3.27pm:       Stankle is unimpressed with Monarch:   @kimmiedunja  I dread to think what would have happened were she with Ryanair/easyjet I&apos;ll tell you; a friend of mine had her return journey to portugal booked through Monarch. When flights were first cancelled, monarch&apos;s response was &quot;you&apos;re on your own love - not our problem&quot;. Now flights have restarted - they kindly offered to fly her and her daughter back from portugal for \u00a31k.   3.21pm:  My colleague James Meikle has been given the latest figures on Heathrow&apos;s operations today.  Normally the airport would have 657 departures today, but the plan at the moment is for 422. It would normally have 655 arrivals, but the plan at the moment is for 343.   3.07pm:       kimmiedunja comments on the TUI/Thomas Cook criticism of the government (see 2.20pm):  Have to say I&apos;m with the TUI bosses here. Mum and her husband have been stuck in Cyprus with Thomson and although they haven&apos;t had much information from the tour operator they have been extremely well looked after: staying at the same (posh) hotel rather than being downgraded to save Thomson money, moved from half to full board, and increased entertainments etc to keep the stranded happy. My maternal grandmother was rushed to hospital whilst mum was away, and she has been duly anxious - so Thomson have ensured she&apos;s on the first flight back, and should land at Manchester in a couple of hours. I dread to think what would have happened were she with Ryanair/easyjet.   2.58pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Here&apos;s a great idea for anyone who&apos;s bored waiting for a plane: Andrew Losowsky, currently stranded in Dublin, is trying to put together a magazine written by and for &quot;fellow strandees&quot;. Working titles include Grounded, SkyFail and Someday We&apos;ll Fly Away.  Blogging from the airport he writes: &quot;If all goes well, the results will be published, probably via MagCloud and/or the Newspaper Club, and any proceeds sent to a charity that helps mitigate the effects of climate change on human populations. After all, we have to repent somehow. Who&apos;s in?&quot; Strandees are invited to answer four questions.&quot;  2.53pm:  jmbriggs, first name John, has been keeping a video diary of his volcano-affected journey from Riga to London on YouTube. Here&apos;s an entry from the room of his ferry from Lithuania to Germany. John suspects his travel companions have been accusing him of sounding like a warthog, which seems a little unfair.             Elsewhere the Guardian has a gallery of images taken as flights resumed today.  2.39pm:  Guardian travel editor, Andy Pietrasik, emails:  Iceland Express has started to resume flights between Reykjavik and London. Iceland Express was the first airline to leave London Gatwick at 01:35 on 21 April 2010. The flight carried 62 passengers to Keflavik Airport, Reykjavik, onboard a Boeing 757-200.   2.36pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Gordon Brown appeared to hint that some night flights, or a relaxation of flight time rules, might be possible to get stranded passengers back. &apos;Now it looks as if we can get lots of people back, and I think you&apos;ll find our airports are open longer to make that possible,&apos; the PM said at an election meeting in Cardiff recorded by ITN. He was also evasive about those illusive coaches in Spain. &apos;There are coaches for people in Spain if they need it, but most people will want to come back via the airline or the charter that they have already booked,&apos; he said.&quot;             .  2.33pm:  National Express is providing nearly 3000 coach seats to/from Dover and London today, a press release has just announced. &quot;A new 24-hour coach operation has been put in place tonight from Dover to help those arriving from Calais throughout the night to get home. 20 different departure times will depart to London where onward UK connections can be made.&quot; Here&apos;s the timetable for services from Dover to London: 0455, 0525, 0625, 0725, 0835, 0930, 1015, 1115, 1215, 1315, 1415, 1515, 1615, 1715, 1825, 2010, 2200, 0000, 0200, 0330 For people aged 16-59 it&apos;s \u00a313.90, a spokeswoman has just told me. Under 16s, people 60 and over and disabled can travel for \u00a36.95. The coach brings you in to London Victoria, where &quot;connections to 1000 UK destinations can be made&quot;.  2.20pm:  Is the government letting Ryanair and easyJet get away with abandoning passengers? That&apos;s what TUI Travel and Thomas Cook appear to be suggesting, writes Matthew Weaver:     Matthew Weaver    &quot;The chief executive of TUI travel, which owns Thomson and First Choice, has described the government&apos;s response to the volcanic ash crisis as a &quot;shambles&quot; in a joint statement with Thomas Cook this afternoon. &quot;It became apparent that the government is condoning a two tier system between the way low cost airlines and airlines of holiday companies operate,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Some low cost airlines stated that their focus would be to commence normal flying schedules as soon as possible and made it clear that it was the government&apos;s responsibility to repatriate their customers. We believe this is a flawed and inequitable approach that is to the disadvantage of consumers.&quot; &quot;It is clear that the Government has put no pressure on low cost airlines to implement their own equivalent repatriation plans,&quot; the statement added. In the statement the two companies contrasted the conduct of low cost airlines with the efforts they have made to bring passengers home. &quot;TUI Travel and Thomas Cook immediately activated their crisis plans when the full implications of the volcano eruption became clear last Wednesday 14 April. Due to airspace being closed, over the weekend TUI Travel repatriated customers via coaches, ferries and owned cruise ships. First Choice and Thomson are now repatriating 21,000 customers today and 32,000 tomorrow with the remainder of its customers being repatriated by Friday.&quot; Peter Long, TUI travel chief executive said: &quot;The Government&apos;s response to the crisis has been a shambles. It is clear that they underestimated the severity of the consequences of the decision for a blanket closure of the airspace for such a protracted period of time.  &quot;This has been compounded by the fact that they have neither put in place a viable repatriation plan or ensured that the industry behaves in a consistent and responsible manner.&quot;  2.05pm:       Severin Carrell with the latest on the North Sea airspace:  North Sea helicopters have been grounded and flights from Aberdeen banned again after the ash plume shifted again, closing air space north east of Peterhead in north east Scotland. The North Sea helicopter operator Bond said two of its aircraft encountered ash in rain clouds 70 miles offshore: they landed to find a coating on ash on their windscreens, but there were no deposits in their engines. &quot;A no fly area has been imposed again,&quot; a Bond spokesman said. The new closure will increase pressure on the oil and gas industry&apos;s system of rotating workers on and off their platforms: for the last five days, many flights have been replaced by slower and more demanding boat trips to the rigs.   2.00pm:  Matt Weaver has spotted that the Foreign Office is using Twitter to offer guidance to Liverpool fans traveling to Madrid for the game.      @ukinspain #Liverpool_Atletico: We&apos;ll be tweeting advice for fans tomorrow so follow us on your mobile (check your operator&apos;s charges).  1.54pm:       Giles Tremlett, our Madrid correspondent at Barajas airport emails:  Foreign office minister Chris Bryant was one of the first members of the government to start flying today, reaching Madrid this morning to study the &quot;hub&quot; operation set up for stranded Britons in the Spanish capital.  Between ten and twenty coaches will leave from Madrid&apos;s Barajas airport Terminal 4 for Channel ports during the day.  &quot;I really don&apos;t want to pretend that we can do everything because we can&apos;t,&quot; Bryant told the BBC. &quot;The main thrust now has to be by the airlines and tour operators.&quot; The embassy has a desk set up in the departures hall where people are joining the queue to get on the buses. Passengers are a mix of those who have been stuck in Madrid for days and others arriving on intercontinental flights.  Two coaches have left already, with two to three drivers on each coach to go straight through to Calais. Free bottles of water, but no toilets on some of them. The drivers say it will take them around 17 hours to Calais.   1.50pm:  Severin Carrell emails to confirm North Sea helicopter flights have been grounded \u2013 showing the plume is heading south again, potentially affecting more services.  We&apos;ll keep you posted.  1.39pm:       Tommyben: &quot;If you have a long wait for a flight it might still be worth going by land and water as most trains and ferries have capacity. Have a look at www.flightlesstravel.com for some alternative travel routes.&quot; The FlightlessTravel website is worth looking at. They have tips on travelling by cargo ship, which sound great fun.  1.30pm:  Rail lines serving London&apos;s airports will stay open around the clock tonight to help get stranded air passengers home, Network Rail has announced. Weekend engineering work on the Anglo-Scottish routes - the east and west coast main lines - has also been cancelled to enable more direct services to run. Robin Gisby, from Network Rail, said: &quot;Network Rail and the train operators are doing all we can to help get people home following the unprecedented air travel chaos. The main lines to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports will be opened round the clock tonight in an effort to speed people on their way.&quot; Paddington, Liverpool Street, Victoria and Gatwick - some of the UK&apos;s biggest and busiest stations - will also stay open around the clock tonight. So does this mean the tube will also be running, for the thrifts (like myself) who prefer to endure the hour-long Piccadilly? &quot;No,&quot; a spokesman for Transport for London has just told me. &quot;That&apos;s following consultation with the department for transport, and with other services like the Heathrow express, Gatwick express, etc, to understand what the demand is likely to be,&quot; he said. &quot;The tube runs up until midnight, and we did have plans in place to run the Piccadilly line into west London should that be necessary, but it does not appear, according to the Department for Transport, that there will be large numbers of people arriving overnight.&quot;  &quot;We do have an extensive night bus operation in London that will continue to operate, and we continue to monitor the situation. If the DfT ask us to run the service we will be able to do so.&quot;  1.18pm:      Terror as plane hits ash cloud [28 years ago]    How&apos;s this for responsible reporting? Copies of today&apos;s Daily Star have been removed from airport newsagent shelves over fears that its splash, headlined &quot;Terror as plane hits ash cloud&quot; with an image of a 747 with engines ablaze, could cause panic among travellers. Behind the headline is a picture of a Boeing 747, engines blazing. A picture which was taken from a TV reconstruction of an incident 28 years ago in which BA Flight 009&apos;s engines were knocked out by a volcanic ash cloud. Full story from John Plunkett.  1.12pm:  Good afternoon all, Adam Gabbatt taking over from Matt, who&apos;s gone for some soup. Right on cue, Severin Carrell calls back to elaborate on the airspace closures in north and west Scotland.  Airspace above the North Sea could also be closed to low level flights due to the volcanic ash, potentially affect the oil and gas industry.        12.54pm: Dan Milmo writes:  &quot;The head of the UK air safety body has denied that pressure from ministers and airlines contributed to the surprise lifting of a flight ban last night. Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, said it was &quot;absolutely 100% untrue&quot; that the independent regulator had been leant on.  In an interview with the Guardian he said the transport secretary, Lord Adonis, and airline executives had not forced the CAA into a hasty re-writing of long-standing guidelines on flying through volcanic ash. &quot;Lord Adonis has been fantastic because he is an intellectual and not an elected politician. He has understood the evidence, the data, and has been very supportive. He has never once put pressure us and likewise the airlines, who were anxious to get flying again but knew that we needed to have a safe method of working.&quot;  Asked if passengers should have any concerns about a new safety regime that permits planes to fly through low density ash clouds generated by Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano, he added: &quot;I would happily fly myself. We have only taken this view after very detailed work by aircraft and engine manufacturers, in-flight testing and intensive investigations. All that data is saying that in low contamination areas it is very safe to fly.&quot; Planes are now taking off and landing at UK airports under a new carve-up of European Union airspace that divides the continent into three zones: a no-fly area; a safe flight region; and areas where flying is permitted despite the presence of ash.  Following intense discussions with engine and aircraft makers, British airspace that was unsafe under the old regime 24 hours ago was redesignated as acceptable for passenger flights. Haines admitted that it took a &quot;burning platform&quot; to focus the industry on an issue - flying through volcanic ash - that had not been examined in great detail previously by an industry whose overriding safety obsession in recent years has been terrorism.  &quot;It depends on how much priority people give to these issues. Some ICAO [the global aviation safety body] working groups go on for five years. Who would have thought that volcanic ash would have been one of their priorities?&quot;        12.44pm: There was a time yesterday when the only flights you could get in the UK were to the Scottish islands, today they are the only place you can&apos;t fly to and from. Could a new flights ban over the Scotland islands being heading south? asks our Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell:  The unpredictability of the Icelandic ash plume has just been underlined with the announcement that airspace over Orkney and Shetland has been shut down with immediate effect, leading to further delays and disruption for travellers and the oil industry. Highlands and Islands Airports, which operates nearly all regional and islands airports in the north and west of Scotland, has just released the following statement: &quot;Despite the widely publicised re-opening of UK airspace last night, National Air Traffic Services have issued directions in the last hour which indicate that the forecast concentrations of volcanic ash in the area around Orkney and Shetland are now expected to exceed safe operating limits between 13:00 and 19:00 today, Wednesday 21 April.&quot; So 15 flights linking Edinburgh and Aberdeen with Shetland and Orkneyscheduled for today have been abruptly cancelled.  Loganair, the main islands operator, is now offering passengers free tickets forrebookings. This closure raises the possibility of the flights ban being reimposed further south.   12.36pm: Airline acitivity across Europe, as tracked by flightradar24.com, is looking a lot busier than it has done over the last few days.      Screengrab from flightsradar24.com     12.06pm: More on the Madrid &quot;hub&quot; fiasco. The Foreign Office has just put out this statement:   &quot;Airlines have confirmed that due to flight restrictions being lifted from 2200 on 20 April, they will not now be diverting planes to a Madrid &quot;hub&quot;, but where possible flying direct to UK destinations. If you were planning to fly to the Madrid &quot;hub&quot; for onward transfer to the UK, you should now contact your airline for the latest advice about available direct flights. British Embassy staff are currently on the ground at the airport, helping passengers to find the best way back to the UK. The team&apos;s immediate priority is working with airlines and tour operators to get people on the first available flights to the UK. The Embassy team will be reinforced by more staff later today. Due to the earlier contingency planning, we have provision in place to allow us access to up to 150 coaches in and around Madrid. We are urgently assessing with the travel industry and our consular teams on the ground in Madrid how best to use this capability to assist British Nationals.&quot;   12.02pm: The airline industry is calling for a financial bailout and it appears to be trying to wriggle out of its compensation obligations to passengers.  &quot;This crisis is an act of god \u2013 completely beyond the control of airlines. Insurers certainly see it this way. But Europe&apos;s passenger rights regulations take no consideration of this. These regulations provide no relief for extraordinary situations and still hold airlines responsible to pay for hotels, meals and telephones,&quot; said Giovanni Bisignani, the director general of the International Air Transport Association.       11.43am: Michael Ellis, from Tettenhall in the West Midlands is stuck in Thailand, furious with the airline EVA, and looking for help. He emails:  My partner and I are stranded in Thailand. Today we were due to fly on the 11.50am EVA flight BR67. It was cancelled, but we were never called to try and standby for a later flight. In fact EVA have been nothing but unhelpful and their London team incredibly rude. We haven&apos;t yet been contacted concerning our return flight nor can we getthrough to reservations. We are now in Bangkok whilst political tensions increase in the city. Today we got caught up in a rally in Siam. We&apos;ve decided to move to Koh Chang, only an hour&apos;s flight from Bangkok, tobe safe and sound. EVA aren&apos;t helping with costs, but thankfully my insurance company are. We&apos;ve been told by other travellers that the soonest availability for a flight home is early May! I have already missed a flight on Friday to my best friend&apos;s wedding in Las Vegas, where I was supposed to be giving her away. Gutted and disappointed doesn&apos;t even cut it. I&apos;m stranded and need to get home. Please help?   11.31am: Five days of quiet skies has inspired some nice poetry and prose. Rural campaigners think we should be allowed to enjoy a world without planes every year. The experience of the last week has prompted the Campaign to Protect Rural England to call for a &apos;National Quiet Day&apos; . Graeme Willis, senior rural policy campaigner, explains:   &quot;This disaster has revealed to many what they&apos;ve been missing: overnight the skies were stripped of the sight and sound of aeroplanes, and without the rumble and drone of aircraft people are reporting they can hear the simple sounds of the countryside once more. &quot;Perhaps the time is right to consider a &apos;National Quiet Day&apos; to remind us all -for one day at least - of what we are all losing in our rush to be somewhere else. A planned approach to making all of our lives a little quieter and more tranquil could deliver some of the benefits of the last few days without the difficulties endured by so many people.&quot;   11.25am: &quot;Heathrow is starting to look like Heathrow again,&quot; according to Sam Jones at the airport with lots of hopeful passengers hoping to leave the UK.  11.16am: Guardian Daily presenter Jon Dennis was supposed to fly back from Barcelona on Friday. The ash cloud forced him and his young family to stay in a &quot;Swindon-by-Sea&quot; while they wondered how they&apos;d get back (as we heard on Monday 11.07am). Luckily they have just checked in for a return flight home. Jon describes his relief and the sense of solidarity among stranded Brits in Spain.  10.38am: The departure board at Heathrow still shows a rash of cancellations, according to the airline website Flightstats.      Screengrab from flightstats.co.uk          10.25am: Meanwhile, the Eyjafjallajokull volcano is still erupting, but is now producing less ash but more toxic gas, according to our science correspondent, Ian Sample. He writes:  The volcano is stable but remains active this morning, says Iceland&apos;s Civil Protection and Emergency Management Centre. The amount of ash being produced has fallen steadily over the past few days, but the plume is becoming more toxic due to higher levels of fluorine. The quantity of ash in the plume has dropped because the crater has become isolated from surrounding glacier ice. Most of the ash is produced when hot magma wells up and meets this ice and water.    10.19am: EasyJet says it plans to operate 900 flights (86% of its network) today. But it warns &quot;it will take several days to resume normal operations&quot;.      Adam Gabbatt     10.16am:  &quot;I&apos;ve just spoken with a press officer at BA. She said their longhaul flights are running as per BA&apos;s normal timetable this morning. So far both flights scheduled to take off \u2013 destined for New York and Tel Aviv \u2013 have done so. There could be some delays, she said, but all services should run. Short haul services will not run until 1pm today, however.  &quot;There&apos;s a lot of cabin crew and aircraft out of position,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to reposition the crews and the aircraft before resuming flights. Customers are still advised to check BA&apos;s website before flying, as there could be time changes and delays.&quot; She did say, however, that all short-haul services should be running after that time. In terms of BA flights in to the UK: again, short-haul services will only be operating from 1pm owing to repositioning, and services could be delayed. Long-haul flights will not be running normally inbound \u2013 because of diversions there will be delays \u2013 but should return to a normal service tomorrow. The latest information on flights will be posted on BA&apos;s website.&quot;  10.15am: Adam posts this Twitter exchange: @lefran @adamgabbatt I&apos;m stuck in Japan for another 9 days, no news on hotel or food budget or anything....impossible to get hold of call centers! @adamgabbatt @lefran ouch. Where are you staying for the next 9 days? @lefran @adamgabbatt my parents have had to snd me funds to check into a hostel. I now have little money left for food. Insrnce won&apos;t help me either       10.05am: Scores of Ryanair flights are still cancelled for tomorrow, including Helen Pidd&apos;s return from Berlin. Before heading for the railway station she emailed this:   My rearranged flight back from Berlin has been cancelled once again. I have thrown in the towel after five days waiting and I&apos;m going to get the train. Our environment colleagues will be glad to hear.        9.59am: What about those all those coaches in Madrid? Giles Tremlett, our correspondent in the city emails this:  I don&apos;t know what will happen to the &quot;Madrid hub&quot; idea for getting people stuck on other continents home via a long-distance coach service from Madrid airport. My guess is that, if it is not wound down, it will be used to try to help those stuck in Madrid and Spain already. There are plenty of them around. Online booking shops show flights available for today at \u20ac500 to \u20ac2,100 a shot but I am not sure I trust them. The first Iberia flight to London with free seats (\u20ac839) is, according to the company&apos;s own website, on Saturday. The first easyJet to London is on the 28 April. Yesterday the embassy desks at Terminal 1 and 4 were taking down mobile phone numbers of those stranded so that they could be called up when, and if, coaches became available. The first five coaches left last night with the ambassador, Giles Paxman, telling me this was &quot;just the start&quot; and that further resources would arrive today.       Adam Gabbatt     9.51am: &quot;Here&apos;s a breakdown of the financial impact of the volcano on various airlines. This is what some of the main carriers were losing at the peak of the disruption:  BA: \u00a315m-20m per day Easyjet: \u00a35m per day AirFrance/KLM: \u00a330.5m per day Emirates: \u00a36.5m per day Qantas: \u00a3900,000 per day TUI Travel (Owns Thompson and First Choice): \u00a36m per day Ryanair: \u00a35.2m European airports were losing around \u00a335m each day during the worst of the crisis. BAA, which owns Heathrow, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Southampton, was losing \u00a35m-6m each day.&quot;  9.42am: It&apos;s remarkable that flights have resumed so quickly, says our transport correspondent, Dan Milmo. Aviation restrictions usually take years to draw up. &quot;Given that the solution we have found is flying through clouds of ash, I think the government was understandbly a little bit weary of pushing Nats and the CAA into letting aircraft take off again after a blanket ban was put in place,&quot; he says.  9.18am: The crisis has cost the airline industry $1.7bn, making it worse than 9/11 in economic terms, according to the International Air Transport Association. It is also calling for restrictions on night flights to be lifted to help airlines return to normality.  Announcing the estimate IATA&apos;s director general Giovanni Bisignani said: &quot;At the worst, the crisis impacted 29% of global aviation and affected 1.2 million passengers a day. The scale of the crisis eclipsed 9/11 when US airspace was closed for three days.&quot; &quot;As we are counting the costs of the crisis, we must also look for ways to mitigate the impact. Some of our airport partners are setting industry best practice. London Heathrow and Dubai are waiving parking fees and not charging for repositioning flights. Others airports must follow,&quot; said Bisignani.  8.56am:       Maev Kennedy&apos;s teenage son Samuel has made it back it from a school trip to China.  The 40 year-10- and 11 geography students from Orleans Park, and four teachers, who have been stranded in five star luxury in China, arrived back into Heathrow at 3.32am, to cheers from the parents and a furtive dab of teary eyes from their school head, Jo Longhurst.  Hours after their flight took off from Shanghai last night, it was still being suggested they might land in Scotland, or Amsterdam, or Barcelona. Samuel - who described the flight, &quot;I had dinner, and then I had another dinner, and then I think I had another dinner&quot; - is fast asleep in his own bed.  Jo Longhurst is wide awake, wrestling with the nightmare scheduling for her 1,000 pupil comprehensive - high spirited respondents to yesterday&apos;s news blog please note, not posh private - school: she still has 12 teachers astray in the world, including the head of maths who is in Tibet, and who was warned yesterday she may not be able to fly back until May 6.   8.45am: In Thailand there&apos;s been a massive scramble to get on the first flights back to the UK. Ben Doherty, our man in Bangkok, writes:   I&apos;ve just got back from Bangkok Airport where the first London-bound plane has left. It was EVA Air flight. There absolute chaos trying to get onto it, authorities basically rang everybody who had had a flightcancelled (with EVA) in the last six days and said get to the airport.  We have a flight leaving today. Everyone rushed madly and it was first-in, first-served. Some people, who had only been delayed a day got on, while others who were on the original plane turned back last Thursday, are still stuck in Bangkok. I talked to a young couple whose plane was the last one cancelled into London. They missed the cut-off by a couple of hours. They are now at the back of the queue waiting to get home.  If you are having trouble getting home please get in touch or leave a comment below. You can email me at matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk or reach me on Twitter at @matthew_weaver  8.40am:The LibDems have also attacked the Tories for trying to politicise the travel chaos. Norman Baker, the party&apos;s transport spokesman, said: &quot;It&apos;s pretty reprehensible for the Conservatives to be almost gleeful about the chaos that there has been. The government is responsible for many things in this country but a volcano going off in Iceland is not one of them.&quot;  8.19am: The transport secretary, Lord Adonis, insisted that safety regulators have acted in an &quot;appropriate and and proper way throughout&quot;.  Speaking to the BBC&apos;s Today programme he denied that the government had put pressure on safety officials to change the rules. &quot;I believe that they [safety officials] have done their duty properly, and I would not have wished to place any pressure on them to have acted faster, than was compatible with the safe passage of planes,&quot; Lord Adonis said. On the delay in lifting the ban, he said it was right to wait for the results of observational data and the views of aircraft manufacturers. He said hew &quot;irritated&quot; by Conservative criticism of the government&apos;s handling of the crisis, and accused the Tories of &quot;playing party politics&quot; over the issue.  8am: Airlines have started the huge logistical operation of trying to return their flights schedule to normal after six days of restrictions were suddenly lifted last night. The first passengers arriving at Heathrow have described their relief at returning to the UK, but stranded passengers and those with bookings have been warned that the phased resumption of flights could takes days and even weeks.  There are lots of questions to answer and issues to be resolved including:\u2022 Were the volcanic ash restricitions necessary?\u2022 Is it safe to resume flights? \u2022 Did the airline bosses bully the officials into lifting the ban?\u2022 How long will it take to get stranded passengers home? \u2022 What happened to all those passengers who were told to head for Calais? \u2022 With planes out of position and restriction still in place, how long will it take for air traffic to return to normality?\u2022 How damaging has the crisising been to the airline industry?\u2022 Did the government do enough to help stranded passengers? \u2022 And how will we remember the days of quiet skies? As the recriminations begin the advice to passengers is to check with their airlines about flights.", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Air transport", "British Airways", "Travel", "UK news", "Iceland", "Airline industry", "Flights", "Europe", "Volcanoes"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-21T07:10:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/apr/21/labour-party-architecture", "sentences": ["Everywhere in Britain was to become a &quot;world-class place&quot; \u2013 somewhere, presumably, along the lines of Birmingham&apos;s revamped Bull Ring or Las Vegas, Shanghai&apos;s Pudong district, or Sodom and Gomorrah."], "title": "What has Labour done for architecture?", "article": "Christopher Wren was a great architect. His performance as an MP, in the 1680s and 1690s, however, was lamentable, a crumbling shack compared to the uplifting acropolis of his architecture. Ever since, politics and architecture have been awkward bedfellows. Politicians want bombast one moment \u2013 the Palace of Westminster, pre-fab tower blocks, the Greenwich Dome \u2013 and banality the next, especially when the financial going gets tough. Picture pretty much any building funded by a private finance initiative (PFI) over the past decade: bandage-thin new hospitals, tinny new schools. One thing we can be sure of as we jostle towards a general election is that none of the major political parties has a handle on architecture or planning. Quite simply, there are too many interest groups involved. On the one hand, there are private developers and party-funding big businesses; on the other, a tangled web of quangos, rival government departments, snake-oil design consultants and local councils. Planning in Britain has been treated as the merest of trades, while architects \u2013 even as they have become more businesslike \u2013 have seen their status drop, as so much building is now led by the construction industry. If I were to cast my vote solely on the basis of architectural and planning manifestos, no party would win it. The shocking state of our woeful and cynical new housing alone would stay my hand, while the wilful privatisation of our public realm would keep both hands firmly in my\u00a0pockets. New Labour bounded into office in 1997, committed to doing something about architecture and cities. After 13 long years of government-sponsored industrial decline, many of these, especially north of the Trent, look as if they have been through a war. Perhaps they have: Britain&apos;s interminable class war. Many a bold word was written in favour of &quot;urban regeneration&quot;, notably Towards an Urban Renaissance, an optimistic government report championed by the architect Richard Rogers. I\u00a0watched, however, in bemusement, then incredulity, as New Labour&apos;s Cool Britannia vision transformed too many historic city centres into gormless &quot;regen&quot; retail theme parks, as ill-suited to Birmingham or Liverpool as to Beijing and\u00a0Mumbai. Yes, new museums by big-name architects opened, and many historic buildings were renovated. Most of these, though, were beneficiaries of the Lottery launched during the &quot;It could be you!&quot; years of John Major&apos;s Tory government. Funds for such projects have dried up, leaving city centres prey to corporate developers, while the government and its quangos blather on about how New Jerusalem is just around the corner. In a mind-numbing report, World Class Places, published last May under the signatures and beaming faces of Hazel Blears (since resigned) and Andy Burnham (moved on), we were told the government &quot;is committed to improving the places where we live, whether these be villages or large cities&quot;. Everywhere in Britain was to become a &quot;world-class place&quot; \u2013 somewhere, presumably, along the lines of Birmingham&apos;s revamped Bull Ring or Las Vegas, Shanghai&apos;s Pudong district, or Sodom and Gomorrah. Toronto, Barcelona, Barnsley So excited with this idea was the new architecture quango Cabe (the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment), it commissioned Ian McMillan (&quot;poet-in-residence for the Academy of Urbanism and Barnsley FC&quot;) to write a poem: Think of them, the world class places: Barcelona, Barnsley, Ludlow, Toronto; that walk from the station down to Newcastle&apos;s quay; plenty of flourish, World class I reckon: world class. Eat your heart out, William McGonagall. As for Cabe, set up by Blair&apos;s department of culture, media and sport, this tax-eating body barks fashionably about &quot;sustainability&quot; and good design, while robustly promoting the building of supermarkets in the very last of Britain&apos;s independent country towns, towns happy to be themselves rather than clown-like, retail-crazy &quot;world-class places&quot;. I know how powerless local people feel in the face of smooth-talking, unaccountable bureaucrats. Why do I know? Because Cabe wants an ugly and unsustainable Tesco built, despite opposition from the town council, chamber of commerce, schools and residents, on a beautiful, allotment-graced riverside site in my home town, Hadleigh, a happily self-sufficient backwater of rural Suffolk. With Cabe&apos;s help, its character and sustainable economy will surely be destroyed. This playground bullying, by a government in thrall to big business, is key to understanding why our towns and cities have sprawled, why urban planning has come to mean property development on a brobdingnagian scale, and why the concerns of rural areas have been trampled underfoot. Politicians of all parties, except Labour, are aware of the problem. &quot;We aim to deliver power to local communities,&quot; says Ed Vaizey, canvassing in Wallingford, in his Oxfordshire constituency. &quot;We&apos;ll push for planning development from the ground up. Developers and large corporations have been in the driving seat; we need to know what local people really want.&quot; Vaizey, shadow arts minister, toyed with the idea of appointing, were the Tories to win, a chief architect to encourage more thoughtful development. He now believes such a role would be divisive, as an architectural tsar could favour a particular style of architecture over another, not a good idea in a pluralist society. So would Vaizey rely on Cabe for advice? &quot;I&apos;ve been a big fan of Cabe,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a good idea in principle. In practice, it&apos;s too big, too\u00a0bureaucratic. &quot;What we do want is expert advisers from a variety of backgrounds to help us understand local landscapes, their histories and identities as well as economic needs, so that we can ensure all places are treated with respect. We&apos;re well aware of how local councils are scared of the threat of appeals made by big developers they dare to\u00a0reject.&quot; Peter Phillips, very much in favour of localism, is one of three architects standing for parliament. Of the other two, one is Tory, the other Lib Dem. Phillips, however, is the BNP candidate for Windsor. &quot;Does he design in the style of Albert Speer?&quot; asks Vaizey when I tell him about Phillips. Well, no. The BNP&apos;s architectural message, I have to say, is not dissimilar to that of the Tories. &quot;The BNP would reverse the increasing over-regulation and centralisation of government,&quot; says Phillips from his one-man practice in Surrey. &quot;We&apos;d get rid of the Homes and Communities Agency, the Partnership for Schools, Cabe and other unmanageable quangos. Centralisation of government, along with PFI and PPP [public-private partnership], has been costly and unhappy for architecture; local practices have been squeezed out from public-sector work funded in these new ways, with the result that architectural diversity has been\u00a0diminished.&quot; There&apos;s not much here a Tory candidate would disagree with, but then the more familiar face of the BNP reveals itself, as Phillips says: &quot;Eighty per cent of our new homes are for immigrants, and this is one key reason why our towns are sprawling.&quot; The Lib Dems are vague on the subject. A spokesman for Don Foster, culture secretary should Nick Clegg&apos;s crew win, says the great man will get back to me. He doesn&apos;t. Perhaps Foster is busy with his ukulele, which he lists as a hobby. Or maybe he is out in honey-coloured Bath \u2013 that battered and bruised architectural wonder, where he has been MP since\u00a01992. What I do know is that the Lib Dems would &quot;slash&quot; VAT on refurbishment, a move that would encourage the development of empty homes, especially in cities like Liverpool, where entire Victorian terraces stand boarded up. A Lib Dem government would also somehow retrofit every home in the country to the tune of \u00a310,000 as part of a &quot;pay-as-you-save scheme&quot; (whatever that is); this means ensuring all homes are well insulated, whatever their age or style. The party says it will protect the green belt, as would the Tories. It will abolish the new Infrastructure Planning Commission, a Soviet-style quango with powers to send nuclear plants, power lines and pylons to your neck of the woods whether you want them or not. Labour is in no mood to talk about such fripperies as architecture, development or planning. My attempts to speak to Margaret Hodge, Labour spokeswoman on architecture, were met with no\u00a0response. A jobless, car-bound subtopia In terms of architecture and planning, the big problem with New Labour has been its almost paranoid need to centralise power and control events. This was evident from the start with the Millennium Experience, aka the Dome, a pointless, demeaning exercise that cost a billion quid and fell flat on its bloated face. While hype surrounded Lottery projects, and passionately concerned housing ministers came and went, cheap land \u2013 much of it floodplain \u2013 has been handed over to housebuilders so they can rush up the unsustainable slums of the future. This or that week&apos;s housing minister has barked on about headline-stealing &quot;eco-towns&quot; that were clearly a bad joke, a new form of jobless, car-bound\u00a0subtopia. &quot;New Labour was never really interested in leaving an architectural legacy,&quot; says Amanda Baillieu, editor of Building Design. &quot;But it was lucky enough to inherit a healthy economy from the Tories, and went on a spending spree. Sadly, all its &apos;acclaimed&apos; public sector projects, like schools, have been hoovered up by big, commercially driven architectural firms. The bar&apos;s been lowered, not\u00a0raised.&quot; Among architects themselves, the vote seems to be split: figures from the Fees Bureau, a research group, suggest 32% will vote Conservative, 30% Labour and 27% Lib Dem. The parties might like to think more seriously about courting them, though no one expects them to have the subtlety of Christopher Wren. They might also think of public good rather than private\u00a0gain. As for our new housing, after a decade of bluster, profligate policy initiatives and relentless bullying, this remains a blight on the landscape, a stain on our collective soul, a national\u00a0disgrace.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Labour", "Millennium Dome", "Regeneration", "Art and design", "Culture", "Communities"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-21T20:30:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/21/shanghai-2010-expo-party", "sentences": ["You have probably never heard of Shanghai&apos;s 2010 Expo and are still less likely to attend.", "Shanghai is holding the biggest Expo ever as it attempts to resuscitate the once-grand tradition of international gatherings that began with London&apos;s Great Exhibition in 1851, gave Paris the Eiffel Tower and drew tens of millions of Americans to the landmark world&apos;s fairs.", "&quot;It&apos;s the 21st century equivalent to the old tribute to the emperor \u2013 we&apos;ve all always had to pay to play in China, but wind-up clocks and oompah bands are old hat so now we have to build pavilions, sponsor things, cut cheques to official charities,&quot; argued Paul French of the Shanghai-based consultancy Access Asia.", "Professor Anne-Marie Brady, a political scientist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, described the expo as a stimulus to Shanghai&apos;s development but also a &quot;campaign of mass distraction&quot;."], "title": "Shanghai 2010 Expo is set to be the world's most expensive party", "article": "It is the biggest and most expensive party to which you have ever been invited, and almost certainly the oddest \u2013 with buildings shaped like rabbits and apples, Copenhagen&apos;s Little Mermaid on show, and violin-playing robots to serenade you. You have probably never heard of Shanghai&apos;s 2010 Expo and are still less likely to attend. But from 1 May, the city will welcome an estimated 70 million visitors to the $4bn (\u00a32.6bn), six-month event, as hyped in China as it is unknown outside it. Wen Jiabao, the country&apos;s premier, has described it as the fulfilment of a 100-year-old dream. It has prompted a city-wide makeover that has cost an estimated $45bn \u2013 more than Beijing&apos;s pre-Olympics transformation. In a matter of weeks the city has unveiled three subway lines, a new airline terminal and a revamped waterfront. The facelift for the latter, the historic Bund, alone cost $700m. Even by China&apos;s frenetic pace of construction, the speed has been incredible \u2013 Pan Haixiao, an urban planning expert at Tongji University, estimates that without the event the changes would have taken three times as long. An army of workers is still racing to lay out pavements, plant mature trees, roll out turf and install public art around the city. At the Expo site itself, which spans 5.28 sq km on both banks of the Huangpu river \u2013 covering the equivalent of almost 1,000 football pitches \u2013 hundreds more toil to finish multimillion-pound pavilions. Shanghai is holding the biggest Expo ever as it attempts to resuscitate the once-grand tradition of international gatherings that began with London&apos;s Great Exhibition in 1851, gave Paris the Eiffel Tower and drew tens of millions of Americans to the landmark world&apos;s fairs. &quot;They were the entertainment event of the year wherever they took place,&quot; said Professor John Findling, author of the Encyclopedia of World&apos;s Fairs and Expos, who suggests they had the kind of impact the Olympics do today. In their heyday, he points out, they were not competing with television, theme parks or the internet. &quot;Visitors were anxious to see people from exotic places, the latest in science, invention and fine art, and to enjoy themselves \u2026 There was nothing else in the way of amusement that was like it,&quot; he said. These days, few could recall recent hosts \u2013 such as Aichi in Japan \u2013 and the events have less razzmatazz and a more earnest tone. Their purpose &quot;is to allow a global dialogue on important issues facing the international community,&quot; said Vicente Gonzalez Loscertales, secretary general of the Bureau International des Expositions \u2013 the world&apos;s fair equivalent of the International Olympic Committee. But few outsiders believe that the opportunity to discuss urbanisation \u2013 this year&apos;s theme \u2013 is why 192 participating countries are laying out jaw-dropping sums. Instead, they point to the thousands of companies hoping to cut lucrative deals and find new customers. &quot;It&apos;s the 21st century equivalent to the old tribute to the emperor \u2013 we&apos;ve all always had to pay to play in China, but wind-up clocks and oompah bands are old hat so now we have to build pavilions, sponsor things, cut cheques to official charities,&quot; argued Paul French of the Shanghai-based consultancy Access Asia. For the hosts there is at least as much at stake. Professor Anne-Marie Brady, a political scientist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, described the expo as a stimulus to Shanghai&apos;s development but also a &quot;campaign of mass distraction&quot;. &quot;The hoopla surrounding it is aimed at helping Chinese people feel positive about their country and how it is developing, distracting them from other, more depressing, issues such as unemployment, the cost of living, official corruption and incompetence, access to good healthcare [and] escalating house prices,&quot; she said. &quot;In China today, the non-political is in fact deeply political.&quot; There is certainly excitement among many residents. Two hundred thousand people attended a trial run and even on cold, drizzling weekdays inhabitants gather to peer through the 10-foot-high wire fence towards the distant Chinese pavilion. &quot;We have waited 150 years for the chance to hold the expo in our country. Now we have succeeded in two big events: the Olympics and this,&quot; said 77-year-old Wang Xinghua. &quot;I feel even happier when people from other countries come to visit \u2013 it represents China standing up in the world.&quot; The mood at the site was not entirely harmonious. Moments after Wang strolled away with his wife, stocky plain-clothed security officers marched away a dozen vendors offering souvenir snaps. On Tuesday state media reported that police had detained 6,000 people during their fourth pre-expo crackdown in less than two months. As officials step up security, new restrictions range from banning kite-flying near the site \u2013 and model aeroplanes across two provinces \u2013 to halting the sale of knives at supermarkets. And as before the Olympics, campaigners warn of a crackdown on dissidents, activists and petitioners \u2013 including some of the 18,000 households whose homes were bulldozed to make way for the site. The Chinese Human Rights Defenders network says it has documented six cases of people being sent for re-education through labour for expo-related reasons this year alone, in addition to detentions, questioning and harassment. &quot;The expo is nothing to do with us. The big businesses earned most of the money, and corrupt officials; money doesn&apos;t get to us or the nation and they stop us selling on the streets,&quot; grumbled migrant toy-seller Huang, 60, who said he could not afford to visit the expo. Although registered residents have received free tickets, standard entry is 160 yuan \u2013 a hefty sum when last year&apos;s average urban disposable income was only 17,175 yuan. Nearby, Song Mi, 47, expected officials to clear away her sugarcane cart in case it gave visitors a bad impression \u2013 and probably rightly, she thought. &quot;I&apos;m counting down the days until the expo opens. I want to see everything,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s the biggest thing that&apos;s happened in my lifetime.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Shanghai holidays", "China holidays", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-21T22:04:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/22/rose-bowl-sony-hampshire", "sentences": ["Perhaps one or two of the more anonynmous players collectively raking in more than \u00a33m a month had been kidnapped earlier in the season and no one had noticed ...

The \u00a348m redevelopment of Hampshire&apos;s home, the Rose Bowl, involves a technology deal with Sony that could make it one of the most technologically advanced stadiums in Europe. Sony will supply high-definition screens throughout the two new stands, conference facilities and the proposed hotel and spa. The system, similar to that employed at Arsenal&apos;s Emirates Stadium, will enable Hampshire to produce their own live content and statistics and stream them to big screens around the ground and concourses. The screens, due to be installed by late 2011, will also be utilised during the concerts that Hampshire hope will attract up to 35,000 fans to the ground and help boost year-round revenues. Glenn Delve, managing director of the Rose Bowl, claims, modestly, that the new system &quot;has the potential to truly revolutionise the way supporters engage with the game&quot;. The technological arms race between stadium designers is seen as increasingly important in maximising advertising revenue and improving the spectator experience. Now they just need to make the ambitious stadium redevelopment pay. Deloitte aid Red Knights  Deloitte, which has worked hard to build up its sporting credentials with its annual audits of football&apos;s finances and consultancy work for a host of clubs, is understood to have become the latest big financial hitter to become associated with the Red Knights, the would-be buyers of Manchester United, in an advisory capacity. Alongside Freshfields, which is supplying legal expertise, and Nomura, the Japanese investment bank that has been responsible for contacting all the 40 or so wealthy individuals who expressed concrete interest in the plan, Deloitte is believed to have been supplying advice on tax structures and how to structure any bid most efficiently. The Knights are expected to make their move in the window between the end of the season and the start of the World Cup. They are expected to leave the \u00a3509m bond in place, with the rest of the offer split between up to \u00a3500m raised from the wealthy Knights and \u00a3250m or more pledged by other fans. No king&apos;s ransom  The creditor&apos;s report prepared by Portsmouth&apos;s administrators makes for grimly fascinating reading and will surely become the set text on how not to run a football club, as detailed elsewhere in these pages. Interestingly, Canterbury Europe \u2013 the club&apos;s kit supplier that itself went into administration earlier this year \u2013 was owed almost \u00a32m, which can&apos;t have helped.  Among many other jaw-dropping accounting lines, nestling in the adminstrator&apos;s abstract of receipts and payments from 26 February, when he was appointed, to 14 April, is a most curious item. Apparently, the club shelled out \u00a3308.50 in &quot;ransom payments&quot; during that period. But how inconsequential do you have to be to merit only a ransom demand equivalent to less than the hourly rate of the administrator, Andrew Andronikou? Perhaps one or two of the more anonynmous players collectively raking in more than \u00a33m a month had been kidnapped earlier in the season and no one had noticed ... Brawn&apos;s flight formula  Here, finally, is the official result of the ash-affected Volcanic grand prix, the race back to British shores declared by several hundred members of the Formula One travelling circus after last Sunday&apos;s Chinese grand prix in Shanghai. With almost all Formula One teams based in Britain, a Wacky Races style dash back to Blighty for work on the cars before the next grand prix in Barcelona ensued. Taking the chequered flag on Tuesday was Ross Brawn. He flew to Nice via Dubai and was chauffeur-driven through France to set foot on British soil just after 5pm. Second was Mark Webber and his Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, whose flight touched down in Scotland around 6.30pm after a 44-hour journey. Webber apparently had no trouble entering Britain despite the loss of his passport on the journey. Third came the BBC presenter Jake Humphrey and his colleague the pitlane reporter Lee McKenzie, who flew to Frankfurt, drove to Calais and reached Dover by ferry at 8.30pm. The race result is, of course, subject to protest and convenient rearrangement by Bernie Ecclestone.

The budget airline Ryanair has sparked fury by refusing to pay the hotel and food bills of those stuck abroad in the six-day shutdown. The stance flouts Europe wide-regulations on consumer rights for airline passengers. But there seems to be no way of compelling airlines to follow those regulations.  Thousands of passengers have returned, including those on board HMS Albion. But thousands more remain stranded, notably in south-east Asia where many have been told they won&apos;t get flights back until early May. Questions continue to be asked about the government&apos;s handling of the crisis. Were ministers right to tell passengers to head for Madrid and Calais, which turned out to be  travel bottlenecks, while negotiating a relaxation of the flight restrictions?  8.19am:       The Guardian&apos;s travel writer Benji Lanyado has been tweeting his epic journey back from Tangier. He&apos;s nearly home. Here&apos;s a selection from the latest stage from northern France to Kent, with pictures. Appropriately enough they were handing out Marathon-runner style foil capes to passengers at Calais.  Eurostar full for days. Driving straight to Calais.  Two hours from Calais. I hear tales of three-hour queues at the port anyway. Sounds like a very British rescue operation The ash refugees... Hundreds of Brits at Calais  Hundreds of people in foot passenger queue at Calais, but moving quickly. Waiting time two hours, ferries leaving every 75 minutes. Lots of TV crews here, just in time for the 10 O&apos;clock news! The Red Cross have arrived! Here&apos;s my girlfriend modelling the latest line of ash volcano refugee chic! F&amp;C Office officials ferrying the golden hordes The final leg is on, of all things, a double decker bus from Dover to London. Home.        8.52am: Tom Riley and his wife have been stranded in China since Saturday and his visa is about to run out. He emails:  After being no help at all and giving us no way to contact them, our airline (Finnair) have told us that 13 May is the soonest they can fly us back to the UK. We&apos;ve just been looking at alternative flights back to the UK and noticed that Finnair are selling tickets from Shanghai (where we need to fly from) to the UK on dates earlier than they have offered us. It seems obvious that they are not prioritising stranded passengers. The costs of my wife and I staying here are mounting and we need to get back to our jobs before our last few days of emergency holiday runs out, as does my visa. We have contacted the authorities and they have said that I will be fined for every day I am here illegally if it cannot be renewed in time. As airspace is opening up, expecting us to stay here for another three weeks at our own expense is ridiculous. Their website specifies they are not responsible for costs incurred as a result of the volcano, when EU law clearly states that they are. We were turned away from the airport with no help at all and told to check the website. Since then, all of Finnair&apos;s numbers in Europe have been recorded messages advising passengers to check the website, and that they cannot be contacted because they are too busy. I am currently on hold to their UK office, it&apos;s been 35mins so far, my wife is adding Skype credit to the account from another computer I use it on this one.   9am: The main political parties might have found an issue they can agree on: bashing Ryanair. Foreign office minister Chris Bryant told the Times: &quot;Most of the airlines have been exemplary. But many people feel badly let down by Ryanair for failing to let them know whether they are getting on a flight or not.&quot; Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Norman Baker issued this statement: &quot;Michael O&apos;Leary&apos;s outrageous decision not to compensate customers after the upheaval of the last week is a blatant defiance of EU consumer rules. &quot;This is shocking behaviour and rubs salt into the wounds for those who have been stranded overseas. This will make people think twice about travelling with Ryanair in the future.&quot;  9.11am: Jat Sahota is stuck in Dubai with hundreds of other Brits. He rang to express his frustration at the lack of information being offered by his tour operator \u2013 Virgin Holidays. &quot;My sense is that Virgin are focused very much on their own costs, rather than getting people home,&quot; he said.  9.21am: BA said it was operating larger aircraft on some routes and was also sending an extra plane to Antigua in the Caribbean tomorrow to pick up holidaymakers stuck due to the airports&apos; shutdown. A spokeswoman said: &quot;There will still be some disruption tomorrow and into the weekend as we get the schedules back on line.&quot;       9.26am: We are getting complaints about BA&apos;s operation in China. Stranded BA passenger Conor Mckee emailed:   On my way to Shanghai airport for 11am flight arriving London 4pm. I suspect I will be on my way back to my hotel though. Been stranded with a colleague for a week. Can&apos;t get hold of BA&apos;s China office and BA&apos;s website has no information. Seems like airports and airlines are in chaos unable to organise themselves to inform their customers. Is it that difficult to be decisive and to disseminate info?  Tom Bowen, another BA customer stranded in China, emails:  Like hundreds and thousands of passengers across the world, flight disruption has left me facing another night stranded in a hotel on the other side of the world. My flight BA1038 was due to depart from Beijing to London on the morning of 21 April, taking me home for the first time in two years. I am, in many ways more fortunate than most. I am familiar with the city, my girlfriend speaks the language fluently and her parents, who were due to visit Beijing, have been kind enough to let us use their hotel reservations since they themselves were also affected by flight disturbances.  There is a sense of camaraderie amongst those stranded here and the hotel have been exceptionally understanding about the situation and the changes we have made to the existing booking.  However, one institution has been neither helpful nor supportive and that is British Airways. Yesterday morning, after my flight was cancelled and after having spent \u00a310 and two hours on hold trying to speak to an operator, I went to BA&apos;s offices here in Beijing. The organisation was terrible, despite the obvious disruption to thousands of BA passengers; there was no queuing system, no information leaflets and only two customer service representatives. Yet, despite these failings, where BA really outdid itself by making sure these two lonely and overworked representatives were unable to speak English fluently and even worse were openly laughing at customers&apos; complaints.  Whilst I was trapped in this nightmare of customer &apos;service&apos;, my girlfriend went to the Air France offices, where she was greeted with a queuing system, comfy chairs set out to accommodate weary travellers and three senior representatives who not only spoke English but French and Chinese as well.  In the time BA served two customers Air France had managed to provide alternative travel arrangements for 10 stranded passengers.  Considering the extent of the disruption and the annoyance amongst many travellers at the airlines it seems unbelievable that BA didn&apos;t make a better effort to provide better customer service to its many disaffected passengers.  The next available flight I have been able to change onto is on the 8 May, 17 days after my planned departure date. Whilst BA are offering to compensate expenditure during this waiting period I first have to pay all expenses up front, leaving me in a far from ideal and financially damaging situation.        9.43am: John Lilley, another angry ash victim, emails with a gripe about car hire costs. He writes:   &quot;Just spent three days getting home from Norway. Highlight of this journey was Avis charging me almost \u00a3700 for one days hire of a Kia car. I take great exception to corporate exploitation of vulnerable people.&quot;   10.21am: Wow: Ryanair has caved in. Here&apos;s a snap from PA: Budget airline Ryanair today ended its defiance of EU regulations by agreeing to fully compensate its passengers caught up in the ash cloud crisis. Yesterday the Irish no-frills carrier&apos;s chief executive Michael O&apos;Leary said he would reimburse travellers only the original price of their air fare and no more. But today the airline said that it would comply with the regulations under which EU airlines are required to reimburse the &quot;reasonable receipted expenses of disrupted passengers&quot;.      Michael O'Leary, RyanAir boss Photograph: Carlo Cerchioli / G/N/Carlo Cerchioli / GraziaNeri    10.27am: Michael O&apos;Leary breaks the habit of a lifetime by backing down. Here&apos;s the Ryanair statement:  Ryanair confirmed this morning that it will comply with EU261 regulations under which EU airlines are required to reimburse the reasonable receipted expenses (as set out in EU261) of disrupted passengers. Under EU261 passengers are not entitled to compensation, as the closure of European airspace over the past seven days was beyond the control of European airlines.  And this is what O&apos;Leary said:   &quot;The events of the last seven days, under which Europe&apos;s airlines were prevented from flying by the closure of European airspace highlight how absurd and discriminatory the EU261 regulations are towards Europe&apos;s airlines. While competitor ferry, coach and train operators are obliged to reimburse passengers reasonable expenses, this reimbursement is limited to the ticket price paid to those operators.  Yet the airlines are required by regulation to meet potentially unlimited expenses, in circumstances where there has been a catastrophic closure of European airspace over the past seven days, as EU governments and regulators wrongly applied a blanket ban on flights over European airspace. Ryanair has long campaigned for these reimbursements under passenger rights legislation to be limited to the ticket price paid in the same way they are for train, coach and ferry operators. We will continue to work through the European Low Fares Airlines Association (ELFAA) and other industry bodies to persuade the European Commission and the European Parliament to alter this regulation to put this reasonable limit on these reimbursement claims&quot;.   10.36am: O&apos;Leary confirmed that Ryanair will reimburse &quot;reasonable costs&quot;, but he will challenge the regulations. But speaking to BBC News. &quot;The events of the last seven days have exposed just how ridiculous and absurd these reimbursement provisions are in the case of catastrophic seven-day closures like this,&quot; he said. He also revealed the crisis has cost Ryan \u20ac30-40m. Asked if Ryanair would make it difficult to make claims, O&apos;Leary said &quot;perish the thought&quot;.  Martha describes returning to England last night on board HMS Albion in this Audioboo interview. &quot;Getting everyone home was just a great feeling,&quot; she says       11.30am: Not everyone is fed up. I&apos;ve just been talking to Martha Rafferty, who was pictured on front of the Daily Mail yesterday boarding the HMS Albion at Santander.  She arrived last night in Portsmouth after leading a stranded Girl Guide group back from Morrocco.  Here&apos;s her account of the journey that she wrote on board the ship:  &quot;This has been one of the best sea voyages of my life. I was one of two leaders on the Girlguiding UK Centenary trip to Morocco that could not get home. We were due to fly back last Friday from Marrakech to Heathrow via Madrid.  We made it to Madrid but then got halted on our journey by the shutdown. I was sick to my stomach trying to figure the logistics of getting 17 people home some with severe medical issues that required hospital treatment in Madrid, thank goodness we contacted the consulate. Since they called back on Monday evening life has been easy if a little cramped. We left the consulate in Madrid and drove through the night to Santander and it wasn&apos;t until we drove up to the HMS Albion itself I believed it was real.  The crew have been wonderful and not once laughed at our ridiculous questions especially when we got lost. The bunks gave me the best night&apos;s sleep since we left home, though getting into the middle bunk did cause me some issues.  I am thankful for a lot, to the consulate for their organisation, to the troops we shared space with who were lovely despite all their months away, to the Navy for taking us not only home, but home in style.&quot;   11.41am: Colin Hind has copied us in on a letter he sent to BA&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh.  Re flight No BA54 at from Johannesburgh South Africa Thursday 15/4/2010 Dear Mr Walsh, Are your staff manipulating tired and disorientated passengers to avoid BA fulfilling its responsibilities? A group of students from Manchester University were due to leave Johannesburg on this flight. It was cancelled because of the Ash cloud. Since then the group have been given little or no information or have been misinformed by your staff. They have now been told that the group details have been lost from the system and they need to re-book. The next fight they could leave on would be 9 May 2010. I have left out much of the details of trips back and forth to the airport and the group&apos;s experience at the hands by your staff, however, I will be happy to provide details should you require them. Many of this group of students face exams in the near future. Clearly, this could have an outcome for their results to say nothing of the distress they are facing. What do you intend to do about it or are you just refusing to accept responsibility for the consequences of your business? Yours sincerely, Colin Hind       Lord Adonis, the transport secretary. Photograph: Tim Ireland/PA    11.45am: Transport secretary Lord Adonis, has welcomed Ryanair&apos;s climbdown. Here&apos;s what he said:   &quot;I welcome the revised statement by Ryanair confirming that they will meet their obligations to passengers.  The government and the Civil Aviation Authority have told Ryanair in the strongest terms that they are expected to pay the reasonable accommodation and food costs of stranded passengers, and that they should seek to get them back to Britain as soon as possible.   This applies to all EU airlines, and I will be equally forthright in defending passenger rights with any airline that seeks to avoid its obligations.&quot;   11.59am: Volcanic ash is still causing flight cancellations. Parts of Scandinavian airspace have been closed after a new cloud of the stuff wafted over. Here&apos;s a rundown of the current restrictions courtesy of AP:  \u2022 Finland: Most airports in southern Finland, including Helsinki Airport, are closed. Airports in northern parts of the country are open. International overflights allowed above 31,000ft.\u2022 Norway: A new wave of volcanic ash caused aviation officials to close airports \u2022 Sweden: All Stockholm airports and Malmo airport in the south are open. Airspace in parts of northern and western Sweden is closed although overflights at high altitude are permitted.\u2022 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania: The airspace of all three Baltic countries is open, but some flights are still cancelled due to restrictions in other countries.        12.23pm: I&apos;ve been sent a fiery email about BA&apos;s handling of stranded passengers in Mumbai.  Erica Wald, reader in international history at the LSE, is trying to get back to London. She writes:   &quot;I&apos;ve just returned from my third round trip to Mumbai International Airport in my attempt to return home to London after my flight, BA 138, was cancelled due to the volcanic ash. It was a fairly depressing and enraging experience. BA told me yesterday after I finally got through to their India number, which I rang for 3 \u00bd hours, that the earliest I could go home was 6 May.  I miss my husband and I&apos;m concerned to be missing so much work at such a crucial time for my students who are due to sit their exams in May. I&apos;ve now been away from home for a month and a half \u2013 my flight to India was also cancelled by BA because of the strike.  Last night I heard BA were still SELLING tickets for flights from Friday, 23 April, so I decided to check for myself. Sure enough, there are seats on each of the two daily flights out of Mumbai, however, they are now asking nearly \u00a32,000 for a one-way ticket. I was so outraged by this blatant, greedy profiteering, that I decided to go to the airport this morning to try to get an answer from them. At the moment, the airport is filled with very upset stranded passengers in varying states of distress - I met a gentleman who suffers from diabetes and who is running out of medication and money. Moreover, BA has lost his suit case with his spare needles. They have not been offered any accommodation, so have been sleeping in the terminal. BA is not even offering passengers bottled water or food. And if you leave the terminal to find food they tell you that you will probably not be allowed back in. There was another passenger undergoing cancer treatment, whose medical needs were also ignored. Another one&apos;s wife is due to give birth in the next two days. Right now, BA is telling us that we have to find our own hotel, pay for it, and then claim compensation when we return to the UK. While I am lucky enough to have a hotel that held a room available for me many are not so lucky. The BA manager here has been ineffectual and rude, not giving passengers any information and denied that BA was still selling tickets (until I produced the print-out of the page where I was asked to enter my credit card details for the purchase). There was a very sweet bunch of backpackers who were booked on to today&apos;s flight and had come to say that they were willing to give up their seats for people who urgently needed to return home \u2013 they just asked BA to provide them a place to stay until there was free flight to get them home. BA refused. Apparently they were unwilling to lay out the cash to them and instead put them on the flight, leaving many desperate waiting passengers flabbergasted. While I appreciate that this is a difficult situation for airlines, they should have a duty of care to their passengers and after making record profits for years. It is hard for many of us, left thousands of miles from home, to understand the rationale behind not sending out extra planes to clear the backlog, as surely they would be full in both directions? I&apos;ve been very disappointed and upset with British Airways&apos; slapdash and frankly dangerous handling of this situation.&quot;        12.42pm: The situation for BA passengers in Dehli doesn&apos;t look any better. Helen Walker contacted us on behalf of her parents. She writes:  &quot;My parents are stuck out there and have been since their flight on the 19 April was cancelled. They have been told by BA they cannot fly back until the 10 May, making it a month they will have been stranded.  Even though airspace has reopened, BA have not put on any extra flights and are sending half empty planes back because unless passengers are willing to re book tickets in first or business class for around \u00a32,200 then they will have to wait weeks. Passengers are unable to get into the airport as it is being guarded by armed police and only bribes will get you into the airport. Last night, the first flight left Delhi with only two of the stranded on the plane. There are 3,000 people estimated to be stranded in Delhi so even a flight back on 10 May sounds unrealistic.  Tourists out there are worried they have been neglected by BA and will be forgotten when this story is no longer newsworthy in a few days&apos; time. They feel incredibly let down by BA who have said they will only help them with food and accommodation for three days. They are shocked no extra flights have been laid on, let alone that they are sending planes back with empty seats. It seems like BA are trying to recoup lost income by expecting people to pay extortionate sums to be upgraded and to get home sooner.&quot;   12.52pm: I&apos;ve just put some of the complaints from stranded passenger to BA&apos;s press office. A spokeswoman told me: &quot;This is a completely unprecedented situation. We are doing absolutely everything we can to help stranded passengers get back to the UK. There are a large number of passenger which every airline is trying to get back onto flights. That is difficult and it will take some time. &quot;So many people have so many reasons why they desperately need to get home. We are trying to prioritise in the fairest way possible. &quot;No BA passenger is being asked to pay any more money to get on a flight. We will put passengers in every seat possible.&quot;  1.14pm: Virgin Holidays says it will pass on Jat Sahota&apos;s complaints (see 9.11am) to their team in Dubai.  A spokesman said: &quot;Virgin Holidays continue to do everything we can to make arrangements for the return of customers who remain overseas but the repatriation effort will take several more days. In the meantime, we will continue to assist those customers by providing hotel accommodation and other support.  &quot;Our over-riding priority remains the welfare of our customers and to that end, Virgin Holidays is working round the clock, both on the ground overseas and here in the UK, to ensure our customers are kept as well informed and comfortable as possible. We appreciate that these exceptional circumstances have been challenging and we&apos;d like to thank them for their continued patience and understanding.&quot;  2.04pm: What&apos;s the reaction of Ryanair passengers to the O&apos;Leary climbdown? PA spoke Jennifer Sigg at Stansted: &quot;We were happy to know that we are going to be able to claim compensation but we weren&apos;t really expecting much. This is Ryanair. They are just a no-frills airline. We flew with them because they are cheap. I would not have expected them to cover extraneous costs. I wasn&apos;t aware of the legislation.&quot;  2.10pm: Here&apos;s that BBC interview with O&apos;Leary explaining his climbdown. He&apos;s going to reimburse (note: not compensate) passengers, but he also wants to sue the EU.  &quot;We recognise whenever I&apos;ve made a mistake and we try to correct those mistakes quickly,&quot; he said.   2.27pm: It&apos;s like a refugee camp for stranded passenger in Bangkok airport, according to Sheila and Carolyn, who are trying to get a Thai Airways flight back to London.   &quot;Against the advice of Thai airways we have come to Bangkok airport after the earliest confirmed flight Thai were able to offer us was 7 May. The situation here is appalling and especially grim for passengers trying to return to London. We&apos;ve been directed into a holding area in the basement of the airport for &apos;Victims of the Icelandic volcanic eruption&apos; - to get us out of the way of the main airport it seems. It looks like a refugee camp. People are using cardboard boxes as mattresses to sleep on.  It&apos;s not the end of the holiday we had expected, and it&apos;s beyond anything we have ever seen. People have been here since the first cancelled flight on 15 April and there is still no guarantee of a flight home for them. They will take priority over us as our flight was not until 19 April. Our estimate is that there are probably about 700 people down here, possibly more. There is British Embassy representation here, and they have told us that Lord Adonis is putting pressure on the Chairman of Thai airways to put on extra flights.  Facilities here are dreadful, although the airport authorities are providing drinks and snacks plus facilities for charging mobiles and using free internet (long queues). We have our name on a standby list for an 11.25 flight tomorrow. This is only for people at the airport so we feel for the moment we have to stay here. This may sound positive but we have come to realise that Thai staff only tell you what they want you to hear. We have met people who have been on a stand by list, or even told that they have a confirmed flight and it has all come to nothing. Thai will only fly us to another destination if we cover the cost of the onward journey ourselves. This might be an option (fly to Paris and get the Eurostar) if we cannot leave tomorrow. However these flights are also stand-by. Looks like a miserable night ahead. They have started giving out mattresses. Longing to be back home!&quot;   2.38pm: The Tories are making a bid for the stranded-passenger vote.  Theresa Villiers, Shadow transport secretary, said: &quot;A Conservative government would conduct a wholesale review of the rules governing compensation and travel insurance arrangements for air passengers. Current arrangements mean few passengers understand whether they are protected by compensation schemes or not.&quot; But will all those stranded be back in time to vote?  2.57pm: Stanley Johnson, Boris&apos;s Dad, has written up his account of being rescued by HMS Albionn, in the Standard. It&apos;s Boy&apos;s Own stuff: &quot;Soon after HMS Albion had put out from Santander into the Bay of Biscay, I found myself being invited to tea by Commander John Gardner, the executive officer in charge. &quot;I told him that, as we stuck our nose through the closed gates on the Santander quayside, we had been afraid that we would be left behind. Commander Gardner said masterfully: &quot;I was not prepared to leave any Brits on the jetty if I could possibly help it.&quot;  3.05pm: Ash flash from PA: Flight training on RAF Typhoon jets has been &quot;temporarily suspended&quot; after inspectors found deposits of ash in one of the fleet&apos;s engines, the Ministry of Defence said today.  3.12pm: The MoD is playing down the grounding of training flights. &quot;These are very high performance jets so they are just being extra cautious,&quot; a spokesman said. Safety inspectors took the &quot;precautionary measure&quot; to check all of the jets based at RAF Coningsby, in Lincolnshire, after findings small deposits yesterday he added.  3.21pm: You heard it here first (3.31pm). The Sun&apos;s website is splashing on an &quot;exclusive story&quot; about how a Thomas Cook flight had to return to Manchester airport after the pilot smelt volcanic ash. We had the story in yesterday&apos;s liveblog, after spotting it here. Here&apos;s the flight recording.  The empty rescue flight bound for Crete had to return due to a technical fault with the air conditioning. &quot;The development of the fault categorically had nothing to do with volcanic ash and whilst there were no customers on board, at no point were our crew or the aircraft in any danger,&quot; a Thomas Cook spokeswoman told me yesterday.  3.40pm: A BA cabin crew member reports being shown volcanic dust that had collected on the wing of a 747.  An anonymous post on the Bassa web forum, which is only open to BA staff, said:   &quot;Just arrived back today, 747, and yes indeed.. the engineer and captain showed us a thin layer of volcanic dust which had collected on the wing. Interesting eh? The aircraft needed an engine inspection to see how much had been taken through, and wasn&apos;t fit to fly until the debris was removed. If [Willie] Walsh went up on a cardiff flight the other day and everything was normal.. then my eyes via the engineer saw differently. I feel we were used as a test flight. Luckily we were safe.. but I am mad that there was obviously some risk to the engines and I&apos;m not happy about that.. there should have been no risk whatsoever. The airlines have pushed the commercial in front of safety. I am pleased the EU did the flight ban.. the scientists were right to advise accordingly , and in my opinion they did not over react. I am now concerned that there is still a risk factor involved where our plane can not fly onwards as a result of this.&quot;   3.52pm: More on the suspension of RAF training flights. My colleague Mark Tran has been talking to the MoD.  Ash was found on one of the jets which landed at Coningsby yesterday, a spokesman said. As a result seven Typhoons that were flying at the time are being checked by engineers. But operational flights from Coningsby are continuing. Tornado and Harriers were not affected. (That&apos;s it for today. Thanks again for all your comments and emails.

The airlines claim they are doing all they can to clear the backlog, but that is being challenged by passengers, who say they are being abandoned by the airlines. Here&apos;s a sample of the latest complaints. Dr Saleem Althaf, an accident and emergency doctor in Lincolnshire, is trying to get back from Chennai in India. He was booked on a flight on Wednesday that was cancelled due to the ash cloud. He was told by British Airways that the earliest he could get back was 10 May. But in the meantime BA have been selling tickets on earlier flights for around \u00a31,500.  &quot;I just found that incredible,&quot; he told me. &quot;I am incredibly angry at the way BA have been treating their customers.&quot; Listen to Saleem&apos;s story here: BA insists it is giving priority to stranded passengers and said it was deliberately selling tickets at higher price to &quot;discourage&quot; new customers.  In a statement it said:   &quot;Our priority is to get our stranded customers back home as quickly as possible after the six-day closure of UK airspace.  To protect seats for BA customers who had their flight cancelled because of the closure, we have priced all available seats at the highest fares specifically to discourage new customers from buying them.  We cannot restrict the booking system that sells BA seats to our call centres only. Seats must be open for sale to everyone, including travel agents, tour operators or other airlines.  We recognise that this policy may be frustrating for customers of other airlines who would like to return to the UK with British Airways.  However, we are in an unprecedented situation not of our making and our prime obligation must be to our own customers.  Existing customers who are rebooking face no additional charges.&quot;  The rationale for that system is lost on BA&apos;s stranded passengers, who complain they are still being denied places on planes. Erica Wald, a fellow in international history at the London School of Economics, is trying to get a flight back from Mumbai after a cancellation last week. She told us she was &quot;outraged&quot; to find BA offering tickets home for \u00a32,000 while being told she cannot return until 6 May (see 12.23pm entry). &quot;The BA manager here has been ineffectual and rude, not giving passengers any information and denied that BA was still selling tickets (until I produced the printout of the page where I was asked to enter my credit card details for the purchase),&quot; she said. BA customers Trevor and Juliet Donnelly, who are stuck in Dehli, say the airline&apos;s behaviour is a scandal. In a letter we published today they wrote:  &quot;We are trapped in Delhi with our children Iona (14 \u2013 missing GCSE exams), Sophia (13 \u2013 missing her part in the school play) and Dylan (seven \u2013 missing home). BA have offered us a flight home on 10 May (we have been stranded since 16 April), but are still selling tickets on Delhi-London flights for thousands of pounds (which we cannot afford). The rich are allowed straight on to flights while the poor remain stranded. This is the real scandal of the volcano crisis.  We are among the lucky ones who BA have put up in a hotel but, with spirits low and tempers high, trouble is brewing \u2013 some people even had a &quot;sit-down protest&quot; in the hotel lobby on Wednesday. The Ramada in New Delhi is a very nice hotel, but our money has run out and we can&apos;t even afford the bottled water.&quot;  BA is not the only airline facing customer anger at the sale of tickets for earlier flights. Tom Riley is having trouble getting a Finnair flights to the UK after being stranded in Shanghai since Saturday. He writes:   &quot;Eventually we got through to Finnair after holding for 45mins. Initially they weren&apos;t budging on the 13 May return date until we asked why they were selling tickets for the start of May to new customers. With that argument we were able to get them down to 7 May, which is still obscene considering the airports are now operating as normal for new customers. Luckily our employers are being as flexible as possible. I have applied with the Chinese police to have my visa extended which cost \u00a316, but they will take a week to process and keep my passport in that time. The British embassy, before they stopped replying to emails, suggested taking them a letter from the airline as proof I was stranded here. They did offer a signed letter of support, but it has not arrived after four days. Luckily the authorities accepted prints of my old and new e-tickets. We are still trying to contact Finnair to demand new earlier flights back to the UK since airspace has now opened fully, but contacting them is expensive and time-consuming. The worst thing is not knowing where we stand and having little or conflicting information to make decisions based on. We are trying to make serious plans about what to do and need to rely on the laws in place, but some airlines (such as Finnair) are being very clear and open that they will not obey the law.&quot;  If you are having trouble getting a flight home please post a comment or get in touch. My email is matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk. We will publish more stories and responses as we get them.  12pm BA passengers Karen Bolton and Paul Holtam, from Bridgewater in West Somerset are stranded in the Chinese capital. They also can&apos;t understand why BA are selling still seats, while they are stuck. Karen writes:  &quot;We have been on a tour of China and should have flown home on 18 April from Beijing with BA. Even though airspace has reopened and BA flights have resumed we are having to go to the airport to fight for standby seats to get back. There is only one flight to London per day and the next few days are fully booked so there is little chance of us returning for weeks. I work at Bridgwater College and will have already missed a week of work by tomorrow. BA is continuing to book new passengers on future flights which means stranded passengers cannot return. There are around 200 of us that we know of, including a school group of 40 pupils. I have just checked on the BA website and people can book on flights we are being told are full, at extortionate rates - up to \u00a35,200. It is incredible that BA continue to take bookings on future flights considering the numbers of stranded passengers who should take priority.&quot;   12.30pm: Erica Wald, who is still stranded in Mumbai, doesn&apos;t believe BA&apos;s claim that it is hiking prices to discourage new customers. &quot;It is pure greed. If they were actually interested in getting people back they would freeze all the seats. People are so desperate that they will pay that money to get back. So I don&apos;t believe that is any form of discouragement. As far as I can tell none of the stranded passengers are getting on to the flights.&quot; Here&apos;s a recording of a phone interview with her:   12.54pm: BA have been selling tickets from India to the UK for as much as \u00a32,286 according to this screengrab sent by stranded BA customer Saleem Althaf. &quot;The listing by BA on the website is pure profiteering, plain and simple,&quot; he says. It shows a ticket available on a flight from Bangalore to Heathrow next Tuesday for 155,999 India Rupees or \u00a32,286       1.10pm: &quot;Free the Delhi 12,&quot; says the subject line on another angry email from a BA customer. Elizabeth Atwell writes:   &quot;We are 12 British Airways passengers stranded in Delhi travelling with Voyages Jules Verne. I cannot begin to describe the utter chaos and disorganisation at BA in Delhi. There is not a system or process in place to repatriate passengers. Those stranded earlier do not get priority. It is the luck of the draw. We were due to fly to London on the 19th April but we have now been given return dates between 4th and 10th May. You can only get inside Delhi airport with a valid ticket for the day of travel so it is impossible to re-negotiate your flight unless of course you are willing to pay a backhander to the armed guards on the door.  Hundreds of passengers join the daily waitlist yet only a handful get a seat. With thousands of BA passengers stranded in Delhi it will take weeks to address this without some extra flights. BA says passengers should contact the airline to get earlier dates but that is an impossible task in itself. Unlike other airlines, BA are not re-routing passengers so we appear condemned to another two weeks in Delhi. What is noticeable is that as other airlines are appearing to repatriate passengers successfully it is the BA passengers who are left filling the hotel beds and lobbies. There are thousands of BA passengers stranded in Delhi. I consider it of utmost priority that management from London get to Delhi to sort out the chaos. It is clear that extra flights need to be scheduled to get passengers back to London. Above all, I think it is immoral that BA are selling tickets for their flights over the coming days without repatriating their stranded passengers first. How can BA possibly claim to be the World&apos;s favourite airline?&quot;   1.45pm:  Pedro Gurrola, a senior lecturer in finance, is trying to get a BA flight from Miami to London.  My family and I are stranded in Miami after our flight BA0208 back to London for the 20 April was cancelled. At that time BA offered to rebook on the 3 May, which they assured was the earliest available date.  However, after airspace opened and flights resumed normality, BA began selling seats on earlier flights at very high rates (see below). So for example, if instead of waiting 13 days here, we want to fly before, we will have to pay at least $1,210 for a seat, not to mention the $6,370 (\u00a34,792) for some earlier flights. Of course, the call centre repeats there is no available seat for us before the 3 May, and that we should keep checking with BA to see if an earlier option becomes available in our travel class.       I have asked BA if stranded passenger can pay the high prices and then claim back the expense. A spokeswoman is trying to find out the answer, but she sounded doubtful.  2pm: I&apos;ve put Tom Riley&apos;s complaints about Finnair (see above) to the airline. He said it was &quot;obscene&quot; that airline was offering earlier tickets to new customer while he is still stranded. A spokeswoman said: &quot;I can see his point. But in our system when you have a reservation on a certain flight it looks like you are OK in our system. They should contact customer services as soon as possible.&quot;  &quot;At the moment the lines are very busy and we are sorry about that. All our staff are doing their best. The planes are very full.&quot;  2.22pm: Here&apos;s another furious BA customer. Claire Nisbet bought one of BA&apos;s high price tickets so that her daughter, whose original flights were twice cancelled, can get back for university exams. She has been refused a refund. She emails:  &quot;My daughter&apos;s first flight back from Qatar was cancelled on 15 April, then again on 20 April. It was rebooked for 28 April. Once airports reopened, I spent 24 hours calling BA offices all over the world to try and get someone to answer phone and rebook. But no joy, the UK one gave a spiel then immediately dropped the call saying they were too busy to answer, even at 2.30am.  I first found a one way ticket online at a cost of \u00a32,000. They normally \u00a3400. I later saw one at \u00a3600 for 22 April. I took the risk and bought it to secure, called the Oman office to transfer the booking then turned up at BA office in Qatar to sort it all out. They had received no guidance from UK and were unwilling to reimburse me for the one way ticket, and transfer the seat to the original booking. I still have not had that refund confirmed yet.  I was furious to read on the Guardian today that they had a policy of offering these tickets on the open market while leaving existing customers stuck all over the world, and the nonsense about pricing them out of the market to stop them from selling is not credible when there are a bunch of desperate people stuck all over the world.I have now contacted them and await a reply.&quot;   2.39pm: The plot thickens for Saleem Althaf, stranded in Chennai (see above). He has now been told that he can&apos;t even buy the high-price tickets, even if he could afford them. They have been reserved for new customer, he was told by a BA call centre in Dehli. &quot;The flights showing up on the website are for new passengers only as instructed by the Revenue Management Centre in London. They are not available to existing customers trying to rebook,&quot; these were words exactly Saleem says.  4pm:  I&apos;ve just been speaking with Ian Fisher and Elizabeth Atwell. Two of the Dehli 12 trying to leave the city with BA. Here&apos;s a transcript. Ian, a retired BT engineer, said:  &quot;The atmosphere in the hotel is pretty. People are leaving which give us hope. It&apos;s a better refugee camp than most, but we do feel absolutely confined.  It&apos;s galling to see other airlines getting their people out. We were told that BA is putting on extra flights to Bangkok and Dubai. I would rather have an extra two weeks in Dubai than Dehli. It is by no stretch of the imagination a holiday resort. We were due to be here for one day on the original tour. And that&apos;s about right. It&apos;s a teeming, smelly, very hot city, waiting for the rains to come. And its under the threat of terrorism. It&apos;s currently suffering the worst heat wave for 50 year. It was 42C today. We went down BA&apos;s officer today. We were left for five hours with no refreshment and more importantly no updates. We got there before noon. We were told we would have to wait an hour, then half an hour, but we weren&apos;t seen until about five. We were allowed to go to the toilet but we had to get security people to let us out. We were eventually told they could dig out one seat single. BA chose one individual from our party. The ticket is not for another two days. We are badgering BA every day. Eventually as a sop to make us go away they gave us a fax number for Willie Walsh.&quot;  Elizabeth Atwell, an A Level teacher at a west London comprehensive, said:   &quot;The situation at the airport is really quite serious. People may not be aware but there is very high terror alert in Delhi. At the airport there are armed guards everywhere. It&apos;s impossible to get into the building without a ticket for travel.  &quot;It is really difficult to talk to BA. People are paying backhanders to get into the terminal or its a very long conversation with a tour rep and then someone from BA comes over. And then you join a very long line and hope you are maybe one of the lucky people who is able to board the plane.  The last time we were at the airport there were 65 people and only two people were allowed on the plane. They were only allowed on because they were deemed emergency medical cases. Those 65 people were only the ones who had got through the airport doors. They are not the thousands outside waiting to leave Dehli.  We have been taking it in turns to get to the airport. BA are proving very conspicuous by their absence. We have been talking to the High Commissioner. My impression is that he was dismayed by the number of people trying to get out. He did seems concerned by the level of disorganisation by BA.  There seems to be no system in place to repatriate people back to Britain.&quot;   4.15pm: Liz MacNiven emails on behalf or her teenage son who is stuck on a school trip in Hong Kong, trying to prepare for his GCSEs. She writes:   &quot;There are so many of us dealing with the effects still. We don&apos;t want it to be yesterdays news. My son was on an exchange trip to Hong Kong when the volcano went up. He was due back on 17 April. He and a group of 16 teenagers are stuck there with two teachers until 4 May - -as there are not enough seats available until then.  The host school (Island School Hong Kong) have been amazing, taking the kids in and giving them personal timetables and so on.  The school here in the UK have also done everything they can, sending out work and so on. The two members of staff out there will need several medals for coping with it all when they get back. Also I have to say, I think Virgin Atlantic should be given all praise for doing their best to sort out repatriation flights. But they only have a certain number of planes. The other airlines don&apos;t seem to be doing this. Shame on them. But please don&apos;t let people forget. Just because the air space is open it&apos;s not over for so many of us. My son went away for a week and by the time he finally gets home it will have been more like a month. Goodness only knows what the effect on his GCSE&apos;s will be.&quot;   4.24pm: The Dehli 12 have grown to 24. They have copied me in on a fax they sent to BA&apos;s chief executive Willie Walsh, pleading for help. They reckon this blog has already helped two of the group to get tickets home.  Dear Mr. Walsh, We are writing to you as 24 stranded BA passengers in Delhi. We have just returned from a second fruitless expedition to your corporate offices and after three hours of waiting yesterday and six hours today, have only been allocated one seat on the 25th April flight. The remaining group members have been re-booked on flights departing on the 3rd 6th, 8th 9th and 10th May. We have sent various group members to the airport who have experienced long frustrating waits at check in stand by queues to no avail. We have yet to receive any customer service from BA and understand that you are the only airline currently operating without a priority wait-list for delayed/stranded passengers.  Furthermore, some group members are struggling financially and will be unable to pay the necessary hotel bills if we are required to stay until May.  During our six hour wait at your Delhi office today we were offered no refreshment, neither given any progress reports. To date we have received a shocking lack of support from BA, have been unable to get through to your call centres and are surprised that on line booking still appears to be offering tickets for sale. Almost any destination would be deemed an infinitely preferable place to be stranded rather than Delhi, with its current 41 degrees and official warnings of terrorist activity. We are a captive audience at the hotel. Following a Guardian Newspaper blog two of our party were miraculously found seats on the BA 256 this morning.  It is untenable to leave us stranded in Delhi for three weeks , whilst other passengers continue to fly to schedule. We hope that you will follow the example of other airlines by prioritizing the passengers stranded for the longest period of time and by providing larger and additional aircraft with immediate effect. Please help us. We are counting on your personal intervention to get us home as quickly as possible. Yours sincerely BA Passengers as listed (Names have been removed)   4.45pm: Keith Taylor emails with an interesting story from the perspective of someone not protected by those European regulations that the airlines resent so much.  &quot;Compared to many others we&apos;ve been extremely lucky in that my sister and I are stranded in New York but can afford a hotel room, and we have been rebooked on a flight home to Manchester on 25 April. Unfortunately for us we&apos;re flying with Continental, an American carrier, so we&apos;re not protected by the EU directive that will compel European airlines to reimburse travellers for the cost of accommodation. We&apos;re now about to move into our fourth hotel since our flight was cancelled on 19 April, and by the time we fly our bill will have come to around $1,600 - plus the cost of meals.  We called Continental on the 20 Arpril to rebook our flights and, after several hours of trying, finally got through to an unhelpful and disinterested woman on the reservations line. She offered us a flight home on 3 May, but when I pointed out that there were available tickets on a flight departing on 23 April she faltered, put me on hold for a minute and returned to insist that I must be mistaken. I read out the details from the Continental booking form but she continued to insist the flight didn&apos;t exist. I fluffed the story a little, claiming that we were down to our last few dollars and that we couldn&apos;t afford a hotel beyond the coming night, and at that she thawed a little and searched nearby airports for connections to Manchester. She finally found a flight into Paris Charles de Gaulle connecting to Manchester this coming Sunday, so at least we know we&apos;ll eventually get home. What gets me riled is that repatriating the stranded clearly isn&apos;t a priority for Continental, a fact that becomes more annoying every time I slump to the hotel front desk to hand over another wad of dollars I won&apos;t be seeing again.  Usually in a situation like this the disaffected passenger would grumble for a few moments before concluding with the age old &apos;Next time I&apos;ll fly with BA&apos;, but looking at the stories of BA passengers that doesn&apos;t seem appropriate this time.&quot;   (That&apos;s it from me today. Thanks for all you comments and emails. Sorry I couldn&apos;t use them all. If you are still stranded good luck getting home. They&apos;ll be more updates on our Iceland Volcano and British Airways pages).", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Air transport", "British Airways", "Airline industry", "UK news", "Travel", "Volcanoes"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-23T10:47:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/23/endangered-habitats-china", "sentences": ["\u2022 The first recorded golf club on the mainland was established in Shanghai by British expatriates in 1896.", "Players from Shanghai often competed against rivals from Hong Kong."], "title": "All the tees in China: Golf boom threatens rainforest", "article": "     The jungles of the Diaolou Mountains do not, at first sight, appear a very inviting location for a golf resort. Leeches and spiders drop through the Jeep windows as we jolt along an overgrown logger&apos;s track to reach this remote corner of Hainan, the tropical island that marks the south-eastern extremity of China. On one side lies a pristine tropical rainforest with 1,000-year-old trees; on the other, a thick tangle of bamboo, cedar and palm has reclaimed an abandoned betel nut plantation. Until now, this national park has been a rare conservation success story in China. Clouded leopards and black gibbons are among the 300 endangered species listed in this sanctuary. But while the jungle has been allowed to grow back, the park&apos;s managers have been forced to watch with frustration as neighbouring communities cash in on one of the biggest, fastest surges in property prices in the world. The value of land in Hainan has increased by between 50% and 100% since the start of the year, boosted by a government drive to turn the island into an upscale tourist resort. For the park&apos;s managers, the temptation is now too great to resist. &quot;We are sitting on a goldmine,&quot; says Zhong Guanghao, the deputy director of the forest bureau, as he exhales a plume of cigarette smoke. &quot;Within five years, we&apos;ll have at least two five-star hotels, dozens of town houses, a conference centre and a 36-hole golf club.&quot; His colleague Lu Yongquan takes me to the proposed site in a four-wheel drive that judders across mountain streams, heading so deep inside the forest that there is no mobile phone signal. &quot;This terrain is very suitable for golf. The environment is quite beautiful,&quot; says Lu, who is head of the wildlife department, as we stop to survey the thick forest where his boss wants to build a club covering 300 hectares \u2013 the size of about 300 football pitches. On the park&apos;s map, the course is inside the core conservation zone, which is supposed to be off-limits to human activity. But Lu said the government permitted experimental development areas to generate funds for wildlife protection. &quot;There will be no impact on the eco-system,&quot; he insisted. &quot;Only the elite will be able to come. It is not for the masses.&quot; The plan looks certain to stir up controversy. &quot;You would have to be greedy and heartless to build a golf course in that area,&quot; said Yang Xiaobo, a doctor of ecology at Hainan University. &quot;The biodiversity here is not just important for this island, but for the entire country. There are few rainforests like this in the world.&quot; If the plan for a resort sounds like the thin end of the wedge, it is not alone in Hainan, where golf is increasingly a tool for shifting land-usage rights towards an international jet set, often regardless of the environmental impact. A quarter of a century ago, China had just one golf course. Today, Hainan alone has almost 30 and senior officials say they want to expand that to 100 and then on to 300. This runs contrary to central government restrictions on golf development, which is seen as a threat to food security because it often eats up arable land. But Hainan claims an exemption because, officials and local businessmen argue, the island needs golf to become the Hawaii of east Asia. This is not the only motive. &quot;Golf is a real-estate driven activity primarily in China,&quot; said Shane Templeton, course consultant at Sanya Yalong Bay Golf Club. &quot;It is just a vehicle to sell property. You&apos;re not supposed to be displacing farmers. &quot;Now, obviously, there are projects that have bent the rules a little bit, but that is up to the government to control.&quot; The environmental impact goes beyond land acquisition. Established 10 years ago, Sanya Yalong is one of the oldest and best-run clubs on the island, but it still needs to fight a chemical war against Japanese cockchafers, ground pearl and other invasive pests that have been brought in with the imported soil for the greens and fairways. Golf&apos;s supporters say the amount of pesticide needed for courses is less than that applied by farmers on their crops. Groundsmen also lay plastic under the soil to ease risks of water supply contamination. But this too can cause problems if huge areas of land are covered. &quot;When there are several golf courses in close proximity, we have to be very careful about the impact on ground water \u2026 That changes the run-off,&quot; someone involved in environmental impact assessments told the Guardian. &quot;There are violations but I can&apos;t talk about them \u2026 Some projects start construction before they have gone through an environmental impact assessment.&quot; At the centre of such concerns is Mission Hills, the biggest golf development in Hainan, covering an area the size of a city. The management company already runs the biggest golf course in the world at nearby Shenzhen. Initial reports suggested the new development in Hainan would be far bigger: as many as 22 courses are talked of. After an outcry, executives are now downplaying their ambitious. They talk only of &quot;at least six courses&quot;, which are already either finished or under construction. But banners displayed around the club still boast it will be &quot;Number One in the World&quot;. It is an astonishing sight. From the terrace of the newly built clubhouse, bunkers and greens appear to stretch endlessly towards the horizon on all sides. Executives claims it is one of the world&apos;s most eco-friendly courses because it is built on volcanic scratch land at great cost. &quot;What we are doing could be the future of golf, because we are using deserted land rather than arable fields,&quot; said Jiaqi Li, the executive director. &quot;Not one family had to be moved for any of our six courses.&quot; But her claims are questioned by local people. In Changyong village on the edge of the course, residents said they have been flooded for the past two years by water than runs off of plastic sheeting under the huge course. &quot;It&apos;s had a huge impact,&quot; said Deng Zhenhe. &quot;We never had flooding in the past. Now it comes three months every year. The water comes up to our waists sometimes. Cars can&apos;t get through.&quot; At Bopian village, a crowd gathers to express their grievances. &quot;The golf club has cut down many big trees and the lychee and longan trees we used to farm. Our sheep and cows have nowhere to graze,&quot; said a man who gave only the surname Wu. &quot;I was cheated of some of my land.&quot; Mission Hills insists the correct procedures were followed. &quot;The environmental impact assessment has been completed and all the experts have put their signatures to the approval,&quot; said Li. But the Guardian has learned that concerns have been raised by inspectors about the risk to biodiversity and water systems. During the environmental impact assessment for Missions Hills, they found several rare plant species, including Ottelia cordata and Aportea sinuate, that are not found anywhere else on Hainan. In addition, they warned of a potential risk of flooding and contamination of groundwater supplies for the nearby city of Haikou. &quot;We have not finished the paperwork because of these problems,&quot; said the source involved with assessment. &quot;We have offered advice on the scale of the course and how to reduce pollution. The matter is still very sensitive.&quot; Local government officials acknowledged concerns about groundwater, but appeared to be in the dark about the scale of the golf club&apos;s expansion. &quot;Mission Hills has completed environmental assessment and received proper permission for only one course,&quot; said Cai Qiao, director of the Haikou tourism development committee. &quot;I&apos;m sure they have completed only one course, not three.&quot; As he spoke, golfers were putting and driving on the finished courses and bulldozers were clearing the way for three more. Hollywood stars are lined up for a celebrity tournament for the opening in October and, by next autumn, the club expects to host the World Cup of golf. Permission is taken for granted. Golf in China: the hole story \u2022 A game similar to golf was played in China more than 500 years before the sport in its modern form was started in Scotland. Jade-and-gold clubs were used in &quot;chuwan&quot;, according to sketches and writings dating back to the Tang dynasty (960-1279). \u2022 The first recorded golf club on the mainland was established in Shanghai by British expatriates in 1896. The nine-hole course sat on what is now People&apos;s Square. Players from Shanghai often competed against rivals from Hong Kong. \u2022 After Mao Zedong&apos;s Communists came to power in 1949, golf was condemned as a bourgeois imperialist sport and the few courses closed. \u2022 In the modern era of opening and reform, the first course was constructed in 1984. This was followed by such a rash of golf development that the government grew concerned about the loss of arable land and tried to impose restrictions. \u2022 Today, there are an estimated 600 courses in China, many of which dodge the regulations by claiming to be landscaping projects or vaguely defined property developments. With golf due to become an Olympic sport by 2016, its popularity is expected to grow. Last year, Jack Nicklaus reportedly claimed the country was planning to build 1,400 public courses over the next five years.", "tags": ["Endangered habitats", "Environment", "China", "Endangered species", "World news", "Trees and forests", "Deforestation", "Conservation", "Golf", "Sport", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-23T16:44:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/25/jenson-button-formula-one-big-guns", "sentences": ["After being overtaken by the faster Alonso as the pair entered the pits in Shanghai, Felipe Massa knows exactly what Alonso thinks about him and it is obviously not very much.", "He finished 11th, second and fourth in the first three races and looked in line for more points in Shanghai before the introduction of the safety car allowed Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso, driving superior cars, to dart past him.", "Tony Fernandes was the most popular team principal in Shanghai \u2013 as the owner of Air Asia he was able to help out not only his own team but others stranded by the flight chaos caused by the volcanic ash."], "title": "Jenson Button on top in battle of the F1 big guns", "article": "Even Monte Carlo or Bust, with Tony Curtis and Terry-Thomas, was a less wacky race than we saw in China last weekend. The shoot-out has left the championship looking wide open and the internecine power struggles within each team are just as compelling as the broader competition. Geoff Brabham, son of the three-times world champion Jack, once said: &quot;Motor racing is 99% boredom and 1% terror.&quot; Well, we have seen little boredom yet, certainly not since that donkey derby beside the sands of Bahrain. Rain has blessed three of the four events so far, creating more overtaking and less predictability; not one of the four pole winners has won a race. At each of the big four teams, though, one driver has already developed an ascendancy over the other that may remain in place for the rest of the season. This is less certainly the case at McLaren, who lead the constructors&apos; championship and whose drivers are first and fourth. The early season clearly belongs to Jenson Button, the world champion, with wins in Melbourne as well as China. Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, has produced the more thrilling drives (of McLaren&apos;s 39 successful overtaking manoeuvres this season the 2008 champion has been responsible for 32). The relationship between the two drivers is a good one but Hamilton has been shaken by Button&apos;s smoothness, not just in his driving but by the way he has become a popular and successful member of the team in such a short space of time. Looking at the two after the race, with Button wearing the bright orange T-shirt along with mechanics as Hamilton looked a man alone in his race overalls, one could almost imagine the latter was the new boy needing to fit in. Button has not only had the better results but outqualified Hamilton on three occasions. These are two evenly matched drivers. It is too simplistic to portray Button as the cerebral one and Hamilton as the dasher. Button is also sensationally fast as his karting career, which was just as impressive as Hamilton&apos;s, clearly illustrated. Neither is Hamilton an unthinking competitor, but he is five years younger. He is also more dependent on team advice. This places some pressure on McLaren, who are anxious to be even-handed but who have also made some bad calls for their younger driver. If Button&apos;s success continues, McLaren must be concerned about how it could impact on the managerless Hamilton, who is still stalked by stories of a falling\u2011out with his father. Red Bull, meanwhile, are trying to come to terms with the fact that they have the quickest car but are trailing third in the championship. The Renault-powered RB6s have taken all four poles, three for Sebastian Vettel and one for Mark Webber. They also produced a memorable one-two in Malaysia. But they have been let down, first by mechanical fragility and, in China, by some ordinary decision-making in terms of their tyres. Vettel and Webber have had their moments in the past but the relationship is basically a good one. Vettel is the faster driver, something that cannot come easily to Webber, who is older by 11 years. Vettel started the season as the bright young driver on the grid after such an impressive finish to last year, when Red Bull scored more points than they had done in their previous four seasons put together. But there is now pressure on the young German, who started on pole and finished sixth in China. He produced a great qualifying performance but, when it came to the race itself, he quickly fell behind Webber, who damaged the team&apos;s jack and his front wing at a pit stop. There is every chance that the pre-season favourite, Fernando Alonso, will burst through in his home country in the next race, where Ferrari will run several upgrades. After being overtaken by the faster Alonso as the pair entered the pits in Shanghai, Felipe Massa knows exactly what Alonso thinks about him and it is obviously not very much. But the man having the most difficult time of all among the big teams is Michael Schumacher at Mercedes. He has been outqualified and outraced by Nico Rosberg. The saddest sight in China was surely that of Schumacher being overtaken by the rookie Vitaly Petrov in an inferior Renault car. Schumacher and Rosberg claim their relationship is good but Schumacher is smarting. The battle to break out of midfield Kubica catches the eye in Renault&apos;s rapid revival The battle for the middle positions \u2013 like the race for fourth in the Premier League \u2013 is almost as interesting as what is happening at the top of the table. Mercedes are the Liverpool of F1. Everybody included the team in their top four for the new season, but they could have a fight to finish fourth, their current position, after a surprisingly flat return from Michael Schumacher. The best performance from the midfield has come from Renault, and, particularly, from Robert Kubica. Mercedes must wonder how well they would be doing if they had Kubica alongside Nico Rosberg. Adrian Sutil has also impressed at Force India. Kubica has been so outstanding that Renault may now have a battle to retain the Pole&apos;s services and it is understood Ferrari have the driver in mind if they decide not to re-sign Felipe Massa, who has been largely disappointing despite leading the championship after three rounds. After last year&apos;s chaos, this has been an impressive turnaround by Renault, despite retirements in the first three races for Vitaly Petrov, who scored his first points by finishing seventh in China after starting 14th. But Kubica has been the star. He finished 11th, second and fourth in the first three races and looked in line for more points in Shanghai before the introduction of the safety car allowed Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso, driving superior cars, to dart past him. Force India are sixth in the constructors&apos; championship after some impressive drives from Sutil, but team-mate Vitantonio Liuzzi has had a tough time. He cannot keep blaming traffic for dismal performances in qualifying and he is coming under increasing pressure from the gifted British driver Paul di Resta, who has been given the chance to impress in practice. Williams, in seventh, failed to score for the first time in China and the great times of the 80s and 90s can never have felt more remote but the experience of Rubens Barrichello and the promise of Nico Hulkenberg is a good combination. It has been a difficult start for Toro Rosso despite Jaime Alguersuari&apos;s improvement, while Sauber have yet to score a point and the Swiss team do not look like doing so. The new boys at the back of the grid Slow progress, but a pointless exercise so far There should have been 26 cars out there but the collapse of USF1, after what appeared to be a solid preparation, was a surprise. But three new teams still brought a frisson of anticipation to the new season. The return of Lotus, one of the most evocative names in the sport, was a boost for everyone\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and how would HRT fare against two\u00a0Virgins? Four races into the new season and there have been more retirements than you would find in an old people&apos;s home. But there have been little triumphs too, especially for Lotus and HRT, though Virgin have been a disappointment. Lotus, with the strongest driving team among the new boys, in Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen, and also the experienced Mike Gascoyne as technical director, have been the most impressive, although in common with the other two teams they have not picked up a point yet. Kovalainen remained on slicks and was up there with the big boys for a while in China, before finishing 14th and he also drove impressively in qualifying in Malaysia, to make it to Q2. Tony Fernandes was the most popular team principal in Shanghai \u2013 as the owner of Air Asia he was able to help out not only his own team but others stranded by the flight chaos caused by the volcanic ash. He used a charter to fly his team back on Wednesday and that means Lotus, unlike some, are confident of having their substantial upgrades ready for Barcelona. HRT&apos;s biggest triumph was to get to the grid in the first place, since their cars were nothing more than a pile of dusty pieces three weeks before the first race. After disappointment in Bahrain Karun Chandhok and Bruno Senna have produced steady \u2013 and brave \u2013 performances. Of the new teams, the Virgin, designed with a fuel tank too small to allow it to finish a race, appears to be the worst prepared, but Timo Glock looks a real talent. Technical director Nick Wirth has promised major improvements for Barcelona.

Noi Shanghai  is a collective formed in April 2004 from the ashes of performance group Junkyard, and their aim is to make music so dissonant, deafening and dangerous that you&apos;ll be running screaming back to your chillwave collection in no time.  Under the guidance of multi-instrumentalist and visual artist Cao Jian Jun (known in the city as Junkyy) Torturing Nurse are the leaders of the group. Using out of tune guitars, broken turntables and the screams of gaffa taped bodies, they make a noise music so feral it makes their inspirations \u2013 including the father of &quot;anti-record&quot; Emil Beaulieau \u2013 seem squeaky clean in comparison. So far, they have produced 194 CDR records with varying lineups, featuring some of the most imaginative names we have ever heard. Assholemouthead, anyone? How about some Orgasm Denial? Or maybe you want to check out the Stalin and Mao Listen to Us Compilation? Despite the sanctions placed on them by the Chinese government, they have sold copies of their records in the UK, US, Belgium and Italy, as well as back home.  If you think the records are extreme, wait until you see them live. Men wearing pyjamas tie each other into bags, secure mic-ed up bodies to tables and tie naked members of the band to chairs. In one local show, Australian artist Justice Yeldham of affiliate group Noiseconcrete played a piece of glass before cutting himself with it, which certainly brings a new meaning to the phrase &quot;suffering for your art&quot;. Unsurprisingly, the group struggle to find performance spaces, having been blacklisted by a number of the city&apos;s traditional venues. But it&apos;s not all S&amp;M and bodily fluids. Even squeamish fans might be tempted by duo Jedung Kying, who embrace internet collaboration as much as any blog buzz band. They transfer files between Shanghai and Guangzhou to create dirty drum&apos;n&apos;bass, while fans of doom rock should try the Diamanda Galas and Acid Mothers Temple inspired Walnut Room. Their churning soundscape might be dizzying but it&apos;s also an entrancing listen. Yet perhaps the best proof that the Chinese underground is still keeping it weird is Junkyy&apos;s rejection of alt-god Thurston Moore in 2008. Moore&apos;s still the go-to man for the &quot;indie rock seal of approval&quot;, yet when he sang Torturing Nurse&apos;s praises following Sonic Youth&apos;s trip to China, this one-man whirlwind wasn&apos;t impressed. &quot;I don&apos;t like him or his band. They are too rock&apos;n&apos;roll. I don&apos;t care if he&apos;s a fan. What we do is totally different,&quot; Junkky said in an interview with SH Magazine.

That no French establishment made it into the list of the world&apos;s top 10 best restaurants this year initially left food critics in Paris lost for words. Two days after the San Pellegrino list of the planet&apos;s best eateries was unveiled in London, the Gallic heavyweights fought back today, questioning the methodology of the selection process and dismissing the entire classification as idiotic. In a signed editorial for Le Figaro, the esteemed food critic Fran\u00e7ois Simon said the very idea of choosing the world&apos;s best restaurants had been rendered absurd by the variety of contemporary cooking. &quot;Can one declare an excellent cr\u00eaperie to be better than a delicious couscous restaurant (or a sushi place, a [Vietnamese] pho cafe, a trattoria ...)? How silly to try to carve that in stone,&quot; he wrote, adding, in a sideswipe at the list&apos;s UK origins: &quot;And yet our friends, who rarely cross their own borders, have just published this idiotic classification.&quot; The annual ranking, which is published in conjunction with the trade magazine Restaurant, seeks to keep track of world trends by asking over 800 jury members to vote for their favourite eatery of the year. The top 10 in the 2010 list featured four Spanish restaurants, three American, one Italian, one British and one Danish \u2013 Noma, the winner, in Copenhagen. Six French eateries were sprinkled further down in the top 50, led by Le Chateaubriand, chef Inaki Aizpitarte&apos;s Parisian bistro, at No 11. Not even this achievement, however, brought relief to the furrowed brows of the French. While saluting the bold efforts of the maverick Aizpitarte, Simon lashed out at the &quot;total surrealism&quot; of his restaurant being placed ahead of those of triple Michelin-starred chefs Alain Ducasse and Jo\u00ebl Robuchon. L&apos;Express magazine&apos;s food critic, Fran\u00e7ois-R\u00e9gis Gaudry, expressed surprise that the talented &quot;national bad boy&quot; had seen off the &quot;tricolour tenors&quot;. &quot;In truth this spectacular promotion hides questionable methods,&quot; he wrote in an open letter to the list&apos;s organisers. Explaining that he would be &quot;taking his leave&quot; after five years on the jury, Gaudry said the methodology behind the voting was too lax. &quot;I have ... become convinced that your business ... is the result of a dubious operation skilfully disguised as an infallible measurement of global gastronomy,&quot; he wrote, adding that the &quot;yo-yoing&quot; of certain names up and down the list each year was proof that they were no more than a reflection of media fads. P\u00e9rico Legass\u00e9, the food critic of Marianne magazine, added to the chorus of complaint, describing the top 50 list as a media-driven marketing operation. &quot;It is as if the boules association of La Corneuve awarded the L\u00e9gion d&apos;honneur,&quot; he said. Nathan Garnett, a spokesman for Restaurant magazine, defended the rankings, saying they were less a &quot;definitive&apos; line-up than a &quot;snapshot in time ... reflecting changing patterns&quot; in global cuisine. The French, he added, should be proud that six of their restaurants made the top 50. &quot;I know it&apos;s hard for them to see a positive in the list but if you compare France to the UK, we have three [restaurants]. And if you compare it with the United States ... you can see that France is actually hitting above its weight.&quot; His words were mere crumbs of comfort to a bruised national ego. &quot;We had already been ... relegated each year to the depths of the Shanghai international universities ranking.

Officials in Taixing told a press conference earlier that police had detained a 47-year-old suspect, Xu Yuyuan. They said his motive was unclear. The assault came one day after a knife-wielding man injured 16 pupils and a teacher at a southern Chinese primary school in Leizhou city, Guangdong. The suspect being held is a teacher from another school who was reportedly on sick leave due to mental health problems. A hospital official has told Xinhua that five of his victims were seriously injured but stable. There are fears that reports are sparking copycat attacks. Yesterday saw the execution of a man for stabbing eight children to death and seriously wounding five others at a school in Fujian province last month. The murders were described as a revenge attack on a society that Zheng Minsheng believed had let him down.

Pi said assaults on police increased after a 2008 case in which a Shanghai man killed six officers. The criminologist suggested restrained media reporting and improved school security could help prevent further attacks. But he added: &quot;Creating a platform for people to express their complaints is also very important. If the authorities they go to are unresponsive and they find no channel for expression they will explode eventually.&quot; The state news agency Xinhua reported recently that the education ministry ordered kindergartens, primary and high schools to upgrade security in the wake of the first attack in Fujian.

Officials in Weifang city said the victims&apos; wounds were not life-threatening and they were in stable condition. Twenty-nine young children were injured when a knife-wielding man attacked their kindergarten class in Taixing, Jiangsu province, yesterday. Officials said that two pupils and three adults were seriously wounded, while early reports and some parents suggested some pupils had died. The day before, 15 students and an adult were injured when another man attacked them with a knife at their school in Guangdong province. Chinese media appeared to be playing down yesterday&apos;s assault in Jiangsu province. The incidents seem to be copycat attacks following last month&apos;s killing of eight children at a school in Fujian province \u2013 for which a man was executed on Wednesday \u2013 and experts have warned coverage could spark further cases. The Danwei website published a notice that it said had been distributed to editors at the major internet portal Sina, warning them to use only reports from state news agency Xinhua when covering the Jiangsu case, citing orders from &quot;higher levels&quot;. The instructions added: &quot;In light of the World Expo opening, this news shall not be placed on the front page for the time being.&quot; Shanghai is holdinga lavish ceremony attended by world leaders tonight to launch its six-month-long Expo, which opens to the public tomorrow. A reported $45bn (\u00a329.3bn) has been spent overhauling the city. With public concern growing about the attacks, officials and experts urged schools to strengthen security. In Beijing, police will patrol schools as students arrive and leave, the China Daily reported, while some headteachers are insisting parents pick up their children. In one district, guards are being issued with forked staves to fend off assailants. Many in China are turning their attention to what lay behind the violence, with several pointing to inadequate treatment for mental illness and anger at inequality and social injustice. The 46-year-old unemployed man held for yesterday&apos;s attack in Jiangsu province reportedly told police he was seeking &quot;revenge on society&quot;. Zhu Li, a professor with the school of social and behavioural sciences at Nanjing University, told the China Daily that more needed to be done to care for people at the bottom of society. &quot;If they get desperate and can&apos;t get help from others, like mental guidance and physical support from families or community workers, it&apos;s possible for them to do something with serious consequences,&quot; he said. Zhang Changrong, a professor with the Fujian provincial police academy, said more skills training and support for the unemployed and better treatment for those with mental illness could &quot;to some degree, prevent such vulnerable groups from resorting to hurting others&quot;. The man executed this week for killing the children in Fujian, was said to have a history of mental health problems, as did the attacker in the Guangdong case. Liu Baofeng, a mental health specialist, stressed that it was unusual for people who were mentally ill to attack others, but said such cases were more likely to catch the public&apos;s attention and cause panic. He added that mental illness was a growing problem in China, as people struggled to adjust to massive social changes, and that many people did not get the treatment they needed \u2013 either because of the stigma associated with the problem, or because services were inadequate or they could not afford them. Shrinking households also meant it was harder for families to support relatives. A survey published this week in the China Daily, based on interviews with 113 million adults across China, found that 17.5% had some form of mental health problem but many did not receive treatment. The survey showed that in Shandong less than 11% of those affected had received treatment, and in Qinghai \u2013 which has 5.5m inhabitants but only one hospital treating mental disorders, according to the newspaper \u2013 only 3% had seen doctors.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-30T09:15:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/30/shanghai-world-expo-2010-launch", "sentences": ["After eight years preparing, Shanghai is launching the biggest Expo so far with a lavish show of lights and fireworks.", "The Shanghai Expo 2010 features everything from palm trees from Saudi Arabia to Rodin sculptures from France \u2013 perhaps a bid by Paris to rival Denmark, which has brought its Little Mermaid statue from Copenhagen harbour.", "&quot;Shanghai&apos;s hosting of the World Expo is the pride of all Chinese people,&quot; Hu told a delegation from Taiwan, according to China&apos;s state media.", "A reported $45bn has been spent overhauling Shanghai for the event \u2013 more than Beijing spent for the Olympics \u2013 with new airport terminals, hundreds of miles of subway line and a revamp of its historic waterfront, the Bund.", "The Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network said officials have detained, harassed or placed under surveillance activists, intellectuals and petitioners across Shanghai and surrounding areas.", "Last month 6,000 people were detained in Shanghai in what officials described as a drive against &quot;theft, gambling, prostitution and selling pornographic materials&quot;.", "Shanghai residents have begun thronging areas nearby in the hope of catching the best of the fireworks display."], "title": "Shanghai Expo 2010: Tight security as city prepares for opening", "article": "After eight years preparing, Shanghai is launching the biggest Expo so far with a lavish show of lights and fireworks.

With security precautions at their height tonight, thousands of police are on duty, guards have been stationed at thousands of bus stops and 8,000 firefighters are on alert. But campaigners say the event has also brought a crackdown on dissent. The Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network said officials have detained, harassed or placed under surveillance activists, intellectuals and petitioners across Shanghai and surrounding areas. One target has been those who have protested over the forced demolition of their homes to make way for the Expo site. According to official estimates, 18,000 households have been knocked down. In a statement the CHRD urged: &quot;The government must stop the practice of placing &apos;troublemaking&apos; individuals under surveillance and restricting their movements on &apos;sensitive&apos; occasions. These individuals should not be punished for exercising their freedom of expression or their right to defend human rights.&quot; Similar pressure was put on activists ahead of the Olympics. Last month 6,000 people were detained in Shanghai in what officials described as a drive against &quot;theft, gambling, prostitution and selling pornographic materials&quot;. In the runup to the event officials have also cleared many vendors off the streets and even ordered residents not to wear their pyjamas outside their homes, as some have become used to doing. The Expo site, which spans both banks of the Huangpu river, is more than twice the size of Monaco at 5.3 sq km (1,310 acres).

Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace, which housed the Great Exhibition of 1851. Photograph: Philip Henry Delamotte/Dominic Winter Auctions/PA    The concept is endearing, yet expos are as much about popular entertainment as they are to do with philosophy or subliminal experiences. This doesn&apos;t mean they have to be banal. They do, though, need to engage the imagination of enormous, queuing crowds. Perhaps the problem is that, like so many expos of the past two decades, architectural pavilions have become self-referential artworks. This might be fine in an art show, but not, perhaps, here. The very first world expo \u2013 the Great Exhibition of 1851 \u2013 offered a mind-blowing building, Joseph Paxton&apos;s Crystal Palace, that happened to be filled to its iron and glass gunwhales with all sorts of things from gothic revival cabinets to the latest machinery via high Victorian kitsch. Offering a comprehensive snapshot of mid-century British commercial culture, the building itself was truly revolutionary. Another famous expo, that in Paris in 1889, featured an equally breathtaking building, the vast Machine Hall, designed by the architect Charles Dutert and the engineer Victor Contamin, which was chock-full of the very latest technological wonders. Mobile platforms, guided by rails, took 100,000 visitors a day on a journey above the machines that would shape the following century. Decades later, even such determinedly experimental and &quot;artistic&quot; expo pavilions as the one Le Corbusier and Iannis Xenakis designed for Philips at Brussels in 1958, offered magical experiences once inside. An &quot;Electronic Poem&quot;, a kind of hyper-sophisticated son-et-lumi\u00e8re, animated the interior of this unexpected hyperbolic-paraboloid concrete tent. If challenging, the experience had been worth queuing up for. Expos are not art shows.

An emergency summit of the 16 leaders of the countries using the single currency was held in Brussels , with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France demanding tougher and quicker regulation of the financial markets in what looked like a doomed attempt to contain contagion from the Greek drama. One factor being discussed last night was to persuade the ECB to launch a new quantitative easing policy \u2013 entailing huge loans to distressed governments in the form of buying up their bonds. This is supported by the European Commission, Spain, Portugal, Italy and France, but is certain to run into German opposition. With the pace of developments outstripping the ability of political leaders to respond, what was initially called as a summit to bless a \u20ac110bn (\u00a395bn) rescue package for Greece turned into a frantic exercise in global crisis management. Alarm bells were ringing in major capitals across the world where leaders voiced their exasperation with European attempts to contain the fallout from Greece. In what may have been Alistair Darling&apos;s last part in trying to manage international financial turbulence, the chancellor took part in a phone conference of G7 finance ministers discussing the implications for the international bond markets of the Greek debt debacle. Australia&apos;s prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was scathing about the EU package for Greece over three years agreed last weekend by 15 eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund: &quot;Markets have judged those arrangements to be inadequate,&quot; he said . &quot;This is a global issue,&quot; Japan&apos;s deputy finance minister, Rintaro Tamaki, told Bloomberg news agency. &quot;All the financial markets are now in turmoil \u2026 The impact of the Greek crisis has gone beyond the euro area.&quot; There were also mounting concerns that the exposure of banks to sovereign debt throughout Europe risks destabilising a financial system that was bailed out by government across the world little more than a year ago. In Germany, the key European player in the crisis, parliament agreed to the highly unpopular bailout, voting for more than \u20ac22bn in emergency loans to Athens. While pleading for the funds, Merkel has rounded furiously on the markets. After stating earlier this week that &quot;politics have to reassert primacy over the financial markets&quot;, she said that the &quot;speculators are our opponents&quot; and described the banks as &quot;perfidious&quot;. Describing politicians as being in battle with the markets, she added: &quot;Like all my other colleagues, I want to win this fight.&quot; But borrowing costs for Spain and Portugal rose to their highest levels, a day after the euro sank to its lowest against the dollar for more than a year. Merkel and Sarkozy, while frequently at odds, demanded that tonight&apos;s summit consider moves to impose tougher penalties on eurozone countries breaking the fiscal rules and for greater peer review of each other&apos;s budgets. They reserved their strongest criticism for the markets and the credit rating agencies which they blamed for making a bad situation worse. &quot;Market reactions during the last few days have amplified the crisis and provoked very large swings in the yields of some euro-area member states&apos; sovereign bonds not aligned with the development of fundamentals,&quot; they said. &quot;In the light of last week&apos;s events, a review should explicitly refer to the rating process for sovereign debts, to communication methods and the publication of rating changes, taking into account the possible role of credit rating agencies in amplifying the crisis and their impact on financial stability. Potential actions should include stricter standards under European law.&quot; Some efforts of European leadersto contain the crisis have been undermined by objections from taxpayers and ties to Greece through the banking system. Five German academics today vowed to pursue court action against the Merkel government for wasting taxpayers&apos; funds in the bailout. They are believed to represent a swath of German public opinion already angry at the billions of euros spent bailing out local banks. However, French, German and Swiss banks are the largest holders of Greek and Spanish debt. If Greek bonds lose value, or the bailout fails and Greece is ejected from the eurozone, the French and German governments would again be forced to bail out their banks with taxpayer funds. This threat to European banks has already prompted anxiety about their ability to repay loans. Most financial institutions, including UK banks, are still recapitalising their balance sheets and building up their cash deposits after the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008 brought the financial system to its knees. Many of their deposits are held in government bonds. If the ratings on government debt continues to fall it not only affects the government&apos;s themselves but also the banks holding the debt. Capital Economics said the situation was delicately balanced and could become &quot;devastating&quot;: &quot;So far, the crisis in Greece has not caused the money markets to freeze up. But if this situation were to change, the impact on risky asset prices could be devastating and derail the fragile global economic recovery. Policymakers know this only too well after the events of September 2008.&quot; Cracks have already begun to appear in the system. The cost of insuring against a default by banks in the euro-zone has risen sharply in recent days. Europe&apos;s sovereign debt crisis is making it harder for European banks to get their hands on dollars and may require their central banks to step in with short-term liquidity to keep up the flow of money through Europe&apos;s economy. Market commentators have asked if the Greek government is strong enough to push through austerity measures demanded by the IMF and eurozone countries, hinting that ejection from the euro area remains a possible outcome. Riots and strikes in Greece could be repeated in other countries which have yet to adopt their own austerity packages.", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Financial crisis", "Market turmoil", "Greece", "Germany", "France", "Dow Jones", "FTSE", "Euro", "European banks", "Angela Merkel", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "Spain", "Alistair Darling", "Business", "UK news", "World news", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-07T18:44:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/07/michael-schumacher-spanish-grand-prix1", "sentences": ["The seven-times world champion had looked distinctly ordinary in the first three races of the season following his three-year sabbatical, and even less than that in his last outing in Shanghai three weeks ago, which bordered on the embarrassing."], "title": "Modified Mercedes brings Michael Schumacher's confidence roaring back", "article": "Michael Schumacher finally showed some of his old verve here today and the other 23 Formula One drivers looked as though they had seen a ghost. The seven-times world champion had looked distinctly ordinary in the first three races of the season following his three-year sabbatical, and even less than that in his last outing in Shanghai three weeks ago, which bordered on the embarrassing. But in the two practice sessions before Sunday&apos;s Spanish grand prix he produced the third fastest time, behind the McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button in the morning and the Red Bulls of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber in the afternoon. Schumacher, 41, has finished behind his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in all four races and been beaten 4-0 in the Saturday qualifying sessions. But now Rosberg was back in sixth and seventh places. Practice sessions are notoriously misleading but it was a smiling and content-looking Schumacher who waved to the crowd after completing the second session in his modified car. It has a longer wheelbase and more downforce on the front end, which is the way the German likes to drive. &quot;It is certainly feeling a lot more like a race car in my hands,&quot; he said. &quot;In China, I didn&apos;t fully understand what was happening, but I have worked very well with my engineers and the team, and we have made some improvements to the car. &quot;It&apos;s not about confidence. It is about the car going where I want it to. There is a clear upward trend. I have stability to work the car to my needs and that is what I was looking for. &quot;If people say I look a lot happier and bouncier this weekend then that reflects where I was before. I have only had this car for a brief time in Rockingham but with the car right now, we have the ability to work it in the directions that I was looking for and that wasn&apos;t possible before. &quot;I am feeling a lot more confident in what the car is doing for me and it confirmed that what happened in China \u2013 whatever glitch it was \u2013 was something wrong with the car. Now we are back to normal.&quot; With an improved car, however, and one made to his specific requests by Ross Brawn, the man behind his title successes at Benetton and Ferrari, there is extra pressure on Schumacher. With the car he wants, more or less, it will be possible to strip him down like an errant engine and view his own failings with greater precision; the excuses are running out. No one will blame him, however, if he is beaten by the Red Bulls. &quot;We are still far, far behind Red Bull \u2013 as much as eight-tenths \u2013 and that is too much,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a huge gap. On one hand, I feel much more comfortable in the car and it feels more like a racing car for me, but on the other hand, we are still a long way off Red Bull.&quot; In an interview earlier this week Schumacher said: &quot;I&apos;m pretty much where I expected to be. I&apos;m not a dreamer who believes I can just cancel out three years, jump in and kick everybody&apos;s arse. That wasn&apos;t my idea. It will take time to feel as confident as I used to.&quot; Hamilton dominated the morning session and was more than half a second ahead of the second-placed Button, who like Schumacher was most impressed by the Red Bulls. &quot;The Red Bulls look quick, whatever fuel they were running, which is a shame,&quot; Button said. &quot;It&apos;s horrible to say but I think they might be untouchable this weekend for anyone.&quot;", "tags": ["Michael Schumacher", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-07T18:50:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/08/mclaren-jenson-button-lewis-hamilton", "sentences": ["The Catalan splendour of Barcelona is so remote from the economic bull that is the city of Shanghai that you have to keep your eyes wide shut to see the similarities, but as Formula One prepared for its return to Europe this weekend Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren&apos;s team principal, must have thought nothing had changed."], "title": "Martin Whitmarsh believes Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button can dominate", "article": "The Catalan splendour of Barcelona is so remote from the economic bull that is the city of Shanghai that you have to keep your eyes wide shut to see the similarities, but as Formula One prepared for its return to Europe this weekend Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren&apos;s team principal, must have thought nothing had changed. His two drivers, Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton, dominated the morning practice session here in much the same way as they dominated the last race in China three weeks ago and those who questioned the wisdom of Whitmarsh&apos;s very British coup are being forced to make a pit stop to change their judgments. &quot;We haven&apos;t done everything right and we haven&apos;t had the quickest car but after four races the championship is within our grasp,&quot; the McLaren boss said. &quot;Already, it&apos;s been a fantastic season. We need to make our car quicker in Spain. And then we go straight to Monaco for a very different kind of race, the jewel in the crown \u2013 we&apos;ve won there 15 times, which no other team can match.&quot; But Whitmarsh&apos;s satisfaction is something deeper than the mere pleasure in seeing McLaren and Button lead the constructors&apos; and drivers&apos; championship despite their failure to match the sheer pace of the marauding Red Bulls. It is the successful union of the last two world champions that has delighted him. &quot;We are still in the honeymoon period and these things can go wrong,&quot; he warned. &quot;They&apos;re massively competitive individuals, so ingredients for strife are there. They will always want to beat each other. The first person you want to beat is your team-mate. But the relationship between the two drivers is good. &quot;People will always try to be cynical in this sport. But when Jenson won the last race Lewis went up to him spontaneously and hugged him. No amount of spin or PR from us is going to create that. We are in the unusual position of having two of the best drivers in the world, who are both young, disturbingly good-looking chaps with star quality.&quot; This is the year in which a general election, Steve Davis and F1 all became genuinely interesting. At the heart of a compelling F1 season is the closeness of the McLaren, Red Bull and Ferrari cars, with Mercedes surely likely to become more competitive through the genius of Ross Brawn. But it is the subplots that created even more interest: the return of Michael Schumacher, the excellence of Adrian Sutil at Force India and Robert Kubica at Renault and the three new teams. The pairing of Button and Lewis, however, has created a greater frisson of anticipation than anything else and the season has not disappointed. It was Button&apos;s drive in Brazil last year that convinced Whitmarsh that he should bring the driver to the Woking-based team. &quot;It was such an impressive performance. He was under massive pressure to win the world championship. The McLaren and Red Bull cars had overhauled him with quicker cars at that point. &quot;But despite that he drove an assertive and competitive race and that was the turning point for me. It made me decide that we should try to secure him as a race driver in our team, so I rang him. &quot;A lot of people thought it was the wrong thing for McLaren to do. A lot of people thought it was the wrong thing for Jenson to do. When people tell you you&apos;re wrong and you still do it you feel delighted when it works out. &quot;To be honest, I thought he would stay with his existing team. He had been with them for a while. They had just won the world championship together. But after Brazil \u2026 &quot;We didn&apos;t particularly want two British drivers. We had never had it before. Our mission is to win races and have the best drivers we can get. It just happened that the best two drivers we could get were Brits.&quot; But could there be a problem if Button&apos;s car continues to finish in front of Hamilton&apos;s, the most committed and brilliant racer on the grid? After a sensational start to his F1 career it has been a difficult time for Hamilton. &quot;Spygate&quot; was followed by &quot;Liegate&quot; and, more recently, allegations of a rift between the driver and his father. Hamilton is not only five years younger than Button but does not share the latter&apos;s almost serene ability to appear relaxed and easy-going when under intense pressure. And while Hamilton often appears a man alone Button is surrounded by his girlfriend, father, manager and friends. Whitmarsh does not see a problem. &quot;Jenson isn&apos;t dominating. He&apos;s leading the championship but on the track there isn&apos;t a dominance. Jenson and Lewis are very closely matched. &quot;Jenson has developed as a driver. His first ever drive in an F1 car was in a McLaren. He&apos;s an incredibly gifted and smooth driver. &quot;Lewis&apos;s great strength is that he&apos;s an aggressive, assertive racing driver. Jenson has five years&apos; experience on Lewis and has made some great calls and measured it well. But Lewis is a tough competitor and he will be planning to come back and beat Jenson in the next race. It&apos;s an exciting dynamic and it drives the team on.&quot; We are still waiting for that wheel-to-wheel Ben-Hur coming together of the two drivers this season. But Whitmarsh insists that they have been given permission to race each other. &quot;When we held a one-two position in China it was very tempting to tell them to just hang on and back off. We were all taking chances. But if Lewis had caught Jenson we trusted them to be sensible and respectful of one another.&quot;", "tags": ["McLaren", "Lewis Hamilton", "Jenson Button", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-08T09:59:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/08/mark-webber-spanish-grand-prix", "sentences": ["The pace of the cars was an even bigger talking point than the reappearance of volcanic dust, which has led to the closure of a number of airports in Spain, including Barcelona \u2013 the neurotic, and there are plenty of them in this sport, might think that the cloud is haunting Formula One after the difficulty in getting out of Shanghai three weeks ago."], "title": "'Crazy quick' Mark Webber on pole at the Spanish Grand Prix", "article": "There was an atmosphere that came close to resignation in the McLaren camp of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton at the Circuit de Catalunya after yet another withering display of pace and power from the Red Bulls of Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel. The pair had once again dominated the qualifying session and will start on the front of the grid for today&apos;s Spanish Grand Prix. Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren&apos;s team principal, said last night: &quot;Red Bull will have to make some mistakes if we&apos;re going to challenge them tomorrow.&quot; Button, the world champion and current leader in the points standings, was just as gloomy. &quot;We will have to get into them into turn one, otherwise I think it might be difficult to get a win here,&quot; was his simple assessment. They love bull-fighting in Spain but this contest was a little too one-sided in favour of the bulls to excite the locals, whose own hero Fernando Alonso will start from fourth. Hamilton will start in third place but he was 0.8 seconds adrift of Webber&apos;s pace and he said afterwards: &quot;The Red Bulls are ridiculously fast. They have more downforce and efficiency than the other teams. They are crazy quick.&quot; Button will start in fifth place, between Alonso and the rejuvenated Michael Schumacher, who qualified ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg for the first time this season. The two Germans will be separated on the grid by the Renault of Robert Kubica. This was the fifth time in five races this year that a Red Bull has taken pole position and the third time that the team has put both cars on the front row. It was Webber&apos;s second pole of the season and the third of his career. The fact that the pole winner has won the last nine grands prix at the Circuit de Catalunya hardly encourages optimism for a memorable race, though rain is once again in the air and could help to spice up the spectacle on a track ill-suited to close racing in modern F1 cars. But if it stays dry it could be something of a procession and there was almost a forlorn tone in Hamilton&apos;s voice when he said: &quot;We are not going to challenge them unless they do something wrong.&quot; The Red Bulls enjoyed an easy dominance of the first two sections of qualifying and nothing changed in Q3, with Webber beating Vettel on all three occasions, though the German did briefly take top spot shortly before the end of the decisive session. Webber said: &quot;Christian Horner [the Red Bull team principal] said you won&apos;t get to drive a car like this around here too often, so go and enjoy it, and I did. Sebastian has a good record against me in qualifying. It&apos;s always very close but it&apos;s not like he&apos;s six or seven tenths down the road, so it was nice today to get it back my way. But it&apos;s great for the team to have both of us up here.&quot; Even though Hamilton and Button have performed better on the big day than in qualifying in this most competitive season they will have their work cut out today on a track where the Red Bulls can make the most of their superior downforce. Now that Red Bull appear to have added some mechanical reliability to their scorching pace they sense they have the chance to break away from the other teams. The pace of the cars was an even bigger talking point than the reappearance of volcanic dust, which has led to the closure of a number of airports in Spain, including Barcelona \u2013 the neurotic, and there are plenty of them in this sport, might think that the cloud is haunting Formula One after the difficulty in getting out of Shanghai three weeks ago. Whitmarsh dismissed the notion of a &quot;trick widget&quot; on the Red Bull cars but pointed to their &quot;impressive overall package&quot;. At least the McLaren drivers were the best of the rest. Button added: &quot;I am very surprised they are that fast. We came here hoping to close that gap but it&apos;s gone in the other direction. It&apos;s very surprising. We&apos;ve got a lot of work to do. One second \u2013 it takes a long time to catch that gap up. It&apos;s not going to happen overnight. &quot;It should be a walk in the park for them. If it&apos;s dry it probably will be. If we get off the line well we might be able to get them into turn one, for me more difficult but for Lewis there&apos;s a possibility. Our race pace always better than our qualifying.&quot; Alonso was fined $20,000 (\u00a313,500) for almost colliding with Rosberg. He pulled out of the Ferrari garage and almost hit the Mercedes as the German driver made his way down the pit lane.

Lose and Chelsea will be crowned champions for the fourth time in their history, enabling John Terry to end his season horribilus on an upbeat note by hoisting the Premier League trophy skywards as his team-mates spray each other with champagne and pogo enthusiastically on a hastily erected plywood advertising hoarding.  Despite Wigan&apos;s 3-1 win over Chelsea in September, the bookies don&apos;t give them a prayer this afternoon; they&apos;re 25-1 shots to win today and 11-1 to draw. Stranger things have happened, but top mathematicians have announced it would take a big-game choke of (Zlatan Ibrahimovic + Thierry Henry) x (John Terry In The 2008 Champions League Final Penalty Shoot-Out + Greg Norman) proportions for Carlo Ancelotti&apos;s merry men to mess up this afternoon. As weirdness goes, it would be straight from David Lynch&apos;s subconscious. For the neutrals among us, it would also be very funny.  They&apos;ve won six of their last seven games, scoring 25 goals in the process, with their only reverse coming at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 17 April.  The teams Chelsea (4-3-3): Cech, Ivanovic, Alex, Terry, Ashley Cole, Lampard,Ballack, Malouda, Kalou, Drogba, Anelka. Subs: Hilario, Joe Cole, Zhirkov, Paulo Ferreira, Sturridge, Matic, Belletti. Wigan (4-1-4-1): Pollitt, Melchiot, Gohouri, Caldwell, Figueroa, Boyce,McCarthy, Watson, Diame, N&apos;Zogbia, Rodallega. Subs: Stojkovic, Thomas, Scharner, Scotland, Moses, Cywka, Mostoe. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)  Meanwhile on Sky Sports: Over a bespoke commentary from Channel 4 racing&apos;s Derek &quot;Tommo&quot; Thompson, they&apos;re showing a montage featuring clips from assorted Manchester United and Chelsea matches throughout the season, cutting occasionally to footage of two racehorses galloping upsides each other neck-and-neck. It&apos;s been a two-horse race, see? See?  Meanwhile in Italy: It&apos;s Bologna 1-1 Catania with two minutes to go. The draw on that game was priced up at 1-3 (it would normally be about 5-2 or 3-1) and the 1-1 draw was even-money (it would normally be 7-1 or 8-1). For all the Premier League&apos;s shortcomings, if a fix like that took place there&apos;d be uproar, followed by investigations, inquiries and suspensions/bans. In Italy it&apos;s so routine such results are greeted with shoulder-shrugs all round.  Not long now: The teams are lined up in the tunnel, awaiting the call to arms. Chelsea&apos;s players are wearing their customary home strip of blue shirts and shorts, with white socks. Wigan&apos;s wear orange shirts and socks, with black shorts.  How they&apos;ll line up: Expect Chelsea to play a 4-3-3 with Michael Ballack in the centre of midfield flanked by Frank Lampard on the right and Florent Malouda on his left. Ahead of this trio, Didier Drogba will be supported by Salomon Kalou on the right wing and Nicolas Anelka on the left. Wigan will play a 4-1-4-1, with Steve Gouhouri patrolling the area in front of the back four and James McCarthy and Charles Nzogbia bookending Ben Watson and Mohamed Diame in a midfield four supporting lone frontman Hugo Rodallega.  1 min: Game on. Forget what I said about Wigan&apos;s line-up, they&apos;re playing three across the back: Gohouri, Boyce and Caldwell, with right-back Mario Melchiot and left-back Maynor Figueroa playing high up the field.  2 min: Nothing much of note happening at the moment, with most of the play taking place in the middle third as both teams pass, probe and prod in a bid to see what the lie of the land is early doors.  3 min: Michael Ballack steps in to intercept a wayward long pass out of defence from Emmerson Boyce, but then gives away possession himself. Chelsea win it back and Salomon Kalou goes on a storming run before getting brought down by Mohamed Diame about seven or eight yards outside the Wigan penalty area. Free-kick for Chelsea.  GOAL! Chelsea 1-0 Wigan (Anelka 6) Drogba fires the free-kick into the wall, it ricochets up in the air, Lampard heads it back into the mixer where Florent Malouda does well to hold off Gary Caldwell and chest the ball down for Nicolas Anelka to smash a volley past Pollitt from about eight yards out.  8 min: Any nerves Chelsea might have had going into this game must surely have been dissipated by that early goal. This could turn into a rout.  9 min: In all the excitement I forgot to mention that Malouda was offside when Lampard headed that rebound into the edge of the six-yard box in the build-up to the goal. It shouldn&apos;t have stood.  10 min: Wigan have responded well to their early setback. First Charles Nzogbia curls a shot high and wide, then they win a corner. It&apos;s pulled back to Maynor Figueroa who tries to dink it into the box. Alex clears.  11 min: &quot;Here&apos;s how China sees things,&quot; writes Martin Stannard. &quot;Chelsea are almost certain to win the title today, but rather than show that happen, Chinese TV is showing Manchester United v. Stoke. The word &apos;marketing&apos; comes to mind.&quot;  14 min: Michael Ballack has a very frank exchange of views with the linesman patrolling the Chelsea half of the field, almost going nose to nose with him when the official has the temerity to award Wigan a free-kick instead of Chelsea the throw-in the German felt they deserved. The ball&apos;s sent into the mixer, a brief game of head tennis ensues and eventually it goes wide.  15 min: John Terry goes close when a long-range free-kick floated into the Wigan penalty area by Frank Lampard dropped kindly, but not quite kindly enough, for him. He stuck out a toe to try and prod it goalwards but the ball was this much out of reach. Wigan clear.  18 min: Possession stats: Wigan 57%-43% Chelsea. No, really.  19 min: Wigan win a throw-in on the edge of the final third and pass their way backwards into their own half. Like a stoner who&apos;s run out of Rizlas, they&apos;ve lots of possession, but aren&apos;t sure what to do with it.  20 min: Ben Watson plays Hugo Rodallega through on goal with a defence-splitting pass from about 25 yards out, but the Colombian is correctly flagged for offside.  22 min: Without a shadow of a doubt, it&apos;s all Wigan Athletic at the moment. They&apos;re bossing Chelsea in the possession stats, they&apos;re stroking the ball around admirably and are just one or two decent killer passes away from restoring parity.  24 min: &quot;Perhaps there&apos;s more United fans in China?&quot; asks Adam Walker in response to Martin Stannards email, not exactly blowing the theory that marketing is the main motivation for it being broadcast over there. &quot;Perhaps they realise the Utd game has a better chance of being entertaining (which at this moment, it&apos;s pretty high octane and very entertaining) while Chelsea games have a tendency to bore people to sleep?&quot;  26 min: Drogba charges down the inside right channel before pulling a cross back from the touchline. Wigan goalkeeper Pollitt blocks the ball at his near post and puts it out for a corner from which nothing comes. Drogba&apos;s momentum carries him into and over an advertising hoarding behind the goal, where he has a brief chat and a laugh with a nice lady in whose lap he landed.  28 min: From the left wing, Anelka squares a ball across the edge of the six-yard box where Ashley Cole and Drogba are waiting. At the near post, the unmarked Cole tries to back-heel it home with his left foot a la Joe Cole-against-Manchester United but makes a pig ear of his effort, then behind him Drogba misses it completely.  29 min: Penalty for Chelsea after Frank Lampard is dragged to ground in the box by Gary Caldwell. Red card for Caldwell and a spot-kick for Lampard.  GOAL! Chelsea 2-0 Wigan Athletic (Lampard 32) Lampard shoots a low, unstoppable outswinger into the bottom left-hand corner. All is not well on Planet Chelsea, however: Didier Drogba has his big sulky-head on because he wasn&apos;t allowed to take it. He and Wayne Rooney are level on 26 goals each in the race to the golden boot, with Darren Bent two behind on 24.  34 min: On Sky, match analyst and self-confessed Premier League cheerleader Andy Gray is saying that Frank Lampard was right not to let Drogba take the penalty, because it was more important &quot;to get the game won&quot; than help the Ivorian win the golden boot. The way he&apos;s going on you&apos;d swear Drogba was some sort of uncoordinated halfwit who&apos;s incapable of putting one foot in front of the other without falling over (insert gag about diving here), as opposed to one of the world&apos;s greatest strikers who&apos;s probably more than capable of beating Wigan&apos;s third-choice goalkeeper with a dead ball from 12 yards out.  39 min: Branislav Ivanovic slaloms down the right flank, beating three of Wigan&apos;s 10 men before losing his balance and falling over. That was a waste of time.  39 min: &quot;I beg to differ with Martin Stannard,&quot; writes Aelred Doyle, determined to prolong what is arguably the most tedious, pointless debate in the history of minute-by-minute reporting. &quot;I&apos;m here in Shanghai watching Chelsea v Wigan on the Shanghai sports channel. CCTV5, the national sports channel, is showing Inter Milan on tape delay. Is he watching on a sneaky illegal satellite rather than actual Chinese television?&quot;  41 min: The camera pans to Didier Drogba, who is quite clearly continuing to simmer and seethe over not being allowed to take that penalty. Once Lampard had put it away he ran over to his team-mate, cupped his face in his hands and said something to him. I&apos;m no lip-reader, but I could definitely make out the word &quot;promise&quot; - he&apos;s obviously given Drogba dibs on any future penalties Chelsea get.  43 min: Mohamed Diame takes the ball off Ballack in midfield and bursts through the middle, only for his momentum to get the better of him and force him into a speed-wobble that gives Ballack time to recover and avert the danger before the Wigan midfielder can unleash a shot.  44 min: Booking I haven&apos;t got around to mentioning yet: Steve Gohouri for a foul on Salomon Kalou.  44+3 min:Mike Pollitt launches the ball down the field, prompting the referee to blow for half-time. Premier League champions elect Chelsea are 2-0 up against 10-man Wigan Athletic at home. Could we not just hand John Terry the trophy now so we can all get on with our lives? Incidentally, my colleague Rob Smyth reckons Terry will go up to receive the trophy shirtless, all the better to show off his only remaining captain&apos;s armband. He&apos;s a very cynical man, is Rob.  Half-time  Oh dear, oh dear: I&apos;ve just seen what is probably the most corporate shill-tastic lager advert ever made. Those shamelessly taking the C*******g dollar: Jack Charlton, Kelly Holmes, Phil Taylor, Steve Davis, Trevor Brooking, Stuart Pearce, Nigel Benn, Clive Woodward, Steve Redgrave, the guitarist from Kasabian, Ian Botham, Bobby Robson&apos;s estate and Ellen MacArthur. A lot of knights and dames of the realm in there - I wonder does that push their fee up? It&apos;s all very grubby.  Half-time comments &quot;It&apos;s good of the Premier League to allow Martin Atkinson to ref at Stamford Bridge today,&quot; says Leon Davies. &quot;Is this so he can join in the celebrations and collect the winners medal he earned in the two decisive games against United.&quot;  &quot;Is it just me, or could these flag-waving pre-world cups ads with various notables giving up their dignity for coin have the capacity to become tiresome?&quot; asks Tom Hopkins. &quot;If marketing is the explanation for why Manchester United is on Chinese television (and I don&apos;t disagree) then what&apos;s the explanation for the fact that here in the US on ESPN we&apos;re watching West Ham vs. Man City?&quot; asks JOhn Speranza, before inviting readers to &quot;Insert joke about ESPN&apos;s football savvy here.&quot; &quot;If Wigan are like stoners without a Rizla then Chelsea must be a bunch of nervous, sweaty smackheads who keep having to score,&quot; writes Ben Bamford.  Second half: Chelsea&apos;s 45-minute victory parade is underway. It would, after all, be completely unthinkable for Wigan to come back from 2-0 down against a Big Four side to draw or even win, eh Arsenal fans?  47 min: The ball&apos;s crossed into the Wigan Athletic box, where Frank Lampard (toe) and Nic Anelka (head) combine to steer it on to the Wigan crossbar. Even if they&apos;d scored, it wouldn&apos;t have counted. Anelka was offside.  48 min: It will be interesting to see whether Didier Drogba brought the childish petulant hissy-fit that hampered his performance in the last 15 minutes of the first half into this period or left it in the dressing room. He&apos;s a great player, [minute-by-minute commentator adopts most pompous tone] but one who&apos;s in danger of spoiling his legacy by being remembered as a big baby.  51 min: Kalou charges down the inside right channel and shoots from a narrow angle when he probably should have crossed to Drogba at the far post. Wide. Moments previously, Charles Nzobia got booked for a pull on Ashley Cole&apos;s shirt.  53 min: &quot;Is newly confirmed Chelsea fan and prime minister in waiting Dave Cameron at the match?&quot; asks our old friend Alison Jeeves, who (wo)mans the turnstiles at London&apos;s O2 Arena. &quot;Surely he will want to hand over the trophy, should it come to that. There is a joke about crosses in boxes somewhere but I can&apos;t locate it.&quot;  GOAL! Chelsea 3-0 Wigan Athletic (Kalou 54) Salomon Kalou peels off his shirt and sprints off in celebration after starting and finishing a marvellous move in which Frank Lampard&apos;s role was pivotal. Kalou charged down the right channel, played the ball out to Lampard on his left and then continued his into the box to pick up the return pass and slot the ball into the bottom left-hand corner from about 14 yards out.  GOAL! Chelsea 4-0 Wigan Athletic (Anelka 55 min) That&apos;s a great goal. A corner&apos;s played short(ish) to Branislav Ivanovic, who sends a sweeping cross-field pass to Anelka at the far post, about 15 yards out. He swivels, putting his foot through the ball and volleying a shot into the ground and up past Mike Pollitt in the Wigan goal.  58 min: Chelsea substitutions: Joe Cole and Juliano Belletti on, Salomon Kalou and Branislav Ivanovic off.  59 min: Didier Drogba blows an excellent chance to make the Golden Boot his own, but miscontrols a marvellous long pass into the Wigan penalty area from - I think - Frank Lampard in midfield. The ball squirts away from him when a more deft touch would almost certainly have resulted in a goal.  60 min: Joe Cole splits the Wigan defence with a pass up the right flank, releasing Drogba. He shoots diagonally across the face of goal and wide of the far post.  61 min: Chelsea take their foot of the gas for long enough for me to inform you that (a) Manchester United are 3-0 up against Stoke City, for all the good it will do them and (b) Salomon Kalou got booked after scoring his goal for removing his shirt, despite referee&apos;s assistant John Terry putting in a good word for him.  GOAL! Chelsea 5-0 Wigan Athletic (Drogba 62) Drogba perks up considerably after putting himself in the box-seat to win the Golden Boot, heading home a looping cross to the far post from Frank Lampard from all of three feet out. It was unfrotunate for Wigan goalkeeper Mike Pollitt, who had saved sensationally from a Drogba bicycle-kick seconds previously. The ball wasn&apos;t cleared, ended up with Lampard at the far post and he put it on a plate for his sulky team-mate. That&apos;s Chelsea&apos;s 100th goal of this Premier League campaign.  66 min: Penalty for Chelsea. Ashley Cole goes down in the box under a challenge from ... somebody. Apologies, I didn&apos;t see who.  GOAL! Chelsea 6-0 Wigan Athletic (Drogba 68) Drogba smashes the ball home off the left upright, showing Sky experts Andy Gray, Glenn Hoddle, Jamie Redknapp and Richard Keys that he&apos;s not the liability they seem to have him pegged for when it comes to taking penalties. If it had been John Terry who&apos;d been wailing and moaning about not being allowed to take one they might have had a point.  70 min: Chelsea substitution: youthful Serbian midfield playmaker Nemanja Matic on, excitable German ref-botherer Michael Ballack off.  71 min: Wigan substitution: Paul Scharner on for his last Wigan appearance, I didn&apos;t see who was granted a merciful release from the last 20 minutes.  73 min: &quot;John Terry can accept the trophy naked as far as I care. 100 goals, what has your team done, then?&quot; asks Damien Neva. Apart from scoring 100 league goals in one season well over a century before Chelsea managed it, my team hasn&apos;t done much. Sunderland don&apos;t follow precedents, they set them.  75 min: Didier Drogba&apos;s just been booked for persistant fouling. At Old Trafford, Wayne Rooney&apos;s just been substituted, which means Drogba will definitely win the Golden Boot unless Darren Bent&apos;s banged in five or six for Sunderland against Wolves. I&apos;m going to go out on a limb and guess that hasn&apos;t happened.  77 min: Joe Cole helps a Florent Malouda cross from the left on its way to Didier Drogba at the far post, but the Ivorian miscontrols , possibly because there&apos;s a bit too much spin on the ball after Cole&apos;s intervention.  78 min: Please God let somebody have got a photo of that. The electrics in one of the linesmens&apos; flags went on the blink, which meant a replacement had to be relayed across the pitch by assorted Chelsea players. John Terry carried it on the final leg of its journey, waving it for yuks as he approached the linesman. It quite suited him.  GOAL! Chelsea 7-0 Wigan Athletic (Drogba 79) Matic charges down the right, crosses to Joe Cole at the far post, who sends it back across the face of goal for Drogba to poke home from about six yards out. This is brutal. Drogba sprints over and starts strumming the corner flag like it was a guitar, while Florent Malouda stands behind him playing imaginary drums. It&apos;s probably fair to say that&apos;s the title wrapped up.  84 min: Wigan substitution: Victor Moses on, I have no idea who went off. It&apos;s difficult to keep up here, to be honest.  84 min: &quot;I&apos;d assumed a Chelsea player had the linesman&apos;s flag from the 1st minute, seeing a replay of their opening goal,&quot; writes Adam Walker.  85 min: Victor Moses brings a top-drawer save out of Petr Cech with a long-range surface-to-air screamer that the Chelsea goalkeeper is forced to tip over his own crossbar.  86 min: Chelsea leave three players on the halfway line for the ensuing corner, forcing Wigan to leave three of their nine available outfield players back marking them. That&apos;s just bullying, like kicking a blind man&apos;s stick.  89 min: Assorted Chelsea players Chelsea stroke the ball around as they await the final whistle which will confirm their status as champions.  GOAL! Chelsea 8-0 Wigan Athletic (A Cole 90) But there&apos;s still time for one more goal as Ashley Cole smashes home a 20 yard left-foot volley after getting on the end of a cross from his namesake Joe, who performed heroics to keep the ball in play down by the touchline adjacent to the right upright before providing the assist. That&apos;s a marvellous goal.  Full-time: It&apos;s all over - having scored seven goals three times this season, Chelsea mark the occasion of winning their fourth league title by going one better and scoring eight - that&apos;s an emphatic victory, to say the least. They win the 2009-10 Premier League title by one point from Manchester United, scoring 103 goals in the process - a fair old achievement by any standards.  Post-match niceties: As One Step Beyond by Madness blares out over the Tannoy, Stamford Bridge starts rocking in full-on party mode as a couple of lads on quad bikes tow the constiuent parts of a giant plywood Barclays advert out into the centre-circle on trailers. As difficult as it might seem to believe, some uncharacteristically exuberant Chelsea fans are singing, stamping their feet and waving their scarves.  The presentation As some remarkably ugly Chelsea fans spot themselves on the big screen and begin celebrating effusively, the Premier League trophy and a big tray of medals are brought on to the pitch by some men dressed in military uniforms. Unlike the man in military uniform who was accompanying BNP leader Nick Griffin as he campaigned before the General Election, I think these lads are actual soldiers.  Here we go: Assorted coaching staff, kitmen, tea ladies Nemanja Matic (he hasn&apos;t made enough appearances to win a medal) get their handshakes and take their bow, before the Chelsea senior squad, led by manager Carlo Ancelotti, emerge from the tunnel and receive their winners&apos; medals. Didier Drogba tries to hog the limelight as much as possible by hanging back until third last, then ducking out of line to kiss the trophy on his way to the rostrum. Next up is vice-captain Frank Lampard, followed by captain John Terry, who is wearing a shirt. They grab a handle each and hoist the Premier League trophy skywards, prompting an explosion of ticker-tape and the usual champagne-spraying and pogoing behind the obliogatory Barclaycard hoarding.  Didier Drogba&apos;s determination to make this afternoon all about him shows no sign of letting up. He sprints across the field with jeroboam of champagne in hand and clambers/is dragged into the warm embrace of the crowd. After being fished out by Fun Police constables in official Chelsea fluorescent jackets, he stretches out in front of the Barclaycard hoarding, hogging the limelight while his team-mates jump up and down behind it. Anyway, that&apos;s another league season over, Chelsea are champions and Didier is the winner of the Golden Boot, so he has every right to be pleased with himself. That&apos;s all from me - enjoy what&apos;s left of your weekend ... unless you&apos;re reading this on Monday and it&apos;s already over.", "tags": ["Premier League", "Chelsea", "Wigan Athletic", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2009-10"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-09T13:53:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/10/lewis-hamilton-mark-webber", "sentences": ["If he drove less brilliantly here than he had done in Shanghai three weeks earlier, that was partly because the Circuit de Catalunya, with its shortened back straight, virtually bans overtaking and that encouraged the 33-year-old Australian Webber to lead from lights to flag in his galloping Red Bull to record his first victory of the season and the third of his career."], "title": "Lewis Hamilton's hopes blow up behind Mark Webber's serene charge", "article": "Lewis Hamilton appears to have his very own, personal cloud of volcanic ash and it continued to loom over him yesterday even in the sunny hills that sit above the Catalan capital. The British driver produced another fine race in the Spanish grand prix and looked certain to finish second behind Mark Webber, who led throughout, until on the penultimate lap his front left tyre gave way to suspected wheel-rim or possibly suspension trouble and he crashed out. &quot;It was a similar feeling to what happened at the N\u00fcrburgring,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;This is my third or fourth tyre blow-out in my career, more than most people have in their whole lifetime. But there was no warning, the car felt great, so it was a surprise and a very disappointing end to the race. &quot;Up until that point it was pretty positive. I was just cruising to the finish line and heading for some great points. It was looking like a great job for us but then it&apos;s never over until its over. Eighteen points and I&apos;d have been right back in the championship battle but, as it is, I&apos;m a little bit further back now. &quot;So I&apos;m absolutely blown away that something happened on the last two laps of the race but that&apos;s motor racing.&quot; Those 18 points he would have garnered here would have lifted him to second place in the championship, one behind his McLaren team-mate Jenson Button, who was fifth. Instead the 2008 world champion Hamilton is now back in sixth place, 21 points behind his fellow Briton, and also in the title-chasing slipstream of Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel, Webber, Nico Rosberg and Felipe Massa. In all five races Hamilton has been stalked by some kind of misfortune or another, whether it has been qualifying cock-ups, poor pit calls or mechanical failure; he must feel as neurotic as a dartboard. If he drove less brilliantly here than he had done in Shanghai three weeks earlier, that was partly because the Circuit de Catalunya, with its shortened back straight, virtually bans overtaking and that encouraged the 33-year-old Australian Webber to lead from lights to flag in his galloping Red Bull to record his first victory of the season and the third of his career. In a city infamous for the slickness of its pickpockets Alonso produced a neat piece of larceny, taking advantage of the problems that beset Hamilton and Vettel to come second, ahead of Vettel and Michael Schumacher, who showed something of his old skill to shut the door on Button. Button, though, was later critical of Schumacher, who overtook him on the 17th lap. &quot;I didn&apos;t really know where Michael was on the outside of me,&quot; said the reigning world champion. &quot;He turned in and, if I didn&apos;t back out of it, we would have crashed. It&apos;s tough to overtake here and Michael&apos;s not silly. He knows where to put his car, so on a track like this you&apos;re not going to overtake him.&quot; Yesterday, sadly, the rain in Spain stayed mainly in the plain. The wet weather had brought so much excitement to the previous three races but its absence now resulted in what was little more than a procession. Yawns, though, were stifled when Hamilton managed to split the Red Bulls of Webber and Vettel, nipping ahead of the German after a tyre change. Vettel tried to retake Hamilton but, with a Virgin backmarker Lucas di Grassi also in the mix, Hamilton responded brilliantly and the Red Bull driver went off the track. The day, though, belonged to Webber. Shortly before the engines roared he said he wanted a boring race and he duly delivered it. The Australian was overshadowed by his thrillingly fast young team-mate Vettel in the build-up to the season. But they now have one win apiece and have shared all the pole positions (three for Vettel, two for Webber). This was the first time this season that a pole winner had won the race, though the tenth time it has happened here in as many seasons; when it is dry in Barcelona dullness beckons like a pot of beige paint. In Spain the stroll \u2013 or paseo as they call it in these parts \u2013 is something of an institution. This, too, was a stroll for Webber. Once he and Vettel had got through the first corner \u2013 though Hamilton and Alonso did their best to force their way through \u2013 it was unlikely that they would be challenged and only problems with Vettel&apos;s car prevented the Red Bull one-two the team had achieved in qualifying the previous day. Over the last few laps the German had almost total brake failure and was glad to hold on to third Because the drivers test here in the winter they know it better than any other track. It is as familiar as an old pullover. And in view of the fact that three of the previous five races here had produced just two overtaking manoeuvres it was never likely to be a thriller in dry conditions. But that did nothing to erase the pure joy on Webber&apos;s face. Even the spires on Barcelona&apos;s magnificent La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia could not have been higher. &quot;I&apos;m rapt,&quot; he said. &quot;After qualifying yesterday it was a great position to start the race. &quot;It was quite tight into turn one and we had a good battle through there but then I settled into a rhythm after that. I always try to do something different if I win a race and I threw my helmet into the crowd. It&apos;s nice to give them a gift.&quot; But for British fans and even some neutrals the continuing despair of Hamilton was a cause of disappointment.

At Monaco four years ago, in his last season in F1, the German parked his car at the crucial Rascasse corner just as Fernando Alonso, his main rival for the drivers&apos; title, was on his qualifying lap. The race stewards subsequently pushed Schumacher from the front of the grid to the back. today, when asked if he regretted the controversial move, he said: &quot;It doesn&apos;t change things if we go back into it. We are now in 2010.&quot; When asked again, Schumacher said: &quot;I had great fun in the race. I came through the field from last and I think I finished fifth. That was good fun.&quot; But was that Saturday a low point in his career? &quot;You made it, yes,&quot; he said. &quot;You journalists. Some of you guys ... Let&apos;s look forward and not backwards.&quot; So would he do it again in 2010? &quot;You&apos;re boring,&quot; he said, trying to change the subject. When yet another effort was made to try to prise the &quot;s&quot; word from his lips, Schumacher said: &quot;You can keep trying, absolutely, but I am not talking about it any more. There is enough said and I don&apos;t feel I need to get any deeper into it.&quot; There were other incidents, of course, in Schumacher&apos;s Formula One career before his recently rescinded retirement, particularly those involving Damon Hill at Adelaide in 1994 and Jacques Villeneuve at Jerez in 1997. But it was the incident involving Alonso that confirmed Schumacher&apos;s status as the sport&apos;s pantomime villain. After disappointing performances this season in the first three races \u2013 and something more abject in the fourth in Shanghai \u2013 Schumacher showed some of the qualities that made him world champion seven times in the course of the Spanish grand prix in Barcelona. That, of course, has brought him back into focus before the Monaco grand prix. &quot;It&apos;s so unique, all the history it has, just thinking of the history makes it so special and a good reason to want to win it,&quot; he said. He placed winning at Monaco just below winning the world championship. &quot;To be so close to the wall at such a speed is extra special. Here, if you want to nail it there is no margin for any little error whatsoever. You have to time it perfectly right. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to the weekend. It is an interesting track. For us drivers it a high rate of challenge. Its ironic, because in a way, we are always looking for safety; to try to have the tracks as safe as possible then we come and race here.

The unlikely soprano, a rotund 24-year-old man, will release his debut album with Sony Music in July. &quot;I still can&apos;t believe this is real,&quot; Yu Chun told a Shanghai press conference. It has been a whirlwind spring for the singer, who shot to international fame with his performance on the Taiwanese karaoke show Avenue to Stardom. The video went viral, and almost 10 million people have watched Yu Chun warble through the Bodyguard soundtrack hit I Will Always Love You. The shy and portly singer, with an unfashionable bowl haircut, was instantly compared to dowdy Scottish star Susan Boyle. Boyle, now 49, stunned viewers of Britain&apos;s Got Talent \u2013 and went on to release the best-selling album of 2009. Like Boyle, Yu Chun did not win his televised talent contest, but he soon became a minor US sensation, performing on The Ellen Degeneres Show, and on George Lopez, where he sang Total Eclipse of the Heart with, er, William Shatner. &quot;I now have more confidence in pursuing a singing career,&quot; Yu Chun told the Associated Press. &quot;You don&apos;t have to be a good-looking man or woman to succeed.

Webber won for the second time in eight days and is now joint leader in the title race with his team-mate. He won from lights to flag, just as he had done in Barcelona last weekend, as he became the first Australian to win here since Jack Brabham in 1959. But it was another bitterly disappointing experience for McLaren, who dropped from first to third in the team standings. Jenson Button, the world champion and the leader of this year&apos;s title race until lunchtime, retired at the start of the third lap with smoke billowing from his engine as if it were a stricken Spitfire. Lewis Hamilton had a frustrating afternoon, finishing in fifth, where he started, though he will be happy enough with that after the accident that befell him in Barcelona. Button said: &quot;We left a bung [a cooling cover] in on the left-hand side of the car that obviously you&apos;re meant to take out on the way to the grid and that&apos;s cooked the engine. It&apos;s a mistake that you would think shouldn&apos;t happen but it does. I&apos;m sure the guy who did not pull it out is gutted. I feel sorry for him. We all make mistakes. We just have to make sure we don&apos;t make them again. &quot;As soon as I saw the flames and fire coming from the back of the car I knew we weren&apos;t going any further. I just pulled over and turned everything off. It has been a pretty frustrating weekend.&quot; The worry for McLaren&apos;s team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, and his drivers \u2013 apart from the swaggering dominance of the Red Bull cars \u2013 is that a proneness to accidents appears to have infiltrated the normally efficient Woking-based team, who had won the second and fourth races of the season but have now had two very forgettable weekends. Yesterday, Button had to throw a remote control handset out of his cockpit at the Rascasse corner. In the last race, in Spain, Button suffered dash failure while Hamilton experienced left front-wheel failure on the penultimate lap when looking sure to come second. All season, the team have performed badly in qualifying, especially in Malaysia, where they misread the weather conditions. Last month&apos;s one-two in Shanghai now feels a long time ago. Whitmarsh, referring to Button&apos;s early retirement, said : &quot;It is disappointing to everyone in the team and devastating to the person responsible. I know these things happen but it is just hard to accept when it does. Inevitably he is devastated. The car went to the grid with no airflow so it was cooked. &quot;You do what you can but you cannot recover from that. These cars don&apos;t have fans, they rely on airflow so if you deny that you are not going to survive very long. We will sit down and talk about it.&quot; For Hamilton, there was resignation. &quot;To be honest, I couldn&apos;t do any overtaking out there. After the last race I was just happy to bag the points.&quot; Monaco is Formula One&apos;s scariest ride. But even though it was something of a procession for Webber, who at one point produced the fastest lap on three consecutive circuits,there were often things happening behind and the safety car came out enough times to make one wonder if it would soon come in for new tyres. If overtaking was a rarity \u2013 except for the sensational Fernando Alonso \u2013 there were enough crashes and pit stops to change the order of things. The most spectacular incident happened late on when Jarno Trulli attempted to pass Karun Chandhok&apos;s HRT and one car slid over the other. Nico Hulkenberg in a Williams crashed in the tunnel and Rubens Barrichello careered into the fencing and showed his frustration by throwing his toys out of his pram \u2013 or at least flinging his steering wheel out of the car. For Webber, there were only celebrations. This is someone who now must be taken very seriously by anyone trying to pick the champion racing driver of 2010. He said: &quot;This is absolutely incredible and for sure the greatest day of my life. To win here is a very, very special day. It started yesterday with qualifying. But this place is such a test for two hours. &quot;But to join Ayrton Senna and those guys [who have won] around here is great. It&apos;s a real blue-riband event.&quot; It was not a classic race but it was another memorable day which added lustre to the legend.

That lasted about 10 nana-seconds, before it started to rally.  Even the euro is recovering from its four year lows against the dollar, and there were even a couple of analysts ready to stick their necks out and make positive noises about the Eurozone. In a note entitled Buy Europe/Sell Japan, Morgan Stanley said:  We are changing some of our recommendations on the prospect of at least a temporary solution to the European crisis. We still want to play the export-to-strength theme (the macro strength being in emerging markets and, perhaps, the US).  However, we now prefer playing this theme with European rather than Japanese stocks. European equities look cheaper, our European colleagues remain bullish on earnings (despite fiscal tightening in the periphery) and our foreign exchange team expects that the euro will remain weak. Consequently, we are shifting exposure from Japan to Europe.   Meanwhile Credit Suisse - in an analysis called Continental Europe: better than you think - said:  We raise Continental Europe to 15% overweight (from 5% overweight). We cut weightings earlier this year \u2013 but now believe investors in a currency-hedged portfolio should be raising weightings because:  Cheap valuation. The sector-adjusted P/E is at a 30% discount to the US - very close to an time low, dividend yield relatives are extreme.  Too much growth pessimism. Consensus expects 1.2% GDP growth in 2010. Germany is 50% larger than peripheral Europe and the best lead indicators are consistent with 3%+ GDP growth. The decline in the euro adds nearly 1% to real GDP\u2014the recent weakness in the euro offsets all the tightening measures announced in recent weeks in peripheral Europe. On our economic scorecard, Europe now has the best rate of change in economic momentum and the loosest monetary conditions.  The weaker euro. We still think the euro is likely to fall to $1.20 (possibly lower). The peak-to-trough fall would then add 13% to EPS, on our models (with a nine month lag). 88% of the time the euro weakens, Europe outperforms (in a currency-hedged portfolio). We have not seen such a decoupling between European underperformance and \u20ac/$ weakness before.  Not as indebted as you may think. Aggregate leverage in Europe (consumer, corporates and government) at 220% of GDP is below that of the US (270%), the UK (300%) and Japan (363%). The savings ratio in core Europe is 6 times that of the US. The problem is the distribution of the government debt. Hence, from an economic point of view core Europe can continue to finance transfer payments to the periphery. To stabilise government debt-to-GDP, fiscal policy has to be tightened by 3% of GDP in the Euro-area as a whole, on our numbers, but by 7% to 8% in the US, Japan and UK (assuming a normal economic recovery).  Policy reaction. We have seen that the EU and particularly the ECB are prepared to take the necessary measures to support monetary union. The packages announced amount to 60% of Spain, Portugal and Greece&apos;s GDP and 77% of their debt. Above all, the ECB has to continue with its bond purchases until stresses abate. This will either result in QE (i.e., the ECB expanding its balance sheet, which is up 60% from its pre-crisis 2007 levels) or a fiscal transfer (as core Europe pays 60% of the recap).

In Pyongyang, rumours of Kim Jong-il&apos;s poor health abound, and the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea takes ever-increasing measures to ward off the instability of a succession in leadership. This might seem an unlikely backdrop to a friendly game of football, but next month North and South Korea move the theatre of conflict from the disputed western sea border to South Africa, where they will compete alongside 30 other countries for the biggest prize in football. The chances of a direct north-versus-south clash at the World Cup are slim, since both teams are drawn in separate groups \u2013 which may be for the best. When the teams met in the qualifying stages for South Africa 2010, Fifa ordered North Korea to move the game from Pyongyang to Shanghai after they refused to play the South Korean national anthem before the match. But despite all this, there is a sense that North Korea&apos;s first appearance at a World Cup since 1966 could actually go some way towards healing rifts with the international community, not least the south. &quot;North Koreans are very nationalistic,&quot; says Glyn Ford, a former MEP and author of North Korea on the Brink. &quot;But if they can&apos;t support North Korea they&apos;ll support South Korea. They&apos;d prefer South Korea to win against anyone else, unless they&apos;re playing them. They&apos;re cheering for Koreans.&quot; It&apos;s a concept totally foreign to what most Europeans are used to. Just look at the &quot;Anyone but England&quot; T-shirts on sale in Scotland as the World Cup approaches. Yet the South, even with the animosity caused by the sinking of the Cheonan, will probably take a similar view. &quot;Koreans from Japan, the Korean community in China, and even those who have travelled to South Africa to support the South largely take the same view in regards to sport,&quot; Ford says. &quot;They did after all march under a single flag at the 2004 Olympics, despite going on to compete as separate nations.&quot; This mutual support is a step in the direction of cultural assimilation, something viewed as key in the long-term future of relations between North and South Korea. At last week&apos;s World Korea Forum in Brussels, the consensus on a long-term reunification plan was to encourage increased engagement and gradual integration, rather than pounce on the north&apos;s weakness during a period of regime transition. For South Korea, a country where Manchester United&apos;s Park Ji-Sung is a national hero, football is a great place to start. Both North and South Korea have fond memories of the World Cup. For the latter, 2002&apos;s run to the semi-final was as culturally defining to the country as England&apos;s 1966 win. In the North, it was during that 1966 tournament they shocked the world by beating Italy before narrowly losing to Portugal in the quarter-finals. Importantly, football appears to be an area that the Kim Jong-il regime allows a greater degree of freedom than many other aspects of North Korean life. For instance last year, Chaoyang Park Rangers, an amateur football team of largely British and American expats based in Beijing, were invited to participate in an exhibition match in Pyongyang against a North Korean university. &quot;The game was played in the national stadium in Pyongyang,&quot; says Mark Rushton. &quot;It almost seemed like a diplomatic statement, as we were the first foreign amateur team allowed to play there, and the first team containing Americans to ever play in North Korea.&quot; Endorsing a cultural exchange on the football pitch is a clear sign that North Korea appreciates the potential value the sport has in improving the image of the country globally. Although few expect the DPRK to progress in South Africa from the aptly named &quot;group of death&quot; featuring Brazil, Portugal and C\u00f4te d&apos;Ivoire, if the team can cast themselves as the plucky underdogs and perhaps even take a point from one of the pre-tournament favourites, it could go a long way to associating North Korea with something other than nuclear armament and a despotic regime. In the Koryo Tours documentary, The Game of Their Lives, which follows the North Korean 1966 World Cup team&apos;s run to the quarter-finals, Pak Doo-ik, scorer of the winning goal against Italy, fondly remembers his time in England. &quot;I learned that football is not only about the winning,&quot; he says. &quot;Wherever we go football can improve diplomatic relations and promote peace.&quot; A little na\u00efve, perhaps \u2013 especially as doubts remain over whether North Koreans will even be able to watch their country&apos;s matches on television. But at a time where tensions are threatening to reach levels not seen since the 1950s, a successful World Cup for both North and South Korea could go some way to creating a little unity on this torn peninsula.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Football", "World Cup 2010", "Sport", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-19T10:29:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/21/london-market-jitters-european-crisis", "sentences": ["Only shares in Shanghai recovered in late trading, rising 0.24%."], "title": "FTSE 100 hits seven-month low on European debt fears", "article": "The FTSE 100 index in London fell through the 5000 mark today for the first time since last November, as the European debt crisis continued to haunt stock markets around the globe.

The sell-off came despite news this morning that Germany&apos;s parliament had approved a bill that allows Germany to contribute to the \u20ac750bn (\u00a3650bn) rescue package for the eurozone drawn up with the International Monetary Fund a fortnight ago. Bank of Japan governor Masaaki Shirakawa added to the tension by warning that financial markets &quot;remain unstable&quot; due to the Greek debt crisis.

David Cameron met German chancellor Angela Merkel today while Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, will present his proposals to overhaul the eurozone at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, the second this week. Berlin has tabled a nine-point plan rewriting the euro regime to include legally enshrined budget deficit ceilings in all 16 member countries. The German demands, in a finance ministry paper obtained by the Guardian, could require the EU&apos;s Lisbon treaty to be renegotiated. In what appeared to be a concession to her centre-left opposition, Merkel vowed yesterday to fight for a global tax on bank transactions at the G20 summit next month. Berlin has also proposed a radical shift in the rules governing the single currency by insisting struggling eurozone countries be allowed to restructure their debt. Sch\u00e4uble argues that that if the G20 effort fails Europe, or at least the eurozone, should go it alone. The wave of selling came amid growing fears that the Greek debt crisis could spread to other countries in Europe and trigger a spiral of losses for banks, endangering the still fragile global economic recovery. An unexpected increase in US unemployment yesterday added to the gloom. The crisis in the eurozone and Germany&apos;s shock decision to impose a unilateral ban on naked short-selling \u2013 a strategy designed to profit from falling markets \u2013 drove shares in London down to 5,000 yesterday for the first time since November. Sch\u00e4uble defended Germany&apos;s actions yesterday, saying: &quot;If you want to drain a swamp, you don&apos;t ask the frogs for an objective assessment of the situation.&quot; Gary Jenkins at Evolution Securities said: &quot;True. But if the frogs are an integral part of your financial and economic system you may want to consider the implications of your actions before you act.

They had given up hope of ever being parents \u2013 which was devastating for both of them, as they were both from huge families (my mum had six brothers, and my dad had eight sisters and two brothers).  &quot;My parents were bikers \u2013 they had a Norton, a classic old English motorbike. My dad wore all black leather and my mum wore all white. They were going to ride their Norton from one end of Italy to the other \u2013 their compensation for being childless. My dad loved Italy, and could speak fluent Italian because he was there in the war from the invasion of Sicily to just before the liberation of Rome. Then I came along.  &quot;They sold the Norton and my mum put me on her lap. Then she read to me. Endlessly. Rupert the Bear, mostly. And I fell in love with reading, and books, and stories on my mother&apos;s lap. &quot;Troubled males have always fascinated me. Nothing gets under my skin quite like a boy or a man \u2013 or a male bear, like Rupert \u2013 who is working through his problems, and trying to make sense of the world and his place in it. Troubled males just ring some inner bell. We all like to read about what we know.&quot; \u00a0 1. Peter Pan in Peter Pan and Wendy by JM Barrie Wild, love-starved and cursed with eternal youth, the boy who can never grow up is now 100 years old, yet somehow becomes more relevant with each passing year. Forget Disney; forget grinning boys in green tights with American accents. Peter Pan is infinitely more complex than that. When he flashes his milk teeth at Mrs Darling, they are snarling fangs.  2. Magwitch in Great Expectations by Charles Dickens From the moment he grabs Pip by the throat in a graveyard until the time he sneaks back from Botany Bay to reveal himself as the young man&apos;s secret benefactor, Magwitch is one of the great tormented souls in literature. Violent, uneducated, blundering, yet full of love and desperate to do one good thing in his life. 3. Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in The Rye by JD Salinger Holden is the original crazy, mixed-up kid and anyone who can recall the agonies and ecstasies and endless yearning of adolescence will see themselves in him. But you have to read him at 16. Come to Holden later, and it&apos;s like trying to hula-hoop for the first time when you are 40. You just can&apos;t get it.  4. Dean Moriarty in On The Road by Jack Kerouac Dean - Neal Cassady&apos;s fictional alter ego - is the friend we all want; the great enabler of adventures, leaving love and home behind to answer the call of the wild. We love this restless, reckless boy even more when we see him all forlorn with empty pockets at the end of the rainbow. His fall somehow gives us permission to go home in time for our tea.  5. Jake in The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway The Hemingway hero with the most undiluted Hemingway in him. A hard, hairy nut with a soft, sentimental centre, Jake travels from Paris to Spain and never wavers from his credo of two-fisted machismo and profound feelings of sexual inadequacy. His platonic love for Lady Brett Ashley and his total lack of self-pity make him Hemingway&apos;s most likeable hero.  6. James Bond in You Only Live Twice by Ian Fleming 007 at his most suicidal. This is the mission in Japan when Bond is recovering from the death of his wife. He is shattered physically, spiritually and emotionally. Fleming&apos;s greatest book sees James as less of a killing machine, more of a nervous wreck, sedating himself with murder, hard booze and mechanical sex. He was never more tortured, and never less like Roger Moore. 7. Jim in Empire of the Sun by JG Ballard Ballard&apos;s memoir of invasion and internment in war-time Shanghai has young Jim at its centre. Unlike the real-life Ballard, Jim has to get through the second world war without his parents. Somehow, this stroke of the fictional brush makes an already incredible story even more compelling. Jim is a typical English schoolboy waking up one day to discover that he is in hell, and totally alone.  8. The Man in The Road by Cormac McCarthy McCarthy pours every fear and anxiety of the modern father into The Man, who must make his way through a wrecked world with his son. He is the measure of our inability to protect our children from all that is rotten in the world, and you can hear his soul weeping.  9. &quot;You&quot; in Bright Lights, Big City by Jay McInerney McInerney&apos;s second-person masterpiece follows the modern male from drug-crazed hedonism all the way to his mother&apos;s deathbed.

The 23-year-old man fell to his death at Foxconn&apos;s Longhua factory in Shenzhen on Wednesday night, the state news agency Xinhua reported. The news came hours after the corporation&apos;s boss said he feared there could be more deaths. The company, a subsidiary of the Taiwanese firm Hon Hai, is said to be the world&apos;s largest contract manufacturer of electronics. It supplies global brands including Apple, Dell, Nokia and Hewlett-Packard. In a mark of Foxconn&apos;s desperation it is installing nets around nearly all dormitories and factory buildings, according to the state news agency. Labour campaigners argue that Foxconn&apos;s mostly migrant workers are vulnerable because of their 10-hour working days and the monotony of their jobs. They say many feel isolated and pressured by a strict regime that bans them from speaking on the production line and takes them far away from their families. They argue that although the basic salary of 900 yuan (\u00a391) per month is above the legal minimum, workers find it hard to live on and are driven to labour for 60 hours a week to gain overtime pay. Despite this, some workers say that conditions and wages compare well with other manufacturers. This week the secretive company arranged an extremely rare tour of the Longhua complex as it sought to counter criticism. Longhua is thought to be the largest factory in the world. It covers more than a square mile and contains fast food outlets, stores and banks as well as the huge production buildings and dormitories. Hon Hai&apos;s chairman, Terry Gou, told reporters he could not sleep because of the suicides and dreaded answering his phone out of hours in case it was news of another death. &quot;I&apos;m not confident we can stop every case. But as a responsible employer we have to take up the responsibility of preventing as many as we can,&quot; he said. Gou apologised for a letter asking workers to promise not to kill themselves and to accept that their families would not receive extra compensation if they did so. He said he would withdraw the letter. Workers reacted angrily, although Professor Michael Phillips, a suicide prevention expert, said it appeared to be in part a &quot;non-suicide contract&quot; \u2013 used by practitioners treating suicidal patients in the past but now regarded as ineffective. Phillips said he had been &quot;really disturbed&quot; by widespread Chinese press reports that families were receiving 100,000 yuan compensation. &quot;Advertising that is not a good thing, because some of these people are very poor and it will be more than their lifetime&apos;s salary,&quot; he said. He warned that workers would probably be reluctant to use a new counselling service and helpline because they would fear others would find out and that it could affect their jobs. Apple said it was &quot;saddened and upset&quot; by the suicides and that a team was independently evaluating Foxconn&apos;s measures to halt the problem. &quot;We are in direct contact with Foxconn senior management and we believe they are taking this matter very seriously.&quot; A Dell statement said it investigated any reports of poor working conditions, expecting suppliers to employ the same standards as the company itself. Phillips, the director of suicide research and prevention at the Shanghai Mental Health Centre, warned that halting further attempts would be difficult. &quot;It&apos;s not something you can stop in its track; it gathers a momentum of its own,&quot; he said. He said that once a cluster emerged the achttp://spike/content/12t &quot;becomes in a sense an accepted or known way for expressing distress&quot;. A 2008 Lancet paper co-authored by Phillips suggested that the annual suicide rate in China stood at 11.8 people per 100,000 between 2002 and 2006. The Longhua plant has 300,000 workers; a third of Foxconn&apos;s global workforce and roughly equivalent to the population of Leicester. Foxconn has said that in previous years it had one or two such deaths. &quot;I don&apos;t think there is any doubt that this is a cluster,&quot; said Phillips. The Associated Press has reported two worker suicides at Foxconn plants elsewhere in China. This article was amended on 1 June 2010. An editing error meant that a quotation in which the speaker professed himself &quot;really disturbed&quot; by Chinese press reports of 100,000 yuan compensation for families was wrongly attributed to Hon Hai&apos;s chairman, Terry Gou. A line about suicides in China 2002-2006 omitted to make clear that the rate shown was per year.

Bookmakers had already been reporting considerable support \u2013 &quot;a gargantuan gamble&quot; according to William Hill&apos;s Kate Miller \u2013 today for Jan Vermeer ahead of next Saturday&apos;s big race, who is now incredibly the 11-4 favourite from 6-1 with Hills and cut across the board with all firms during the morning. It seems increasingly clear that Jan Vermeer is now a definite runner at Epsom and momentum seems to be building behind the idea that there might be a chance Johnny Murtagh will switch to ride the colt instead of drifting market-leader St Nicholas Abbey \u2013 who is already out to as big as 3-1, having been cut from 9-4 to 2-1 by Ladbrokes only yesterday. Surely nobody can be surprised that Ballydoyle have decided that the colt is too good to go to France though - the stable&apos;s runners in the Prix du Jockey-Club have tend to be second-division stuff in recent years and Jan Vermeer looked distinctly premier league to me at the Curragh on Sunday. Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler Ever since he once publicly embarrassed me for not wearing a tie to some dinner at Newmarket racecourse (it said &quot;smart casual&quot; on the invitation, for goodness sake \u2013 how was I supposed to know that it meant everyone apart from me would be wearing a suit?), I&apos;ve held a grudge against Sir Mark Prescott. However, unlike some, I can still recognise that he is a very talented trainer, to whom there is much more than the skill of getting late-developing middle-distance types well handicapped. Prescott&apos;s team have been busier than usual so far this month with the stable having plenty of runners and although the winners haven&apos;t exactly been flowing in, he enjoyed a decent victory at Brighton yesterday and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see a couple more successes there today. Cafe Elektric (2.30) is the first foal of the stable&apos;s Shanghai Lily, unbeaten as a two-year-old, and she has reportedly been showing up particularly well in her homework. Staying at Brighton, I have a few concerns over whether the ups and downs will be suitable for the enormous Aestival (3.40), who also had entries up at Ayr today which I personally thought looked to be better options. However Seb Sanders has always ridden this track well and I expect to see him have Aestival up towards the front from the start in a bid to make the most of his stamina. He showed plenty of promise seven days ago at Yarmouth despite things not going right in the closing stages when his rider lost the reins and I expect the reason why Prescott has kept this horse in training as a four-year-old despite the scant promise shown in his first two seasons to become more apparent today. The only shame is that he&apos;s odds-on this morning as I was expecting something around the 7-4 mark, which means that even if he wins he won&apos;t be carrying my cash. Paul Hanagan leaves Newcastle early in order to make the journey down the A1 to ride Lady Luachmhar (7.00) for boss Richard Fahey at Pontefract. She looked sure to win more races when third off this mark in a big handicap at Glorious Goodwood last year. Things haven&apos;t quite gone to plan since, but she wasn&apos;t seen to best effect when struggling to get a clear run on her reappearance and this contest should be well within her grasp. Tipping competition, day five We try to pick races that could throw up big-priced winners, so those with ground to make up are still in the contest. But sometimes, as yesterday, those races are nevertheless won by short-priced runners, favouring those at the head of the leaderboard. Sangfroid found a 5-2 winner on the day of his final university exam to take a clear lead into the final day. Meanwhile, DrSativa marked his 39th birthday with a 4-1 winner. Ellandback, stee33, millreef and WalthamstowLad had doubles, despite having no known reason to celebrate life landmarks yesterday. For today&apos;s thrilling climax, we&apos;d like your tips, please, for these races: 4.05 Newmarket, 4.15 Brighton, 5.40 Newcastle. Get those tips in early! In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day (i.e. today). This week&apos;s prize is a \u00a325 bet offered by Paddy Power. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday.

For the next few weeks the face that is revealed to the world, at least as far as football fans are concerned, will for a change not be that of a short, bespectacled dictator. The Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, will be upstaged by &quot;the People&apos;s Rooney&quot;, Jong Tae-se, a steely-eyed footballer full of passion, ambition, power and not a little humour: a popular goalscorer who, if he has his way, will soon be playing in the Premier League. Jong is already a star in east Asia. He took the 2008 East Asian Championship by storm in China; is one of the top strikers in Japan&apos;s J-League; has appeared in television adverts alongside Manchester United&apos;s Park Ji-sung in South Korea; and, most unusually in the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea, where supporters do little more than clap at football matches, has had his name chanted by 80,000 fans at Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang. Now he is ready to take on the world. Jong&apos;s two sumptuous strikes against Greece \u2013 the first a 25-yard shot that crashed in off the bar, the second a fierce strike from a tight angle after a burst of acceleration past a defender \u2013 may even have caused a few frowns in the training camps of World Cup Group G opponents Brazil, Ivory Coast and Portugal. Over green tea in the ground floor restaurant in the Kanagawa Science Park, a hotel in Kawasaki just outside Tokyo where Jong plays his club football, it is hard to stop the 26-year-old talking. In his deep, rich voice, he announces: &quot;I want to score a goal a game at the World Cup, one goal a game, that is my target.&quot; And then? &quot;I want to play in England.&quot; It would complete an unusual journey. Jong was born, raised and still lives in Japan. There were reports in Seoul that his parents were South Korean but the player denies that this is the case and he appeared on the cover of South Korea&apos;s FourFourTwo magazine in 2008 above the headline: &quot;I am not South Korean&quot;. Once he entered the pro-northern education system that operates in Japan&apos;s large Korean community, there was only one team he was going to play for. &quot;I was born as a North Korean and went to a North Korean school just like many people in Japan do and many of my friends did. My mother is from North Korea. My father was brought up in Japan and went to a Japanese school but despite that he thought of himself as North Korean and I do, too.&quot; Midfielder Ahn Yong-hak is another Japan-based North Korea international. Such players, who earn about \u00a34,000 a week, go to Pyongyang on football-related visits only. Their team-mates earn a minimal state allowance and play for clubs such as the army outfit 25 April and Amroggang, one that has produced seven &quot;heroes of the republic&quot; in athletics and football. There is no professional football north of the 38th parallel, where matches draw sparse crowds. There are no divides in the DPRK dressing room, however. &quot;I am not the first North Korean player to be based in Japan and the other players have always been really nice to me. They just wanted to know information about Japan and the J-League \u2026 It was really impressive the way the players welcomed me and the way the North Korean government and people treated me.&quot; Politics is the one issue that Jong will not talk about, on or off the record. Another no-no, though he enthused about it when the recorder was switched off, was the trial he undertook at a Premier League club earlier this year. He will not name the club, but says he realised he was not quite good enough. He believes he can improve, however, and at the World Cup millions of fans around the world will get to see for themselves as he has the chance to compare himself to the best around. He has been nicknamed Inminui Rooney \u2013 the People&apos;s Rooney \u2013 because of his aggressive and hard-working style and stocky build, but he thinks that it is not the best moniker. &quot;I don&apos;t dislike being compared to Rooney, he is one of the greatest strikers in the world so it is a big honour, but my style of play is different to his. My benchmark is Didier\u00a0Drogba. &quot;I want to play in England. When I was at high school, Italy&apos;s Serie A was the most popular league but with the help of cable television, I started watching English football and I really enjoyed the stadiums, the atmosphere and the passion. Years ago, I used to train wearing a Blackburn Rovers shirt.&quot; Was this a common sight? &quot;I don&apos;t think so,&quot; he says, laughing. &quot;In Japan, there were not many people wearing Blackburn shirts. I just went to the shop and bought one because I\u00a0liked\u00a0it.&quot; He may get close to the real thing after the summer. The last North Koreans to play in England famously defeated Italy on their way to a thrilling quarter-final with Portugal in the 1966 World Cup, in which the Asians took a 3-0 lead before losing 5-3. &quot;We know the history of course,&quot; Jong says. &quot;It will be tough to repeat it but we will give everything. Our technique is not better than the likes of South Korea and Japan but in terms of mentality and physicality, we are better than any other in Asia. Nobody really expects us to do much at the World Cup and there will be little criticism even if we lose all the games. If we win, that will be beyond our wildest dreams.&quot; Despite the presence of Drogba in the Ivory Coast team, Jong is more excited about the opening game on 15 June. &quot;I am looking forward to facing all three teams, especially Brazil with their history and football tradition. It will be a great experience to play such a team.&quot; It will be a far cry from the 2007 preliminary qualifier against Mongolia \u2013 the first step on a long road to South Africa. Later came four games against South Korea. When the two teams lined up before an emotional match in Shanghai (the match was moved from Pyongyang as North Korea refused to fly the southern flag or play their anthem) tears rolled down the striker&apos;s cheek. On the back of a solid defence and a quick counterattack, North Korea finished second in a tough final group containing Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and South Korea. &quot;We never really thought about qualification before the final round but game by game we improved a lot and we were able to stop our opponents from playing to their strengths,&quot; Jong says. &quot;I was very happy as qualification progressed because my team-mates were getting better and better.&quot; Claiming the runners-up spot was a tense affair. By the final day, South Korea had already won the group and were taking on Iran in Seoul. An away win would have left North Korea needing a victory in Saudi Arabia. That was on the cards as Iran were leading until Park equalised with nine minutes remaining. It meant that, thousands of miles to the west and a few hours later, North Korea needed only a draw in Riyadh. Jong watched the Seoul match in his hotel room in the Saudi capital as he tried to relax before the game. &quot;Park Ji-sung gave us the best-ever assist. He gave us a great chance. It was so exciting. I was with Ahn Yong-hak and we were hugging each other and jumping up and down when Park Ji-sung scored. We knew that we only needed a draw and I had faith that we could do the job in Saudi Arabia. We play defensively and I knew that few strikers can easily penetrate our defence.&quot; They held out for a goalless draw. &quot;At the final whistle, I was so happy and so excited. I cried for a long time. When we went back to our hotel, we intended to go out for a drink and have a good time but all of us were really tired. We just had dinner and went to bed. &quot;Many of the team went back to Pyongyang and had a great reception. I couldn&apos;t go but as you can imagine as North Korea hasn&apos;t qualified for the World Cup since 1966 then everyone there was so happy when we qualified, so excited.&quot; It was a triumph for the coach, Kim Jong-hun. Little is known about him, other than that he is gruff, likes to wear trenchcoats, and does not take kindly to journalists who refer to his team as North Korea rather than DPRK. His players speak highly of him but the team&apos;s biggest problem, like the coach&apos;s, is a lack of international experience. In the past, friendlies have been as few and far between as visitors to Pyongyang. Nigeria were due to go there in April but backed out when it became apparent that they were expected to bear the costs themselves. The team have not been idle, however, and at least from a football perspective, North Korea are internationalising at breakneck speed with trips to Africa, South America and Europe in recent months. It has not all gone smoothly. A game with Chile was cancelled because of an earthquake in the South American country in February, a game in China was scrapped after food poisoning, and a training camp in Zimbabwe was called off after locals protested about Korea&apos;s planned visit because, back in the early 1980s, North Korea helped to train a Zimbabwean army brigade that slaughtered at least 20,000 Ndebele people in the part of the country where the team were due to train. There is still support from elsewhere, however. Few fans, if any, from the nation itself are expected to go to South Africa but a number from the Korean community in Japan will travel and the Beijing office of the North Korean Sports Committee has given 1,000 tickets to Chinese fans. There is also a Beijing-based international fan group, DPR Korea Football Supporters Association, organised by two Englishmen, who will send 300 fans to cheer the team from all over the world. With South Korea sending just a few hundred Red Devils, due to the cost, distance and fears about security \u2013 widely reported in east Asia \u2013 the North could actually be better supported than their neighbours. But Jong hopes that the 2002 semi-finalists perform well in South Africa and he even has a regular column that appears in the Seoul media. It still continues despite the increase in tension between the two countries. On 24 May, South Korea publicly accused Pyongyang of having sunk the Cheonan, a navy corvette, in the Yellow Sea in March. Forty-six young sailors lost their lives. The chairman of South Korea&apos;s bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Han Sung-joo, a former foreign minister, remains keen to have North Korea involved in the tournament if possible. Jong certainly hopes that it is. &quot;If the World Cup comes to Pyongyang it would be beyond our wildest dreams. The people are already excited about the World Cup in South Africa, having a World Cup on home soil would be something else. It was impressive watching South Korea reach the last four back in 2002 and if North Korea has home advantage then we could perform well also. &quot;It may not be easy politically to be united but sport can unite people. If there are games in South Korea and North Korea, then that can contribute to peace on the Korean peninsula.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 1 June 2010.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World Cup 2010 Group G", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-29T23:07:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/may/30/vietnam-jungle-afghanistan-war", "sentences": ["Communism paused for thought and built a temple of capitalism in Shanghai."], "title": "Vietnam, minus the jungle | Peter Preston", "article": "There is, said the American secretary of defence, no certainty &quot;that a conventional military victory, as commonly defined, can be achieved here \u2026 We seem to have gotten caught in a sinkhole.&quot; He&apos;s talking about Afghanistan surely, as the thousandth US military death is recorded and coalition losses creep towards 2,000? No: that was Clark Clifford in 1968. And the sinkhole that finally cost more than 200,000 American dead and wounded was Vietnam. It&apos;s not a grisly comparison anyone wishes to make, of course. The scale of the casualties doesn&apos;t equate, for one thing. The Afghan terrain is rocky and bare, not steaming, sapping jungle. But pause and shiver a little as some parallels grow. For Vietnamisation, as Richard Nixon&apos;s last desperate excuse for calling the boys home, read Afghanisation. For President Thieu, illegitimate, distrusted, desperate, read President Karzai. For Vietcong troops operating across a fatally porous border, read the Pakistan-based Taliban (currently beginning their summer offensive). And as for &quot;conventional military victory&quot;, forget it. Just remember how Lyndon Johnson, towards the end, effed and blinded about staking so much on a no-account country far away. He&apos;d followed his generals, who had a plan. Send in hundreds of thousands more troops to &quot;finish the job&quot;. Drop many more bombs. Win hearts and minds (where applicable) or at least dish out zillions of extra dollars. But the dreadful truth for LBJ, as for General Westmoreland, was that once the cigarette smoke in the planning rooms cleared, no one was really in control. There wasn&apos;t a plan, let alone a strategy.The top brass couldn&apos;t counsel retreat, because that would mean their own defeat. The president couldn&apos;t give up, because that would be letting his gallant troops down. So the bombing and killing rumbled haplessly on. Ashes to ashes. Meanwhile, back in 2010, David Cameron and his generals are having a country awayday this week to see what (apart from British deaths rising, too) comes next in Afghanistan. US forces prepare for another supposedly make-or-break operation, this time around Kandahar. American missions to Islamabad grow ever more outspoken about Pakistan&apos;s failure to clamp down in north Waziristan, where the man who failed to blow up Times Square got his rather duff training. What lessons work now across four barren decades? Start with the reality that, when Saigon fell, the &quot;domino theory&quot; beloved of the US right fell with it. Communism didn&apos;t gobble up south-east Asia and set sail for San Francisco. Communism paused for thought and built a temple of capitalism in Shanghai. So the reason for going to war in the first place was delusion. Now look at the reason for invading \u2013 then staying in \u2013 Afghanistan at whatever cost. The 9/11 bombers trained there, didn&apos;t they? We must rescue this failed, impossible state to prevent that happening again, to keep Russell Square and Manhattan free from attack. But al-Qaida doesn&apos;t live in Afghanistan any longer. It promptly slipped over that damned elusive border into Pakistan. The bombers who&apos;ve threatened Britain and America since the twin towers have done their O-levels in terrorist studies in the badlands of Pakistan&apos;s north-west. The Taliban who very probably murdered more than 90 innocent Ahmadi worshippers in Lahore last week came down from there for their killing spree. The Taliban leadership that pulls the Afghan campaign strings puts its feet up in Karachi. Why not attack Karachi instead of Kandahar, then? Why not bomb Peshawar, flatten Swat, knock the hell out of Quetta? Because it&apos;s a ridiculous misreading of reality. Pakistan, population spiralling towards 200 million, is a huge, riven nation doing its best now to save itself, let alone Obama&apos;s bacon. It needs help, not state department bullying. But it also needs wider understanding. Simply: neither Islamabad nor Kabul can push some administrative button marked peace and harmony. The turbulence and the poverty don&apos;t allow it. Religious extremism is endemic. Nationalism and resentment of foreign interference are deep rooted. Structured society doesn&apos;t exist where it is most needed. There is no &quot;victory&quot; in one country. There is no western security that can be secured by sending in more drones and CIA operatives. There is only time passing and a long internal march to stability. In short, there is no continuing purpose to the Afghan war (except saving face and wasting more lives).

In a brief visit en route to the meeting of G20 finance ministers in South Korea, George Osborne said: &quot;I am keen on the British economy developing in a way that is more export-driven, with more investment and a different model of growth to that pursued in the last decade or so. &quot;If you are looking at Britain and saying where is growth going to come from, I think exports to an economy the size of China is one place we should be looking.&quot; Osborne said that at present only around 2% of British exports were destined for China. &quot;As it moves from being an nation of manufacturers to a nation of consumers, there is an opportunity for us to sell to China the kind of services and high technology products we excel in,&quot; he added. Earlier this week the European Union&apos;s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation complained China was using a weak currency, state subsidies and export incentives to stoke its economy, while doing little to boost domestic demand and open its markets. In a letter to a formal review of China&apos;s trade policies, John Clarke said that companies believed the business climate was worsening. The chancellor said he had discussed protectionism in his meeting with vice premier Wang Qishan, but played down concerns. &quot;There are always going to be issues around specific companies and specific issues of market access,&quot; he said. But he added: &quot;It&apos;s in China&apos;s and Britain&apos;s interests that we are leading advocates in the world for free trade and confronting forces of protectionism wherever they are found.&quot; While the US and other countries have complained that the renminbi is substantially undervalued, Osborne told reporters the issue had to be seen in the context of broader imbalances. &quot;Countries with high budget deficits need to make sure they can deal with those deficits. Surplus countries also need to play their part in contributing to global growth. That will be one of the big topics for discussion in South Korea,&quot; he said. China has said it is committed to currency reform at its own pace, but it is highly unlikely to allow appreciation to the level sought by others. Osborne also said there was &quot;clearly quite a lot of Chinese concern&quot; about the eurozone&apos;s debt crisis and that it was in everyone&apos;s interests that countries including the UK showed they could live within their means. On global financial regulation, he said he would use the G20 to push for agreements raised last year to be made more concrete. &quot;There will be a period of transition for banks, but we want to end the uncertainty about what those standards are going to be and the sooner we can do that the better,&quot; Osborne said.

A major issue at the forum has been the need to alleviate China&apos;s impending labour shortage. The implications for Central America and other developing countries loom large. It might seem inconceivable that a country with more than 1 billion people would have a labour shortage, but it&apos;s true. According to reports in the New York Times, the shortage is due to two factors: the increase in the levels of Chinese people going through higher education and getting absorbed into the emerging high technology, high value-added sectors of the economy; and the decrease in China&apos;s birth rate since its &quot;one child&quot; policy that began in 1977. At the forum, Min Hua, director of the Institute of World Economy at Fudan University unveiled China&apos;s solution to the problem: the industrialisation of Chinese agriculture and the creation of scores of new cities to absorb the 800 million farmers who will migrate to those cities. That&apos;s right, China plans to move 800 million farmers to existing and newly created cities. If they mechanise the countryside and achieve similar productivity levels to the US, they say, China will only need 100 million people in the rural sector. When the nations of Central America hear about this they will be shaking in their (Chinese) boots. For years these countries have been working to hook their economies to the US market, with a particular emphasis on clothing and apparel exports. Beginning in the 1980s, most Central American nations set up export processing zones that export textiles and clothing to the United States. By 2001, 87% of all El Salvadoran exports to the US were from such zones. For Honduras, 78%, and Guatemala and Nicaragua each export 63% of their exports to the US were from export processing zones. The capstone of such efforts was the Central American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Central American nations (excluding Panama) and the Dominican Republic (Cafta, for short). Cafta, by lowering tariffs and locking in access to the US economy, was supposed to solidify Central America as a clothing hub. Then China crashed the party. In 2001, both China and Central America sold approximately $6.5bn worth of clothing exports to the United States, with each holding approximately 12% of the US market for clothing. In 2004, the year before Cafta went into effect and after China&apos;s WTO entry was in full swing, Central American exports to the US reached $7.5bn and China&apos;s were still in the same order of magnitude at $10.7bn. Yet since Cafta went into effect, Central American exports of clothing to the US have fallen by 25%. How could this happen? Clothing exports to the US from Central America in 2009 were down from $7.5bn in 2004 to $5.6bn but China&apos;s were up to $24.3bn \u2013 a 127% increase for China since 2004. The Central American share of US clothing imports has declined to 8.7%. China now holds 38% of the US import market for clothing.  News of a Chinese labour shortage was thus very welcome in Central America. Central American nations, as well as Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka and some others would stand to gain. Hundreds of millions of &quot;new&quot; low-skilled workers however, could seal Central America&apos;s fate. As Roberto Porzecanski and I argue in our forthcoming book on China and the future of industrial competitiveness in the Americas, these trends are not reason to point fingers at China. Rather than bashing the Chinese, Central Americans, not to mention nations such as Mexico that have chosen a &quot;low-wage export to the US through free trade agreements&quot; development strategy, developing nations should look to learn from China.  Both China and the Americas have been globalising their economies for 30 years. China has adopted a strategic and gradual approach to globalisation where the government plays a key role, the Americas have practised the Washington Consensus of rapid trade and investment liberalisation and yanking the government from economic affairs. China has turned out to be the best globaliser in the developing world.", "tags": ["International trade", "China", "US economy", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-05T17:00:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/06/china-fashion-designer-shops", "sentences": ["James Dorn, a China analyst for the Cato Institute, said: &quot;When I first visited China in 1988, most people in Shanghai were still riding bicycles and wearing poorly made clothing.", "Today, Shanghai is a vanguard city, and the rich and growing middle class demands top-quality fashion, homes and cars.&quot; Last month, celebrities including Marion Cotillard and Charlize Theron joined John Galliano, the creative director of Christian Dior, for the French fashion house&apos;s debut show in Shanghai.", "Obviously Shanghai has more clients today, but a city like Guangzhou has fantastic potential.", "It&apos;s the first time we have seen so many cities with big potential.&quot; Tom Ford, the former creative director of Gucci, is rumoured to be eyeing sizable retail spaces in Shanghai.", "Called the Blue collection and consisting of 12 different pieces, the line is currently on sale only at Dior&apos;s revamped Shanghai shop."], "title": "Leading British fashion brands entice China's  nouveau riche", "article": "For decades western fashion brands have looked to China for cheap materials and labour.

It is estimated that the Chinese bought $7.5bn worth of luxury products last year. &quot;We estimate retail sales will grow 16-18% this year,&quot; says Jessica Lo, of the China Market Research Group. A report published by McKinsey last autumn predicts that consumption will double in China&apos;s 100 biggest cities between 2008 and 2015.\u00a0 &quot;China can no longer be seen as just a low-cost production centre. Consumers are getting wealthier and shopping more, they remain optimistic about the economy and their own job prospects,&quot; Lo said. &quot;Eighty per cent of women told us they would spend more in the next six months than they did in the last six months. Consumers in less famous cities like Chongqing are spending a lot, too.&quot; Toledano echoes this observation: &quot;It&apos;s rather consistent. Obviously Shanghai has more clients today, but a city like Guangzhou has fantastic potential. It&apos;s amazing. You can see so many cities with potential for luxury. Even in Europe... if you take England, for example, frankly outside of London it&apos;s much more difficult [than in China] to find shoppers interested in luxury goods. It&apos;s the first time we have seen so many cities with big potential.&quot; Tom Ford, the former creative director of Gucci, is rumoured to be eyeing sizable retail spaces in Shanghai. And, fellow Los Angeles-based shoemaker George Esquivel plans to open his first stand-alone store in Beijing later this year. Lo warns that western brands should not bank on Chinese consumers directly paralleling European and American shoppers when it comes to taste and aesthetic appetites. &quot;Many western companies forget to localise both their styles as well as advertising. They use celebrities and images that work in the UK and Europe, but that don&apos;t resonate with Chinese consumers. It is critical that companies get the right product selection and style and advertising image.&quot; Levi&apos;s has announced that it will debut a new brand this summer exclusively for China. The company is also planning to expand its number of stores in China from 20 to 1,000 by 2015. Dior has also introduced items made exclusively for the Chinese market. Called the Blue collection and consisting of 12 different pieces, the line is currently on sale only at Dior&apos;s revamped Shanghai shop. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say there&apos;s one theme; China is a heavily fragmented country with a heavily fragmented consumer base,&quot; says Cody Ross, who has been selling his avant-garde brand Priestess in China for the past three seasons. &quot;In terms of design and silhouette I have certainly tailored to local taste. For instance, I did a Qipao dress: it&apos;s a traditional Ching dynasty dress, demure and conservative. A lot of designers have adapted looks because the Chinese are obsessed with history and dynasty, and that&apos;s always sort of the Zeitgeist.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Vivienne Westwood", "Fashion", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-05T23:06:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/07/chinese-city-worlds-largest-mechanical-clock", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s a delightful position to be working with them 100 years later and still looking after all these pieces.&quot; The clock on the customs house on Shanghai&apos;s Bund was made by JB Joyce and Co, now part of the group."], "title": "Chinese city gets world's largest mechanical clock", "article": "It combines 150 years of expertise with cutting-edge racing car technology and makes Big Ben&apos;s clock look diminutive. Workers are this week beginning to install the world&apos;s largest mechanical clock in the unlikely surroundings of Ganzhou, a city in southeast China. The faces are 13 metres in diameter \u2013 almost twice the size of those on the Houses of Parliament tower \u2013 while the minute hand is 7.8 metres long. It may be a classic example of China&apos;s ambition, but the clock was made in England by the family firm Smith of Derby. Founded in 1846, the company also has timepieces in St Pancras station and St Paul&apos;s Cathedral. The firm said the last time it built a large mechanical clock from scratch was in the 1950s, although it has continued to refurbish and repair them. In recent years most people have opted for cheaper, lighter electric versions. The \u00a31m project has required new technology as well as historical expertise. &quot;When you get beyond a certain scale, the complexity and difficulty becomes magnified beyond the degree to which [a clock] is larger,&quot; said Jonathan Betts, senior specialist in horology at the National Maritime Museum in London. &quot;It becomes much heavier than the size would suggest, because there is so much more mass to it.&quot; Traditional steel hands would have weighed around 2 tonnes each. Instead, Smith turned to EPM Technology, a Derby firm that creates carbon fibre panels for F1 cars. It used its expertise to make hands weighing a mere 65 to 70kg (about 150lb). The four giant clock faces were produced by Yantai, a 95-year-old Chinese firm. &quot;The greatest challenge was to make it safe [given its size],&quot; said Bob Betts, managing director of Smith of Derby. He pointed to the 1976 incident in which Big Ben&apos;s clock mechanism exploded. &quot;The [other] unusual thing is that it&apos;s exquisite \u2013 it has to look lovely because it&apos;s on public display.&quot; The tower includes a viewing gallery so visitors can inspect the movement, which is made from hardened steel with bronze finishing and brass and gold-plated components. The clock is the largest of its kind in the world when measured by size of dial and hands and has taken a year to design and build. Despite weighing 10 tonnes it was flown to China to meet the customer&apos;s deadline. Staff from Smith have travelled to Ganzhou to install it in the 113 metre high Harmony tower, at the heart of a new development described as part business, part residential and part horologically themed park. The clock will be unveiled at the end of the month and the tower opened to the public next year. The timepiece is accurate to within 30 seconds a month and uses GPS technology to correct itself. It comes with a 100-year guarantee, though the company says it should last much longer. &quot;We were doing pieces in China 100 years ago,&quot; said Betts. &quot;It&apos;s a delightful position to be working with them 100 years later and still looking after all these pieces.&quot; The clock on the customs house on Shanghai&apos;s Bund was made by JB Joyce and Co, now part of the group. Other timepieces were destroyed in the turmoil of the last century, but Betts said several cities were interested in reinstalling them. &quot;Low technology is not always bad, especially if you want it to last for a very long time,&quot; said Jonathan Betts, who is not related to the Smith of Derby boss. &quot;As long as you don&apos;t want something that gives you the time to within 1/1,000th of a second, mechanical clocks are a very good option. They have centuries of working life in them.&quot; He added that people also found the artistry behind them compelling. &quot;Even on the most basic level they capture people&apos;s interest: to see these entirely man-made objects with lives of their own,&quot; he said. A spokesman for the Ganzhou Expressway Company, which is developing Harmony park, said it chose a mechanical clock because it wanted a historical feel and turned to the UK on the advice of experts. The firm hopes the tower will be morally improving as well as useful. &quot;Not only will it record the time, but it will also remind people not to waste time,&quot; said the spokesman.", "tags": ["China", "Manufacturing sector", "UK news", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-07T20:00:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/08/politicians-ties-green", "sentences": ["The PM donned a shiny lime number to greet the president of the EU on Monday, while George Osborne bustled around Shanghai last week wearing viridian."], "title": "Politicians' ties: why green is the new purple", "article": "&apos;You can&apos;t break the ties that bind,&quot; sang Bruce Springsteen, and very likely the coalition government was listening.

But over the last fortnight, in a display of unprecedented solidarity, Tories and Lib Dems have switched to matching knots of green. Leading the revolution is Cameron, who has sported neckerchiefs from chartreuse to teal.

I would really appreciate advice on how much money I will need. I am also wondering what internal rail travel is like in China (including cost), or whether flights or buses are sometimes preferable? Lewis, London Although China is not fantastically cheap, you can get by on less than \u00a325 per day. To do this, use cheaper classes of trains or buses, spend less time in big cities where your money doesn&apos;t go as far, eat from street stalls and stay in backpacker accommodation like dormitories, hostels or cheap guesthouses, which abound particularly in south-west China. Over eight weeks, this budget would add up to \u00a31,400 spending money, not including flights. If you could get up to \u00a32,000, you&apos;d be able to fund more expensive jaunts like a flight or train to Lhasa in Tibet. I covered the logistics of travelling to Tibet back in April. Train is the best way to get around between principal towns and cities. There are a growing number of high-standard day and sleeper services serving key destinations from Beijing such as Shanghai and Xian. In most cases, however, you&apos;ll find regular Chinese trains \u2013 &apos;T&apos; or &apos;K&apos; prefixed services \u2013 more than fit for purpose. Many western travellers opt for soft seat class (soft sleeper on overnight journeys), which consists of a four-berth compartment, but the next class down, hard sleeper is much used by budget travellers on longer journeys too, offering six bunks in open compartments. Hard seats on slower trains tend to be the cheapest option but are not much used by visitors as they can be very crowded and noisy. To give you an idea of cost, if you book and pay locally for a hard sleeper from Beijing to Xian, it will cost in the region of \u00a330 one-way. You can get an excellent overview of train services with pictures and fares at Seat61.com. For long-distance services, you should book a few days ahead if possible (agencies like china-train-ticket.com can help), and expect things to be seriously crowded during Chinese New Year, around May Day and the National Day holiday week around 1 October. Buses will often be cheaper and are not a bad alternative for travellers on a budget, but comfort on long journeys should also be considered. You&apos;ll find modern sleeper buses on more popular routes. We have a week in August when someone can look after our farm for us. We can fly to Jersey from Blackpool on jet2.com for 99p (\u00a373 in all), but would we find it boring, overcrowded and unpleasant? We wouldn&apos;t normally dream of going away in August (or going to Jersey for that matter), but it&apos;s our only chance of getting a holiday this year and we don&apos;t want to go anywhere too hot, too far or too expensive. Jane Ruthven, by email Jersey isn&apos;t boring \u2013 at least I didn&apos;t think it was \u2013 but I liked the areas away from St Helier better and would recommend staying in St Aubin which is quieter, smaller and has more character. August is, however, peak season so expect accommodation to be more expensive than at other times of year. The Old Court House Inn has doubles from \u00a3130 in August. A week on Jersey may be stretching things, so consider making your trip a Channel Islands tour. Once you&apos;ve seen the principal museums on the island and Mont Orgueil Castle, you can try your hand at kayaking, windsurfing and cycling. There&apos;s also a handsome Victorian sea-fed swimming pool in St Helier. Take a ferry on to Guernsey (condorferries.co.uk; \u00a336 return for foot passengers) where you can explore the lovely cobbled streets of historic St Peter Port, try a spot of surfing at Vazon Bay and visit the island&apos;s Shipwreck Museum. Add a day on Sark seeking out hidden beaches and La Seigneurie Gardens and Maze and you have a full and fun week that will leave the crowds behind whatever time of year you travel. I am a backpacker, currently in Indonesia. Phone calls home are ridiculously expensive and one of my fellow travellers suggested that I sign up for a Skype account, and then my calls will cost only two cents per minute. Well, I did that, and indeed I got a very cheap call and was happy about that. But now I am increasingly worried. I used a public internet shop computer to sign up and am concerned that my Skype account information is accessible to the store&apos;s owner or to anyone using the computer. I am even concerned that they can get my credit card information that I used to open the account. Robb Schwartz, by email I asked Skype about this, who say that as every account is protected by a unique user name and password, provided you logged out then you shouldn&apos;t have anything to worry about. Subsequent users of the PC you were using will not be able to access your information. If you left your account logged in, or think you may have, the risk is still low but the best course of action is to change your password and for peace of mind you might also make a call to the card company to check for unexpected activity. There&apos;s much more on Skype-specific security at skype.com/security. In general, this is a timely reminder for anyone using internet cafes or public computers to close down their sessions before leaving the PC. I am looking to book a holiday to either Orlando or Los Angeles for myself, my husband and our seven-year-old daughter, for next April during the two-week Easter holiday. My problem is, I keep reading how it is essential to hire a car in either destination and I am not confident enough to drive in a foreign country. My husband does not drive and I would be happier going somewhere where there is reliable public transport for seeing all the sites. Which destination would you suggest for us?Melinda Austin, by email There&apos;s no denying that a car is helpful for both destinations, in particular if you&apos;re trying to cover plenty of theme parks in a short space of time. However, you can have a superb time without one. Of the two, Orlando works a little better. Choose a hotel that is centrally located, either on or close to International Drive. Many hotels use the services of a shuttle bus or operate their own to get to and from all the major parks including Disneyworld. Some of these buses visit lots of hotels, so be prepared for slow starts and ends to your journey. There are also public buses (golynx.com) \u2013 a particularly useful one is Route 50, which goes along International Drive, passes Sea World and terminates at the Ticketing and Transport Centre for the Magic Kingdom and EPCOT Center. However, not all Disney park entrances are accessible by public transport and for these you will be reliant on the shuttles mentioned above. If you are planning to concentrate solely on Disney parks, you would be better off opting to stay in a hotel within the park, from where the transport provided is excellent. You&apos;ll find it difficult to do much outside of Orlando and the Disney parks without joining a tour, so going to the beach will prove tricky. Los Angeles downtown is 26 miles from the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, so you might consider dividing your time between family-friendly Santa Monica or attraction-packed Hollywood and staying around Anaheim for Disney. From Hollywood you can easily reach Downtown and Universal Studios by public transport. \u2022\u00a0Tom is on holiday next week.

He is \u2013 with Kafka and Borges \u2013 one of those few writers who can only be properly described by using an adjectival form of their surnames. The word &quot;Ballardian&quot; conveys dystopian modernity, claustrophobic psychodrama and the alienating, pathologising impact of technological advancement on the human psyche. Ballard began publishing short stories in the 1950s, selling them to SF magazines such as New Worlds and Amazing Stories. Many readers disliked his enigmatic, literary take on the genre, as he noted in 2006: &quot;Most readers of science fiction did not consider me to be a science fiction writer. They saw me as an interloper, a sort of virus that had got into the cell of science fiction, entered its nucleus and destroyed it.&quot; Despite this friction, Ballard was no Atwood \u2013 he remained &quot;very proud&quot; of being considered a science fiction writer. The medical metaphor above, incidentally, is typical of Ballard. Following the second world war, after leaving his birthplace of Shanghai and moving to England, he studied medicine with the aim of becoming a psychiatrist. If a reader didn&apos;t already know that, they could surely deduce it. Traversing the 1500 pages of the two-volume Complete Short Stories (which is misnamed \u2013 some are missing), psychoanalysis soon emerges as what &quot;science&quot; really means in Ballardian science fiction. Just as his The Atrocity Exhibition (1970) sees characters&apos; malfunctioning nervous systems externalised as highways, office buildings and helicopters, so throughout his work do psychological pathologies manifest as &quot;real world&quot; events. As China Mi\u00e9ville wrote in a recent piece for the Nation, the observation that Ballard was more interested in inner space than outer space &quot;suggests nothing much new, but it is a good bon mot and deserves to be repeated&quot;. Ballard&apos;s fascination with Freud \u2013 he called him, only half-playfully, &quot;the great novelist of the 20th century&quot; \u2013 and Freud&apos;s artistic progeny, the surrealists, resulted in the domination of his work by symbolism and febrile mental states. Like the rampant sonic sculpture of Venus Smiles (1957), these intertwined drives grow over everything else in Ballard&apos;s short fiction, which is peopled less by characters than by aggregations of psychosis, anxiety and desire. Ballard took time to get good. While some of the early stories house tremendous ideas \u2013 a society where timekeeping is banned; a city where space is so scarce that broom cupboards are envied addresses \u2013 they are frequently sabotaged by clunky twists. One early story, The Voices of Time (1960), breaks this sequence, looking forward to later developments in the same way that The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race (1966) points to the paranoid satiric excess of The Atrocity Exhibition and 1977&apos;s The Dead Time tentatively excavates memories more fully explored in The Empire of the Sun (1984). With its obsessive psychiatrist, its symbols cut into empty swimming-pool floors, its derelict weapons ranges and scenes of grotesque biological entropy, The Voices of Time surveys the zones into which Ballard&apos;s fictions would move later in the decade, and the dense network of leitmotifs with which he would populate them. Most importantly, the story shows him gathering the confidence to at least partly abandon plot. This development was of key importance in abetting the obsessive, destabilising atmosphere his later work would create. That atmosphere is nowhere more pervasive than in The Atrocity Exhibition (1969). Both novel and story collection \u2013 Ballard preferred the former definition, but each of its chapters or &quot;condensed novels&quot; had been published individually as stories in the years prior to its release \u2013 the book moves through a cycle of psychotic fantasies and bizarre experiments enacted by Traven, a somewhat unbalanced mental-hospital psychiatrist who first appeared in the extraordinary 1964 story The Terminal Beach. Throughout the collection Ballard&apos;s relentless repetition, which boils down to a series of symbols copiously deployed throughout his work (nuclear test atolls, deserted weapons ranges, dead astronauts, dead wives, the &quot;psychic zero&quot; of the desert, those haunting multitudes of drained swimming pools), takes on the eerie power of those depopulated afternoon piazzas portrayed by De Chirico (a painter whom Ballard, a particularly visual writer, frequently referenced alongside Ernst, Dali and Delvaux). What might be tedious in other writers becomes mysteriously freighted, his world ushered into life not with broad sweeps but with bullet-pointed, monomaniacal repetition. The book surveys the politics, sexuality and psychopathologies of the 60s and in doing so looks back across the decade to its closest cousin, Naked Lunch. Ballard has a much-vaunted reputation for prescience, which is borne out by such stories as The Subliminal Man (advertising), The Watch-Towers (surveillance Britain), and the wonderful The Illuminated Man (ecological doom). Ballard himself rejected the judgment, claiming he didn&apos;t forecast future developments but wrote about the world around him \u2013 and yet modern life continues to converge, in remarkable and troubling ways, with his vision. As I was writing this, I learnt of a Channel 4 programme to be broadcast this summer in which a passenger jet will be crashed into the desert to analyse how planes react in such circumstances. Was news of the real occurrence of this supremely Ballardian metaphor a coincidence? &quot;Deep assignments run through all our lives,&quot; he wrote in 1990. &quot;There are no coincidences.&quot; The man is gone, but his strange world remains.", "tags": ["JG Ballard", "Short stories", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Science fiction"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-10T15:24:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/11/honda-china", "sentences": ["This week, workers at a Taiwanese rubber products factory in Shanghai rallied for higher wages."], "title": "Chinese workers strike at Honda Lock parts supplier", "article": "Chinese workers marched out on strike at a Honda parts supplier today as the swelling wave of labour unrest in the workshop of the world raised the prospect of fairer wages for local employees and an end to cheap products for western consumers. Following industrial action this week at foreign-invested plants in Jiangxi and Xian, labourers at Honda Lock in Zhongshan, Guangdong province, demanded a pay rise and improved collective bargaining rights. About 500 workers demonstrated outside the gates of the Sino-Japanese joint venture and said they wanted to elect their own representatives rather than accept the so-called &quot;enterprise union&quot; imposed on all factories in China by owners and the communist party. Riot police blocked the road and management representatives used loudhailers to warn of &quot;serious consequences&quot; before the crowd dispersed without a resolution. Workers want greater negotiating rights and a rise in the base salary from 1,500 yuan (\u00a3100) a month to 2,000 yuan, but they say the management has conceded little ground. &quot;They have no sincerity at all. They only agreed to increase wages by 100 yuan. We&apos;re very disappointed,&quot; a 27-year-old migrant worker from Guangxi province told the Reuters news agency. &quot;If we don&apos;t resolve things by tomorrow, we probably won&apos;t go back to work for another week.&quot; The rally is the latest of at least five strikes at foreign firms in the past two weeks. Honda has been the focus of most unrest. Two suppliers \u2013 of exhausts and transmissions \u2013 have just resumed production after earlier stoppages. Honda said employees of Foshan Fengfu Autoparts agreed to a pay raise of 366 yuan, an increase of about 23% on the previous monthly salary. Japan&apos;s Brother Industries also announced the end of a week-long strike that halted assembly lines at its sewing machine factory in Xi&apos;an, the provincial capital of Shaanxi. While Japanese companies appear to be the most affected, they are not alone. This week, workers at a Taiwanese rubber products factory in Shanghai rallied for higher wages. Late last month, the South Korean carmaker Hyundai promised a 25% pay rise to curtail a strike by 1,000 employees at a supplier in Beijing. The electronics company Foxconn, which has been hit by a spate of suicides, has promised to increase salaries at its Shenzhen plant by nearly 70% if workers meet certain conditions. Industrial unrest has broken out sporadically in China for many years but labour activists say the latest cluster of strikes represents a new trend as workers organise more effectively and ask not just for pay rises but structural reforms allowing them to engage in collective bargaining. In several cases, workers have clashed with the institutionalised unions that are supposed to represent them, but are actually often appointed and funded by managers, and beholden to the governing Communist party. In the latest strike, employees hired a legal consultant \u2013 Professor Chang Kai of Renmin University \u2013 to advise them in negotiations. He framed the unrest as a traditional class conflict. &quot;Workers now realise that they can&apos;t protect their rights as individuals so their awareness of the need for collective action has increased,&quot; Chang told the domestic media. &quot;In the case of Honda, the behaviour of the unions makes us wonder what position unions should take in the conflict between workers and capitalists.&quot; According to labour activists, strikes have been on the increase since a major demonstration in 2008 by workers at Yantian port in Shenzhen, which is owned by Asia&apos;s richest man, Li Ka-Shing. Liu Kaiming, director of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, a labour rights group in Shenzhen, said: &quot;That was the tipping point because they demanded their own representatives. Workers in China are becoming more and more powerful. They are not just asking for higher wages; they are asking for an elected union. Their appeal is not just about individual issues \u2013 they are asking for collective rights and benefits.&quot; Demographics have strengthened workers&apos; bargaining power. A bulge in the working-age population is tapering off and a new generation of rural migrants are less willing to accept the poor conditions that their parents endured. This has prompted speculation that the era of cheap Chinese labour may be coming to an end, which could add to inflationary pressures across the globe, reduce the competitiveness of mainland products, and make the government in Beijing more reluctant to increase the value of the yuan. Foreign labour rights activists, however, were cautious about predicting a transformation in the balance of power between labour and capital. Geoff Crothall, of China Labour Bulletin, said: &quot;It is too early to say this is a tipping point. Millions of workers are still willing to work on a low wage out of economic necessity. There is still an oversupply. But the trend is clear: more workers are unwilling to work for low pay in bad, often dangerous, conditions. They are more discerning than in the past and more willing to face up to management.&quot;", "tags": ["Honda", "China", "Automotive industry", "Manufacturing sector", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-11T13:38:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/12/rereading-julia-lovell-lu-xun", "sentences": ["Rebellious young men (and, increasingly, women) now gathered in Beijing and Shanghai, baying for the end of old China: denouncing the horrors of Confucian tradition, demanding westernisation and free love, worshipping Goethe, Byron, Shelley, Ibsen.", "Throughout his supposed conversion to communism, he continued to shelter in semi-colonial Shanghai&apos;s urbane foreign concessions: enjoying family life, browsing in favourite bookshops, going to Tarzan movies."], "title": "Rereading: Lu Xun's The Real Story of Ah-Q and Other Tales of China", "article": "To no one&apos;s great surprise, communist China&apos;s 60th anniversary National Day celebrations last autumn passed in a fizz of self-congratulation: 200,000 soldiers, 100,000 civilians, 80,000 schoolchildren, 4,000 musicians and 60,000 doves and balloons were marshalled, after months of rigorous training, to hymn the greatness of the Motherland and the wisdom of its rulers.

All this patriotic bluster drowns out a far more interesting story of modern China: the angry complaints (generated by Chinese writers, thinkers and ordinary citizens) at the poverty, injustice and political violence that have scarred the country for much of the past 100 years. And anyone wanting to get a sense of the despair that gripped it for large parts of the 20th century and which still lurks behind the country&apos;s resurgent fa\u00e7ade should probably start with the short stories of one of the country&apos;s founding modernist authors: Lu Xun. At his birth, in 1881, Lu Xun&apos;s future as a professional iconoclast would have looked implausible. The grandson of a grandee in the Beijing civil service, he emerged into the vanishing glories of the fin-de-si\u00e8cle empire. He was schooled in the cultural archaisms of the Chinese classics \u2013 even though he always preferred his nurse&apos;s stories of ghosts and demons lurking in the back garden. He played at being a good Confucian son for as long as he could bear to: studying for the imperial civil service examinations, submitting to a loveless arranged marriage with an illiterate woman. But through his teens, the gentility of Lu Xun&apos;s early years faded into impoverished disgrace. The decline of his establishment clan seemed to mirror China&apos;s own unhappy predicament in the dying years of the 19th century, as apocalyptic millenarians and greedy imperialists threatened to dismember what, only 100 years before, had been one of the largest and richest empires in the world. In 1899, Lu Xun became one of many young, restive Chinese men of his time who turned their backs on the Confucian traditions that seemed to have led China (and his family) into disaster. He plunged into western learning \u2013 English, and political and natural sciences \u2013 at one of the country&apos;s new academies. His family was unimpressed: his mother wept at his decision to &quot;sell his soul to foreign devils&quot;, while an uncle ordered him to change his name, to avoid further disgracing the clan. He won a scholarship to study medicine in Japan \u2013 a country that Chinese radicals regarded with awe for its success in reinventing itself as a modern, imperialist nation. &quot;A glorious future unfurled in my mind,&quot; he remembered, &quot;in which I would return to my homeland after graduation and set about medicating its suffering sick . . . all the while converting my fellow countrymen to the religion of political reform.&quot; In 1906, though, at the end of a biology lecture, one of his Japanese teachers showed the class a slide depicting a scene from the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05, partly fought on Chinese territory. A crowd of Chinese people watched appreciatively while one of their compatriots was beheaded by the Japanese as a Russian spy. &quot;Every face was utterly, stupidly blank . . . I no longer believed in the overwhelming importance of medical science,&quot; Lu Xun later recalled. &quot;However rude a nation was in physical health, if its people were intellectually feeble, they would never become anything other than cannon fodder or gawping spectators . . . The first task was to change their spirit; and I decided that literature and the arts were the best means to this end.&quot; A few months after this Damascene moment \u2013 the most famous conversion in modern Chinese literature \u2013 Lu Xun abandoned his medical studies and began a career as self-appointed literary physician to China&apos;s spiritual ills. It took a decade for the rest of China to catch up with Lu Xun&apos;s born-again radicalism. For 10 years he brooded on the sidelines, seeing a magazine venture fail, his books languish unsold, his essays go unread. As the last dynasty fell in the revolution of 1911, and the republic that succeeded it splintered into warlord regimes, Lu Xun holed up (with more than a touch of Gothic self-pity) in a haunted courtyard apartment in Beijing, perusing antiquarian books, editing classical texts, reconstructing ancient tombstone inscriptions. But by 1917, the country&apos;s cultural temperature was changing. Rebellious young men (and, increasingly, women) now gathered in Beijing and Shanghai, baying for the end of old China: denouncing the horrors of Confucian tradition, demanding westernisation and free love, worshipping Goethe, Byron, Shelley, Ibsen. Pretty much at this moment, Lu Xun found his voice and his audience, generating for the country&apos;s radical journals dozens of brief, barbed polemical essays (on feminism, on the uselessness of Chinese men, on nationalism, on his moustache) and, between 1918 and 1925, two volumes of short stories, Outcry and Hesitation. These piercing snapshots of early 20th-century China are set, for the most part, very specifically in the landscapes of Lu Xun&apos;s childhood on the south-eastern coast: in the mansions of its complacent gentry families; in its wind-lashed fishing hamlets; in its isolated, impoverished mountain villages. But Lu Xun&apos;s ambitions are far more general: to illuminate the social and political darkness in the China that he observed around him. In &quot;Kong Yiji&quot; (told across five brutal pages by a callous child narrator), a crowd of boneheaded drinkers revel in humiliating the village failure, roaring with laughter at the discovery his legs have been broken by the local magistrate. In &quot;Medicine&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, children are allowed to die of superstition: a tubercular boy is fed a supposedly miracle cure \u2013 a bread roll dipped in the blood of an executed revolutionary. &quot;The Real Story of Ah-Q&quot; \u2013 Lu Xun&apos;s best-known fictional creation of the idiotic Chinese everyman \u2013 follows with sardonic delight the stupidities and indignities of this mock-biography&apos;s subject, a man too witless even to realise he is going to his own execution. Within a few years of his invention, Ah-Q had begun to enter the Chinese language as shorthand for every imagined blemish on the national character: its obsession with face; its superiority complex; its servility before authority and cruelty towards the weak. When they were first published, Lu Xun&apos;s short stories were unorthodox in their language, as well as their worldview. Until the 1910s, aspiring literati devoted themselves to writing poetry, in an elliptical classical Chinese infused with millennia of allusions; vernacular fiction was scorned as a disreputably popular form. Lu Xun saw things differently. To him, imperial China&apos;s archaism was a grand conspiracy to silence the uneducated majority. &quot;We have two choices,&quot; he wrote. &quot;To cling to our classical language and die; or to throw it aside and live.&quot; Cast in a new, modern vernacular, his short stories declared to readers, for almost the first time, that fiction could serve sophisticated, serious purposes. In the Chinese literary canon, Lu Xun is (to reach for a rough European analogy) Dickens and Joyce rolled into one: a mercilessly acute observer of the era he lived through; and a remaker of language and form. Finding European models to explain Lu Xun is not as western-centric as it may sound. Like many of his contemporaries, Lu Xun devoured foreign literature, in Chinese, Japanese and German translations from English, French, Russian. One of his first publications was a translation \u2013 from the Japanese \u2013 of Jules Verne&apos;s De la Terre \u00e0 la Lune. And traces of his international reading habits are everywhere in his fiction. The foreground noise we rightly hear in the western media about draconian censorship by the Chinese government sometimes drowns out the fact that \u2013 outside the anomaly of the Maoist years \u2013 Chinese literary culture over the past century or so has been just as cosmopolitan as its British or American counterparts, if not more so. Communist China&apos;s curious posthumous cult of Lu Xun tells us a good deal about how Mao and his successors have tried to cope with the writer&apos;s argumentative brand of intellectual independence. Like many patriotic writers of his time, Lu Xun began to look leftwards after the rise to power of the repressively rightwing Nationalist party in the late 1920s. But he never became more than a fellow-traveller to Chinese communism, and a half-hearted one at that. Throughout his supposed conversion to communism, he continued to shelter in semi-colonial Shanghai&apos;s urbane foreign concessions: enjoying family life, browsing in favourite bookshops, going to Tarzan movies. He remained, throughout his life, pessimistic about the relationship between writers and politics, predicting (accurately) that the revolution would obliterate literature. By the time of his death from tuberculosis in 1936, he was rowing furiously with the party&apos;s cultural apparatchiks. As soon as he was dead, though, and unable to bite back in one of his vicious polemics, he was adopted by Mao as &quot;the saint of modern China&quot;, as an exemplary servant of the proletariat. Since Mao commandeered him for communism, an entire Lu Xun industry has grown up: museums, plaster busts, spin-off books, journals and television adaptations, all loudly chorusing Lu Xun&apos;s great revolutionary contributions to the nation. Generations of schoolchildren have been forced to memorise his most famous works. Entrepreneurial developers have even created an arrestingly tacky theme park offering tourists the &quot;Lu Xun experience&quot; \u2013 the chance to meet actors hamming it up as the author&apos;s most famous characters and generally to savour the horrors of pre-communist &quot;feudal society&quot;. But Mao&apos;s glorification of Lu Xun ironed out the writer&apos;s spikiness and consigned his critical impulses to the dustbin of history. &quot;Under the rule of dark forces, Lu Xun rightly fought back with burning satire and freezing irony,&quot; Mao explained in 1942, on the edge of his first &quot;rectification&quot; of those demanding freedom of expression. &quot;But in our communist bases, where democracy and liberty are granted in full, we do not need to be like Lu Xun.&quot; But even decades after Mao started removing the sting from Lu Xun, official discomfort with the writer&apos;s dissident tendencies remains. In 2007, the beginnings of a Lu Xun withdrawal from Chinese school textbooks began, partly to make way for escapist kung fu texts. Perhaps the intention was to vary the literary diet of the young; or perhaps to redirect their impressionable minds from Lu Xun&apos;s moody introspection towards a more exuberant self-confidence. Perhaps also it was an attempt to discourage the youth of today from Lu Xun&apos;s inconveniently fault-finding habits. One of the excised works was a bitterly sad 1926 essay written to commemorate a female student killed by government forces in a peaceful demonstration \u2013 an inconvenient foreshadowing of the 1989 Tiananmen repression that the party is anxious to erase from public memory. With the PRC now in its swaggering 60s, I would prescribe \u2013 to counter the excesses of Beijing bombast \u2013 a stiff dose of Lu Xun: for his intensely crafted, sympathetic insights into the blackness of modern China; and as a biographical lesson in the Communist party&apos;s energetic, though unsuccessful efforts to neutralise the country&apos;s critical conscience.

With greater concentration his work could be even better,&quot; judged his English teacher. Ballard grew up in Shanghai and was interned with his family in a Japanese camp during the second world war. His recollections were the basis for Empire of the Sun. He moved to Britain, and by the 1960s had become a full-time author.

Similar outbreaks ignited by disputes over land, food prices and poll results across the divided Fergana valley in 1990 and 2005 eventually subsided, with or without the type of foreign intervention sought at the weekend by the interim government in Bishkek. But these precedents offer scant comfort to the big powers \u2013 Russia, China and the US \u2013 whose economic, security and strategic interests are increasingly affected by central Asian instability. Kyrgyzstan&apos;s unresolved problems, including extreme poverty, poor education levels among the rural majority, complex ethnic and tribal rivalries, north-south divisions and the spread of extreme Islamist ideology mean the next crisis is never far away. Russia is widely believed to have triggered the latest upheavals by undermining the now deposed president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Moscow&apos;s motives include control of key energy and transit routes and a desire to maintain, or restore, political pre-eminence in the former Soviet sphere. It is intensely wary of perceived Chinese and American regional encroachment. But speaking after Russia helped consolidate the April putsch that overthrew Bakiyev, President Dmitry Medvedev tacitly acknowledged the perils inherent in the interventionist policy espoused by his prime minister, Vladimir Putin. &quot;We wanted to intervene in a situation that is ultimately another country&apos;s sovereign affair in order to prevent bloodshed,&quot; Medvedev said. &quot;As for whether this kind of situation could arise in other countries in the post-Soviet area \u2026 anything is possible \u2026 [It] could repeat itself anywhere.&quot; Moscow now appears reluctant to face the consequences of its actions, declining a request for Russian peacekeepers and referring the crisis to the hitherto toothless Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) of former Soviet republics. Conversely, it may be gratified by the reaction of other central Asian leaders. As MK Bhadrakumar, an Indian former diplomat noted in Asia Times, a rattled President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan dropped everything and hurried to Moscow after the Kyrgyz coup. &quot;Karimov is a shrewd observer of regional politics. Of late Tashkent has been gravitating towards the west but the turmoil in Bishkek underscores Moscow&apos;s unique role as the preserver of regional security,&quot; Bhadrakumar said. China has been more circumspect, issuing platitudinous, non-judgmental statements calling for a peaceful resolution. But the crisis has shown why it cannot remain indifferent or aloof. Kyrgyzstan, itself an important trade partner, stands astride vital routes to China&apos;s central Asian export markets, notably Kazakhstan. More significantly, given the recurring unrest in China&apos;s western, largely Muslim province of Xinjiang, the ethnic Uighur population of Kyrgyzstan is estimated at up to a quarter of a million. That makes the country&apos;s stability a key security concern for Beijing. Author Richard Lourie, writing in Moscow Times, said a new &quot;great game&quot; was underway in central Asia. During the first world war, he said, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany had tried to instigate a Muslim jihad against British India, a gambit Punch magazine dubbed &quot;Deutschland \u00fcber Allah&quot;. Now China feared similar Islamist agitation spreading from the Fergana valley into its territory. &quot;Unstable countries like Kyrgyzstan could become the base and refuge for Uighur insurgents,&quot; Lourie said. China was also mindful to defend its spreading pipeline network in central Asia. &quot;China recently broke the Russian monopoly on energy transmission in the region, completing a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to western China that crosses through nominal Russian allies like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan \u2026 Logic will dictate protecting those costly and valuable assets. That&apos;s when an ethics-free Chinese foreign policy might suddenly seem less appealing [to regional governments],&quot; Lourie said. Like Russia&apos;s toothless CSTO, the crisis has left the much vaunted, Beijing-sponsored Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, comprising central Asia states, also looking ineffectual and irrelevant. According to Richard Weitz, writing in the The Diplomat, the SCO&apos;s underperformance has raised questions about what use it may be in defusing future, possibly bigger regional challenges. Amid these complex machinations and calculations, the Obama administration, not for the first time, looks like something of a helpless bystander, a naif abroad in a wild land. The US military base at Manas, logistically important for Afghan war supplies, is Washington&apos;s foremost Kyrgyz concern, whatever it may mumble about self-determination and human rights. But the implications of April&apos;s Russian orchestrated putsch, like the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, were slow to dawn on a bumbling White House, and amid deteriorating security Manas&apos;s long-term future is now clouded in doubt. So, too, is the reform schedule for a new Kyrgyz constitution and autumn parliamentary elections.

The discussions are designed to clear the way for a possible multimillion dollar deal with the cable news company CNN, which is believed to have approached Morgan about hosting a primetime interview slot. Morgan, who lost his job editing the Daily Mirror six years ago after publishing faked photos of British troops abusing Iraqi prisoners, is believed to be optimistic about reaching a deal with CNN which could involve him replacing veteran presenter Larry King. He wants to combine a CNN contract with his work on America&apos;s Got Talent, which is produced by his friend Simon Cowell. Morgan will hold urgent talks with senior figures at NBC about his role as a judge on the talent show, one of the network&apos;s most popular programmes. It is likely that NBC will seek assurances about his workload. Morgan is likely to step down as a judge on Britain&apos;s Got Talent, the UK version of the show, in order to fit the CNN programme into his schedule. The CNN deal, which could be worth up to \u00a310m over three years, would confirm Morgan as one of the most recognisable faces on US television. King made his name hosting a radio talk show and has hosted a daily interview slot on CNN since 1985, but ratings have tumbled in recent years. Morgan, 45, who reinvented himself as a TV personality and author after he was sacked from the Mirror in May 2004, is also believed to be close to signing a separate two-year deal with ITV, which screens Britain&apos;s Got Talent, which will free him from his obligation to appear on the show. His existing ITV contract expires next month. A source spoke of &quot;very positive&quot; talks about a slate of shows. Although the details of the ITV deal are unclear, it is likely to include a further two series of Piers Morgan&apos;s Life Stories, each running to 12 episodes. Past guests have included Katie Price, Joan Collins and Gordon Brown, and the show has won reasonable-sized audiences. More than four million viewers tuned in to watch Morgan&apos;s February interview with Brown. It is understood that ITV has also agreed to commission several one-off travel documentaries starring Morgan, similar to those screened last year on Dubai, Shanghai and Las Vegas. A spokesman for ITV declined to comment. Morgan will move to New York if negotiations are successful, although CNN&apos;s parent company, Time Warner, has not confirmed that an offer has been made. Some of CNN&apos;s biggest stars, including the veteran news reporter Christiane Amanpour, have left in the last 12 months. Audiences for Larry King Live fell to an average of just over 650,000 viewers in May, according to market research company Neilsen, its worst performance in nearly 20 years. Morgan&apos;s decision to walk away from Britain&apos;s Got Talent is a headache for ITV, which may have to find two replacement panellists. Cowell, the show&apos;s creator, has hinted that he may also quit as a judge. ITV has yet to agree a deal with Cowell over his role on The X Factor, ITV1&apos;s other Saturday night ratings winner, which starts filming in the autumn. It is still talking to Cowell about the amount he will be paid to star in the show and is also holding separate negotiations with the show&apos;s makers \u2014 Cowell&apos;s production company Syco and Talkback \u2014 over the 2010 series.

And on Monday, his firm, The Weinstein Company, took it in the neck from the man claiming credit for both writing and directing duties on the forthcoming Fraggle Rock film, who went public with his anger over a decision to apparently cut him out of the creative process. &quot;Harvey is a cheater in the eyes of many Chinese moviemakers,&quot; said the filmmaker Feng Xiaogang at the weekend, launching a highly public attack on the US producer who founded Miramax, and later The Weinstein Company, with his brother Bob. Feng said Hollywood executives were interested in buying Chinese films only as a symbol of friendship, but without the intention of selling them and thus helping China&apos;s film industry grow. He dismissed two Weinstein-backed films, Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, two of the highest-grossing Chinese language films of all time, as &quot;Hollywood movies&quot;. &quot;They&apos;re not Chinese movies,&quot; he added. Feng&apos;s attack was all the more remarkable because Weinstein himself had only just left the stage at the Shanghai event, excusing himself to catch a plane after making a brief appearance. He had been on hand to discuss his forthcoming second world war-era thriller, Shanghai, starring Gong Li and John Cusack, which screened at the festival on Sunday night, and had spoken positively about Chinese film and The Weinstein Company&apos;s interests in the region. &quot;It seems to me that in the last five years Asia and China in particular are on the cutting edge of things,&quot; he said. &quot;We intend to buy and make more movies in the area.&quot; Weinstein must have just about arrived home in the US when Corey Edwards published a post on his blog attacking The Weinstein Company for deciding to hire a new screenwriter to work on the forthcoming live-action movie version of Fraggle Rock, the much-loved Jim Henson TV show. Edwards, who says he has a contract to direct the film, and had penned a script, said: &quot;Not to be too alarmist, but I am struggling to stay in control of my own movie at this point. The Weinstein Company gives me no confidence these days. Why? For starters, they have begun the search for a new writer, presumably to rewrite my entire script from scratch. &quot;This is happening behind my back, without consulting me or even asking my opinion. I enjoy working with other writers and have no doubt that the RIGHT person could help make any script better. But to not even ask me?&quot; Edwards, the writer and director of the poorly received 2005 animated tale Hoodwinked, went on to decry the main suggestion from the Weinsteins \u2013 that his story was not &quot;edgy&quot; enough. &quot;That&apos;s the note,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s what they are trying to do to the Fraggle Rock movie. EDGE it up! &quot;WHAT is edgy?? Faster edits? Rock music for the score? Boober wearing some gangsta bling? I have no idea. What I DO know is that the word &apos;edgy&apos; should not be anywhere near this movie.&quot; So far Weinstein has not made any public response to either attack, though the producer is used to shrugging off negative publicity. He was painted as an overbearing figure in Peter Biskind&apos;s book Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film, which included a claim that Weinstein and Quentin Tarantino fought over the former&apos;s efforts to cut the length of one of his movies.

Coming a day after the premier, Wen Jiabao, made similar comments, the editorial suggests the authorities may be encouraging businesses to restructure the economy by putting less emphasis on cheap exports and more on higher-value goods and domestic consumption. For most of the past 30 years, China&apos;s economic growth has been fuelled by low-cost migrant labour. This has helped raise national competitiveness, attract foreign investors and keep consumer prices lower across the world. But members of a new generation of migrants are less willing to endure hardship and many have successfully gone on strike to demand better conditions. Without mentioning strikes, the People&apos;s Daily said China should adjust to a tighter labour market by improving skills, creating more service-sector jobs and giving workers more cash to spend. This echoed a speech a day earlier by Wen, who said a new generation of migrant workers should be given improved conditions . &quot;Your work is glorious and should be respected by society at large. Migrant workers should be cared for, protected and respected,&quot; he told workers at the construction site for the No 6 subway in the capital. &quot;The government and the public should be treating young migrant workers like their own children.&quot; According to labour activists, there have been numerous strikes in recent years, though few get reported in the media. Chang Kai, professor of labour relations and law at Renmin University, said the number had increased by 30% per year. Their impact has grown as the &quot;one-child&quot; family planning policy starts to thin the bulge in the working-age population. This demographic change in the balance of labour supply and demand has added to improved worker organisation and greater activism at high-profile foreign firms. Japanese firms have disproportionately been the focus of the reported strikes. The Toyoda Gosei car parts plant, in Tianjin, was shut down by a strike this week until the management promised to negotiate higher wages. Three Honda plants in Guangdong have been affected, along with a Hyundai factory in Beijing and a Taiwanese rubber products manufacturer in Shanghai. According to Xinhua news agency, the fast food franchise KFC has conceded to a union demand for minimum monthly pay of 900 yuan (\u00a390), up by 200 yuan. In most cases, however, workers have organised outside the unions, which are seen as close to management and the party. This has sparked commentaries in local media urging unions to mediate more effectively between workers and employers. Having seen how the Solidarity movement in Poland helped to overthrow a communist government that stopped representing its interests, China&apos;s leaders do not want to alienate the labour force.

There are on-the-hoof shots and darkroom experiments; large photographs and small; intimacies and distances. There is a photograph of a young man&apos;s ear, caught by the clippers while having his hair cut; there is a shot of a forest in Tierra del Fuego, the trees blitzed by light and shade. All this might be bewildering: the jumps in scale, the sheer variety of Tillmans&apos;s subject matter, his different means of presentation (huge sheets of photographic paper hung from bulldog clips, other things taped directly on to the wall, work sitting in Perspex boxes). But it is all orchestrated with a sense of rhythm, pace and surprise. For Tillmans, photography can be a record, something observed or something never seen before. It can also be painting by other means: pinkish fields with sudden judderings that recall skin seen close up; strange abstractions generated by the random dirt on the silver drum of Tillmans&apos;s printer (and which recall the squeegeed abstractions of Gerhard Richter, whose art is also much concerned with the relationship between painting and photography, intention and meaninglessness). Some of his photographs are near-monochromes, recalling thin shadows crossing the walls in a pale room, or the acid lighting on a highway at night. Sometimes it is hard not to think of paintings by Ellsworth Kelly or Raoul de Keyser. Here is a still life, an accumulation of little objects on a window sill: a conker, an acorn, a key, some lenses, a number of stainless steel sex toys for stretching your balls. (At least that&apos;s what I thought they were. When I asked him, Tillmans called me a pervert. He was right.) Elsewhere, there is a small image of a naked man on his knees. He might be praying. Weirdly, it looks more like a pallid ink drawing or a water-colour than a photograph. In fact, it is a\u00a0faded fax, a degenerated thermal image of a photograph now fixed for ever on the verge of disappearance. Somehow everything makes a kind of sense. The cumulative effect of Tillmans&apos;s art may be puzzling, but it isn&apos;t a puzzle. Its logic lies in process rather than in the production of telling images. The differences in his work are themselves the point: from his coloured rectangles dancing on the Serpentine gallery&apos;s white walls (they make your eyes dance, too) to the wonky, knocked-together tables that stand in the middle of one room, laden with cargoes of text, newspaper pages, printed ephemera. Here is an article on religion by Polly Toynbee, commissioned by Tillmans for an edition of Die Zeit he guest-edited; there is a piteous image of two young men \u2013 little more than boys \u2013 about to be hanged in public for the crime of homosexuality in Iran; here is an article by Tillmans himself, a keen amateur astronomer, on the 2004 transit of Venus. What is the carpet tile doing among all this stuff, on one of the tables, a blank square of pixellated industrial flooring? If art can talk about the world, the big question is where to stop. What do you include and what do you exclude? Sometimes, and especially in photography shows, you can end up going from one damn thing to another, driven by the hope of finding something salacious, erotic or just plain peculiar. Tillmans does his best to call a halt to such aimless gawping by constantly giving us things that need to be approached and looked at in different ways \u2013 as images, as constellations of pictures, as objects. For some artists, doing one thing well is enough. But photography \u2013 perhaps more so than painting \u2013 allows for many different kinds of incidents and singularities. The great pleasure of this exhibition is its orchestration of different registers and voices. The last big Tillmans show I saw, in Berlin in 2008, was called Lighter. Walking through it, I felt heavier and heavier: it was so full of stuff, it was hard to hold the logic of it all in one&apos;s head. Retrospectives often fall into this trap. The smallness of the Serpentine gallery demands much tighter editing; the space edits the work as much as the artist. Tillmans&apos;s show was hung and finished two days ago, but late on Tuesday night the artist decided to rearrange part of the hang. Things aren&apos;t right until they&apos;re right, and rightness seems to be a big issue for the artist. The big problem, of course, is what happens when the crowds pour in. You lose all those perfect sightlines. The extreme variety of Tillmans&apos;s work, with its different printing techniques and technologies, makes for a fascinating show on many levels. There are luscious photographs and dirty faxes, photocopies that accentuate the dismal Edinburgh light and glossy prints that bring out the unpleasant glamour of Shanghai by night; there is a vivid cyan blue invented in the darkroom and too artificial to be the sky. It is all here. These could, of course, all be exercises in style: I can do this, and this, and this; you can have it this way or that. You want abstract? I can do abstract. You want gritty, or sexy? Well,\u00a0here they are. But there is more to Tillmans&apos;s work than formal intelligence. He wants it all, and why not?", "tags": ["Wolfgang Tillmans", "Art", "Photography", "Installation", "Sculpture", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-23T20:30:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/24/world-cup-2010-denmark-japan", "sentences": ["&quot;Why oh why am I stuck watching this in Shanghai (work, grr) when I could be home in tokyo?&quot; blubs Ganesh Sethuraman."], "title": "World Cup 2010: Denmark v Japan - as it happened | Simon Burnton", "article": " So, in brief: Denmark must win. Japan can draw.  In a bit more depth: Denmark were disappointing against Holland, and then poor again against Cameroon until Dennis Rommedahl decided he was Jairzinho, perhaps the most unlikely event in this most improbable of World Cups. But that 2-1 win alone won&apos;t do: they must follow it up with more of the same against an impressive Japan side. As their coach Morten Olsen said: &quot;Both teams have fought hard to get to this party \u2013 the World Cup is a party \u2013 and when we are here, we must have ambitions.&quot; So must the Danes have ambitions because they fought hard to get here, or because it&apos;s a party? I&apos;m guessing that Olsen is a uniquely ambitious party guest. I&apos;m picturing Olsen listing the night&apos;s ambitions to himself in front of a mirror before departing to soir\u00e9es. &quot;Right, it&apos;s Mike&apos;s annual fancy dress do. I want to get there by eight, impress everyone with my hand-made gorilla suit, win the costume-of-the-night award, pick all the cashews out of the mixed nuts and be out of there by half past 10.&quot; That kind of stuff. As for Takeshi Okada, &quot;we have to score,&quot; he says (which could easily be one of Olsen&apos;s party ambitions, really). &quot;I told the players that we should not think about any draw,&quot; he added. So that means we&apos;re in for some damn fine excitement, then. In other news, according to a survey by the Danish postal service, more Danes would like to get a postcard from Daniel Agger than any other player.  The big pre-match question was: Will Nicklas Bendtner be fit? The big pre-match answer is: Yes he will! Denmark: Sorensen, Jacobsen, Agger, Kroldrup, Simon Poulsen, Jorgensen, Christian Poulsen, Kahlenberg, Tomasson, Rommedahl, Bendtner. Subs: The rest of &apos;em. Japan: Kawashima, Komano, Nakazawa, Tanaka, Nagatomo, Hasebe, Matsui, Abe, Endo, Okubo, Honda. Subs: Everybody else. Referee: Jerome Damon (South Africa).  Suspension update: Also, Simon Kjaer \u2013 the Danish centre-back who contributed to their comeback against Cameroon with probably the pass of the tournament to release Rommedahl before their first goal \u2013 is suspended. Fiorentina&apos;s Per Kroldrup, who Everton fans may remember with a shudder, replaces him. &quot;As a Fiorentina fan, I am intimately familiar with his epic fail as a centre-back,&quot; writes Angharad. Apparently he&apos;s known as &quot;The Krolmonster&quot;. Be afraid, be very afraid.  And out come the teams! That&apos;s all I&apos;ve got to add at this point, really.  Danish anthem-singing: 6/10 really. Everyone&apos;s singing, but none of them with any particular gusto.  Japanese anthem-singing: 5/10. A couple of them a barely even moving their lips, and as for the coach, well...  1 min: Peeeep! And they&apos;re off!  3 min: Steve Wilson hails Denmark&apos;s &quot;tremendous World Cup pedigree&quot;. This is presumably based on the fact that they have never failed to progress past the first round, on any of the four occasions (out of 14 attempts) they have actually qualified. They have, though, had the first shot of the game. If the goal tripled in size, it still wouldn&apos;t have been on target.  5 min: A testy opening. Denmark have had the majority of possession, and on their three forays forward have so far overhit a shot, a cross and a through-ball, one each.  6 min: &quot;That Japanese national anthem was actually written by a guy from my hometown, Cork,&quot; reports Josef O&apos;Shea. &quot;His name was John William Fenton and his story was a bit like that of the Tom Cruise character in that terrible Last Samurai movie. Only with a violin rather than a rifle and far less scientology.&quot;  7 min: Poulsen&apos;s cross takes a deflection and looks like it will drop perfectly for Jon Dahl Tomasson, but he tries an ambitious overhead, about six yards out, and it all goes a bit wrong.  9 min: &quot;Surely a liberal, cosmopolitan paper like the Guardian should be above such petty nationalism as anthem singing?&quot; complains Franckie. Hey, if they&apos;re going to sing &apos;em I&apos;m going to mark &apos;em.  11 min: The referee, a South African, is running around the pitch telling people to get up. Poulsen goes down at the edge of Japan&apos;s penalty area and gets nothing. Japan break, Honda eventually going down on the right touchline. He gets nothing either. Both definitely fouled, Poulsen in a very tasty location.  12 min: Eventually Japan do get a free-kick, and the referee promptly books Yasuhito Endo for time-wasting before he takes it.  13 min: Incredibly lucky save! Yoshito Okubo floats in a nice ball from the left, Matsui gets on the end of it and sends it goalwards but it just clips Thomas Sorensen&apos;s knee and deflects to safety.  14 min: Japan miss another decent chance (sorry for the lack of coverage of that one) before Tomasson is played in down the left side of Japan&apos;s penalty area and rolls a low, lazy shot across goal and just \u2013 just, though \u2013\u00a0wide of the far post. Wide open spaces at both ends, promisingly.  GOAL! FREE-KICK OF THE TOURNAMENT SO FAR! Denmark 0 Japan 1 (Honda, 17)Keisuke Honda, 30 yards out, sends a left-foot shot arcing perfectly into the far corner. Sorensen took a decisive half-step to his left before flinging himself, in vain, to his right. You could blame the keeper if you like, but it&apos;s one hell of a strike.  21 min: Ross Bremner in New York had just mailed concerning the players&apos; problems controlling the Jabulani, but it does seem like they&apos;ve got the hang of it \u2013\u00a0Honda&apos;s strike is decent evidence, but Fabio Quagliarella&apos;s brilliant effort for Italy earlier pretty much definitively proves it&apos;s possible.  22 min: Excellent chance for Denmark! Christian Poulsen dinks the ball into the penalty area; Tomasson reaches it, but then misses it.  24 min: One highlight so far is Bendtner&apos;s hilarious last-moment high-speed back-stick arrivals whenever Denmark have a corner \u2013 none of which has gone anywhere near him. I&apos;ve not noticed it in Denmark&apos;s previous matches.  26 min: Another Japanese player booked for time-wasting, this time Yuto Nagatomo, who dallied over a throw-in midway into his own half.  28 min: &quot;Just wondering if you, or any or your MBMers, know what the black &apos;webbing&apos;, for want of a better word, is on the back of Hasebe&apos;s jersey, the Japanese No17?&quot; asks Joe Buggy. &quot;I saw Malouda and some of the other French players sporting such gimickery also.&quot; I&apos;ve no idea. Anyone?  28 min: Denmark still having most of the possession, but Japan working like busy little bees to stop any of it from being particularly useful. The upshot is lots of people trying to play in their strikers with ambitious 50-yard passes.  29 min: Kroldrup booked for quite cynically pulling Honda back, 20 yards from goal. Another wonderstrike in store?  GOAL! ANOTHER EXCELLENT FREE-KICK! Japan 2 Denmark 0! (Yasuhito Endo, 30) Everyone assumes Honda&apos;s going to have another pop, but instead Endo steps up and curls it beautifully over the wall and into the far corner with his right foot.  32 min: &quot;The black webbing is Adidas&apos; Tech Fit Power Web, as anybody would know who followed yesterday&apos;s Germany v Ghana,&quot; snarks Radbert Grimmig.  34 min: &quot;Shame to see Thomas Sorenson getting beat around like this,&quot; writes William Agger, as Denmark prepare their first substitution. &quot;He&apos;s always been one of my favorite goalkeepers in the English game, mostly because he looks like Val Kilmer. Guess that&apos;s not enough now, is it?&quot;  34 min: Martin Jorgensen is coming off for yet another Poulsen, Jakob this time.  36 min: Denmark&apos;s primary concern will be maintaining their optimism. They&apos;ve been incredibly unlucky that, having had much less of the ball, Japan have curdled in their two shootable free-kicks in the first half-hour. It can&apos;t have been Japan&apos;s gameplan. If it was, it wasn&apos;t much of one.  39 min: Robin Van Persie has scored for Holland. &quot;Am I right that yellow cards don&apos;t reset until after the quarterfinals?&quot; asks Jonathan Francis. I don&apos;t think you are, Jonathan \u2013 isn&apos;t it after the round of 16? Anyway, do go on. &quot;If so, then two bookings in five matches results in a suspension, right? Why does FIFA not realize that we want to see the best players play, not sit on the bench because an overly-sensitive referee thinks taking an extra five seconds over a throw is grounds for a booking?&quot;  40 min: Another Japan free-kick! No idea what it was for, we were watching some highlights instead of the match, for some reason. Ruddy miles out, mind.  41 min: A rubbish cross, as it turns out. They don&apos;t get them all right.  42 min: Japan swing in a cross from the right, which Yoshito Okubo tries to slam home with a glorious scissor-kick. He gets nowhere near the ball, of course, but it&apos;s tricks &apos;n&apos; flicks time for the Japanese now, isn&apos;t it?  44 min: Christian Poulsen has a decent shot on target, though given that he took it from about 50 yards out the keeper had time to have a sandwich before catching it.  44 min: Full-back Yuichi Komano breaks into the area and slams in a high shot from a sharp angle that&apos;s tipped over the bar.  45 min: &quot;How can you talk about Val Kilmer look-alikes without mentioning Sergio Ramos?&quot; asks Charles Cameron Dunn, the second vote for Ramos on the Kilmerlike front.  45+1 min: Japan are &quot;almost on another planet tonight&quot;, says Martin Keown. As I&apos;ve said before, they&apos;re a bit lucky to have produced two wonderstrikes but their work rate has been very impressive, and with the Danes feeling pretty unhappy they look like running away with it now.  45+2 mins: Peeep! That&apos;s half-time then folks. Denmark have a lot of work to do in the next quarter-hour, I&apos;d say.  An email! &quot;Nothing wrong with a gameplan that relies on scoring from free-kicks. It got England to the 2002 World Cup,&quot; says Mark Gillies. True enough, Mark, true enough.  Another email! Jonathan Francis was right \u2013 the yellow card amnesty only kicks in after the quarter-finals.  The pundits add: Sorensen&apos;s getting a bit of a rollicking for imperfectly lining up the wall ahead of Japan&apos;s second free-kick. True, they stuck a short lad on the end and could have done with taking a couple of steps to their left, but I think the free-kick would have gone over them anyway.  Yet another email! &quot;As an Asian myself, i&apos;m a little offended when you considered Japan&apos;s two wonder goals as lucky,&quot; writes Pangeran Siahaan. Just to be clear: the goals weren&apos;t lucky at all, they were brilliant, but it&apos;s a bit lucky to hit two brilliant free-kicks. Anyway: &quot;I believe you never watch the legendary anime Captain Tsubasa. In that cartoon, they score goals like that on daily-basis.&quot; I have never heard of said cartoon, I must admit. In other news, the players are back out.  46 min: Peeeep! They&apos;re off! Again! Denmark apparently came out five minutes early for the second half. I&apos;m not sure what the significance of that is, but there must be one.  48 min: Japan hit the post with another free-kick! From about 60 yards! It was just an overhit cross from Yasuhito Endo, but Sorensen doesn&apos;t move an inch until it&apos;s right on top of him and he pushes it, desperately, onto a post.  49 min: &quot;Always thought actress Nancy McKeon of 1970s-1980s US sitcom The Facts of Life was the classic Val Kilmer look-a-like,&quot; writes Noah. Denmark have a chance to shoot from a free-kick, and Bendtner hits it into the wall.  51 min: &quot;Dodgy watches,&quot; moots Peter McGushin of Denmark&apos;s early reappearance. &quot;That would never happen to the Swiss.&quot;  51 min: Rommedahl crosses from the right, Tomasson, Bendner and Thomas Kahlenberg queue up at the back stick to miss it. Bentner&apos;s not really trying, to be honest. He&apos;s either injured, lazy, or bobbins.  53 min: Denmark really are giving it a go, heaving any number of crosses into the box and hoping that Tomasson will make one of them look good. We&apos;re still waiting for that.  55 min: But Japan are looking pretty classy, it must be said. Daisuke Matsui shone in the first half, but they&apos;ve got some talent. Denmark bring Soren Larsen on for Per Kroldrup, a striker for a defender. At this stage, why not?  59 min: Thomas Kahlenberg has a crack from 25 yards. Not a bad crack either, but the keeper shovels it away.  60 min: Denmark have a free-kick, 30 yards out. Daniel Agger takes. The keeper catches. Simples.  62 min: Andreas Rie\u00df adds: &quot;Some additional information to make the yellow card amnesty after the quarterfinals an issue as well for English supporters: suspensions are not carried onto European Championship qualifiers.&quot; a) nice sly dig at the English, German boy; b) So if we lose we might as well throw a few punches, eh?  64 min: Christian Eriksen, just 18 and the youngest player at the World Cup, we&apos;re told, replaces Thomas Kahlenberg  65 min: Samuel Eto&apos;o has scored a penalty for Cameroon to make it 1-1 in the other game. Denmark a flinging a succession of not-good-enough balls towards Japan&apos;s penalty area. &quot;Note the combined Japanese/Danish flag in that picture&apos;s background, as well as the Dannebrog on the cheek right/front. Always courteous. That&apos;s how I remember the Japanese fans from 2006 when they flooded Dortmund for that Brazil match,&quot; writes Radbert Grimmig. Dannebrog, eh. Get you.  66 min: Bendnter gets booked for dissent. The only way he&apos;ll be getting into the referee&apos;s notebook today.  68 min: Denmark are hopeless. Really, stop now. Just walk off, go home. You&apos;re getting nothing out of this.  68 min: Eriksen slams an initially nice-looking half-volley high and wide from 20 yards.  70 min: Denmark dink a not-good-enough ball towars Tomasson. Then Rommedahl pulls a good-enough-actually ball towards Tomasson, whose shot is not good enough. Denmark&apos;s best chance of the night. &quot;Why oh why am I stuck watching this in Shanghai (work, grr) when I could be home in tokyo?&quot; blubs Ganesh Sethuraman. &quot;I need to be there next to the Danish embassy, that&apos;s five minutes from my place!&quot;  73 min: &quot;As the majority of European teams either drop like flies or progress without convincing are we heading for another Cup where the European football press bemoans the quality of the Cup because they didn&apos;t do well, like &apos;02?&quot; asks Kyle Karinen. No, I&apos;d say. As a fan of a lower-division football team, I love big teams doing badly. Could have done with Germany and England joining France and Italy, really. That would have been ace (though now I&apos;d like England to win it please).  74 min: Shinji Okazaki replaces the excellent, if a little less influential this half, Matsui.  76 min: Martin Keown says Premier League scouts should be casting their eye over 32-year-old centre-back Yuji Nakazawa. &quot;He&apos;s up for a battle,&quot; he roars.  78 min: Okazaki heads straight at Sorensen, a half-decent chance. They&apos;re not really bothering to attack, Japan, content to be totally dominant in defence and willing to have a chuckle watching Denmark try pitifully to score against them.  80 min: Penalty to Denmark! Agger goes down in the box under Makoto Hasebe&apos;s challenge. A slight push, a big fall. Which happened just as I was writing about an excellent shot on the turn from Soren Larsen that slammed against the crossbar, a minute earlier.  GOAL FOR DENMARK! Denmark 1 Japan 2 (Tomasson, 81) Tomasson misses the penalty, but collects the rebound and dinks it into the corner.  83 min: And now Tomasson&apos;s limping. Looks like he did a thigh muscle scoring the goal. Now he&apos;s limping, and 33, he and Bendtner might make an all-time least impressive front two for the last seven minutes.  85 min: Huntelaar scores a second for Holland, putting them 2-1 up against Cameroon. Tomasson barely walking now, but Denmark have used up their substitutions so he&apos;ll limp on, I imagine.  86 min: &quot;I nonchalantly told my friends I&apos;d eat my hat if Japan goes through the group stages,&quot; writes Tomohiko Harada, as Akubo slams a shot into Sorensen&apos;s chest from 15 yards. &quot;Does anyone here know a good recipe for hat?&quot;  GOAL! JAPAN SEAL IT! Denmark 1 Japan 3 (Okazaki, 88) Really good build-up, the pass to Honda, his clever turn to humiliate Rommedahl and the square pass to let Okazaki tap into an empty net. Excellent goal. Excellent performance.  90 min: Look at Japan&apos;s last 10 games here \u2013 pre-World Cup defeats to England, South Korea, Serbia, South Korea again, and some team I don&apos;t know. Victories over only Hong Kong and Bahrain. Where has their World Cup form come from?  90+1 min: Junichi Inamoto has just come on, a blast from the past.  90+2 min: Agger gets the ball in the penalty area and blasts it goalwards. It deflects off Yuki Abe&apos;s back and then Makoto Hasebe&apos;s hand before bouncing away to safety. No penalty.  90+3 min: &quot;Lovely little scene just now of the Japanese coach kicking one of his players up the backside in joy at the third goal,&quot; reports Peterr McGushin. &quot;They really know how to celebrate.&quot; More of that to come, you&apos;d have thought.  90+4 min: &quot;He&apos;s played like a Rolls-Royce tonight, Honda,&quot; says Keown.  90+5 min: Peeeep! It&apos;s all over! Japan go through! And mental!  Final thoughts: A disappointing match, if only because Japan were so very, emphatically superior where I had been anticipating a real battle. Brilliant to see both the 2002 hosts excelling again, proving to the world that they don&apos;t need home advantage and some slightly dodgy officiating to shine. Daisuke Matsui, Yuji Nakazawa and Keisuke Honda stood out, one in defence, one in midfield and one in attack, but if they&apos;ve got any weak links Denmark didn&apos;t find them tonight.  In 2002 they got out of their group and promptly lost to Turkey; they could go one better against Paraguay here. Organised in defence \u2013 giving Denmark too much space just once, from memory, back in the 14th minute \u2013\u00a0disciplined and inventive in midfield and with Honda excellent in attack. If you haven&apos;t already, check out his assist for the third. Wildly impressive. Goes for the whole team, really.", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Denmark", "Japan", "World Cup 2010 Group E", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-24T17:41:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/korean-war-american-imperialism-veterans", "sentences": ["Go to the Shanghai Expo and the North&apos;s pavilion shows footage of the war."], "title": "Korean war: 'There's still the evidence to show it was American imperialism'", "article": "     In the West it is the forgotten war, but to Xiang Chaoshan the 60-year-old conflict lives long in the memory \u2013 and its causes are clear. Just a few arches of the bridge that once straddled the Yalu river, linking north-eastern China&apos;s Dandong to neighbouring North Korea, remain as a stark and deliberate reminder of the US raids that enraged him as a young man. &quot;That&apos;s still the evidence to show it was an evil war \u2013 it was imperialism \u2026 if it was not a war of invasion, why did they bomb our bridge?&quot; asked the 78-year-old Chinese veteran. Today marks the 60th anniversary of the Korean war, which began when the North invaded across the 38th parallel. But in Dandong the museum commemorates The War Against American Aggression and To Defend Korea. Across the border in the North it is the War of Fatherland Liberation, which started with earlier incursions by Southern troops, instigated by American imperialists. With cold war tensions running high, escalation was perhaps inevitable once North Korean troops crossed the line in 1950: both the US and China believed they had to check the other&apos;s power. Beijing warned it would intervene if US-dominated UN forces pushed back past the 38th parallel, towards China. &quot;At the time we had a saying about our relations with North Korea: &apos;If the lips are gone the teeth will feel the cold,&apos;&quot; said Wang Xinshan, another veteran of the conflict. By 1952 Chinese soldiers outnumbered their allies by three to one; hundreds of thousands are thought to have died in the conflict. The repercussions are still playing out in the region. The war cemented an alliance that sustains Pyongyang in the face of widespread vilification, and created a powerful emotional bond. &quot;Most Chinese have been immersed in an almost morbidly sentimental connection with the North,&quot; said Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Peking University. For veterans, those links are particularly potent. &quot;I didn&apos;t cry when my parents died but when I think of those who died in the war my tears roll down,&quot; said Xiang, recalling his comrades. When a Southern warship sank this spring, killing 46 sailors, international experts concluded the North torpedoed it. But Xiang backs Pyongyang&apos;s denials. &quot;People shouldn&apos;t bully North Korea any more,&quot; he said. Inside the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea, such perceptions are far sharper. To the outside world, the fact that technically the North and South are still at war \u2013 because no peace treaty followed the armistice \u2013 is a historical curiosity. To the North, it is the principle around which life is organised. &quot;They have structured their huge military and much of the society as a fighting machine determined, someday, to win this war (or at least hold off the South and the Americans),&quot; says Professor Bruce Cumings, whose new book The Korean War: A History is published this month. Go to the Shanghai Expo and the North&apos;s pavilion shows footage of the war. Open a maths book and calculations feature heroic patriots battling American invaders. &quot;The regime pays a great deal of attention to the topic of the Korean war because it justifies its own legitimacy, helps mobilise the masses around the top leader, and provides the pattern for people&apos;s self-sacrificing behaviour in economic life,&quot; said Dr Leonid Petrov, a Korea expert at the University of Sydney. Xiang and other veterans blame the war for the North&apos;s economic struggles, which have left millions reliant on food aid. Yet he acknowledges that its own choices have played a part too. The Chinese government seems baffled by the hermit kingdom&apos;s refusal to adopt their own, prosperous path of economic reform and opening. At Dandong the surviving Friendship Bridge now appears as loaded symbolically as the bombed crossing beside it: on the Chinese side, lights burn bright, but darkness falls abruptly halfway across. Energy is a scarce resource on the far shore. Wang, who returned to the North to visit the graves of dead comrades recently, thought its problems echoed those of China&apos;s past and was troubled by the rigid grip on information and expression. &quot;In China there have been huge changes; you can speak out or even criticise and it won&apos;t be a problem if you are not deliberately destructive. But in North Korea I could sense people were very cautious in words and manner.&quot; Like the veterans, Beijing has become more critical of its ally over the years. It has established an economically valuable relationship with the South, pressed Pyongyang harder in private and publicly attacked its nuclear tests. Yet Seoul, Tokyo and the west are unhappy at Beijing&apos;s reluctance to ascribe blame for the warship&apos;s sinking, and the vast amounts of energy and aid it still supplies to the North. Experts say Beijing is not convinced that pressure can force the North into line and, more importantly, fears the collapse of its neighbour.

Born in Wisconsin on 9\u00a0March 1959, Barbara Millicent Roberts is the world&apos;s most famous supermodel. She drives a Corvette convertible, owns a dream home with a pool, parties with jocks and adores shopping. In the US,\u00a0she was a\u00a0prom queen and a role model. In\u00a0China, she is emerging as an ambassador for consumer culture. Better known as Barbie, this 30cm-tall icon was first sold in China in the early 1990s, but it was not until 2009 that she was given her own home in the retail heartland of Shanghai. Mattel,\u00a0the world&apos;s biggest toy company, marked her 50th\u00a0birthday by opening the planet&apos;s largest Barbie emporium. Covered in pink plastic, the six-storey doll&apos;s house on Huaihai Road became an instant landmark. Martial arts star Jet Li and the actor Christy Chung were among the celebrities at its launch. This was more than a party; it was the start of a marketing campaign aimed at prolonging and expanding the lifestyle championed by the toy firm. For the Barbie market to continue to grow for another 50 years, the doll would have to\u00a0make it big in China. When I lunch at Barbie&apos;s place, in the fantastically kitsch restaurant with a menu devised by chef David Laris, it doesn&apos;t seem to be hugely popular. Along with Barbie\u2122 burgers with Barbie\u2122 pink sauce, Ken burgers, pinktastic pasta, doll-icious desserts and Barbie\u2122 tini cocktails, the restaurant boasts generous promotional offers: those opting for the special meal receive a boxed set of Barbie plates and cutlery to take away. I ask Liu Yunting, who works for an advertising company, what she plans to do with her new tableware. &quot;I will use it myself,&quot; she says. Isn&apos;t it a little childish? &quot;Not at all. It is cute. This is much better than the stuff for children. We\u00a0know better how to appreciate it.&quot; Liu is a member of the fastest-growing consumer class: single women \u2013 or xiaobailing (white-collar princesses). They have high levels of disposable income and a craving for designer labels. For marketing moguls, they are the future face of consumer power. State\u00a0planners forecast that half the population will be middle class by 2020. Until recently, China was living within the planet&apos;s means. If everyone in the world consumed what the average Mr or Mrs Wang did in 2007, we&apos;d just about stay within the sustainable resources of our planet. Humanity would have a balanced ecological budget. But, understandably, Mr and Mrs Wang wanted to keep up with Mr and Mrs Jones on the other side of the Pacific. That was human nature. It was also bad news for the environment, because if we all ate, shopped and travelled like those average Americans, we&apos;d need 4.5 Earths.     A mall in Xujiahui, Shanghai. Photograph:  /Reuters    In recent years, the planet&apos;s largest corporations have become dependent on the Wangs catching up with the Joneses. The US had shopped until its economy dropped. Sinking in debt, plagued by obesity and increasingly dependent on military might to protect its lifestyle, the world&apos;s superconsumer was groaning with indigestion. Europe was too decrepit and conservative to take up the slack, so global manufacturers, retailers and restaurant chains were desperate to stimulate the Chinese appetite. Shanghai was their beachhead. While information firms and political lobbyists headed to Beijing and manufacturers flocked to Guangzhou, retail giants almost invariably chose Shanghai for their China headquarters and their first showrooms. From Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald&apos;s and Starbucks to Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Chanel, international brands made the city a giant shopping mall. Shanghai became the biggest, richest, most globalised mass of modernity in China, home to the most luxurious boutiques, the tallest buildings, the nation&apos;s first formula one track, the biggest auto companies, the second busiest port in the world and a gathering horde of international salesmen trying to sell the American consumer lifestyle. Chinese consumers have never had more options. America&apos;s Wal-Mart, France&apos;s Carrefour, Britain&apos;s Tesco and Japan&apos;s Ito Yokado are expanding in China faster than in any other country. Each year, they open hundreds of new stores in the expectation that demand will surge as more rural migrants move into cities and work their way into the middle class. Young urbanites are becoming as enthusiastic about french fries, burgers and fried chicken as their counterparts in New York or London. When the first KFC opened near Tiananmen Square in 1987, it was seen as a novel western dining experience; 20 years later, the company has 2,000 outlets in 400 cities, employing 200,000 people, making it easily the biggest restaurant chain in China. In roughly the same period, McDonald&apos;s had grown from one restaurant to 800. Along with the changing diet came a surge in obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Obese children used to be rare in China; now nearly 15% of the population is overweight. Shanghai is often cited as the worst affected city. Barbie\u2122 burgers and the like are part of an increasingly carnivorous diet. To\u00a0feed its growing livestock, China imports huge quantities of soya, much of it from Brazil, which has resulted in accelerated clearance of Amazonian forest and Cerrado savanna. Like many other wealthy cities, the high-protein, high-octane, jet-set lifestyle is being paid for elsewhere. I meet my guide, Emily Zhang Huijia, a connoisseur of consumption, outside number 18 the Bund. Once the China HQ of Standard Chartered Bank, the Bund is now a centre for shopping, eating and clubbing. Emily is its PR manager. A fashionista since her teens, she has worked for Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, and says she was brought up on Vogue, Glamour and OK! magazines. By western standards, her childhood was not privileged. In 1985, when she was three, her family got its first colour television. In 1992, around the time the first Barbies went on sale in China, they bought their first air-conditioner; so did everyone in the neighbourhood. The Zhangs had their first fixed phone line installed when Emily was six. By the time she was 16, they were connected to the internet. My family in the UK had a phone three generations before Emily&apos;s, but her parents went online four years earlier than mine. By 2006, the average person in Shanghai owned two mobile phones, 1.7 air-conditioners, 1.7 colour television sets, more than one fridge and spent 14,761 yuan a year (around \u00a31,455), some 70% more than the rest of the country. They use almost twice as much toilet paper as the average in developed nations and have a bigger carbon footprint than people in the UK. The city is consuming beyond the planet&apos;s means, and its appetite is growing by the day. By the time Emily&apos;s generation were earning a salary, they could afford more than the essentials; they could buy style. &quot;I&apos;m a Shanghai girl,&quot; she says. &quot;We don&apos;t earn so much, but we see luxury brands every day. We don&apos;t want to buy anything else.&quot; Most of her friends are in the industry and\u00a0they share information about discounts and sample sales. At her first sale, she blew a third of her salary on Fendi sunglasses. &quot;It is like a fever,&quot; she says. &quot;The price is so low, you cannot refuse.&quot; Like many a proud shopper, Emily lists how much she saved rather than how much she spent. She is wearing a half-price Dior watch reduced by 2,900 yuan (\u00a3286). In her 40 sq m flat near Fuxing Park, she has dozens of other bags, accessories and clothes, including an Armani coat for 999 yuan (\u00a398), discounted from 9,900 (\u00a3976). Compared with friends, she says, she is restrained. In the last three years, Emily&apos;s monthly salary has increased from 3,000 yuan to just under 20,000, putting her firmly in the middle-class bracket. She eats at restaurants at weekends, has a French boyfriend, plays poker every Thursday. Business and pleasure are mixed. Her favourite after-hours hangout, she says, is the building where she works. &quot;Bund 18 has the coolest nightclub in Shanghai, so it&apos;s probably also the coolest in China.&quot; We agree to meet there again at midnight. After dark, the Bund&apos;s spotlit neoclassical pillars and low-rise architecture are reminiscent of London. On the other side of the Huangpu river, however, the futuristic Pudong skyline rises higher than almost anywhere on Earth, including one of the world&apos;s tallest buildings, the 492m bottle opener-shaped Shanghai World Financial Centre. Twenty years ago, most of Pudong was farmland. Today, it pulsates with light and colour. The crowd in the club is made up mostly of expat western men and their Chinese girlfriends. In the cigar lounge, Emily introduces me to a French food and beverage manager, Julian Desmettre, who describes how the nouveau riche from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have made the city their playground: &quot;Shanghai is like Paris during la belle \u00e9poque. This is the city of wealth and style, where people must show their money, where they are judged by how they dress, where they look down on those with less than themselves.&quot; Julian arrived in Shanghai as a student eight years ago with 5,000 yuan in his pocket. Now, he has on his wrist an Omega watch worth six times that amount. &quot;My life here is better than in France. I have a big apartment, a cleaner, a compound with a pool and a gym. It is so comfortable, it is almost too much.&quot; Most revellers in the lounge are European. &quot;Where can I meet Chinese partygoers?&quot; I\u00a0ask Emily, but she is reluctant to recommend anywhere: &quot;There are clubs, but they are the type of place you&apos;d find in a second-tier city. The music and decor are not as good, but Chinese men prefer them because they don&apos;t want to be near foreigners. Chinese women are different. They are\u00a0more open. They go where the quality is.&quot; Wandering around local bars and restaurants, I\u00a0meet bar owners who organise prostitutes for customers and set up trips to karaoke parlours, where hostesses strip off to sing. Shanghai seems to be emulating the consumer sex industry of Tokyo; the hostess bar scene is reminiscent of Japan at the height of its &quot;bubble economy&quot;. The next day, Emily introduces me to Cindy Tai, the head of a marketing agency and former head of EMI Music in China, who helped organise the first Rolling Stones concert in Shanghai. As a child during the Cultural Revolution, Cindy and her academic parents were sent from Shanghai to a farm on the nearby island of Chongming. &quot;We had enough to eat, but nothing to spare. We were very happy if we got a little meat on the table once a week. My\u00a0parents suffered. I vowed that one day I\u00a0would buy them whatever they wanted.&quot; She has achieved that ambition; now, her dream is &quot;to create an organic farm. I&apos;d like to grow fruit, vegetables and rice, raise pigs and chickens. And to have a helicopter, because the traffic is so bad.&quot; But like many affluent consumers around the world, Cindy&apos;s environmentalism seems selective. She has blueberries delivered from an organic farm, baguettes from a French bakery in Xintiandi and olive oil from Italy. She eats out at least once a day, and at one point she and her French husband had four cars: a BMW, an MG and two Mercs. Now they have two; a sign, she says, of their increasing concern for the planet. Later, however, she reveals that her interest has switched to yachts. One is moored near their second home in Cannes. She may yet get another luxury car. Cindy is a member of the Shanghai Porsche club, mainly to\u00a0keep up with her friends, and has been invited to an awards ceremony hosted by Jaguar. I\u00a0shamelessly ask if I can come along. The venue for the Jaguar Gorgeous Award Party is a renovated mansion off Huaihai Road, a few minutes&apos; walk from the Barbie store. In cocktail dresses and designer suits, guests sip wine in the courtyard, where they are treated to a sales pitch for the new 5-litre XKR: &quot;It is a wow car!&quot; gushes a PR lady who introduces herself by her westernised name, Seraph. I am sceptical: &quot;But you can barely move in Shanghai&apos;s traffic. Why would anyone want such a\u00a0huge engine?&quot; &quot;Rich people never take the subway,&quot; Seraph replies. &quot;Even if the traffic is bad, they need a car. Jaguar is nothing but gorgeous and beautiful.&quot; In the five years to 2009, sales of luxury cars in China rose five-fold, de luxe villas seven-fold and luxury goods tripled. This was just the start of a spending splurge: the number of wealthy households is forecast to double again by 2015. Earthwatch Institute estimates that if China&apos;s 1.3 billion people were to consume at the same rate as Americans, global production of steel, paper and cars would have to double, oil output would need to rise by 20m barrels a day and miners would have to dig an extra 5bn tons of coal. If it followed the US appetite, China would chew its way through 80% of current meat production and two-thirds of the global grain harvest. &quot;China is telescoping history,&quot; says Lester Brown, president of Earthwatch. &quot;It forces us to focus on what happens when huge numbers of low-income people rise rapidly in affluence. Chinese consumption shows the need to reconstruct the world economy.&quot; Instead of relying on an ever greater consumption of resources to generate growth, Brown says mankind needs to move to a fairer, more sustainable model. Yet the opposite seems to be happening. Global corporations and the communist government are trying to make China the greatest shopper of them all. In Shanghai, that goal is already being realised. By one estimate, the average carbon dioxide emissions of its residents have already overtaken those in Tokyo, New York and London. If there is a glimmer of environmental hope, it is that even in Shanghai people have not yet fully embraced western levels of throwaway consumption. Many still prefer flasks of hot tea to cans of Coke, and in the supermarkets the average basket of goods is smaller than in the west and profit margins are lower. This thrift is not inspired by environmental concerns, but by a\u00a0traditional desire to live within one&apos;s means. Even so, the rest of the country has some way to go to catch up with Shanghai, which is what the government wants. This will require a great deal more energy and raw materials. To provide everyone with a Shanghai lifestyle, factories will\u00a0need to churn out an extra 159 million refrigerators, 213 million televisions, 233 million computers, 166 million microwave ovens, 260 million air-conditioners and 187 million cars. The retail market, meanwhile, is becoming less diverse the bigger it grows. Paul French, a Shanghai-based marketing consultant, says the problem is that the shopping malls designed to create the image of a good life do not reflect reality for most people: &quot;They are building more and more malls filled with luxury brands. Like the power stations in Soviet-era Russia, they are being built not because of demand but because of prestige. Every official in China wants one to show their city is on the international map.&quot; These emporiums are designed to generate desire, not meet needs. Many are dismissed by locals as gui gouwu zhongxin (ghost malls) because they attract so few customers. Yet in Shanghai they are everywhere. Xujiahui intersection, for example, is ringed by six department stores. Among them is the Orient Shopping Mall, boasting Est\u00e9e Lauder cosmetics, Rolex watches, Cartier pens and Dior lipstick. Passing through the revolving door one weekday morning, I\u00a0see not a single customer. Not even a window shopper.

If BC does decide to float part of the company, it is likely to seek a listing in either Hong Kong or Shanghai. BC favours an Asian float as the region is seen as a more lucrative source of future growth. &quot;The company is looking at different options... Given the growth in Asia, it is quite sensible for BC to consider floating there,&quot; said a source close to the deal. It is understood that any flotation, which could value Fitness First at between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn, would take place next year. So far, 2010 has been a tricky year for IPOs, as the European debt crisis has spooked investors. Several were cancelled, including Blackstone&apos;s proposed sale of entertainment group Merlin, and the float of fashion chain New Look. BC, though, has managed several flotations already this year, including Spanish travel booking firm Amadeus. Fitness First has enjoyed strong growth since being founded in 1993 in Bournemouth. It now runs around 550 health clubs, of which more than 150 are in Asia and Australia. The take-up of gyms by the Asian public is lower than in Europe, but analysts believe this gap will narrow as the market is growing faster than in the UK.

There is also a return of risk aversion among investors, as sovereign debt issues continue to weigh despite the G20&apos;s attempts to resolve the key issues. There is also some nervousness ahead of Thursday, when European banks are set to repay \u20ac442bn, money they borrowed at cheap rates a year ago as part of the ECB&apos;s attempts to boost liquidity in the market.

The Shanghai Composite is down 23% since mid-April. Austerity measures do not, of course, explain entirely the current sense of gloom. In Europe, there are two local obsessions. First, the stress tests on 100 banks have succeeded only in stressing investors. Either the EU&apos;s inspectors will produce a whitewash next month, that will reassure nobody; or they will identify the banking weaklings, which could be dangerous. Which is worse? Second, Europe&apos;s banks must on Thursday repay \u20ac442bn (\u00a3358bn) of cheap money borrowed a year ago from the European Central Bank. Again, it is hard to see how &quot;good&quot; news could emerge. Spanish banks are screaming that the ECB is being too harsh in not renewing the facility, which the markets read as an indication of real fear in Spain. But, if the ECB were to soften its stance at the eleventh hour, investors would sense panic in Frankfurt and worry about the health of German banks. Austerity measures, however, do explain why these concerns over banks seem so urgent.

By chance, it comes to 75.&quot; So Foster, who turned 75 this month, has decided to make models of all 75, to hang in his own personal museum, which he keeps at his Swiss home, an 18th-century chateau set in vineyards between Lausanne and Geneva. These model aircraft will hover over his collection of some of the 20th-century&apos;s greatest machines, cherished for both their engineering brilliance and streamlined beauty; many of them look like winged or wheeled versions of Foster&apos;s most innovative buildings. &quot;At the moment,&quot; says the architect, &quot;I&apos;m restoring a Citro\u00ebn Sahara, designed to tackle north African dunes. I&apos;m also thinking of getting a Bell 47 helicopter as a focal point. And I&apos;ve had a model made of the Graf Zeppelin airship.&quot; This last item puts me in mind of 30 St Mary Axe, aka the Gherkin, the Zeppelin-like London skyscraper that bears witness to Foster&apos;s passion for engineering marvels \u2013 a passion that began in childhood. Five years ago, I asked the architect if he had ever been a railway enthusiast. He replied by postcard, with a sketch of a Royal Scot class 4-6-0 thundering along, just as he would have seen it from his bedroom window, in the terraced house in Manchester where he grew up. Foster has come a long way from those zinc-bath-in-front-of-the-fire days. The boy who left school at 16 to do his national service with the RAF is now \u2013 as his astronomical career shows, and as Deyan Sudjic writes in his new biography \u2013 &quot;a phenomenon&quot;. But the lad from Levenshulme never forgot what he saw and learned as a working-class child brought up in an industrial Britain. &quot;There&apos;s a snobbery at work in architecture,&quot; says Foster, speaking at his riverside studio in Battersea, London. &quot;The subject is too often treated as a fine art, delicately wrapped in mumbo-jumbo. In reality, it&apos;s an all-embracing discipline taking in science, art, maths, engineering, climate, nature, politics, economics. Every time I&apos;ve flown an aircraft, or visited a steelworks, or watched a panel-beater at work, I&apos;ve learned something new that can be applied to buildings. Disciplines connect, from locomotive engineering to the design of a bridge, or from a study of the way raptors and gliders soar. The most amazing lesson in aerodynamics I ever had was the day I climbed a thermal in a glider at the same time as an eagle. I witnessed, close up, effortlessness and lightness combined with strength, precision and determination. &quot; Foster&apos;s own rise has been no less impressive. His relentless enthusiasm and bristling energy had propelled him into the architectural stratosphere by the mid-1980s. Today, Foster and Partners is a global concern that employs 1,000 architects, working on an enormous number of projects: universities, skyscrapers, hospitals, museums, schools, production plants and entire city centres, stretching from Argentina and Brazil to Mumbai and Beijing, via London, Germany, Istanbul and the Middle East. These range in scale from the India tower, a needle-like skyscraper in Mumbai that could end up being the world&apos;s tallest building (the height has yet to be finalised), to a sustainable school in Sierra Leone made of timber and mud-bricks. The former is an exuberant expression of the booming Indian economy; the latter a modest structure paid for by the Foster family. Like all architectural firms, Fosters has been rocked by the recession. &quot;In spring 2009, we had to lose 400 staff,&quot; he says. &quot;Economic downturns hit architecture hard, but we&apos;ve been recruiting again for several months. Now, we&apos;ve accelerated into India, South America and parts of the Middle East, like Abu Dhabi, where economies are performing well.&quot; Foster has, over the past decade, been criticised for building on too prodigious a scale. With so many designs on the go, and so many architects on the books, it hasn&apos;t always been possible to maintain the level of innovation and quality displayed in the firm&apos;s best works. These would include Berlin&apos;s Reichstag, a powerful remodelling of the original German parliament building torched in 1933 and now crowned with a mesmerising glass dome; the Viaduc de Millau (with Michel Virlogeux), the awe-inspiring French roadbridge over the Tarn valley with masts as high as the Eiffel tower; and the Hearst tower in New York, an eyecatching 46-storey skyscraper with a triangular exposed steel structure, rising provocatively from the top of a listed 1920s publishing HQ. Most architects would give their souls for a sliver of his commissions. Which building is he most proud of? Always the one he is working on next, he says, although he is rightly fond of the beautifully detailed Hong Kong and Shanghai bank, opened in 1986 and built to aerospace standards of design, detailing and construction, with a budget (\u00a3500m) to match. Essentially apolitical, Foster doesn&apos;t like to get involved in architectural spats, although he did sign a letter, along with other architects, denouncing the Prince of Wales&apos;s interference in the planning process for the redevelopment of the old Chelsea Barracks site in London. This is partly because Richard Rogers, battling the prince here, is an old friend, but also because Foster, although hugely successful, knows how hard winning major commissions can be; the wrong sort of interference can seriously damage well-meaning architectural practices. &apos;The chemotherapy was horrid&apos; As trim as ever, Foster, who has been married three times and has five children, seems fit and healthy, light on his feet and mentally sharp. So it comes as a surprise to learn of his battle with bowel cancer a decade ago, and of the fact that he can no longer fly solo, having suffered a heart attack. &quot;For whatever reason,&quot; he says, &quot;Deyan Sudjic played down these events in his biography. I did explain in some detail how I had worked my way through these life-threatening conditions. I certainly had no intention of letting up, neither then nor now. The day after I was told I had cancer, I\u00a0had to present the Riba gold medal to Barcelona; and there was so much else to do, so many commitments. &quot;The chemotherapy was pretty horrid, I have to say, but I got through it by reading Lance Armstrong&apos;s book [It&apos;s Not About the Bike]. I bought a racing bike, and though I didn&apos;t quite manage to win the Tour de France [as Armstrong did in 1999, after fighting off testicular cancer], I&apos;ve cycled marathons ever since.&quot; As a boy, he used to cycle to the Lakes and back to Levenshulme in a day; today, he tackles the Alps and the Pyrenees, his most memorable ride being a five-day jaunt along the precipitous Camino de Santiago, the 485-mile medieval pilgrimage route from France into Spain. As another 75th birthday present to himself, Foster has commissioned a car from racing car restorers Crosthwaite &amp; Gardiner. This is not any car, but a replica of Buckminster Fuller&apos;s legendary Dymaxion. US inventor Fuller, born in 1895, is best known for his geodesic domes, but he wanted to create a car that could fly, that could whisk drivers off roads and drop them at lightweight aluminium homes planted anywhere they fancied. The Dymaxion, a 20ft-long three-wheeler that looked part-airliner, part-yacht and part-whale, was the first step. &quot;I&apos;ve admired the look and the idea of these cars for many years,&quot; says Foster. &quot;Yes, they were flawed, but they were a brave attempt to connect the car to architecture. They were just\u00a0astonishing.&quot; The zero-carbon mini-city Foster met Fuller in the US in 1971, and the two worked on projects together until the inventor&apos;s death 12 years later. It was Fuller who asked Foster how much his hangar-like Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts, built in Norwich in the 1970s, weighed. Until then, this was not a question British architects, or indeed any architects, gave much thought to. What does it matter, as long as it stays up and shelters its occupants? Foster bothered to find out: the answer was 5,619 tons (the Empire State Building, by way of comparison, is said to weigh 370,000 tons). Fuller&apos;s question has been used as the title of a forthcoming documentary, How Much Does Your Building Weigh, Mr Foster?, made with\u00a0the help of his wife Elena. &quot;One of the things it tries to say is that we should do more with less,&quot; the architect says of the film. &quot;Today, I&apos;m trying to get this message across not just through single buildings, but on a citywide level. &quot;Just now, for example, we&apos;re working on our Masdar City project in Abu Dhabi. This is an attempt to create a zero-carbon, zero-waste mini-city with a population of around 50,000 in a hostile desert climate \u2013 with, I hope, some lessons for cities worldwide. The idea is that conventional cars are housed in parking silos on the edges of what is, in effect, a contemporary walled city. Without cars, the streets inside the walls can be narrow, so they&apos;re both pedestrian-friendly and shady. But, so people can get around, there are proposals to create a level below pedestrian streets with guided electric cars. You&apos;d call them by phone and they&apos;d come to you; but once out of the city, they could also be driven like a conventional car. All this is based on ideas I discussed with Bucky years ago.&quot; Masdar City, raised on a seven-metre podium so its electric cars can travel freely below the streets, recalls the fantasy future cities depicted in the pages of the Eagle, the weekly boys&apos; comic first published in 1950, and one that Foster and other architects of his generation found compelling. Its strips were influenced by sci-fi fantasy\u00a0as well as by the latest projects\u00a0of Frank Lloyd Wright, whose\u00a0buildings Foster visited while a\u00a0student at Yale. Where Masdar City differs is that its architecture is based on traditional Arabic precedent: it makes use of layers of sun-defeating decorative screens, cooling towers, narrow passageways, shade and oasis-like squares. If Middle Eastern cities of the future can develop along similar lines, they will be able to contain sprawl while being models of environmental good manners. It does seem a better idea to have a dozen new\u00a0small walkable\u00a0satellite cities close to Abu Dhabi rather than an Abu Dhabi too big for its urban robes. It&apos;s a project \u2013 the first part of which opens this year\u00a0\u2013 that shows Foster and his practice still at the cutting edge of architecture and\u00a0design. For all his worldly success and professional esteem, and despite the fact that Foster and Partners is one enormous machine for making buildings (sometimes a little too slickly), Foster still exudes the curiosity of that enchanted boy looking out of his window at a world of wonderful machines. &quot;I&apos;ve never been busier,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m amazed to be here still and doing all this. But then I look at Oscar Niemeyer in Rio, who was a hero of mine when I was a student at Manchester. Oscar&apos;s still busy at work at 102, so there&apos;s hope. In any case, I just wouldn&apos;t know how to stop.&quot;", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture", "Norman Foster"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-29T20:31:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/30/china", "sentences": ["As John Ross of Shanghai&apos;s Jiao Tong university argues, while the US and Europe tried to overcome the investment slump at the core of the crisis indirectly with deficit spending, China was able to drive up investment through its public banks \u2013 with the result that growth is running at nearly 12% and its deficit is below 3%."], "title": "These strikes are good for China \u2013 and for the world | Seumas Milne", "article": "Something is stirring in the workshop of the world. For weeks, strikes and protests have been breaking out across the coastal regions which have been the engine of China&apos;s emergence as an economic power and have unleashed an avalanche of bargain-basement consumer goods on the rest of the globe. While trade unions in Europe are taking industrial action against cuts in wages, pensions and jobs, low-paid workers in China have been striking against rampant exploitation, and winning double-digit pay rises. It&apos;s a development that cuts to the heart of China&apos;s economic model, as well as the role of cheap labour in the global economy. What started at the Taiwanese-owned company Foxconn, the world&apos;s largest electronics supplier, with a spate of suicides linked to working conditions at its mammoth production centre in Shenzhen, has since spread to a rollcall of mostly foreign-owned firms. Foxconn employs more than 400,000 workers in Shenzhen alone, producing millions of Apple iPods and iPhones, as well as computers and mobile phones for brands such as Nokia, Dell and Sony. Its workers&apos; deaths sparked a national scandal, led to an immediate rise of 30% in wages of less than \u00a3100 a month, and helped spawn walkouts in Honda, Hyundai and Toyota plants and suppliers, along with other factories across China. The strikes, organised by mobile phone and internet chatrooms outside official union structures, have already delivered pay rises of more than 30% at Honda&apos;s transmission factory in Foshan, where workers were not even allowed to speak to each other, and 25% at a Hyundai supplier in Beijing. There have been plenty of walkouts and protests before, of course, but the impact of copycat strikes in the core of China&apos;s hi-tech export sector on the globalised supply chain has already been powerful. China is now the world&apos;s largest exporter, and has seen its share of global manufacturing output rise from 2% to nearly 20% in 20 years. While the industrial working class has shrunk in Europe and north America, in China it is now hundreds of millions strong, swollen by a tide of rural migrants. And\u00a0when a 20-year-old strike leader at a Honda plant in Foshan, Li Xiaojuan, insists publicly &quot;we must not let the representatives of capital divide us&quot;, it has a special kind of resonance in a country whose constitution declares itself a &quot;socialist state led by the working class&quot;. Now Chinese export workers have shown they can get results, the strikes look likely to continue. Their hand has been strengthened in part because China&apos;s one-child policy and better living standards in the countryside are translating into labour shortages in the industrial areas. But it&apos;s also because the pressure to boost wages goes with the grain of shifting government policy. In a nation where strikes are discouraged and often barely reported, the response of the authorities to the latest wave of stoppages has verged on the supportive. The chairman of the state-owned partner of Honda and Toyota, for instance, insisted the workers&apos; demands were &quot;reasonable&quot;. The party&apos;s Global Times warned the strikes showed the necessity of &quot;organised labour protection&quot;, complaining &quot;ordinary workers&quot; had received the &quot;smallest share of economic prosperity&quot; from China&apos;s opening to the world market. The reason is clear enough. China&apos;s leaders are determined to increase consumption at home in the face of continuing crisis in the western economies, shift resources from cheap labour to a more hi-tech output and transfer production to the poorer interior. They are also under intense pressure to respond to revulsion at the gross inequality that has disfigured China in the years of its explosive economic breakthrough. Hence the introduction of stronger labour protection legislation a couple of years back and sharp rises in minimum wage rates, even before the latest strikes. That tension is built into the model China has used to make the breakthrough \u2013 which echoes but goes well beyond the concessions to capitalism in the Soviet new economic policy of the 1920s. It has turned China into a global economic power, raised its national income by more than 9% a year for three decades, and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty \u2013 but at a cost of sweeping and corrupt privatisation, a decline in health and education provision, environmental degradation, the creation of a fabulously wealthy elite and a block on civil and democratic advance. The Hu Jintao leadership&apos;s attempt to reduce inequality, move back towards freer health and education, improve conditions for migrant workers and &quot;green&quot; production are seen by some, like the academic Lin Chun, as &quot;signs of a resumption of reform socialism&quot;. From enthusiasts for more privatisation and capitalism, there are at the same time increasing grumbles that &quot;the state advances, the private sector retreats&quot;, while the strike wave has emboldened senior former state officials and &quot;old revolutionaries&quot; to call publicly for the &quot;restoration of the working class as the leading class&quot; and &quot;re-establishment of public ownership as the principle part of the economy&quot;. What is clear is that China&apos;s publicly owned or controlled sector, particularly its state banks, has allowed it to weather the international economic crisis with remarkable success. As John Ross of Shanghai&apos;s Jiao Tong university argues, while the US and Europe tried to overcome the investment slump at the core of the crisis indirectly with deficit spending, China was able to drive up investment through its public banks \u2013 with the result that growth is running at nearly 12% and its deficit is below 3%. It&apos;s a powerful challenge to the Washington consensus that has driven economic policy for a generation. A growing Chinese economy also offers a welcome antidote to continued stagnation or recession in the western world, especially if the current switch to consumption continues. Strikes against poverty wages can only help. When Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, hailed Chinese cheap labour as a lever to hold down global labour costs, he was highlighting what has been a burden on workers across the world. Sustainable, growing Chinese living standards should also strengthen the prospects of progressive domestic change. These strikes are good for China and good for the world.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-30T20:00:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jul/01/gareth-malone-goes-to-glyndebourne", "sentences": ["Shanghai Tales 9pm, BBC4This remarkable film, first broadcast in 2008, follows the intense training regime of the Chinese Circus School, which moulds children into physics-defying acrobats capable of performing what seem to be superhuman feats."], "title": "Gareth Malone Goes to Glyndebourne | Shanghai Tales | Southland | Skins | BBC Samuel Johnson Prize For Non-Fiction | Importgant Things With Demetri Martin | Watch this", "article": "Gareth Malone Goes to Glyndebourne 9pm, BBC2In the feverish climax of the series, Gareth Malone gets his motley collection of truculent youths ready for their big moment: performing an opera at Glyndebourne.

Headline plans at the venerable Great Russell Street institution include an exhibition about Afghanistan, which will open next spring and which is the result of protracted negotiations with Kabul and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  But Neil MacGregor, the director of the museum, would not be drawn about the impending impact of cuts to museum funds. The museum management will find out on 20 October how much money they are to lose and they will be arguing their corner hard, probably mostly behind the scenes, until then. They have already gone so far as to develop a series of money-saving options with varying degrees of severity, of which they would give no detail. MacGregor&apos;s chairman, Niall FitzGerald, also pointed out that cuts would have come under any government. What MacGregor would say, though, was that the exhibition schedule is &quot;almost fully funded until the end of 2012&quot;. So no changes are likely there, he reassured the assembled press. The BM&apos;s thematic concentration on Africa over the past year is to be succeeded by a foray into religious and spiritual history and by a plan to work with museum experts in Canberra on a further understanding of Australian art. Two strong drives seemed to be behind much of the museum&apos;s plans. MacGregor is building on links between museums abroad, including in Basra in Iraq, and in Shanghai and Beijing in China, and is also underlining the connections between the British Museum and the regional museums in this country. This is something now made more possible through the &quot;portable antiquities scheme&quot; and it means not just swapping exhibits around across the country and helping with the research on important finds, like the Staffordshire Hoard, but also actually setting up British Museum galleries in other museums. Spreading this network of expertise across England and across the world is, of course, a way to create a richer understanding of history. But more significantly, it is a brilliant way to handle the British Museum&apos;s two big image problems from the past: its acquisitive, colonial history and its London-centric attitude. Sir Neil has made another smart move this year, too. Radio 4 listeners will certainly have noticed the History of the World in 100 Hundred Objects series that he writes and presents everyday. It has become one of the station&apos;s most popular programmes, and he revealed today, has already been the subject of 5,456,000 downloads worldwide. It has also boosted visitor numbers, he said.

QUAD, Sat to 5 Sep Robert Clark Alice Neel, London Alice Neel&apos;s considered one of the 20th century&apos;s great portraitists, yet success came late for the single mum who pioneered her unfashionable figurative painting for decades unnoticed, while the boys&apos; club of abstract expressionism and then minimalism and pop art held sway. As this first survey of her work in a UK public gallery makes clear, whether painting her family or neighbours in Spanish Harlem, pregnant women or the New York art world, for Neel, portraiture was an act of revelation. Her famed painting of Andy Warhol as a pallid martyr, half-naked with bullet scars, is one of 60 works here, tracing how Neel became adept at mining her subject&apos;s inner life, laying it bare with unsettling acuity. Whitechapel Gallery, E1, Thu to 17 Sep Skye Sherwin Russell Mills And Ian Walton, Ambleside It&apos;s 62 years since exiled German artist Kurt Schwitters died in Ambleside, yet the influence of his radical cut-and-paste works pervades all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Here Russell Mills and Ian Walton pay joint homage to the great dadaist with an exhibition titled Forward To Far, Telescoping Time From Schwitters To Now. Mills and Walton update Schwitters&apos;s use of collage and assemblage to a world in which we&apos;re all bombarded by an overdose of multimedia, so much of it seemingly alluding to the terminal mess we are collectively making of the environment. Yet for all Mills and Walton&apos;s air of dreadful concern, the overall effect of their installations is of a fragmentary charm. Deeply romantic art that is ultimately celebratory. The Armitt Collection, to 30 Oct Robert Clark Paul Sietsema, London Paul Sietsema makes sculptures, drawings and films, but his chief material seems to be uncertainty. A previous ruse included a paint-blotted cutting of a newspaper review of his work that turned out to be his own meticulous ink drawing. Sietsema&apos;s painstakingly realised art-about-art may be chock-full of theory, but it can be as physically compelling as it is brainy. In his latest film, what could be aged footage of primitivist paintings turn out to be the scarred work surfaces of his studio, while a seemingly candid lecture on his work is partly culled from the thoughts of Jean Dubuffet. Interpretations slide around; time becomes an illusion; art changes shape as it&apos;s passed from the artist to its audience.

Former air steward Gaia Persico imagines a global city in her drawings where horizons snake across the page, binding landmarks from San Fran&apos;s Union Square to Darling Harbour in Sydney. A film by Elisa Sighicelli conjures urban spectacle, as a Shanghai skyscraper sends out a rainbow kaleidoscope of lights, while in one of her photographic lightboxes familiar scaffolding becomes a fantastic structure. Matthew Houlding recycles household flotsam into maquettes of jazzy modernist apartment blocks, while Jools Johnson turns yesterday&apos;s tech, like upturned old computer screws, into tomorrow&apos;s skyscrapers. PM Gallery and House, W5, to 29 Aug Skye Sherwin Spencer Tunick, Salford Spencer Tunick is the artist who has notoriously photographed large groups of astoundingly unselfconscious naked souls at sites ranging from an Amsterdam car park through to the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House. It is interesting to see him now posing his participants in compositions that refer to the work of another artist and at sites that are far from obviously noteworthy. While LS Lowry&apos;s exploited masses of weary mill workers could not be more culturally at odds with Tunick&apos;s liberated naturists, Lowry&apos;s swarming compositions here provide a potent framework for cloudy day gatherings in such local landscapes as Peel Park and the Concorde hangar of Manchester Airport. The Lowry, to 26 Sep Robert Clark Andrew Cross, Birmingham A series of colour photographs shows an apparently common English field as it passes from dawn to dusk. It turns out that the subject of the images, collectively titled Hats Off To Roy Harper, is the site of the 1970s&apos; renowned Knebworth rock festivals. An accompanying twin-screen projection features an elaborate drum solo specially performed for Cross&apos;s camera by Carl Palmer (yes, he of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer prog supergroup fame). As Palmer builds his solo from single snare, through brushes, cymbals and felt beaters into a full drum onslaught, Cross&apos;s close-up focus and minimalist editing defiantly and almost provocatively rescues a musical genre from cultural obsolescence. Ikon Eastside, to 25 Jul Robert Clark Surreal Friends, Chichester The reappraisal of women surrealists gathers more steam with this show focusing on the lives and work of three friends: the British artist Leonora Carrington, the Hungarian Kati Horna and Spaniard Remedios Varo. Variously escaping personal and political traumas in war-torn Europe where Varo and Carrington had worked in the shadow of their surrealist lovers, these women pioneered their own vision in Mexico City. In one of Varo&apos;s best-known paintings, an owl-woman conducts an alchemical art experiment bringing painted birds to light by moonlight, a sister to Carrington&apos;s menagerie of mythic creatures. As a photographer, Horna was as attuned to real-world hardships as she was to a surrealist sensibility. Here her extraordinary images of women refugees from the Spanish civil war complement symbolic photomontages where female eyes peer out from barred windows.

Fifteen minutes later, she was taking part in industrial action for the first time in her life. &quot;I was worried, but everyone was excited and determined,&quot; recalls the 21-year-old migrant worker at the Denso car parts plant in China&apos;s southern province of Guangdong. &quot;We started our shift at the normal time, but instead of working we just walked around and around the workshop for eight hours. The managers asked us to return to our jobs, but nobody did.&quot; The next day she and the rest of the 1,000-strong workforce repeated the demonstration at the Japanese-owned factory, which makes parts for Toyota and Honda. This time, the corporate union begged them to go back to work. Again they refused. There was no chanting, no speeches, no violence. When the workers got tired, they sat down and chatted for a few minutes. Then they got up and carried on walking until the end of the shift, marked their time cards and went home. Industrial action does not get much lower key than this, nor does it get much more significant. The Denso strike was reported across the world because it took place on the frontline between global labour and global capital: workers in the workshop of the world had downed tools \u2013 and won. For almost three decades, the world&apos;s biggest corporations have outsourced an increasing share of their manufacturing operations to China, where they can benefit from cheap labour and lax regulation. In rich nations this has helped to keep consumer prices low and corporate profits high. In China it has meant workers having to endure a worsening environment, tough conditions and wage rises that have failed to keep pace with economic growth. But Zhang (not her real name) was part of a recent wave of strikes to have hit foreign companies, prompting speculation of a readjustment. In the past two months workers have walked off production lines at three Honda plants, a Toyota supplier, a Hyundai factory in Beijing, a Taiwanese rubber products manufacturer in Shanghai and a Carlsberg brewery in Chongqing. The latest action, last week, was at a Japanese electronics firm, Tianjin Mitsumi, where workers crippled output with a sit-in, complaining they were being asked to work extra hours for no extra pay. In almost every case the strikers have won at least a partial victory. Zhang and her colleagues at Denso went back to work last week after their Japanese bosses promised a rise in the monthly basic salary from 1,300 yuan (\u00a3125) to 1,700 yuan. In addition, they will get a bonus increase of 400 yuan per month. Such successes have created a new cast of heroes for the global labour movement. Business analysts are warning that consumer prices might rise if the era of cheap Chinese goods is over. The ruling Communist party \u2013 which has long since cast aside its revolutionary Marxist origins \u2013 faces a conundrum. Not wanting to stir up a Solidarity-like opposition, the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, has publicly called for improved working conditions. The People&apos;s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist party, has hailed a &quot;tipping point&quot; of relations between labour and capital. There are hopes that a newly aspirational class of migrant workers might drive the economy away from cheap labour and production, so that China could finally leave behind its reliance on low-cost, high-polluting manufacturing. Yet, off-stage, the authorities are terrified of instability and a fall in foreign investment. The governor of Guangdong has been called in to brief the politburo. Domestic reporters have been ordered to play down their coverage of the strikes to minimise the risk of copycat actions. Perhaps for this reason, the workers who have won pay rises in Guangdong are far from triumphant about their success. There is none of the assertive militancy that was seen at the Yorkshire collieries in the 1970s or the Gdansk shipyards in the 1980s. Nervous of repercussions and suspicious of potential management spies, many workers play down their actions. &quot;We don&apos;t call it a strike. We just say we stopped work,&quot; said Zhang. &quot;Nobody tells us who is leading the strike, because if everyone knew then the management might find out and punish them,&quot; said another 22-year-old migrant worker. &quot;Nobody told us there was going to be a strike until it happened.&quot; Off the record, workers said there had been a secret meeting the day before the strike started on 21 June. Rather than leave a digital record that could be traced back to their computers or mobile phones, the organisers handed out leaflets stating their demands to the management: an 800-yuan pay rise, the right to choose their own union representatives and a guarantee that nobody would be punished for striking. On the day of the strike, the organisers were so cautious about revealing themselves that the frustrated management encouraged the official union to organise a vote for representatives so that they had someone to negotiate with. It was not so much a Solidarity moment as a stealth movement. The Pearl River delta contains one of the world&apos;s densest clusters of industrial estates. Many factories sit amid palm trees and vegetable fields ringed by broad roads and power lines. Workers&apos; dormitories sit close by, easily identified by the workers&apos; uniforms on the washing lines and the many pairs of trainers left to air by the windows. The new communities are almost identical. The city of Foshan&apos;s &quot;Car Assembly Town&quot; is typical: a few broad low-rise factories, a thicket of six-storey dormitories, an internet cafe, a mobile phone shop, a bank and a small street of food kiosks selling noodles, fried rice, boiled eggs and spicy stew. Off-duty workers with dyed hair, jeans and trainers wander out from their new dormitory, carrying umbrellas in a rainy season squall that sets the palm trees blowing\u00a0wildly. The turnover of workers is spectacularly rapid. Few of the dozen or so employees at Denso in Foshan and Honda Lock in Zhongshan are older than 22. Many are in their teens. Most are women. Waiting in ragged lines for the factory buses to come to pick them up from their dormitories, they look like pupils on their way to school or teens queuing up for a rock concert. It hardly seems a hotbed of class war. &quot;I felt guilty leaving the production line. This has really hurt the company, and what hurts them will hurt us,&quot; was a typical response from one young worker. But they say rent, food and other living costs have risen faster than wages. After seeing Taiwan&apos;s Foxconn electronics group raise salaries by more than 60%, they pushed for similar benefits. The way they went about it suggests changes may be afoot, albeit slowly. Almost all of the employees at the affected firms in Guangdong attended vocational schools, meaning they had a relatively high level of education compared with the average in Guangdong. During the Honda Lock dispute, they hired a legal consultant, Chang Kai, a lecturer at Renmin University, to help them with negotiations. Thanks to school networks, mobile phones and internet bulletin boards, they are far better organised than the previous generation of migrant workers. Their expectations are also very different. While their parents were willing to &quot;eat bitterness&quot; so they could send money to their desperately poor rural families, many of today&apos;s young workers spend the bulk of their incomes on clothes and phones for themselves. Demographics are on the side of labour. A bulge in the working-age population has started to thin, which is changing the balance between supply and demand. In recent years the flood of new migrants into Guangdong has slowed. According to labour rights campaigners, this is putting upward pressure on salaries. &quot;Labour shortages only existed because companies refused to offer decent wages. As soon as a halfway decent salary and reasonable benefits were offered, recruiters had no problem finding new hires,&quot; wrote Geoff Crothall in a blog for China Labour Bulletin. Many workers are asking for independent collective representation. Unions in China are usually funded by companies, staffed by management and answerable to the Communist party. During an earlier strike at the Honda plant in Zhongshan, union representatives fought workers, injuring two of them. &quot;The union is basically useless,&quot; said Zhou, one of the workers who had been on the strike. &quot;It was wrong of them to beat us.&quot; Given this background, labour activists predict more unrest. &quot;I think there will be more and more strikes. Workers have started to be concerned about their rights as well as their incomes. They have begun to realise that their economic poverty is due to their political poverty,&quot; said Liu Kaiming at the Institute of Contemporary Observation. Employers still have the upper hand in many firms. Many locals believe Japanese companies have been targeted because they treat their workers better than most factories in Guangdong. Local academics and journalists say the pay and conditions at Honda and Toyota are better than average in the province. &quot;I don&apos;t know why the Honda workers went on strike, because their salaries and conditions are better than ours,&quot; said Chen Jian, a 24-year-old employee of the Yongtai Plastic factory, which is only a few miles from the Japanese firm. &quot;We are not satisfied but we will not go on strike. Some workers tried that last year and they were all fired. That is normal.&quot; Additional reporting by Cui Zheng", "tags": ["China", "Globalisation", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-03T23:06:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/05/xinjiang-china-riots-one-year-on", "sentences": ["While China&apos;s economic powerhouses \u2013 such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen \u2013 have been ordered to help the poorest areas, some are sceptical about the basis for sustained growth."], "title": "A year on from Xinjiang riots, ethnic divisions are 'greater than ever'", "article": "Xinjiang&apos;s riots: the aftermath Last year&apos;s violence was &quot;like an earthquake revealing faultlines \u2013 divisions and problems ethnic, religious, cultural, political and economic,&quot; said Professor Dru Gladney, an expert on Uighur culture at Pomona College in California. The violence prompted the Communist party&apos;s biggest re-examination of its policy in Xinjiang for over a decade. It concluded it should tackle economic grievances via &quot;leapfrog development&quot;, pledging to introduce a natural resources tax and raise GDP to the national average. But critics say that &quot;more of the same&quot; economic plans, without a greater say in development, are unlikely to bring much benefit to Uighurs; and that residents also want expanded political and cultural rights. &quot;This is not a problem you can spend your way out of,&quot; said Sophie Richardson, Asia advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. One westerner in Urumqi said there was little obvious sign of tension or anxiety among residents today and that although security was heightened it had remained relatively low-key. Reuters reported that the city was slightly quieter than usual. Inhabitants said last year&apos;s memories weighed on them but were not enough to stop them going to work, it added. One, Dou Huanying, told the agency: &quot;I am not worried because I believe in China. You can see all the extra measures that the government has taken.&quot; But Gladney said that while it was hard to be sure of sentiment in Xinjiang, given that many people feared the repercussions of speaking about the situation, underlying divisions appeared greater than ever following last July&apos;s violence, with &quot;simmering anger and resentment on both sides.&quot; But he added that Han who had grown up in the region also felt left behind by the recent influx of migrants. &quot;Han and Uighur from the region feel they miss out on opportunities because so much in China is based on guanxi [relationships] \u2013 where people work with people they are familiar with,&quot; he said. Dr Joanne Smith Finley, an expert in Uighur studies at Newcastle University, added: &quot;[These plans] won&apos;t have the desired effect unless the Chinese government brings in legislation outlawing employment discrimination.&quot; She said that since unrest in the mid-Nineties, &quot;Uighurs are increasingly perceived ... as &apos;ungrateful&apos; for the job opportunities, medical care, education and general progress brought to them by the bountiful People&apos;s Republic of China&quot;. Experts also question whether the oil rich North&apos;s rapid development can be copied by the largely agricultural, predominantly Uighur south. While China&apos;s economic powerhouses \u2013 such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen \u2013 have been ordered to help the poorest areas, some are sceptical about the basis for sustained growth. Critics also believe a shift in cultural policy and attitudes is needed. Smith Finley said that many Uighurs felt earlier migrants had respected their culture, while more recent waves had imposed their own lifestyle. But last year&apos;s violence has hardened attitudes among many Han Chinese. The predominantly Uighur assaults on Han on 5 July last year were followed by revenge attacks on Uighurs. Two months later, tens of thousands of angry Han took to the streets following claims of syringe attacks by Uighurs, complaining the government was not protecting them. While experts debate how the region can recover from the violence, the causes of last year&apos;s riots are as bitterly disputed as ever. The government blames separatists for fomenting violence from overseas. But Uighur exiles deny the allegation, most saying they seek autonomy rather than independence. They also claim security forces brutally cracked down on an initially peaceful protest prompted by Han murders of Uighur migrant workers in southern China. In a report published by Amnesty International on Friday, one witness of events in Urumqi alleged police shot dead a protester. Another said security forces later shot a group of Uighurs in the back as they fled amid rioting. There is no way to verify the claims independently. Witnesses at the time suggested that tensions spilled over as the police tried to push demonstrators out of the city centre. Officials have said that security forces shot dead 12 rioters after violence erupted. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 July 2010.

Headlined &quot;Shanghai Reveals Torture Secrets&quot;, the article, by Tillman Durdin, detailed torture techniques used against inmates of the Bridge House, a secret prison run by the Japanese in that Chinese city. The victims included Chinese and American soldiers, who suffered such horrors as lit cigarettes jammed up their nostrils and the use of electric shocks. Durdin continued:  &quot;The water treatment was another violent torture the Japanese used in the Bridge House. The American [an unnamed source], explaining it, said his face was covered with a towel, except for the nostrils. Then a guard, using a tea kettle, poured water slowly down the victim&apos;s nostrils. If the victim did not swallow he drowned; if he swallowed he became bloated, suffering extreme abdominal pain.&quot;  This is waterboarding, and Durdin&apos;s report is significant mainly because of his straightforward description of it as torture. Not that anyone would have thought twice about that description back then. According to a study released recently by the Joan Shorenstein Centre on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, the New York Times and other major papers invariably referred to waterboarding as torture until the Bush-Cheney administration began using it to extract information from suspected terrorists. After 2002, the word torture all but disappeared from news accounts of waterboarding. As the students who conducted the study observe:  &quot;The results of this study demonstrate that there was a sudden, significant, shift in major print media&apos;s treatment of waterboarding at the beginning of the 21st century. The media&apos;s modern coverage of waterboarding did not begin in earnest until 2004, when the first stories about abuses at Abu Ghraib were released. After this point, articles most often used words such as &apos;harsh&apos; or &apos;coercive&apos; to describe waterboarding or simply gave the practice no treatment, rather than labelling it torture as they had done for the previous seven decades.&quot;  How pronounced was the shift? The study found that from the early 1930s until 1999, the New York Times characterised waterboarding as torture in 44 of 54 news articles on the subject (81.5%), and the Los Angeles Times in 26 of 27 articles (96.3%). By contrast, from 2002 to 2008, the New York Times referred to waterboarding as torture in just two of 143 articles (1.4%); the LA Times, three of 63 (4.8%); the Wall Street Journal, one of 63 (1.6%); and USA Today, not at all. Significantly, the study found no reluctance on the part of newspaper editors to label waterboarding as torture on their opinion pages. The logical conclusion is that news executives decided avoiding the &quot;T&quot; word had become an essential rule of objective news coverage \u2013 a rule they dared not violate for fear of being accused of liberal bias. &quot;This government does not torture people,&quot; George W Bush proclaimed in 2005. And there was little to contradict that statement in the largest American newspapers. The Shorenstein study, published in April, did not became more widely known until last week, when the media were mainly preoccupied with the upcoming Fourth of July holiday. New York Times executive editor Bill Keller, speaking through his paper&apos;s Media Decoder blog, called the study &quot;somewhat misleading and tendentious,&quot; and added that referring to waterboarding as torture would have amounted to &quot;taking sides in a political dispute&quot;. Yet, before Bush and Dick Cheney came along, it wouldn&apos;t have occurred to anyone that waterboarding wasn&apos;t torture, as the Times&apos;s own archives show. It&apos;s not as though we didn&apos;t know better. During the last presidential campaign, John McCain, himself a victim of torture during the Vietnam war, unloaded on fellow candidate Rudy Giuliani when the former New York mayor suggested that waterboarding wasn&apos;t torture. On another occasion, McCain pointed out, correctly, that waterboarding was among the crimes for which Japanese officers were executed after the second world war. Does a single word matter? After all, Keller says of waterboarding that &quot;we describe the practice vividly, and we point out that it is denounced by international covenants and human rights advocates as a form of torture.&quot; Keller&apos;s justification is similar to that voiced by National Public Radio ombudsman, Alicia Shepard, in an interview last year with her network&apos;s On the Media programme. &quot;Why is it so important to call something torture?&quot; she asked. &quot;You know, when you describe the technique, I think that sounds like torture to me. Isn&apos;t it the job of the news media to put the facts out there, to give as much detailed information and to put it in context?&quot; I disagree with Keller and Shepard. In doing so, I am contradicting a little voice in my head telling me it&apos;s better to describe than to label. But this isn&apos;t about the rules of good writing. It&apos;s about understanding exactly what took place during the long, dark years of the Bush presidency. We have not even begun to come to terms with what was done in our name during that period. Apologists such as Liz Cheney criticise Barack Obama for being weak because he ended the barbaric practices championed by her father. Words matter. If our largest newspapers had referred to waterboarding by its proper name, as they did in the decades leading up to the Bush years, we might be having a more honest discussion today about issues such as Guant\u00e1namo, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the ongoing fight against terrorism.", "tags": ["Torture", "Law", "George Bush", "US news", "Human rights", "Newspapers", "Media", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-06T15:07:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jul/08/natural-world-terry-jones-dive-watch-this", "sentences": ["MS Shanghai Tales9pm, BBC4Out of Shanghai&apos;s 20 million people, this follows the life of one man: Liu Wei, hassled tour guide, who is trying to get ahead and earn money while dealing with his materialistic 21-year-old girlfriend and his grumpy parents."], "title": "Natural World | Tim Marloe Meets . . .

For years, migrant workers in China have been seen as a massive workforce without collective power. The rural economy has long been unable to sustain its population. And since gaige\u00a0kaifang (economic reforms and opening-up), when China lowered its barriers to global capitalism three decades ago, millions of impoverished peasants and rural labourers have moved from city to\u00a0city and province to province in search of a\u00a0livelihood. This 200-million-strong army now makes up half of China&apos;s urban workforce and has contributed to half of China&apos;s gross domestic product. Yet they remain a marginalised and deprived group, with no rights and often no status in the cities \u2013 fundamentally as a result of the state&apos;s hukou, or household registration, system set up in 1958 to control rural-to-urban migration. The Chinese state, now faced with growing workers&apos; discontent, has responded. In his hyped-up public relations tour, Premier Wen Jiabao shook hands with migrant workers and\u00a0told them that their work was glorious. But\u00a0when he was confronted with a migrant worker asking him why\u00a0he has no rights to send his children to school\u00a0in Beijing, where he\u00a0works, Wen simply said: &quot;Things have to\u00a0change slowly.&quot; But how long do migrant workers have to wait for the government to end the hukou system that deprives them of their rights to basic healthcare, education and welfare? Conditions in the Apple factory gained global headlines recently. But frustration and anger can be heard among migrant workers working for domestic as well as foreign-owned businesses. During my research over the\u00a0last two years, I have seen how workers cope with minimal wages, long\u00a0working hours, random dismissals and factory closures. Labour disputes are noticeably on the rise. I have seen migrant construction workers living in metal shacks without heating throughout the winter. They found it hard to live on \u00a36 a day as they had to send most of their earnings home, but still hope the work will go on. With many casual labourers queuing to get a job, these builders did not consider industrial action possible. I saw Sichuanese migrants toiling in the northern brick kilns for \u00a34 or \u00a35 for a 14-hour working day. At a brick kiln owned by corrupt local officials and &quot;protected&quot; by criminal networks, hundreds of workers were owed half a year&apos;s wages. When they went on a spontaneous strike to demand their wages back, they were immediately sacked. I also met former miners of Henan \u2013 they slaved in the dark for 18p a day and eventually had no choice but to migrate to a southern city for safer and better means of livelihood. In the worst cases, workers are faced\u00a0with corporate violence \u2013 in Shandong, a migrant construction worker had his hand chopped off by\u00a0thugs hired by the company when asking about wage arrears. When seeking justice, migrant workers either cannot afford the legal costs or cannot prove their employment because they have no contracts. Many migrant workers saw jobs in the foreign-owned manufacturing plants as an improvement in their work choices. Wages were considered higher there. However, this perception changed last year when migrant workers&apos; wages began to decline and conditions worsened generally in the manufacturing south. Those who remained at work were told that they have to share the burden of business decline in a downturn. There has been a recent increase in local minimum wages in some cities, yet migrant workers&apos; average wage levels remain extremely low \u2013 their minimum wages are set at just 40% to 60% of the average local wage. For instance, they are paid \u00a375 per month in cities such as Guangzhou or Shanghai \u2013 with much of that being sent back to families. But if the current strikes spread and\u00a0workers all over China begin demanding higher wages, better conditions and trades union recognition \u2013 in both foreign-owned and domestic companies \u2013 things might really start to\u00a0change.

Michael Ward, managing director of Harrods, said: &quot;Can we open stores in other geographies? That opportunity is there.

The focus on China underlines the growing importance of its shoppers to high-end retailers. The number of Chinese visiting Harrods is up 125% this year \u2013 and they like to buy. The average spend of a Chinese shopper is more than triple that of an American visitor to the store. The expansion plans come as Walpole Group, which represents British luxury brands including Harrods, Jimmy Choo and Wentworth golf club, seeks a meeting with the business secretary, Vince Cable, to ask for UK border rules to be relaxed to attract more high-spending Chinese tourists. According to Walpole deputy chairman Guy Salter, Chinese visitors can get a visa for 24 European countries which lasts 90 days and costs \u20ac60 (\u00a350), but need a separate one for the UK which only lasts 30 days, costs \u00a367 and involves a 10-page application. &quot;The number one activity for mainland Chinese tourists is shopping.

Figures released last week by the Higher Education Statistics Agency showed that about 10% of 2009 graduates failed to find work during the past year. As if that weren&apos;t bad enough, the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) this week released the findings of its biannual survey, showing an average of around 70 applications for every graduate job, with employers expecting to see a further 6.9% drop in vacancies this year \u2013 a forecast nearly four times worse than the AGR&apos;s own predictions just six months ago. The AGR&apos;s chief executive, Carl Gilleard, points out that the depressing forecast reflects a fragmented graduate jobs market in which sectors such as finance are now showing high levels of growth, while others, including law and engineering, remain in the doldrums. &quot;The important thing for graduates is to keep their ears to the ground,&quot; he says. &quot;A snapshot survey of our members reveals that 30% haven&apos;t yet filled their vacancies.&quot; Yet for those prepared to look farther afield, there may be a glimmer of hope from the increasing numbers of UK graduates who are successfully finding work overseas. Nannette Ripmeester, a Rotterdam-based international careers expert who has worked in 17 countries, says the jobs outlook is not as bleak everywhere. &quot;Within the European Union, the UK and Spanish jobs markets have been worst-hit, but other countries such as the Netherlands, and also newer member states like Poland, have not suffered as much,&quot; she says. &quot;Outside Europe, think of Asia and places like China and Singapore, where jobs markets are considerably better.&quot; Jamie Foster, 24, is a UK graduate working in Beijing, China. Having obtained a history and Chinese degree from Nottingham University, followed by a business master&apos;s from the School of Oriental and Asian Studies, he admits he &quot;always had an eye on China&quot;, but his lack of success job hunting in the UK hastened his passage east. &quot;It&apos;s a bit like the wild west out here,&quot; says Foster, who arrived in Beijing in January after five months of applying fruitlessly to City financial institutions. &quot;It&apos;s unlike any other country in the world. The incredible thing about Beijing, or Shanghai for that matter, is the number of new companies popping up every day.&quot; Through CRCC Asia, a company that, for a fee, arranges internships in China for UK students, he undertook a\u00a0two-month work placement in Beijing while at university. He found networking opportunities abundant and met the American start-up entrepreneurs for whom he now works full-time, helping to form private equity companies. Foster says that while speaking a\u00a0little Mandarin beforehand helped, a lack of local language need not be a\u00a0barrier to finding work \u2013 although he warns would-be gold prospectors to expect a fast-moving, entrepreneurial environment rather than structured graduate schemes. &quot;So many entrepreneurs come out looking to make a buck and they want graduates from the UK and the US who have the tangible skills to work in a business like that,&quot; he says. Neil Chowings, managing director of Work Group, a Hong Kong-based recruitment firm, says that while the Chinese graduate recruitment market has massive problems of its own \u2013 with 30% of university leavers annually unable to find jobs \u2013 UK graduates can bring something unique to China&apos;s rapidly growing economy. &quot;There&apos;s a huge shortage of innovative, entrepreneurial, free-thinking graduates in China,&quot; he points out. &quot;Culturally, it is still a very controlled government state. Workers are not used to voicing their own opinions, which is where foreign graduates tend to do better.&quot; Opportunities in China are not confined to financial whizzkids, either. Akram Shalabi, 23, studied for a mathematics degree at King&apos;s College, London, followed by a law course at BPP law school. Last summer he undertook a two-month internship in international law in Beijing. &quot;I was applying for law training contracts in the UK and I wasn&apos;t getting any,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought, why not go to\u00a0China and enhance my CV?&quot; After returning, Shalabi still found it difficult to break into a UK law firm, so decided to study for a master&apos;s in mathematics at Cambridge University. Now he is going back to Beijing later this month to teach maths at university there, while keeping an eye out for suitable openings with law firms. He thinks it is quite feasible for graduates to find work in China and has been astonished by the quality of experience on offer. &quot;What really surprised me is how UK graduates have real credibility, which you don&apos;t have here,&quot; he says. &quot;On my internship I\u00a0was given real responsibility, not just making tea or doing photocopying. I chaired meetings and I even held a press conference. I experienced things you probably wouldn&apos;t experience in five years in your career in the UK.&quot; Closer to home, the change of government looks set to herald new graduate opportunities in a rather unexpected overseas location. William Hague&apos;s comments last week about increasing the UK&apos;s representation at the European Commission&apos;s Brussels headquarters delighted senior British EU officials who had been anticipating a further distancing of relations from the new foreign secretary, hitherto renowned as a eurosceptic. &quot;In our last main recruitment competition for graduate administrators, the UK made up only about 1.7% of applications, which is incredibly poor in relation to its population,&quot; says David Bearfield, director of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which recruits EC staff. &quot;We&apos;re not allowed to recruit by nationality, but we want to work with the UK government to see how we can dramatically increase the number of applications.&quot; EPSO mainly recruits graduates with language skills for jobs as translators, conference interpreters and lawyer-linguists. Bearfield says that in response to Hague&apos;s olive branch, the EC will seek to establish itself with UK universities and careers services as a genuine graduate destination. &quot;We believe we have a really attractive and unique career offering,&quot; he says. Charles Gittins translates documents into English \u2013 mainly from Greek, Estonian and five other official EU languages \u2013 at the EC&apos;s English language department in Brussels. &quot;Seven is kind of average,&quot; he says. As much as anything, he enjoys the mixed international working environment. &quot;You go to the canteen and you can hear all the 23\u00a0official EU languages being spoken.&quot; Drawn to the work and the political surroundings, Gittins decided to apply to the EC after completing his degree in modern languages at Oxford. After passing the written and oral parts of the EC&apos;s recruitment competition, he was then put on a reserve list for potential vacancies. It took two years from his first test to being offered a\u00a0job, &quot;and I was one of the quickest&quot;, he jokes. But the good news for those interested is that the process has now been streamlined considerably. Bearfield admits that the necessity of speaking two other languages (one of which must be French or German) has historically been a sticking point for many UK applicants to the EC. But he says the first round of the competition \u2013 which until now has had to be completed mostly in a second language \u2013 has changed, so the bulk is in English which, it is hoped, will encourage more British graduates to apply. &quot;We hope to work more and more with the UK government on schemes like the Fast Stream, which has just been brought back,&quot; he says. &quot;I think there&apos;s been this perception in the UK that the EC just offers awful, bureaucratic jobs, but nothing could be further from the truth. They&apos;re brilliant, exciting careers where you can really make a difference.&quot; Nannette Ripmeester points out that in the long run, working abroad can make you more employable at home. &quot;Once the jobs market picks up again in the UK, which it will do eventually, international experience gives you something extra when applying to your home jobs market,&quot; she says. And while moving abroad can seem like a risk, particularly to far-flung destinations such as China, for Foster the rewards on offer easily make up for it. &quot;I&apos;m getting exposure to $100m deals,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m dealing with the kind of figures I wouldn&apos;t touch in a UK investment bank for five or 10 years. Frankly I wouldn&apos;t have dreamed of this six months ago.&quot; Five tips for finding work abroad 1. Be focused. It might sound obvious, but having a specific goal in mind will help focus you. &quot;Either look for particular sectors, companies, or countries,&quot; suggests international careers expert Nannette Ripmeester. 2. Consider work permits/visas. This may not be a problem if you&apos;re heading to the EU, but for other countries it&apos;s essential to check with the relevant embassy or consulate. Agencies can help with this process \u2013 expect to pay for the service, though. 3. Brush up on your languages. Obviously a grasp of local languages is a\u00a0big advantage in mainland Europe, &quot;but UK graduates are lucky in that English is still the lingua franca of business,&quot; says Ripmeester. Chinese employers might want you to take a\u00a0crash course in Mandardin \u2013 but they may even sponsor you if they like what they see. 4. Be culturally sensitive. &quot;Almost more important than not speaking the language is the way British workers often forget jobs markets differ in other countries,&quot; says Ripmeester. &quot;For example, employers may not place such value on things like your hobbies as they might in the UK.&quot; So do your homework and show you understand the locals before you apply. 5. Think tactically. Do you know people who already live where you&apos;re heading? If so, ask them to put the feelers out on your behalf, and if possible take advantage of their hospitality (but don&apos;t overdo it). And network as much as possible, both before you go and while you&apos;re there. A personal recommendation can be invaluable in any culture.

Anchee Min&apos;s well-meaning fictional biography of the writer sets out to be an epic of modern China told through an imagined friendship between Buck and a Chinese woman called Willow; disappointingly, it deteriorates into an exotic jumble of hastily sketched characters and ill-digested Chinese history. Born in rural south-eastern China around 1890, Willow is the daughter of an over-privileged ne&apos;er-do-well who, after bankrupting the clan through his extravagance, survives by thieving from his neighbours. Aged eight, Willow becomes a pickpocket herself, and it is through stealing the wallet of the local missionary that she is eventually befriended by his daughter, Pearl. In time, Pearl and Willow migrate to the nearby cities of Shanghai and Nanjing to begin new lives as modern, educated women. After the man with whom they have both fallen in love (the celebrated modern poet Hsu Chih-mo) chooses Pearl, Willow consoles herself by marrying a tough communist apparatchik called Dick. Pearl leaves China before the communist victory in 1949, while Willow remains to endure the political horrors of Maoism. Finally, after the deaths of both Mao and Pearl, a nonagenarian Willow makes a pilgrimage to America to scatter Chinese earth over Pearl&apos;s grave. The first third of the book \u2013 which trots along at a respectable pace through Willow&apos;s and Pearl&apos;s picaresque early childhoods \u2013 has plenty of charm, with mutual incomprehension between earnest missionaries and bemused Chinese villagers providing nice flashes of humour. Looking at a picture of a heavily bearded Jesus, Willow&apos;s father objects that &quot;no Chinese would worship a god that looked like a monkey&quot;. After about 10 years of this, though, the book becomes a rather breathless sprint through 20th-century China. Anchee Min seems determined to drag her characters to the centre of almost every major political event of the period: the nationalist and communist revolutions, the civil war, high-level Maoist power struggles. Twice \u2013 in high melodramatic style \u2013 the book&apos;s characters are rescued from certain death by absurd coincidences. By the novel&apos;s halfway point, key relationships are not making a great deal of sense. The book is tonally inconsistent, too, veering between fortune-cookie wisdom (&quot;the fisherman profits when a crab and a lobster are locked in a fight&quot;), chick-lit repartee (&quot;As long as you are in the picture,&quot; Willow tells Pearl, &quot;I don&apos;t stand a chance with Hsu Chih-mo&quot;), valley-girl vernacular (&quot;oh my God,&quot; exclaims young, Protestant Pearl) and historical cribs. If you&apos;re looking for insight into Buck&apos;s extraordinary life, you should probably read Hilary Spurling&apos;s new biography. If you want to know more about Maoist China, you could try Anchee Min&apos;s own autobiographical account, Red Azalea (among many fine books). For understandable logistical reasons, the market share of Chinese writing in English translation has long been dwarfed by that of China-related novels and memoirs written directly into English: few editors have the time and knowhow to grapple with the mass of work published in Chinese. But when a book is as hit-and-miss as this one, it can&apos;t help but seem a wasted opportunity.

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian yesterday Howman said scepticism over the efficacy of the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission, that began around the 2008 Olympics, was unfounded. &quot;We have worked very hard with Jamaica since Beijing,&quot; he said from Wada&apos;s Montreal offices. &quot;We were alert to the comments and have offered our help. We&apos;ve been there four or five times; most recently in May at the invitation of the Jamaican sports minister. We prepared a report about how their national anti-doping agency is progressing. In general it was a very positive report and there was nothing that made the agency non-compliant with the Wada Code. &quot;There were some suggestions for improvement around daily operational issues, such as sample collection, providing more out-of-competition tests and looking at potential conflicts of interest in several individuals who were closely involved in sports. And they are making strides in that direction.&quot; The roots of the rumours about Jamaica&apos;s supposedly weak regulatory regime lie in Beijing, where Jamaican athletes scooped six gold medals in the sprint and hurdles events at the 2008 Olympic Games. At the time the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission was an under-funded organisation that did not match the standards required of those in athletics&apos; other leading nations. Voices such as Carl Lewis and even Jamaica&apos;s own Usain Bolt, who stated 14 months ago that his homeland&apos;s anti-doping facilities were not up to scratch, cast doubt on the island&apos;s commitment to the fight against drugs in sport. However, Howman believes much has changed since. Nor was he concerned that Jamaica has declined membership in the Caribbean&apos;s Regional Anti-Doping Organisation. &quot;They decided they wanted their own national programme,&quot; he said. &quot;This has been backed by the government, which passed a law and that is fine.&quot; Fraser, as reigning Olympic and world 100m champion, is the highest-profile Jamaican athlete to test positive to date. Her positive test for Oxycodone, a synthetic opiate, has led to more speculation about Jamaican dominance of sprint disciplines. Yet, like others from the island recently to have tested positive, her case is deeply nuanced. Fraser does not deny she took the medication, which she had been given by her own coach, Stephen Francis, to alleviate severe toothache, and admits she was at fault. She says her crime was more clerical error than deliberate deceit and regrets omitting to report the drug on her doping-control form to the Diamond League meeting in Shanghai in May. &quot;I take some responsibility as athletes are supposed to be responsible for what they take,&quot; she has said. &quot;But I am upset as everybody is starting to assume I am taking drugs. My reputation is ruined somewhat.&quot; That might not wash with Wada, although its zero-tolerance approach does not prevent athletes from treating ailments with the appropriate medication when they arise. Nick Davies,spokesman for the International Association of Athletics Federations, said they were &quot;disappointed with her carelessness. Athletes must pay more attention to what they ingest as our rules are clear.&quot; There will be a debate about whether Wada should be busying itself with cases such as Fraser&apos;s. Oxycodone is a painkiller akin to morphine, not widely acknowledged for making people run faster, nor does the Wada Code consider it a masking agent for other, more sinister substances. Asafa Powell, who has in the past called for drugs cheats to serve jail sentences rather than mere competition bans, has swung behind Fraser in this case. &quot;It&apos;s a lot different in Shelly&apos;s case as she didn&apos;t cheat,&quot; the Jamaican sprinter said. &quot;She took some painkillers, [which] is something different. If it doesn&apos;t help you perform well, I don&apos;t think it should be on the list because, if it causes you to perform worse, it&apos;s your fault. It&apos;s complicated but if it&apos;s not something that helps you it shouldn&apos;t be on the list.&quot; Howman conceded this is an area of the code that needs scrutiny. He said: &quot;We have already revised the [2004] code, in 2007, and we conducted a review last year and will again in 2012. We&apos;re alert to the need to check that the laws are proper and acceptable. If there is an uprising against them, of course we will do something about it.&quot;", "tags": ["Athletics", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-09T23:05:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jul/13/china-english-schools", "sentences": ["Today there are 11 schools featuring Mickey Mouse statues, Peter Pan text books and Little Mermaid teaching aids \u2013 eight in Shanghai and three in Beijing - and the company plans to double the number of locations by the end of the year.", "At the end of last year, a spate of bankruptcies at some of Shanghai and Beijing&apos;s longest-running language schools was at least partly linked to their failure to attract new students or top teachers in an increasingly competitive market."], "title": "Battle intensifies for China's $2bn English teaching business", "article": "In South Korea, pushy parents who want their children to get ahead in learning English send them for an operation to elongate the tongue, in the belief that it will make pronunciation easier. Such is the national obsession with having a fluent command of the language that drastic measures are taken in some cases when children are just six months old. China has not yet reached the same level of fanaticism over spoken English, but it is not far off. Chinese children with affluent parents are packed off to classes staffed by American, Canadian and British teachers as soon as they can speak. High school students are frequently enrolled in extra-curricular classes to cram for the English component of the university entrance exam. And young professionals aspiring to a more interesting and lucrative career flock to classrooms and online lessons and even stadiums alongside tens of thousands of other evangelical linguists. To meet this rising demand, there are now an estimated 30,000 organisations or companies offering private English classes in China. The market has nearly doubled in size in the last five years and is now worth around $3.1bn. Disney English, a subsidiary of the US entertainment giant, has rapidly expanded since launching in October 2008, after thousands of parents signed their toddlers up for its special curriculum of Disney-themed classes. Today there are 11 schools featuring Mickey Mouse statues, Peter Pan text books and Little Mermaid teaching aids \u2013 eight in Shanghai and three in Beijing - and the company plans to double the number of locations by the end of the year. Andrew Sugerman, Disney English&apos;s general manager, said: &quot;We take children from age two to 12. Parents coming to our schools want their kids to start young, to reach a higher level of English. They want their kids to be comfortable communicating with others, particularly with foreigners, to be more competitive.&quot; Analysts are predicting growth across the private English school sector in China of between 12% and 15% in 2010 as disposable incomes in urban areas rise and a greater proportion of that money is funnelled into educating the next generation. Privately owned EF Education First, which has more than 130 schools under the English First (EF) banner, including many that are franchises, has witnessed fierce competition as barriers to entry have come down and companies have found it relatively easy to enter the market to meet the demand. &quot;Like any growing industry, specialisation and segmentation have occurred and competition is much greater than before,&quot; said Ming Chen, EF&apos;s executive vice-president. In this climate, big brands \u2013 both domestic Chinese and foreign \u2013 with marketing clout, nationwide reach and access to capital, have been carving up the market and gaining share from the tens of thousands of smaller, local schools. New York stock exchange-listed New Oriental, China&apos;s largest private education provider with 324 learning centres and schools, is best-known for its exam preparation training courses. Since its 2006 debut, its shares have more than quadrupled in value. In a recent analyst note, investment bank Goldman Sachs pointed out that the group&apos;s enrolments in the third quarter of the current financial year were up 18% year on year, ahead of expectations. Chinese-owned Global Education &amp; Technology group, which operates the Global IELTS brand, offering English language test preparation training at many of its 49 owned and 198 franchised schools, will be hoping to recreate similar shareholder value following its expected $100m initial public offering on the Nasdaq later this year. There is also speculation that UK media giant Pearson, which last year bought the Wall Street English chain, with 39 schools in China, is preparing to invest further in the region, after earning a $1.6bn windfall from the sale of one of its subsidiaries. Analyst\u00a0Lorna Tilbian at Numis in London said she expected Pearson to spend the cash on &quot;emerging markets and digital technologies&quot;. As a clutch of dominant, national and increasingly professional English language schools emerges, several smaller, localised teaching institutions, with less marketing and investment firepower, have started to crack. At the end of last year, a spate of bankruptcies at some of Shanghai and Beijing&apos;s longest-running language schools was at least partly linked to their failure to attract new students or top teachers in an increasingly competitive market. In the fallout it emerged that teachers and pupils at the collapsed schools were owed considerable amounts in unpaid wages and course fees and that many of the staff did not have proper teaching visas for China. EF Education First estimates that there are just 5,000 native-speaker English teachers with valid teaching visas in mainland China. With more than 300 million students in the education system who could potentially seek out private English classes, that suggests a major staffing shortfall. To some extent, Chinese nationals with a strong command of English are able to step in, but many students \u2013 and their parents \u2013 still place greater value on native English speakers. Disney English&apos;s solution has been to recruit teachers with specific young-learner teaching qualifications in the US, and arrange appropriate visas. In addition the company has launched a China-wide recruitment drive. For qualified and experienced English teachers, the dynamics of the industry in China represent an opportunity. But for the thousands of small English language schools, unable to compete with the new breed of slicker professionals, times may be about to get significantly tougher.", "tags": ["Tefl", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-13T13:00:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/13/google-china-business-with-the-west", "sentences": ["The US chamber of commerce in Shanghai has been equally forthright in voicing its members&apos; frustrations, and this open discontent is a noteworthy departure from the tradition of silence about the difficulties of doing business under Beijing."], "title": "Is Google just the start? | Isabel Hilton", "article": "When the latest list of firms approved by Beijing to provide online mapping services in China was published last week, it was no great surprise that Google&apos;s name was missing. Google has an estimated two million users of its mobile mapping services in China, but now the state bureau of surveying and mapping services is reviewing the sector. Only those companies of &quot;excellent quality&quot;, says the bureau, will be approved. Google, apparently, has so far failed to demonstrate that &quot;excellence&quot; to Beijing&apos;s satisfaction. Google is still in a messy stand-off with the government over its decision last year to stop censoring its search results in China. What was less predictable and more disturbing for businesspeople convinced that the Chinese market is a potential Eldorado was that none of the 23 approved companies listed so far is foreign. There was no mention of Nokia or Microsoft, for instance, both in good standing with Beijing. The mapping market is small but rapidly growing, and at present dominated by Baidu, the compliant Chinese search giant that was the main beneficiary of Google&apos;s defenestration. If the lack of foreign names on the list had been an isolated case, it would have attracted less angst. But for months now foreign entrepreneurs have been unusually vocal about what many perceive as a growing policy of state-led discrimination in favour of Chinese firms. Remarks made by Jeff Immelt, chief executive of the American giant General Electric, to dinner companions in Rome last week were among the more colourful recent complaints. &quot;I really worry about China,&quot; he said. &quot;I am not sure that in the end they want any of us to win, or any of us to be successful.&quot; GE earned $5.3bn in China last year, but Immelt complained that conditions have never been harder \u2013 so hard that they are beginning to look elsewhere. It seems unthinkable that major players could give up on the Chinese market, but Immelt&apos;s discontent was previewed earlier in the year by European and US business lobbies in China. In April J\u00f6rg Wuttke, then president of the EU chamber of commerce in Beijing, complained that most of his members felt they had run into an &quot;unexpected and impregnable blockade&quot;, and that, while Chinese companies could buy up foreign industrial groups \u2013 along with their intellectual property \u2013 non-Chinese firms enjoyed no reciprocity. The resentment cuts across many sectors \u2013 from manufacturers of wind-turbines, excluded by rules on turbine size which fit only Chinese producers, to mobile phone makers who face demands for the testing of already thoroughly tested handsets. The US chamber of commerce in Shanghai has been equally forthright in voicing its members&apos; frustrations, and this open discontent is a noteworthy departure from the tradition of silence about the difficulties of doing business under Beijing. Playing nice over the long term \u2013 demonstrating that they were &quot;friends&quot; of China \u2013 would eventually be rewarded in access to a fast-growing market with huge potential. So what has changed, to make that friendship now seem unrequited? One factor is the strategic decision China implemented last year to create national champions across a range of technologies. Keen to move up the value chain, Beijing set in place rules to foster &quot;indigenous innovation&quot;\u2013 which foreign firms clearly see as discriminatory. The rules exclude foreign companies from parts of the market and demand technology transfer to China from others as the price of doing business. Given the scale of intellectual property theft in China, many western firms have been left feeling abused. The slope of the playing field today seems steeper, even for the most robust multinationals. When it comes to free trade rules and local interests, no country&apos;s record is pristine. But today&apos;s potentially toxic combination of resurgent nationalism and the effects of economic crisis in the west have generated a sour mood in China that is amply reflected in the US and Europe. Since the financial crisis, China has been palpably more assertive across issues from economic policy to human rights. The world, Beijing seems to believe, needs China more than China needs the world. To that degree, the tensions in trade policy reflect a profound change in global power that is reshaping assumptions about globalisation.

Chief executive Angela Ahrendts said the move was in keeping with Burberry&apos;s aim of &quot;unifying the brand&quot; famous for its black, tan and red check. China was an &quot;exciting&quot; market, with the deal, which takes in 50 stores in 30 cities, providing a platform for expansion in a &quot;high-growth luxury region&quot;. Ahrendts&apos;s predecessor, Rose Marie Bravo, is credited with reinventing what was once a dowdy British trenchcoat-maker as a global luxury brand. She instigated the slow process of buying out its licence holders around the world and Ahrendts has continued with it since taking over in 2006. In February Burberry, whose glamorous campaigns are fronted by Harry Potter actress Emma Watson, announced the closure of its Spanish business, which made a cheaper clothing line sold in stores such as El Corte Ingl\u00e9s. To persuade the fashion jetset to buy its expensive handbags such as the alligator skin &quot;Warrior&quot;, with a price tag of \u00a313,000, or its \u00a3200 cashmere snoods, which were one of last winter&apos;s bestsellers, Burberry has cracked down on the counterfeit goods being sold overseas and on the internet. It has also begun using its trademark check more subtly, after its success backfired in 2005 when former soap star Danniella Westbrook and her baby were snapped dressed from head to toe in it and football fans started sporting it on the terraces. The British brand has been on sale in China for 20 years through a franchise partnership with Kwok Hang Holdings and Ahrendts said it was an &quot;optimal time&quot; to take the business in-house.

St Paul&apos;s cathedral, across the river, seems close enough to touch. It&apos;s the kind of view, and the kind of heroically stylised building, you would expect to see in some 1930s sci-fi movie: the perfect place for a hero and a villain to have a rooftop showdown. At 147 metres, the newly opened Strata is London&apos;s tallest residential building. The nine-metre blades I&apos;m standing beneath are housed in one of three wind turbines that crown this new tower soaring above Elephant and Castle, an area of the city not known for flashy penthouses. But Elephant and Castle is undergoing a massive, if slow, transition from a rundown miasma of noisy road intersections, underpasses and vast housing estates into what the Borough of Southwark hopes will be a \u00a31.5bn model of inner-city regeneration. The plan was first made public six years ago and work is unlikely to be completed before 2020. It&apos;s a colossal challenge, as well as an opportunity, and the \u00a3113.5m Strata, the first of three skyscrapers planned for here, is a symbol of the dynamism and energy the project demands. And that energy must, of course, be seen to be green. It&apos;s early days, but if the turbines work as planned, and aren&apos;t too noisy for residents in the pricey penthouses beneath them, they should generate 8% of this 43-storey building&apos;s energy needs. This is roughly enough to run its electrical and mechanical services (including three express lifts and automated window-cleaning rigs) as well as the lighting, heating and ventilation of its public spaces, which include an underground car and cycle\u00a0park. Strata is the first building in the world to incorporate wind turbines into its structure. Yes, the new Bahrain World Trade Centre in Manama, by the firm Atkins, also boasts three giant turbines, but these are set on steel struts connecting its twin towers, not part of the actual towers themselves. While I can vouch for the strength of the south-westerlies that will turn Strata&apos;s blades, whether its turbines will set a precedent for future British towers is less clear: this rooftop was exceedingly hard to construct, almost prohibitively so, every part of it having to be hauled up. However, what the three fans do, without a doubt, is give Strata a striking profile. Whether you find this exciting, disturbing or simply over-the-top will be down to personal taste, yet it&apos;s no surprise the tower has been dubbed the Electric Razor, not just because of its whirling blades but also because of its black and silver lines that seem to pixellate upwards; Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, has called it the Lipstick. So what do green experts think? &quot;You&apos;ve got to take your hat off to the design team for delivering a building that captures the imagination,&quot; says Paul King, head of the UK Green Building Council. &quot;I doubt wind power will become a common feature in high-rise inner city projects, but without this type of bold innovation, how would we ever know? Developments like this show that sustainability is increasingly becoming mainstream. That&apos;s something everyone should celebrate.&quot; Including the 1,000 or so people who have already moved into \u2013 or bought into \u2013 Strata&apos;s 408 flats (each boasting floor-to-ceiling windows). And there is a difference between the two. Nearly every flat was bought off-plan, before construction began, 50-75% of them by investors. This is a shame: the whole idea of the tower is that it should be a guiding light for new inner-city residential development. This is meant to be a home for local people, not a machine for property market profiteering. Indeed, 25% of the flats, on floors two to 10, are &quot;affordable homes&quot;, for those on incomes of less than \u00a360,000 (in central London that kind of money won&apos;t guarantee a home of your own); meanwhile, a three-floor pavilion to the side of the tower has been given to council residents leaving the soon-to-be-demolished Aylesbury Estate, a 1960s housing complex seen by most as an enormous failure. Tony Blair made his first speech as prime minister at this estate, in a bid to show his government would care for the poorest elements in society. To my mind, Strata&apos;s big propellers give the building the feel of an airship holding aloft the passenger cabins (or flats) below. Or perhaps it&apos;s more like an old-fashioned transatlantic liner with its complement of first-, second-and third-class passengers. I think of this as architect Ian Bogle, of London-based BFLS (formerly Hamiltons Architects), leads me through the tall, narrow lobby to the lifts that shoot silently up to the residential floors. &apos;You feel like you own the city&apos; The views are spectacular. Most front doors open directly onto gaping vistas of London, framed by giant windows. They are not for the faint-hearted. Bogle goes to open what looks like a door at the side of a window and I think he might vanish into the ether. As it happens, he&apos;s simply opening a perforated screen designed to let fresh air in. &quot;We&apos;ve tried to get as much daylight and fresh air as possible into the flats,&quot; says Bogle. &quot;You certainly feel as if you own the entire city from up here.&quot; Indeed you do. There are magic moments, too: way below, trains race in and out of buildings and seem to pass through the tower itself. It reminds me of the super-modern city drawn by Antonio Sant&apos;Elia, the Italian futurist architect, shortly before the first world war. His Citt\u00e0 Nuova was a dynamic, machine-like metropolis through which cars and even aircraft would pass, via openings in the buildings. His imaginings inspired film-makers, from William Cameron Menzie&apos;s Things to Come in 1936, to Ridley Scott&apos;s Blade Runner in 1982; they also resonated in city developments as dramatic and diverse as the Barbican, the Pompidou and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. And they echo today in these views from the Strata tower, and in its mighty\u00a0turbines. But are they just a tokenistic green gimmick? Or will they propel us towards a new urban architecture, one that&apos;s cinematically thrilling and ecologically sound? Until its sibling towers rise and the redevelopment of Elephant and Castle is complete, it will be hard to properly judge Strata. Right now, it stands alone, a sleek silver sentinel, towering over the follies of the recent past.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Green building", "Culture", "Energy efficiency", "Wind power", "Energy", "Renewable energy", "Environment", "Cities", "Skyscrapers"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-18T20:31:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/19/james-harding-mediaguardian-100-2010", "sentences": ["At the Financial Times he set up the paper&apos;s Shanghai bureau and worked as Washington bureau chief."], "title": "James Harding | MediaGuardian 100 2010", "article": "Job: editor, the TimesAge: 40Industry: publishingCirculation: 503,6422009 ranking: 39 James Harding was thrust into the frontline of the debate about newspapers&apos; digital future with Rupert Murdoch&apos;s decision to put a paywall up around the Times online.

We represent better value for money,&quot; says Chris Bones, dean of Henley Business School. The reputation of a UK MBA has been underpinned by consistently high research ratings, as business schools are mostly semi-autonomous departments of major universities, which draws a steady influx of overseas students. London Business School, Manchester Business School, Cambridge Judge Business School, Said Business School (University of Oxford), Imperial Business School, Lancaster University Management School, Warwick and Cass in London have all seen a rise in ranking and student numbers. In addition, Cranfield, Durham, Strathclyde and Open University Business School have joined an international elite of business schools that are triple-accredited by UK, European and US quality kitemarks. Business education in the UK has never been more widely respected. The rise in international students has accelerated a long-term trend. The Association of Business Schools says more than 80% of all students on full-time UK MBA courses are now from overseas. Henley Business School, part of Reading University, reflects the trend, with most students from India, Hong Kong, China and eastern Europe. Just 20% of its full-time MBA cohort are from the UK. &quot;Students are looking for an internationally recognised brand name,&quot; says Susan Rose, head of MBAs at Henley, where a full-time MBA costs \u00a333,500. Global demand In fact, the MBA is more international than ever, as demand for the gold standard business qualification goes global. Multinational companies want a qualification that crosses borders and the MBA, with its Harvard-based core modules in business strategy, finance and marketing, is widely regarded as the passport to senior management and boardrooms across the world. The rise of the Asian tiger economies of China, Hong Kong, Singapore and India led huge numbers of international students to apply to study MBAs in the west before sparking an academic gold rush as US, UK and European business schools set up branch campuses overseas, usually in partnership with local universities. The top US business schools, Harvard, Stanford and Wharton, attract many of the best students, and numerous US institutions offer generous bursaries for international students. But they are nowhere near as international as UK and European counterparts, and their two-year MBA programmes make them more expensive compared with UK or European rates. At Tuck Business School at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, 65% of students are American, with the rest split roughly from across Europe, Asia and Latin America. Tuck attracts around 250 students a year and its full-time cohort of 500 students is split into small groups for personal tuition according to the areas of business they want to specialise in. &quot;Demand for MBAs is higher than ever. We have 10 applicants for every place and academic standards are extremely high,&quot; says Tuck&apos;s dean, Paul Danos. &quot;Learning at Tuck is like being part of a great big family group. In your two years you will do internships with top companies, and 80% of our alumni stay in the US for their first job working for global companies like Google, Goldman Sachs or McKinsey.&quot; With fees of $50,000 a year most students take out a loan. Like many Ivy League institutions, Tuck has an in-house finance company that arranges low-interest student loans. Starting salaries on graduating are on average 2.5 times what a person was earning on entry. European leaders In Europe, IMD, Insead and the two Spanish schools IESE and IE (formerly known as Instituto de Empresa) lead the world rankings. Other schools are catching up fast. Set up as an executive training arm of Nestl\u00e9, Lausanne-based IMD is a private, not-for-profit foundation specialising in executive education for multinational corporations. &quot;That makes us a lot closer to business,&quot; says IMD&apos;s MBA faculty director, Martha Maznevski. &quot;Students who study with us are looking to change career, industry sector or location. More than half will change all three.&quot; IMD MBA students are older and more experienced than in many business schools. Their aim is jobs in senior management and even boardroom appointments. &quot;Companies are taking fewer risks in hiring. They want people with a significant track record and they are not just looking for a generic MBA. They are looking for individuals,&quot; says Maznevski. Five years&apos; management experience and fluency in two languages and a high Gmat (entry test) score are essential entry requirements. Based at Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management (RSM) is among the top 10 in Europe and one of the most international. &quot;We are 95% international and are noticeably more European than business schools in France or in the UK,&quot; says RSM&apos;s dean, George Yip. The Dutch school specialises in MBAs with a conscience. The Aspen Institute, an international thinktank from the US, ranks the school second in the world for teaching corporate social responsibility and sustainability. &quot;The financial crisis has made a difference to public perception of business. It is clear that the American model of shareholder capitalism is not working. Our [MBA] model [provides a] multi-stakeholder perspective,&quot; says Yip. Yip, who has taught in Harvard, UCLA, Judge Business School and London Business School, believes European institutions are where change is happening. To prove his point he cites RSM&apos;s move towards introducing technology that will encourage virtual online discussion. One thing is sure \u2013 competition between the world&apos;s top-ranking business schools is driving innovation and best practice. Embas: Stepping stone to the top job Global executive MBAs (Embas) are on the rise. Tailor-made for time-pressured senior executives whose jetsetting lifestyle leaves little time for conventional study, these qualifications bring together students from across the world. Rotterdam School of Management&apos;s global OneMBA is delivered in Washington, Mexico and Brazil, while the Trium MBA is taught on the Paris campus of \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris (HEC), at the London School of Economics and at the Stern Business School, New York University. The global Emba from the Business School of the University of Navarra (IESE) connects Madrid, New York and Shanghai. &quot;The bar for acceptance is very high and we&apos;re open to people from many cultures,&quot; says Frank Brown, dean of Fontainebleau-based Insead Business School. Insead&apos;s global Emba is aimed at senior executives with a minimum seven years&apos; management experience as the stepping stone to becoming a chief executive. Launched in 2003, the Insead programme spans France, Singapore and Abu Dhabi, where students fly in turn every six weeks for a week-long taught residential module. During the MBA, students will spend 12 weeks in face-to-face classroom sessions and the rest of the time distance learning. &quot;You can do it and keep the day job!&quot; says Brown. Choice of location is paramount. Insead&apos;s Fontainebleau campus is within easy reach of France&apos;s main transport hub, Charles de Gaulle airport.

It did nothing of the sort, of course, making my own name appear repeatedly and inelegantly (10 PRINT &quot;Saptarshi Ray&quot;; 20 GOTO 10) was all I achieved other than spending hours playing the likes of Jet Set Willy and Gunfright. The deception was one propagated by most of my generation and most parents were unknowingly complicit. We just wanted to play games but they didn&apos;t want to admit they were simply buying us a toy, but via our youthful vantage point of technical knowledge we helped assuage their guilt. Now the reverse seems true. If you believe the hype of Apple, Microsoft, Sony and their ilk, work or practical use of any kind is merely a byproduct of every gadget and gizmo&apos;s ability to make our lives that little bit more zany, wacky or cool. I recently saw a newspaper advert for a satnav-capable mobile phone, the strapline for which was something along the lines of: &quot;Now you&apos;ll always be able to find the pub your mates are drinking in.&quot; The latest TV ads for the iPad, iPhone, laptops and cameraphones dazzle us with claims that you can access Facebook or YouTube quicker than ever. That you can download music and films faster than before, and that you can tweet all of this in an instant. Advertising aimed at the youth market is nothing new, but these are apparently aimed at everyone. Somewhere along the way, consumer technology seems to have swung from what it can do to make our lives better, to what it can exclusively do to make our lives more fun. Surely it can do both? Mobile phones have migrated from a demographic of bombastic bankers and estate agents clinching deals, to teenagers and adults eager to use them to giggle at videos or contact people they see regularly anyway. Only a few years ago, advances in broadband, Wi-Fi, shadow servers and the like were seen as a step towards allowing people to work from anywhere. We were told phonecalls of immense clarity could be made to your office in San Francisco while you were on a train in Shanghai; you could access your files in Birmingham from an internet cafe in Kuala Lumpur. Technology meant you could manage your work-play ratio so much better. The play now seems to eclipse the work. I am not against this development: I like Facebook, I like Twitter, I like YouTube and the way the online environment&apos;s relative irreverence has seeped into newsrooms and companies and made them a bit less stuffy. But I fall short of nostalgia for the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, synonymous as it is with table football and laidback accountants with headsets on orange beanbags. Where we are now seems like a hangover of that period. Are we really becoming more frivolous as a society? Is the phenomenon of parents having flashier toys than their children a welcome or worrying development? Obviously working in the media is a biased sample, journalists are encouraged to tweet, post or forward funny and unusual material. And inversely, social media has been harnessed to help report some powerful stories by the public \u2013 such as Wikileaks&apos; footage of a Baghdad air strike or Twitter&apos;s role in the protest after the Iranian elections. But at what point did we stop thinking that advances in communications were primarily to aid a greater progress? On the one hand we are told to be more serious about the environment, carbon cost, lose our apathy towards politics and economics, hold big business to account, follow medical breakthroughs and the plight of farmers and workers in developing nations; yet on the other, we are driven to embrace our inner geeky child as technology becomes more portable and more convenient. Each time, the marketing pushes to become less uptight, more infantile \u2013 more teenage boy. I applaud the ingenuity behind developments in consumer technology, but surely there is a market for each new product beyond man-boys and fanboys? I wonder if we couldn&apos;t be shown their uses beyond ensuring we don&apos;t end up in the wrong pub.", "tags": ["Computing", "Games", "Technology", "Advertising", "Marketing & PR", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-22T15:02:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/22/chinese-army-cyber-war-department", "sentences": ["Ni Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military analyst, told the South China Morning Post: &quot;The USCYBERCOM aims at coping with hacker attacks as well as other cyber attacks, which means the internet will become another key battlefield in tomorrow&apos;s world."], "title": "Chinese army to target cyber war threat", "article": "The People&apos;s Liberation Army has unveiled its first department dedicated to tackling cyber war threats and protecting information security, Chinese media reported today.

Ni Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military analyst, told the South China Morning Post: &quot;The USCYBERCOM aims at coping with hacker attacks as well as other cyber attacks, which means the internet will become another key battlefield in tomorrow&apos;s world. &quot;It&apos;s a very important message to the PLA because the army did not have a united and centralised management system to command its information technology centres in different forces.&quot; Christian Le Miere, senior Asia analyst for Jane&apos;s Country Risk, said: &quot;Every major military has to be concerned about cyberwar. &quot;There was maybe some form of taboo [about setting up a dedicated centre], but as soon as the US does it, everyone says &apos;we can have one too&apos;.&quot; Le Miere said such security issues had gained attention after Estonia suffered cyberattacks which some blamed on Russia and Chinese faced allegations of state complicity in attacks on US sites. &quot;It is seen as an increasingly useful arena for competition and quasi-military espionage,&quot; he said. A recent report warned that Nato was increasingly vulnerable to cyberwarfare and US deputy defence secretary William Lynn said in a speech last year: &quot;We know ... that both Russia and China have the capability to disrupt elements of other nations&apos; information infrastructure.&quot; Discussing attacks on American governmental, military and private networks, he said the Pentagon had traced some back to China but &quot;[could] not attribute whether it&apos;s a private, public, whether it&apos;s military, intelligence, industry or criminal.&quot; But China also feels vulnerable.

An official with the National Computer Network Emergency Response Team accused foreign countries of &quot;rumour mongering and overstating the cyber threat from Chinese hackers ... covering up their political purpose of building up a cyber army&quot;.

His new book, When a Billion Chinese Jump, is a travelogue that tells the story of China&apos;s breakneck development and its consequences, from melting glaciers in Xinjiang and cancer villages in Henan, to dam projects in Sichuan and skyscrapers in Shanghai.  Sam Geall: The urgency of China&apos;s environmental situation has struck many people in the past year or so, especially since the Copenhagen climate conference, but you have been writing this book for four years. How did you become convinced of the importance of this topic?  Jonathan Watts: The book grew and it changed. Because the country is so big and changing so fast, I found that this kind of road-trip reporting was a good way to capture that dynamism. And I found myself writing more and more environmental stories \u2013 whether it was a protest against a proposed factory development; a pollution spill into a river; Beijing&apos;s air quality ahead of the Olympics; or the loss of another species. The subject almost chose itself.  But if I had to choose one moment when it really hit me in the face \u2013 that the environment situation in China is a matter of global, species-wide concern \u2013 it would be the story of the [now-extinct] baiji dolphin. When I went out to report it, I didn&apos;t think it would be an epic story. It was only when I sat down and did the research and tried to put it in context, that I realised how incredibly significant the loss of something is after 20 million years \u2013 something that has been on the earth more than twice as long as humanity. That really hit me.  The situation is still changing. When I started the book four years ago, everyone was talking about pollution \u2013 also perhaps about climate change, political systems and how they influence governance. But I found myself shooting at a moving target: as I looked more into the story my priorities changed, and the story changed. It&apos;s about pollution, climate change and one-party governance, but it&apos;s even more about consumption and biodiversity and the long-term trend of human development. This is not just about China. In a sense, China is extraordinarily unfortunate to be hitting this stage of development at this time in human history. SG: The book points to some of the deeper dynamics at play in China&apos;s response to the environmental situation. One is the tension between the Daoist tradition, with its desire to find harmony, and Confucian philosophy, with its tendency to impose order on the natural world. How did you find this shaped China&apos;s response to this stage of development? JW: Looking for a solution to the predicament we are in, of living unsustainably, the importance of values comes up again and again. The focus in China is mainly on science and technology, on hardware \u2013 on things that if you drop them will hurt your toe. The importance of values hasn&apos;t really kicked in, but it&apos;s absolutely essential. Where do you get these values? Clearly western values haven&apos;t stopped the west from screwing up the environment. So, it&apos;s worth looking to China&apos;s philosophical and cultural roots.  One of the sub-themes of the book is an exploration of China&apos;s Daoist side. There have always been competing philosophies in China. It intrigued me that you can&apos;t really have a Daoist civilisation \u2013 it&apos;s almost an embrace and acceptance of the wild, of anarchy and chaos. Most of the time Confucianism has been the predominant philosophy, though there have been times that China is more Legalist. However, in Chinese history, you hear that some Mandarins were Confucians while working in their official positions, but when they went home they tended their gardens, or wrote poetry, and gave space to their Daoist sides. Maybe that&apos;s one of the secrets of Chinese civilisation and why it has lasted so long: that balance of the two sides.  I spoke to the popular philosopher Yu Dan, who has made her name writing about Confucian ideas \u2013 which is very much in line with Party orthodoxy at the moment. She told me that she is more of a Daoist, but that she doesn&apos;t think &quot;China is ready for Daoism yet&quot;. Certainly in the last 60 years, that Daoist side has faded. The trend has been to order things.  SG: One ecological example you give is the contrast between the traditional irrigation system at Dujiangyan and the large-scale hydro-engineering project at the Zipingpu Dam, both in Sichuan province.  JW: I was first in Dujiangyan around the time of the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, but it was only afterwards when I interviewed the environmental philosopher Tang Xiyang that I realised its significance. Tang is the one who says: &quot;If China is going to solve its problems, it needs more Daoism.&quot; He told me that if I wanted to see how that would work in practice, then I should look at Dujiangyan. It&apos;s an example of how things can be: they can last, they can endure \u2013 you can work with nature, rather than against it.  This is the long-term view. The other type of development is brittle. The hydrological engineering solutions are very impressive \u2013 when I saw the Three Gorges Dam I was amazed and knocked out by what humans can do \u2013 but they create new instabilities, which build up. And China has learned this painfully in its history: the events of 1958 come up in the book \u2013 that height of human hubris, the sense that you can overcome nature and impose your will on nature.  The Maoist view of nature hasn&apos;t gone completely. There are lots of questions being asked about it, but the mega-projects have a certain momentum. Even some of the projects I have seen completed in the last seven years are the fulfillment of Mao&apos;s dreams. The railway to Tibet, the south-to-north water diversion scheme, the Zipingpu Dam \u2013 these were all Maoist ideas. It&apos;s almost like Mao Zedong was the big dreamer, and now there is a government of implementers.  But I don&apos;t think that old vision of conquering nature is as strong as it once was. At the exhibition centre at the Three Gorges Dam, there are no pictures of the current leaders, premier Wen Jiabao and president Hu Jintao. The top leaders of the country did not attend the topping-off ceremony for the dam. This suggests to me that there are reservations about the wisdom of that project and concerns about where it is going.  SG: Do you think a new set of values is starting to take root?  JW: I see a search for new values \u2013 a real yearning for new values \u2013 and a sense that solving environmental problems needs to be part of any new set of values. I don&apos;t see a clearly defined new ethos, or even the reinvention of an old ethos, that completely gets to the heart of this. There are causes for optimism \u2013 the growth of green NGOs, the increased coverage of environmental issues in the media \u2013 but these do not represent the prevailing ideology.  However, China&apos;s history of the last 100 years is one of dramatic change, with some ideas catching on so quickly that it&apos;s almost terrifying. Whether it&apos;s the fervour of political revolution, or the fervour to make lots of money, the country has been able to make 180-degree turns. I have to hope that this might be the case with the environment.  SG: So, could China become the world&apos;s first green superpower?  I wanted to ask that question in this book. We are heading into a difficult 30 or 40 years for our species. We are over the limit already by just about every ecological measure. And yet our population is probably going to rise by another two billion in the next 40 years. We need to get through this rough period and over that 40-year hump: after that, populations should start to fall and there should be better technology and economic models too. But now, the country that is in the best position \u2013 and the worst position \u2013 is China.\u00a0 China is in the best position because its economy is growing so quickly that it does have a lot of resources. It&apos;s in the worst position because it&apos;s reached this supercharged phase of growth at a very unfortunate time in terms of the history of global development. China can&apos;t outsource its problems like other countries have been able to do. This is a country that has to reinvent itself.  The big contrast between China and the United States, particularly in renewable energy for instance, is that China is trapped by momentum, it has to keep moving forward. By contrast, the US is trapped by inertia \u2013 it&apos;s trying to protect what it already has. This is also why China is in a better position to become a green superpower.  SG: One intention of your book seems to be to introduce a note of scepticism amid much western optimism about China&apos;s ability to save the world economy.  JW: There is still a widespread assumption that one model has proven itself again and again over the past 200 years: the get-rich-first, clean-up-later model. But what worked for Britain in the nineteenth century, for the US in the twentieth century and for Japan and South Korea in the late twentieth century, may not work for China, because of scale and because of timing.  In a sense, Britain and China may prove to be bookends on this phase of development that will be seen as abnormal in the long-term scale of human development. Britain was one small country producing an awful lot of pollution and extracting and using resources unsustainably. At that point it didn&apos;t really have a great planetary impact, but then this moved to Europe, and to the US, and the number of countries that were unsustainable and producing too much got bigger and bigger. Meanwhile, the number of countries left to absorb the impacts gets smaller and smaller. Where does China dump its waste? How does China extract enough from the rest of the world to provide for its people? I believe this is where economic development hits an ecological wall.  The environment and the economy, which used to run pretty much in parallel, have become so detached from one another. The economists, the governments and the corporations all think the solution to the world&apos;s problems is more consumption in China, whereas the environmentalists are all saying: be careful what you wish for. If there is to be any solution, it is in the reattachment of economy and environment. China is moving in the right direction with its recently discussed ecological compensation scheme: this would require that economically rich parts of China, like Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou, pay the ecologically rich parts of China, like Yunnan, Heilongjiang and Guangxi, for &quot;environmental services&quot;. This means directly giving a value to forests because they absorb carbon, or wetlands because they absorb pollution.  This would mean that a laptop would become more expensive, but the price would be at a much more realistic level in terms of reflecting ecological limits and what things are really worth \u2013 which brings us back to the importance of values.

Throughout the day we&apos;ll update this page with stories, links and what&apos;s expected to happen in the hours ahead. Time permitting, we&apos;ll try to post below the line, answering your questions and comments. First and foremost: is there any way that Ferrari should escape further punishment for their team orders in the German GP? And just how good is Alberto Contador after his third success in the Tour de France? JD  8.55am: We&apos;re expecting a press conference for around midday BST today at Real Madrid, where Raul will bid farewell to the club after 18 years there. The forward, who joined the Spaniards aged 17 in 1994, has been linked with a move to Schalke. JD  9am: Here&apos;s an extract of Clive Everton&apos;s excellent piece on the late Alex Higgins, who tragically passed away aged 61 on Saturday:  Higgins loved the limelight so much that it seemed at times as if it was more important to him than winning. Maybe it was because of his taste for living on life&apos;s dangerous edge that he seldom beat a top player easily. Dancing too near the flame, he lost more close ones than perhaps he should have done. Invariably, he raised the emotional temperature of the arena. It was the battle, the action, the roar of the crowd in which he revelled whereas Steve Davis, for example, had the temperament to accumulate results whether before an audience of millions or the proverbial man and a dog.  He goes on:  Perhaps he would have won more titles if he had lived even a slightly more temperate life but full throttle, all out, death or glory, on and off the table was his style and snooker, for all his faults, is lucky to have had him.              9.15am: Here&apos;s video and audio of the Alonso-Massa team orders. The most ludicrous thing is surely the blatancy of Rob Smedley&apos;s message. JD  9.25am: Here&apos;s your Monday Rumour Mill. Could David Beckham and Michael Owen really be playing for the same team this season? And which World Cup star could soon be blazing penalties against the bar at White Hart Lane? KM  9.46am: Some early morning YouTube action for you, featuring what has to be one of the most audacious penalties ever. It&apos;s from Spain&apos;s win over Italy at the U19 European Championships. Spain midfielder Ezequiel Calvente runs up to seemingly hit the ball with his right foot \u2013 only to switch to his left. It&apos;s worth sticking with the video until they show the camera shot from behind the goal, it&apos;s the best angle to see it from. KM        10.10am: Some of your posts from below the line on all things Ferrari (and thanks to reader Ben Edwards for noticing that somehow it&apos;s actually a mirrored video of the events. Very random): TobytheTeacher &quot;For me it&apos;s not that Ferrari cheated, it&apos;s the way they cheated. There are plenty of more subtle ways to effect a race result: hold Massa in the pits for a couple more seconds, tell Massa he needs to switch to a fuel saving mode, etc. Ferrari don&apos;t seem to care or realise how negative the fans&apos; reaction to such simplistic cheating is. All the teams cheat, but Ferrari&apos;s cheating tends not to be in spirit of the sport. I understand why they cheated. I don&apos;t understand why they didn&apos;t cheat better.&quot; LondonEye &quot;What&apos;s blatant about saying, &apos;Alonso is faster&apos;? There is no proof of direct team orders. Massa knew the score and moved out of the way. The anger that people are showing is to do with old jealousies about Ferrari, usually from McLaren supporters who also think they have a divine right to rule F1.&quot; hardatwork &quot;Interesting to have the Tour de France finishing on the same day as the big Ferrari scandal. F1 has a rule against team orders, and Ferrari blatantly and arrogantly broke it. But as to the &apos;morality&apos; or otherwise of team orders, and whether or not they make the sport vacuous - one only has to look at cycling for a comparison. Of course the context is slightly different, with pacemaking having a genuine physical rationale in cycling. But team orders nonetheless, in that at the line you let through the main guy in your team if he&apos;s got the legs, even if you have too.&quot;  10.25am: News from the Chinese Super League, where a Qingdao supporter ran on to the pitch and karate-kicked the referee during his team&apos;s 2-0 loss to Shanghai Shenhua. According to Reuters, &quot;Yu Tao, the general manager of Qingdao, denied that the man, who was wearing branded shorts and trainers, was a club employee. &apos;The man was definitely not on the staff of our club. He was just an emotional fan,&apos; he told the Xinhua news agency. &apos;The referee failed to control the game well \u2013 perhaps he was too young.&apos; Around 100 Qingdao fans smashed up a car they believed belonged to the referee, Wang Zhe, after the match, Xinhua reported.&quot; JD       10.40am: &quot;What I find despicable is the fact that because Alonso is not the media-pleasing fresh-faced poster boy that Vettel, Button or everyone&apos;s favourite &apos;sportsman&apos; Lewis Hamilton, then all of the F1 experts (Save Andrew Benson and James Allen) will find any opportunity to lay into him,&quot; writes Matthew Fry. &quot;What I cannot fathom is whether these people and most of the writers on these sites really expect Ferrari to throw away the wdc just for a sentimental Massa victory when he&apos;s been nowhere all season and probably would have spun out under the pressure from Alonso if he hadn&apos;t already backed him into Vettel. Furthermore, Alonso has had a couple of very unfortunate races previously \u2013 if Hamilton had done this and please don&apos;t even try to suggests that he wouldn&apos;t, no one would be writing such nauseous self-righteous comments. Alonso is the most gifted and ruthless driver of his generation. Just as Senna was.&quot;  10.55am: A couple of brief football transfer lines: Celtic have confirmed the signing of Mexico international Efrain Juarez, who joins the club on a four-year deal. And as mentioned below the line, West Brom are interested in making Eric Djemba-Djemba a Premier League player once again. Odense coach Lars Olsen cryptically said: &quot;Eric will not be involved [in the squad due to face Randers] because we have allowed him to travel abroad. It is for personal reasons which we cannot say more about.&quot; JD  11.10am: We&apos;re not expecting further statements from the FIA regarding Ferrari today, but we will have Oliver Owen blogging on the matter later this afternoon. In the meantime, here are our updated interactive driver rankings following the German GP. In other news, Rugby World Cup-winning former England wing Jason Robinson has come out of retirement to play for National League side Fylde, who recently appointed Brian Ashton as coaching consultant. Ashton said: &quot;It is a remarkably fortunate coincidence for me to be returning to help out my old club Fylde as Jason arrives to play. I have had the privilege of working with Jason and know that his stature, ability and qualities as a player and a person will benefit all who come into contact with him, both on and off the field.&quot; JD  11.25am: McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh has been speaking to autosport.com about yesterday&apos;s German GP, but intends to speak with Ferrari about their team orders, rather than criticise them in the press. He said:  &quot;I don&apos;t want to get drawn into it. I have my own private views on it. They were quicker than us today; they got a 1-2, but perhaps in a different order from that which people may have thought was right. I will give my private views to Ferrari, but I don&apos;t want to go on record and express those views. &quot;You can go back to the late 90s and all sorts of times when things have happened - but we decide to race. I think having our drivers racing, in the longer term, is a healthy thing to do for this team. That is my decision and that is what we want to do. Others do what they want to do, and it is for the FIA and Ferrari to determine what they think is right. We were racing our two guys until the end of the race.&quot;  JD  11.40am: Argentina coach Diego Maradona has confirmed that he is keen to sign a new contract \u2013 so long as he is allowed to retain his entire backroom staff by AFA president, Julio Grondona. Speaking on America TV&apos;s El Show del Futbol last night, Maradona said:  &quot;I really want to stay, but it depends on Grondona. If they touch a hair of one of my guys, even if it&apos;s the masseur or the kitman, I&apos;m going. I want to continue the adventure but not with [just] anyone. I chose these people. I want to continue working with them.&quot;  JD  12.05pm: We will have a Richard Williams Tour de France round-up blog coming your way soon, but in the meantime, some views of my own: \u2022 Le Tour shouldn&apos;t end in anti-climax. It should always be like in &apos;89. \u2022 Despite Andy Schleck&apos;s improvement on general classification (in terms of time deficit to Alberto Contador), there was still always a feeling that Contador was riding within himself. That&apos;s not to say that had Frank Schleck been around on the Port de Bal\u00e8s, Andy may well have been able to ride back up to Contador before the finish post-chain malaise. \u2022 Nicolas Roche had an outstanding Tour to finish in the top 15, Bradley Wiggins&apos;s was a Tour to forget, or at least learn some serious lessons from. JD  12.20pm: Our Talking Horses blog is up with the day&apos;s best bets, latest news and day one of our latest tipping competition. A \u00a325 free bet is up for grabs, you lucky, lucky people. JD  12.39pm: Javier Mascherano reported back for pre-season training at Melwood this morning \u2013 but it&apos;s still no clearer whether he&apos;ll be staying at Liverpool. Meanwhile Roy Hodgson has admitted that he has no idea who to play in Thursday&apos;s Europa League qualifier against Rabotnicki. Hodgson has been warned by the club&apos;s medical staff against including those who featured at the World Cup \u2013 a plea the manager says he may ignore:  &quot;I don&apos;t know what to do at this stage. I will have to liaise with them and [head of sports science] Peter Brukner and make a decision by Tuesday on what sort of team I can put out. &quot;I can promise the Liverpool fans we will put out the best possible team, without compromising the future. It is going to be a difficult discussion between myself and Peter because his feeling is we shouldn&apos;t use any of them and I am going to be tempted to say I want to use quite a few of them.&quot;  KM  12.58pm: Gazzetta dello Sport has claimed that Mario Balotelli held a &quot;leaving party&quot; in Milan at the weekend, as he moves closer to a move to Manchester City. It comes as Sky Sport Italia reports that City have agreed a fee with Inter of around \u00a324m. There&apos;s no confirmation from either club, but Roberto Mancini has suggested to La Stampa a deal could still be some way off. &quot;Mario has two qualities that suit us, his talent and his age, because I want people able to build a cycle at Manchester City,&quot; said the City boss. &quot;But we come back to the problem of the valuation, which must be resolved. I think in about 10 days certain situations will be clearer.&quot; KM  1.15pm: Richard Williams&apos;s Tour de France blog has just gone live. Here&apos;s an extract:  After all the smiles and handshakes, it was surprising that Alberto Contador and Andy Schleck didn&apos;t blow kisses to each other as they stood on the podium in Paris yesterday evening. We can only hope that beneath their avowals of respect and friendship lurk the elements of a true Tour de France rivalry: simmering resentment and something close to hatred. Since their battle over the three weeks of the 2010 Tour concluded with a repeat of the previous year&apos;s result, and it seems more than likely that there will be more to come next year, there needs to be something more than sun-kissed displays of magnanimous sporting behaviour if this historic race is to maintain its vibrancy.   1.30pm: The first day of the second Test between Sri Lanka and India has reached stumps, with the hosts 312 for two in Colombo. Kumar Sangakkara is unbeaten on 130 and Tharanga Paranavitana hit 100 to leave India in trouble. JD      Raul. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    1.45pm: Raul has been speaking at his departure from Real Madrid. Speaking at a press conference this lunchtime, he said:  &quot;It&apos;s a hard day for me. I feel like a footballer still and I will keep on playing, but I will always be loyal to Real Madrid. I have tried to give everything in my time here. A new period starts today. I have been happy at Real Madrid and I will always be willing to help the club in whatever it needs.&quot;  Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez paid tribute to the forward:  &quot;We will never forget Raul. There are many men who form part of the legend of Real Madrid, but few that are chosen to embody the club - Raul is one of those.&quot;  JD  2pm: As promised, Oliver Owen&apos;s blog on the Ferraris has arrived, in which he poses the following:  If we get to Abu Dhabi in November with Lewis Hamilton needing a second-place finish to clinch the world championship but running third while Jenson Button \u2013 out of title contention in this hypothetical scenario \u2013 leads, what do you think Martin Whitmarsh will do on the McLaren pit wall? What would you do?  JD      Paul, before he became all big time. Photograph: Volker Hartmann/AP    2.15pm: Look which psychic octopus is set to become a celluloid cephalopod. According to our film department:  The film, a co-production between China Film Group Corporation and Beijing Filmblog Media Company, was shot over the past few weeks in South Africa using a body double, owing to the indisposition of the real Paul, who has gone into retirement. Release is scheduled for August. According to Sky News, the film&apos;s makers have focused on Paul&apos;s remarkable winning streak and explore &quot;how the octopus acquires the ability and discuss his possible fates&quot;.  JD  2.30pm: More quotes from Raul, who hasn&apos;t confirmed that he&apos;s off to Schalke just yet and suggested that a move to the Premier League could yet be on the cards. He said:  &quot;The German team is interested in me and I have had very deep discussions with them. In a few days I will know whether I&apos;ll be going to the Bundesliga, but there are other teams that are also interested. What is clear is that my future lies in Germany or England.&quot;  Any views as to which Premier League club would be the best fit for him? JD  2.50pm: UK Sport and Sport England, the two bodies that distribute National Lottery money to sport, are to be merged. The culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, today announced the move as one of a number of mergers and abolitions of public bodies, saying that merging UK Sport and Sport England would &quot;create a more effective structure to deliver elite sport success and a wider sports legacy from the 2012 Games&quot;. JD  3.05pm: There will probably be a fair few votes in the following poll: should Ferrari be banned for their Hockenheim team orders? JD  3.23pm: Jenson Button didn&apos;t give too much away in the paddock after yesterday&apos;s race, but he&apos;s offered some fairly strong views on Ferrari&apos;s team orders today. Talking to PA Sport, he said:  &quot;Personally I think team orders in Formula One are wrong, in any motor sport category, although sometimes they are inevitable. We all want to win, and I know that every team wants to win, both the constructors&apos; and drivers&apos; championships. But they have to give both their drivers the same opportunity to do so. This was very early in the season. How early is it going to start in the future?&quot;  KM  3.40pm: If you&apos;re suffering from a mid-afternoon work lull, here are a couple of things to keep you entertained: an extra-early edition of today&apos;s Fiver and the YouTube video of quite possibly the greatest break Alex Higgins ever made \u2013 the 69 against Jimmy White in the semi-final of the 1982 world championship. KM  4.02pm: Aston Villa have held what they call &quot;amicable&quot; talks with James Milner and his agent today. The midfielder&apos;s future at the club remains uncertain, but he will travel with the rest of the squad to Portugal on Wednesday. Here&apos;s Villa&apos;s (rather brief) statement:  &quot;James Milner trained with the rest of the Villa squad today at Bodymoor Heath. He and the manager, along with chief executive Paul Faulkner and the player&apos;s representative, Matthew Buck, had an amicable conversation and, while James will not play in tomorrow&apos;s game at Walsall, he will fly with the squad to Portugal on Wednesday ahead of the Guadiana Cup in which Villa will compete with Benfica and Feyenoord this weekend.&quot;  It&apos;s believed Villa still haven&apos;t received an improved offer of \u00a324m from Manchester City. KM  4.28pm: Another City transfer update, this time concerning Mario Balotelli. The striker&apos;s agent has confirmed that talk of a deal already being struck is premature. &quot;Balotelli hasn&apos;t signed anything,&quot; said Mino Raiola, &quot;and I doubt that anything will be agreed in the next few days.&quot; KM  4.50pm: While the majority of you think Ferrari should be banned, the poll&apos;s perhaps a bit closer than expected. So far it&apos;s 67% in favour of a suspension, 33% against. KM  5.05pm: Right, that&apos;s about yer lot for today. It&apos;s a pretty quiet evening on the sport front, but you can follow the Friends Provident t20 quarter-finals with our live scoreboard and Twitter updates.

Yet the crest on their jersey features three gold stars. The third one, then, is an aspirational adornment, like the moustaches that scrawny 14-year-old boys grow to show they want to be men, or the souped-up Ford Capri that the Fiver drives to show that we fully intend to get our licence and insurance any day now, officer, otherwise why would we be driving? Duhhhh. City want their third title pronto. And they seem to be going about getting it in a canny way: by buying every player in the world. Manager Roberto Mancini has already spent \u00a378m this summer and is still jabbering about further acquisitions, which may involve sploshing \u00a325m on James Milner and \u00a370m on advanced research into fatal diseases, thereby disproving the notion that the club owners, who hold an enormous chunk of the world&apos;s wealth by fluke of birth, are not hollow bozos who care only about bling and \u2026 sorry, that was a misprint: the \u00a370m has been earmarked for Fernando Torres. &quot;Torres is one of the best strikers in Europe and has already been playing the Premier League for three years,&quot; gushed Mancini, whose challenge for a Big Cup spot was last season undermined by him having a mere seven senior strikers from which to cobble together an attack. No wonder even Torres won&apos;t be enough \u2013 City are also eyeing Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko and Inter&apos;s Mario Balotelli. &quot;There are two or three strikers that we could go for, but it is the same situation as with James Milner,&quot; revealed Mancini, perhaps hinting that the deal will only be done if the selling club agrees to accept an absurdly extravagant bid. &quot;First it is the price, then it depends on if the players want to change team,&quot; explained Mancini, who may well be able to field an entirely different 11 for every match of the season if he manages to add all his targets to City&apos;s extant multitude. Except, of course, he won&apos;t. Because new Premier League rules stipulate that clubs may only register 25 players for the first half of the season, including eight who were grown at home. City have 37 and counting. So either they&apos;re going to turn the likes of Joleon Lescott, Wayne Bridge, Jo, Felipe Caicedo, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Stephen Ireland into the planet&apos;s highest-paid stewards or they&apos;re going to find clubs that will take that lot off their hands. There will be no shortage of suitors because some of those players have plenty to offer \u2013 but they also have sumptuous contracts. City are likely to be paying at least part of their wages for many years to come, regardless of who they play for. All of which, of course, enhances the chances of a City employee lifting the Premier League trophy next season. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;The man was definitely not on the staff of our club. He was just an emotional fan. The referee failed to control the game well \u2013 perhaps he was too young&quot; - Yu Tao, general manager of Chinese Super League outfit Qingdao, denies that a fan who ran on to the pitch and karate-kicked the referee during the defeat to Shanghai Shenhua was a club official, despite sporting branded shorts and trainers, as well as offering up a neat line in blame repositioning. THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE UNSCHEDULED 42-HOUR STOPOVER BP might be suffering from bad PR at the moment, but if news of Portsmouth&apos;s pre-season tour of North America is anything to go by, woes prompted by photos of disconsolate and dead-looking sludge-soaked brown pelicans could soon be eclipsed by those of another well-known oil retailer. Pompey&apos;s website proudly informs visitors that their away travel is &quot;fuelled by Texaco&quot;, who everyone who is anyone in the petroleum industry is aware, are the official motor fuel partner of the npower Championship. Whether Texaco&apos;s remit stretches to fuelling Portsmouth&apos;s travels beyond the Championship&apos;s boundaries remains unknown. If it doesn&apos;t, their public relations wing could do worse than rattle off a short press release completely disassociating themselves from an expedition so beset by misfortune it makes Shackleton&apos;s Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition seem like a fun-filled weekend jolly for the lads. Relegated, potless and still very much in administration, the very fact that Portsmouth&apos;s budget stretched to a pre-season tour of anywhere more exotic than the Winchester bypass is surprising. But led by new manager Steve Cotterill, the club&apos;s two-week trip to USA! USA!! USA!!! and Canada concluded yesterday when a team comprised of trialists, youth-team players and a clatter of their few remaining registered first-team players were whipped 4-0 by DC United. It was the high point of the kind of bad trip that gives LSD a bad name, if only because it marked its end. Luckless Pompey&apos;s problems began a fortnight ago when a cancelled connecting flight meant a journey to San Diego ended up taking 42 hours. Travelling on to Canada, two players had to be sent home with knack, including suspected leg-snap for goalkeeper Jon Stewart, who as it turned out, was one of the lucky ones. The remaining players and backroom staff found themselves stranded in Chicago when a storm grounded their flight from Edmonton to Washington, which meant the players arrived for Saturday&apos;s match with DC United having had just four hours&apos; sleep and lost 14 items of luggage, including their kit. The final indignity? Having to wear the away strip of their hosts as they had their backsides handed to them by Major League Soccerball opponents in a bad-tempered &apos;friendly&apos; played in temperatures so sweltering the referee very considerately sent three players, including Hayden Mullins, off to cool down. &quot;The one thing about this result is that it&apos;s shown the position we&apos;re in. It&apos;s painful,&quot; said Cotterill who, to be fair, probably hadn&apos;t envisaged a future in which glitter and candyfloss featured prominently when he agreed to take the job. &quot;We&apos;ve got some good honest senior lads here and some youngsters who are trying their hardest. The kids have got to be at full tilt to be anywhere near the team and we&apos;re going to be playing in a man&apos;s league in a couple of weeks&apos; time.&quot; In poker, a player on &apos;full tilt&apos; plays with wreckless and ill-advised abandon after suffering bad setbacks. While this may well be the reaction Cotterill gets from his younger players, the Fiver suspects it&apos;s not quite the definition of the term he had in mind. \u00a366 HAT-TRICK OF FREE BETS WITH BLUE SQUARE Click here to find out more. FIVER LETTERS &quot;As a native of the &apos;notoriously rough Dublin village&apos; of Tallaght, I take offence at Friday&apos;s Quote of the Day and suggest you get your facts straight about what is now practically a city in south Dublin. As a Guardian reader of 10 years or so, I am not one who takes offence easily or writes in outrage to complain but when I see snide comments like this in Irish and UK media it is a bit galling when one considers just how far Tallaght has come from a deprived suburb to near city status. The village itself is virtually unrecognisable from its humble beginnings. Yes crime has been an issue in the past, and most recently seen in violence outside\u00a0Shamrock Rovers&apos; stadium, but show me a city anywhere in the UK where this does not happen.\u00a0I could easily make derogatory remarks about Manchester or London, but I don&apos;t. Not once in 22 years of living in Tallaght did I experience or witness a serious crime against me or any neighbour&quot; - Rebecca Newman. &quot;Re: the Fiver describing unaccomplished Guardian sub Josh Widdicombe&apos;s freestyle quiz as being not funny (Friday&apos;s Still Want More?).

BITS AND BOBS Albert Riera has revealed he left Premier League also-rans Liverpool in order to win trophies with Greek giants Olympiakos. &quot;During the last two years at Liverpool I didn&apos;t win any titles, so that&apos;s why I took the decision to come to Olympiakos,&quot; he crowed. Twenty-six-year-old former Millwall and Bradford striker Gavin Grant has been jailed for 25 years for the murder of Leon Labastide, who was shot dead outside his parents&apos; London home in 2004. DI Steve Horsley said: &quot;Grant thought he had got away with murder. He carried on his footballing career while, all along, he had blood on his hands.&quot;  The return leg of Shamrock Rovers&apos; upcoming Big Vase qualifier against Juventus will be moved to Modena because fellow Dublin outfit U2 are playing at Turin&apos;s Stadio Olimpico on the same night. After spending 86 years at Real Madrid, Raul has finally left the club. Where is he going? Nobody knows. Diego Maradona wants to remain as Argentina manager but only if he&apos;s allowed to keep his entire backroom staff. &quot;If they touch a hair of one of my guys, even if it&apos;s the masseur or the kitman, I&apos;m going,&quot; he declared of his hirsute and proud of it team. Good news for trendy Glasgow-based cantina Bibi&apos;s: the city&apos;s Mexican population has been swelled by one with the news that Mexico striker Efra\u00edn Ju\u00e1rez has joined the Queen&apos;s Celtic on a four-year deal. Even better news for Amsterdam eateries, big-boned Egypt striker Mido is set to join Ajax. And Gus Poyet has praised his Brighton and Hove Albion players&apos; &quot;togetherness&quot; after they displayed their solidarity against Portuguese side Portimonense in a friendly that had to be called off in the 68th minute. &quot;It is difficult to draw positives when the match almost ended with a fight, but everyone reacted very well together,&quot; said Poyet clutching at some nearby straws. STILL WANT MORE? If you don&apos;t know what former Real Madrid player Guti did on 14 September 2008, then it&apos;s probably not worth you having a go at today&apos;s quiz. Look which psychic octopus is set to become a celluloid cephalopod. This season&apos;s Premier League shirts: retro chic or walking billboards?

When retirement comes, the waters of academia swallow them up so that they become barely a footnote on a conference paper. And then there are men like Paul Romer. Romer is bulge-bracket academia, a departure-lounge economist: the kind of intellectual as likely to be found turning left on a plane as in seminar rooms. Forever mentioned as a future Nobel prizewinner, this Californian is a world expert on how and why economies grow. When Gordon Brown made that infamous speech about post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory, it wasn&apos;t Balls \u2013 as Heseltine jibed \u2013 but Romer he was quoting. He&apos;s one of Time&apos;s &quot;25 most influential Americans&quot; (true, Time was the magazine that ran a joint profile of Cyndi Lauper and Madonna in 1985, and firmly declared that Cyndi was the bigger star, but that neither came &quot;within a mile of Tina Turner&apos;s splendid album of racked soul, Private Dancer&quot;, but accolades such as these are still to be taken with due gravity of expression) . And then there are the adoring journalistic profiles, one of which began with the reporter turning up cap in hand to meet the academic lounging &quot;poolside at his house, which overlooks a huge expanse of rolling ranchland&quot;. That, it perhaps won&apos;t surprise you to learn, was the hardest-hitting moment. So Romer is a brilliant economist, and he has a new and big idea. And because he is The Great Romer, he gets to present this wheeze to national leaders, high-profile conferences and invitation-only gatherings of policy-makers. And because he has some spare cash (views over rolling ranchland don&apos;t come cheap, you know), Romer can afford to jack in his formal position at Stanford and start up his own think tank to make his case. Trouble is, the idea stinks. With little track record in dealing with poor countries, Romer has come up a grand scheme for lifting Africa and Asia out of poverty. What they need to do, he argues, is give up a big chunk of their land to a rich country. Policy experts from Washington can take over a patch of Rwanda, and invite along GM and Microsoft and Gap to come and set up factories. Poor countries give up their sovereignty in return for the promise of greater prosperity. His big example is Hong Kong. At the end of the first opium war in 1842, the Chinese were marched on board a British warship anchored off Nanjing and forced to sign Hong Kong away to Queen Victoria. Over the next 150 years, the little island turned into Asia&apos;s number one capitalist success story. It was an example that Deng Xiaoping ended up copying on the mainland, in coastal provinces such as Guangdong \u2013 to explosive economic effect. China&apos;s loss of Hong Kong should not be seen as a national humiliation or great international injustice, Romer has written, but &quot;an intervention&quot; which has &quot;done more to reduce world poverty than all the world&apos;s official aid programmes of the 20th century combined \u2014 and at a fraction of the cost&quot;. What the world needs, the economist argues, is not one but 100 Hong Kongs. You think this is colonialism? For Romer, that &quot;kind of emotion . . . can get in the way&quot; (see what he did there? You have emotions; the elite economist has evidence). Sure, the poor people living and working in these new charter cities wouldn&apos;t necessarily have any democratic privileges such as the right to vote, but they could vote with their feet. And in the meantime, the Africans or the Asians would get the undoubted benefit of all this huge western expertise. Romer&apos;s right, in a way. This idea isn&apos;t prompted by dreams of a new imperialism \u2013 because this California economist doesn&apos;t know enough imperial history. If he did, he&apos;d realise that the English Whig Thomas Macaulay said it all before, when he said of India in 1833: &quot;It is scarcely possible to calculate the benefits which we might derive from the diffusion of European civilisation among the vast population of the East . . . To trade with civilised men is infinitely more profitable than to govern savages.&quot; That was a view of the Empire as the white man&apos;s burden: then it came with Orientalists, now it is accompanied by corporate logos. In both cases it comes with great lashes of condescension and a lack of knowledge about the countries one is imposing on. With a bit more history, Romer might acknowledge that mainland China had other areas that were so dominated by foreigners they too might be described as Charter Cities. Shanghai in the early 20th century had signs reading: No Dogs, No Chinese \u2013 and yet it didn&apos;t boom like Hong Kong did. He might also agree that there remains a big debate about how China has got so rich, with World Bank economists recently arguing that it is farming that has done most to reduce poverty, rather than industry. One result of the great economic crisis is that academic practitioners are finally acknowledging that economic policy is not just a series of equations applied to the real world, but questions that ultimately have a political answer. Yet the old pseudo- scientific blank slate-ism still survives, as Paul Romer&apos;s latest project demonstrates.", "tags": ["Psychology", "Science", "Economic policy"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-27T06:00:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jul/28/today-in-sport-28-july", "sentences": ["The former world champion is getting married this weekend and is then due to play in qualifying for the Shanghai Masters.", "Here&apos;s the statement, which surely must be influenced by the recent match-fixing allegations to have hit snooker:   I would like to make it known that I consider that I will not be in a position to play to the best of my ability in my Roewe Shanghai Masters qualifying match in Sheffield next week."], "title": "Today in Sport - as it happened | Tom Lutz and Katy Murrells", "article": " 9.38am: Good morning and welcome to our daily sports news blog. Throughout the day we&apos;ll update this page with stories, links and what&apos;s expected to happen in the hours ahead. Time permitting, we&apos;ll try to post below the line, answering your questions and comments. But for starters, feel free to post your thoughts on the morning&apos;s main talking points: Fernando Torres&apos;s decision to stay at Anfield (for now), Diego Maradona&apos;s departure as Argentina manager, Britain&apos;s one-two in Barcelona and Andy Murray&apos;s decision to split with coach Miles Maclagan. KM  9.45am: Some interesting transfer news coming in: West Ham have confirmed they&apos;ve rejected a bid from Tottenham for Scott Parker. This is the (fairly lengthy) statement on their website:  The club would like to state that regardless of the size of the bid, nothing will break the promise that chairman David Sullivan made to our supporters. As repeatedly stated, Scott Parker is not for sale and there are no circumstances and no amount of money that will cause us to break that pledge to the fans. The club informed Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy prior to him making the offer that we would not welcome any approach to unsettle the player. Scott Parker has three years left on his contract and the club has opened talks with his agent over a new five-year deal. David Sullivan said: &quot;I made a promise that I would not sell Scott and I will not, for any amount of money, break that promise to the West Ham supporters. Scott is not for sale at any price, to anyone. West Ham supporters, for far too long, have had owners that sell their best players and promise one thing and do another.  This is a new era. We are building a bigger, better West Ham and when we make a promise, we honour it.&quot;  KM  9.57am: Another blow for &apos;Arry and Spurs: Ra\u00fal has opted for a move to the Bundesliga instead of England. Schalke have confirmed the former Real Madrid forward has agreed a two-year deal to join them \u2013 subject to a medical today. KM  10.12am: I thoroughly enjoyed the 10,000m at the European Athletics Championships last night, although I may have turned over for three minutes to watch Piers Morgan boasting about how he&apos;s made it in Hollywood. What did you think of Mo Farah&apos;s decision to encourage Ayad Lamdassem to overtake him as the race reached its conclusion. Was it a canny psychological ploy or a needless piece of showboating? I&apos;d go with the former, Lamdassem fell for the bait and Farah went on to power past him. TL  10.39am: A quick update on what&apos;s coming up today:  \u2022 Football-wise, we&apos;ll have a blog on Diego Maradona up later. Roy Hodgson&apos;s giving a press conference at 5pm ahead of Liverpool&apos;s Europa League qualifier tomorrow, while tonight Celtic are in Champions League qualifying action against Braga.  And if you haven&apos;t found it already, here&apos;s this week&apos;s Knowledge, featuring players who have won with their country but not with their clubs. \u2022 The European Athletics Championships continue. From a British perspective, the pick of the action should be Dwain Chambers in the 100m final at 8.45pm. The semis take place at 6.50pm. \u2022 We&apos;ll be keeping an eye on the England v Pakistan build-up, with both teams giving holding conferences at Trent Bridge. \u2022 And there&apos;s a Felipe Massa presser too, ahead of the Hungarian GP, the scene of his serious crash last year. No doubt he&apos;ll also be asked about last weekend&apos;s events in Germany too. KM  10.47am: Newcastle have confirmed the signing of Sol Campbell on a one-year deal. We&apos;ll have more on the site shortly. KM            11.05am: Just in case you have a hankering for non-fatal lorry crash videos. I always find these near-death videos a little creepy. Mainly because of the fact that if there are loads of these videos of people narrowly escaping death, there are loads more of people not escaping death. TL  11.08am: Tim Bresnan has been called into the England squad for the first Test against Pakistan. Ajmal Shahzad has been ruled out due to an ankle injury. TL  11.18am: A couple of lines coming out of Arsenal: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has confirmed that Nicklas Bendtner will miss the start of the season because of his groin injury, while Wenger&apos;s also had a few words to say about the Cesc F\u00e1bregas saga. &quot;He is a very important player for us, he is our captain and we have worked very hard [for him] to be the future of our team and that is why we are always adamant about [not] letting him go,&quot; he said. &quot;It is only noise. In our job we have to deal with what we can master. What we cannot influence is not to worry about.&quot;  Meanwhile, Ra\u00fal&apos;s move to Schalke is now a done deal. There&apos;s more here. KM  11.58am: Spain&apos;s Under-19s weren&apos;t the only ones involved in a bit of set-piece trickery yesterday. Here&apos;s Danilo Rios scoring an almost identical goal for Duque de Caxias in Brazil&apos;s second division last night. KM  12.33pm: For the racing fans among you here&apos;s today&apos;s Talking Horses, featuring our tips for day two of Glorious Goodwood and, as usual, the chance to win a \u00a325 bet. KM  12.57pm: There&apos;s nothing like honesty. Peter Ebdon has today released a statement \u2013 to play down his chances of winning a match. The former world champion is getting married this weekend and is then due to play in qualifying for the Shanghai Masters. Here&apos;s the statement, which surely must be influenced by the recent match-fixing allegations to have hit snooker:   I would like to make it known that I consider that I will not be in a position to play to the best of my ability in my Roewe Shanghai Masters qualifying match in Sheffield next week. This is down to personal circumstances, including the fact that I am getting re-married in Hungary this weekend. Since playing in a recent tournament in Thailand I have not been able to practise, and by the time the qualifiers come around I will not have played for 10 days or more. I know just how bad I can be when I don&apos;t feel properly prepared as I am the type of player who needs to practise hard in order to play to a reasonable standard. As always, I will be doing my utmost to win what is a very important match for me but in truth, my levels of expectation will not be very high.&quot;  KM  1.24pm: Birmingham City&apos;s new signing, Nikola Zigic, has been looking forward to the new season. In terms, of rallying cries it&apos;s not the best we&apos;ve ever heard. &quot;La Liga is quite physical too. It may not be as fast as the Premier League but I will certainly do my best to adapt. I&apos;m pretty sure I will be able to do that. I do have to adapt a bit physically but I am working very hard on that in training to step up the pace.&quot; On paper, he looks like a decent signing but I was underwhelmed by his performances at the World Cup. TL  1.34pm: Bad news for fans of central Asian wheel-based sports: Tour de France champion Alberto Contador will leave Astana at the end of this season. Rumour has it he may join a new team founded by Fernando Alonso, who&apos;s no stranger to team orders etc and so forth. TL  1.57pm: Darren Clarke&apos;s hopes of playing his way back into the Ryder Cup team, and forcing captain Colin Montgomerie into finding another assistant, have received a huge boost as he has been invited to take part in the US PGA Championship for the second year running. He&apos;s been a solid performer down the years against the US but has he got the form this year to make him a competitive selection? TL  2.35pm: Sachin Tendulkar&apos;s doing his best to salvage something from the second Test in Colombo. He&apos;s finished day three unbeaten on 108, with India closing on 382-4 in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s first innings of 642-4 declared. Debutant Suresh Raina was 66 not out. And here&apos;s a gallery of yesterday&apos;s action at the European Championships. Better late than never, eh? KM  2.53pm: We&apos;ve got a nice blog post on how the Guardian has archived its World Cup content down the years, especially interesting for those who lean towards a spot of tech.  3.30pm: Joe Cole won&apos;t make his Liverpool debut in tomorrow&apos;s Europa League trip to Rabotnicki after Roy Hodgson decided to rest most of his World Cup players for the qualifier. Cole, Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Glen Johnson didn&apos;t travel with the rest of the squad to Macedonia this morning, while Pepe Reina, Fernando Torres, Dirk Kuyt and Ryan Babel are still on holiday. Lucas, Alberto Aquilani, Daniel Agger, Martin Skrtel and Sotirios Kyrgiakos did get on the plane though, along with new signings Milan Jovanovic and Danny Wilson. KM  3.40pm: Canford Cliffs has won the big race of the day at Goodwood, the Sussex Stakes, running down last year&apos;s winner Rip Van Winkle. There&apos;s more from our racing team in Talking Horses. KM  4.06pm: After the &quot;he&apos;s not for sale&quot; talk from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and David Sullivan earlier, it&apos;s now Chelsea&apos;s turn to get in on the act. Responding to the rumours linking Didier Drogba with Manchester City, Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said: &quot;Didier will be a Chelsea player next year. Didier is under contract. The thing about this time of year is we always get [this]. For our players to be in the news \u2013 it&apos;s normal. But Didier Drogba will be a Chelsea player next year.&quot; KM  4.28pm: Still want more on today&apos;s no-one&apos;s-actually-going-anywhere transfer stories? Then here&apos;s another 500 words or so for your reading pleasure, courtesy of the Fiver.  4.55pm: That&apos;s about it for the day blog-wise. Here&apos;s our live scoreboard if you want to follow Celtic&apos;s Champions League qualifier later, while we&apos;ll also be keeping an eye on Chambers v Lemaitre at the European Championships. Here&apos;s what&apos;s happened so far today in Barcelona, including an impressive start for British gold medal hope Dai Greene in the 400m hurdles.

And cool. Famous and cool. Fame alone isn&apos;t much worth striving for \u2013 after all, Josef Fritzl is famous and he&apos;s nobody&apos;s role model. No, everybody wants to be a celebrity. That&apos;s not much of an ambition either, frankly. Until you get there, you&apos;re miserable. Once you get there you discover (I&apos;m guessing, obviously) that it often involves doing things you don&apos;t actually want to do, like pretending to be happy about meeting Jeremy Clarkson, and that makes you miserable too. It&apos;s not just people who strive to achieve the heady mix of recognition and acclaim that celebrities enjoy. Every sport that isn&apos;t football, and for that matter every football league that isn&apos;t the Premier League, wants it too. They want to be talked about. They want to be popular. They want to be cool. Snooker is not cool. Sure, the best players achieve a certain level of fame, but they never enjoy the breakout success of the truly trendy. You know you&apos;ve hit the big time when you see somebody else wearing what appears to be your own hair, but where the Beatle, the Beckham and the Rachel from Friends led the way, the Ray Reardon strangely failed to follow. Nike never asked Cliff Thorburn to put his name to a range of swoosh-branded patent leather footwear. And then there&apos;s the clothes. A fashion-conscious youth who sees a man sporting a dress shirt, waistcoat and bow tie is considerably less likely to praise his dress sense than to steal his mobile phone. No, there&apos;s no getting away from it, snooker is not cool. But it&apos;s trying. Last week Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan launched &quot;the future of snooker&quot; \u2013 a half-hour, condensed version of the game which television viewers should find very much like watching highlights of the old version of snooker, without anyone having been required to edit out seven hours of rubbish. This is a promising first step. What the sport really needs, though, is a true star, someone to drag it into the spotlight by embodying the ultimate celebrity package of astonishing skill, swaggering sex appeal and, ideally, a surprising post-retirement talent for ballroom dancing. And while it waits for that person, it&apos;s got Peter Ebdon. Ebdon is an unlikely hero. He&apos;s nearly 40, lives in Budapest, once had a ponytail and has a fianc\u00e9e called Nora. His focus on the game is so absolute that he is widely considered, by his own admission, &quot;a horrible so-and-so&quot;. Sure, a musical side-project launched following a successful singing engagement at a friend&apos;s daughter&apos;s wedding has so far seen him release a couple of singles, but there is absolutely no street credibility to be gained from covering David Cassidy&apos;s 1973 No3 hit I&apos;m a Clown (strangely absent from the internet, but here&apos;s his self-penned follow-up, Fall of Paradise). Outside snooker and long-forgotten 70s balladry, the 2002 world champion&apos;s interests seem no more likely to engage the public. In an interview earlier this year, for example, Ebdon broached one such subject. &quot;I&apos;ve had Lexus, Mercedes, Honda, top-of-the-range motors,&quot; he said, &quot;and by far, the Skoda had the best windscreen-wipers of them all.&quot; The interview was not with Heat magazine. A few days ago Ebdon announced that when he gets to next week&apos;s Shanghai Masters qualifying event in Sheffield he will play really badly. &quot;By the time the qualifiers come around I will not have played for 10 days or more,&quot; he said. &quot;I know just how bad I can be when I don&apos;t feel properly prepared. As always, I will be doing my utmost to win what is a very important match for me but in truth, my levels of expectation will not be very high.&quot; He&apos;s got a decent excuse for not practising: this weekend in Hungary Nora will become the second Mrs Ebdon. Had he not told anyone, arrived in Sheffield among the favourites and lost, he could have been in trouble. The bookmakers could have become suspicious. The Gambling Commission might have got involved. (Both of which happened when he unexpectedly went down 5-0 to Liang Wenbo in 2008, though no wrongdoing was discovered.) The announcement was refreshingly honest, showing a willingness to break bad news in full and in advance that was so lacking from, say, the recent election campaign. This is a man to trust, a man of integrity and honour. Just the man, perhaps, to take snooker global. But now he&apos;s in a pickle. Having told everyone he&apos;s going to lose, he has to go through with it. What if he turns up in Sheffield, no pressure on his shoulders, elated after his nuptials, and produces the form of his life? The bookmakers could become suspicious. The Gambling Commission might get involved. Perhaps it&apos;s best that he doesn&apos;t turn up at all \u2013 but then he&apos;ll have had even less match practice for his next event, and we all know how bad he can be when he doesn&apos;t feel properly prepared. No, he&apos;s got little choice now but to abandon his career. Bet he didn&apos;t think of that. Still, Ebdon would leave with his head held high, a hero, of sorts, for some. And snooker&apos;s search for a saviour continues. Unless, that is, the Ebdonator turns out to be any good at ballroom dancing. twitter.com/Simon_Burnton", "tags": ["Snooker", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-30T23:28:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/01/caitlin-rose-own-side-now-review", "sentences": ["On &quot;Shanghai Cigarettes&quot; she quits both smoking and a toxic romance."], "title": "Caitlin Rose: Own Side Now | CD review", "article": "Her debut album finds 23-year-old Rose already crowned a country princess, thanks to an EP last year that showcased crafty songwriting and a proud, ringing voice that recalls old-timers such as Loretta Lynn.

But then, few in China or the US knew of the sports entrepreneur before he launched an ambitious $70m (\u00a345m) bid to buy a stake in an NBA team barely 15\u00a0months ago. Chinese media have reported he was born in 1964 in southern Guangdong province and was said to have been an outstanding badminton player in his youth. But he has made headlines by combining his love of sport and knowledge of his homeland with American business experience \u2013 honed at the New York Stock Exchange, as the first Chinese graduate employed there. He graduated from his hometown&apos;s Zhongshan University before moving to the US to study at Columbia University and then complete a masters degree at St John&apos;s. He reportedly speaks Japanese as well as Mandarin, Cantonese and English. Unlike previous high-profile foreign bidders for English teams, he is not known as a tycoon. He does not seem to appear on Chinese rich lists and the extent of his personal wealth is unclear. Instead, he has established himself as a deal-maker \u2013 this bid is backed by a sovereign wealth fund. Huang&apos;s first notable forays into the sporting world came when he cut deals to market the Houston Rockets and New York Yankees to Chinese businesses. Given the vast appetite for basketball among young people in China \u2013 there are said to be as many as 300 million fans \u2013 it was an obvious match. But he grabbed attention when he led a Chinese investment group to buy a 15% stake in the NBA team the Cleveland Cavaliers last year in a deal said to be worth $70m. Months later, he underlined his ambitions with a preliminary deal to take over the Jilin Northeast Tigers, part of the Chinese Basketball Association. His Hong Kong-based QSL Sports company has announced a 15-year agreement to help develop a youth baseball team in China, investing several million dollars to raise the profile of the sport. &quot;It seems like he is trying to piece together a one-man-created sports empire: baseball, basketball, football; the US, England and China,&quot; Maggie Rauch, editor of the China Sports Today blog, said. &quot;The industry perception is that they are keeping an eye on this guy and seeing what he is up to. So far he has maybe done more talking than doing as far as building anything here in sports goes.&quot; But Marc Ganis, president of the US consulting firm Sportscorp, who has worked with the businessman on several ventures, told Associated Press last year: &quot;Huang is a guy with real vision but also the ability to make it a reality.&quot; Huang is managing director of Rocket Capital \u2013 the investment platform he launched with Leslie Alexander, owner of the Houston Rockets \u2013 which focuses on emerging markets, particularly China. Its investments include the China Railway Group, the carmakers Brilliance Auto, the Xinjiang Xinxin Mining Industry Company and the Longrun Tea Group. Dividing his time between Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland and the US, he appears as well-connected in the world of Chinese business and government as he is in sporting circles. A biographical note on the website of Aspen Infrastructure \u2013 where he is a director \u2013 describes him as &quot;one of the most accomplished business executives partnering with some of the largest state-owned enterprises in China&quot;. Despite his ambition and his attention-grabbing investments, he has shunned the limelight, giving few press conferences. The British company he has hired to handle media inquiries was unable to confirm the year of his birth or if he was an American citizen. Whether or not his bid succeeds, he is unlikely to be the last businessman from China to seek to buy a well-known British team. &quot;It&apos;s just a matter of time before a Chinese entrepreneur buys one of the big football clubs,&quot; Rupert Hoogewerf, founder of the Hurun rich list, said. The petrochemicals tycoon Xu Ming, who owns Dalian Shide, was linked to Leeds at one stage; the property developer Xu Rongmao was rumoured to be interested in Newcastle; and some predicted a Chinese bid for Crystal Palace after the club picked up players from Shanghai. Indeed, Liverpool have previously been linked to another businessman from China \u2013 the multimillionaire gaming entrepreneur Zhu Jun, who reportedly held exploratory buyout talks with Barclays Capital.", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Premier League", "Business", "Football", "Sport", "Business", "Premier League 2010-11"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-02T11:56:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/02/volvo-ford-chinese-carmaker-geely", "sentences": ["  The archetypal Scandinavian car brand Volvo fell under Chinese ownership yesterday as Shanghai-based Geely Automotive completed a deal to buy the loss-making carmaker from Ford for an initial price of $1.5bn (\u00a3955m)."], "title": "Chinese carmaker Geely completes Volvo buyout from Ford", "article": "  The archetypal Scandinavian car brand Volvo fell under Chinese ownership yesterday as Shanghai-based Geely Automotive completed a deal to buy the loss-making carmaker from Ford for an initial price of $1.5bn (\u00a3955m). Four months after agreeing on terms, Geely took over Volvo at a handover ceremony in London, in a transaction widely regarded as a sign of Chinese ambition to make a splash in the global automotive industry. Geely pledged that Volvo would continue to be based in Sweden, with factories kept running in Scandinavia and Belgium. The Chinese firm wants to increase production by more than 50% to 600,000 cars annually within five years. &quot;This is a historic day for Geely, which is extremely proud to have acquired Volvo cars,&quot; said its chairman, Li Shufu. &quot;This famous Swedish premium brand will remain true to its core values of safety, quality, environmental care and modern Scandinavian design.&quot; Known for its robust bodywork and sleek Nordic designs, Volvo was founded in 1927 with a name derived from the Latin verb &quot;volvere&quot;, meaning to roll. The business was bought by Ford for $6.45bn in 1999 but has struggled recently, recording a loss of $653m last year after a 10.6% drop sales to 334,000. The price paid by Geely, which comprised $1.3bn of cash and a $200m loan note, is short of the $1.8bn originally agreed, attributed to adjustments in pension obligations and working capital. Ford&apos;s chief executive, Alan Mulally, said: &quot;Volvo is an excellent brand with a strong product line, and it has returned to profit after a successful restructuring. We are confident Volvo has a solid future under Geely&apos;s ownership.&quot; The Volvo buyout is the first Chinese takeover of a premium European car marque. It comes a year after China overtook the US as the world&apos;s biggest automotive market, with sales of 13.5m vehicles in 2009 after remarkable year-on-year growth of 45%. Geely, which also owns a 19% stake in the London taxi maker Manganese Bronze, believes it can steer Volvo to copy German carmakers such as BMW, Audi and Mercedes in making inroads into China. And the Chinese firm intends to use Volvo&apos;s technological expertise to improve its own models. Unions in Sweden gave the deal a cautious welcome \u2013 Stefan L\u00f6fven, head of the Swedish Industrial and Metalworkers&apos; Union, said: &quot;With production, research and development remaining in Sweden and with China being the largest growth market for the automotive industry, we hope for a positive effect on employment.&quot;", "tags": ["Ford", "Automotive industry", "China", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-02T18:17:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/03/china-prostitution-sex-workers-protest", "sentences": ["Zheng Huang, of Shanghai Leyi \u2013 an NGO supporting male sex workers \u2013 said the crackdown was the most significant for at least a decade."], "title": "Chinese sex workers protest against crackdown", "article": "A crackdown on China&apos;s fast-growing sex industry has prompted a backlash, with sex workers demonstrating for the legalisation of prostitution and an outcry about the treatment of women suspects. The protest in Wuhan, central Hubei province, is thought to have been the first of its kind in the country. The small group of women asked onlookers to sign a petition calling for an end to discrimination against sex workers and the scrapping of anti-prostitution laws. &quot;Our society has many problems that are neglected by the public and prostitution is one of them,&quot; Ye Haiyan, the activist and sex worker at the forefront of last week&apos;s demonstration, said today. &quot;Since the crackdown has drawn a lot of media attention, I thought it was a good opportunity for a demonstration to gain public attention so people can know more about the lives of prostitutes.&quot; She said police had detained her for a few days for her part in the protest. Prostitution is widespread and blatant in China, despite frequent crackdowns. Many hotels, hairdressers, massage parlours and karaoke bars make little effort to disguise illicit activity. The World Health Organisation has estimated the country has 4 million sex workers, but academics have suggested the figure is higher. In May, state media said police had arrested 1,100 suspects from &quot;high-end&quot; establishments in Beijing alone. But pink-lit hairdressers and massage facilities appear to be operating unhindered in the capital and elsewhere. Ye, who tweets and blogs under the name Hooligan Sparrow, said the police campaign was harming the health of workers. She launched the Chinese Women&apos;s Rights Workshop, distributing condoms and Aids-prevention pamphlets to brothels in Wuhan. But she said that sex workers were now reluctant to use condoms for fear they would be used as evidence of prostitution. On her website she said she also decided to speak out after seeing women publicly humiliated following police raids. She told the Guardian that legalisation would not only help protect the health of sex workers and stem trafficking, but would also help tackle corruption. &quot;Brothels are not cheap places. Most consumers are quite rich and spend a lot usually. So where is the money coming from? If prostitution was legalised, such income could be more transparent,&quot; she said. Zheng Huang, of Shanghai Leyi \u2013 an NGO supporting male sex workers \u2013 said the crackdown was the most significant for at least a decade. He believed prostitutes have become more vulnerable because they are moving around to avoid police. He said: &quot;Sex workers just need to regain the rights they are supposed to have rather than asking for more rights. For example, many prostitutes do not dare to call the police when they get robbed, because they are afraid of being arrested for their job.&quot; Lawyers and academics suggest that, as in many countries, sex workers \u2013 rather than those who run the brothels \u2013 bear the brunt of anti-prostitution drives. &quot;Policemen usually impose a fine on the place then leave them in peace. It is like a protection fee,&quot; said Li Yinhe, a well-known academic who has campaigned for sexual reforms.This year&apos;s campaign has gone further than usual. Chinese police closed the Hilton hotel in Chongqing for several days in June after raiding a basement bar. Hilton Worldwide said the club was independently owned and operated. There was anger last month when pictures of a raid on a brothel in Guangdong province emerged. The images of women barefoot on the street, handcuffed and tied to a rope, enraged internet users. Last week the ministry of public security ordered police to stop such practices. Li said her research showed the public were no longer so judgmental about prostitutes. Zhu Xiaoding, a lawyer who has been following the anti-prostitution campaign, added: &quot;Now people know prostitutes are mainly from poor areas in the countryside, with no skills and no other choice for making a living.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 4 August 2010.

Smart-suited young British PR executives poured Rwandan coffee and burbled about presenting &quot;a different image&quot; and focusing on &quot;mountains, gorillas, crops&quot; \u2013 all part of the country&apos;s increasing efforts to reinvent itself 16 years after it was torn apart by genocide. Alluring offers were held out of trips to the nature reserves for journalists willing to write up such topics, and when Mushikiwabo arrived she wanted to share &quot;the good news that has been taking place in Rwanda&quot;. There are more women in parliament than any other country and it has been admitted to the Commonwealth. &quot;We are at a time in our post-genocide history where we have to move on,&quot; she said. As Rwanda prepares to go to the polls on Monday to elect a president for only the second time since 1994, this public relations drive, masterminded by the incumbent president, Paul Kagame, this week faces its sternest test. The government is facing accusations, which it denies, of state murder and corrupting the democratic process. Will the international community accept that Rwanda has indeed, moved on? Tasked with persuading the world is London PR firm Racepoint, hired by Kagame. &quot;You used to Google Rwanda and the first thing you would see would be about genocide,&quot; said Cathy Pittman, Racepoint&apos;s managing director. &quot;Now we are feeding content and stories to journalists about the economy and culture. A lot of it is about images.&quot; It sometimes works. A writer from Foreign Direct Investment magazine was taken on a trip to Rwanda by Racepoint and wrote a piece in February which stated Rwanda &quot;prides itself on having zero corruption&quot; and that &quot;Rwanda is poised to become Africa&apos;s newest success story&quot;. The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, in a report last year, found that Rwanda has &quot;excellent public relations machinery&quot; which has succeeded in &quot;persuading the key members of the international community that it has an exemplary constitution emphasising democracy, power-sharing, and human rights which it fully respects&quot;. It concluded: &quot;The truth is, however, the opposite.&quot; Rwanda&apos;s constitution, the report said, was &quot;a facade which hides the exclusionary and repressive nature of the regime&quot;, &quot;basic human rights are in an unsatisfactory state&quot;, &quot;censorship is prevalent&quot; and there are &quot;serious concerns about the level of political freedom&quot;. On 24 June Jean Leonard Rugambage, a dissident journalist, was approached at the gate of his home in Kigali by two gunmen and shot twice in the neck. The killing sparked accusations and denials that his murder was commissioned by the government, which had already withdrawn his newspaper&apos;s licence to print. Hutu opposition politician Victoire Ingabire has failed to secure registration to stand in the election, leading to claims Kagame&apos;s regime is blocking her candidacy. At Racepoint&apos;s suggestion, James Musoni, Rwanda&apos;s local government minister, wrote an opinion piece for British newspapers, which was pitched to the Guardian, among others, to try to deal with these issues. It concluded somewhat ambiguously: &quot;The government is determined to ensure these elections go ahead peacefully and fairly \u2013 without interference from those inside and outside the country who stand to gain from stirring up instability.&quot; Racepoint also arranged for a Guardian journalist to interview Kagame in Kigali. The resulting story was published on 28 May and focused on the allegations. Earlier this month, opposition politician Andre Kagawa Rwisereka was found dead, reportedly nearly decapitated, sparking concern that the killing was politically motivated. Rwanda is not alone among regimes with controversial human rights records to turn to London&apos;s PR firms for help. Others have hired leading outfits such as Bell Pottinger, led by Lord Bell, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher; Portland PR, which counts Michael Portillo among its advisers; and Hill and Knowlton, better known for representing Adidas, Castrol and Nissan. Leading consultants have fanned out from London to win contracts as far afield as China, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Zambia. A recent report into the phenomenon in Brussels by Corporate Europe Observatory, a campaign group which researches the power of corporate lobbying, said: &quot;Secrecy among both embassies and consultancies keeps much of this phenomenon out of public sight \u2026 some of the consultancies are lobbying on behalf of governments which are directly or indirectly responsible for serious human rights violations.&quot; London&apos;s growing status for reputation management is partly down to the time zone, language, and the important role for their clients of British publications with large international readerships including the Economist and the Financial Times, PR executives said. &quot;If you are managing a client&apos;s reputation, whether individual, company or country, it is the Anglo-Saxon media that matters and particularly the London-based media,&quot; said Ivo Gabara, who advises the Kazakhstan foreign ministry on press relations in London. &quot;Coverage in the US is important but what is said out of London will determine your global reputation.&quot; An Amnesty report on Kazakhstan earlier this year stated that &quot;torture or other ill-treatment of individuals deprived of their liberty, whether formally detained or in de facto unacknowledged detention, continue to be routinely used&quot;. &quot;I take on business I am comfortable to identify myself with,&quot; said Gabara. &quot;In Kazakhstan I see a country making progress on every front including its human rights record, media legislation and political freedom.&quot; The doyen of this business is Lord Bell, the chairman of Chime Group, which runs Bell Pottinger. His firm&apos;s political contracts include Sri Lanka, where the government was recently accused of war crimes and Madagascar, where he acts for the former president, Marc Ravalomanana, who was forced out following violent clashes and was sentenced in absentia to four years in jail for abuse of office in buying a presidential jet. Bell&apos;s position on the ethics of which contracts to take is simple. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t do anything I would do a bad job on,&quot; he said. &quot;It is about the direction of travel. I don&apos;t choose to sit in judgment on whether they are going fast enough. If the direction of travel is right then I am perfectly happy to help them.&quot; Another big UK firm, Hill and Knowlton, has contracts with the Malaysian government&apos;s cyber security agency; the Singapore prime minister; city governments in Beijing, Shanghai and Chonqing; and Saudi Arabia&apos;s investment authority. Portland PR works for the Kremlin while Africa Practice, whose director, Marcus Courage, helped run Mwai Kibaki&apos;s presidential campaign in Kenya which was followed by a wave of violence, is working for the government in Gabon. A PR executive who has worked for governments in eastern Europe and Africa said working for foreign governments was sometimes an exercise in &quot;spinning them into legitimacy&quot;. &quot;You are often paid a lot to do something that you know from the outset you will not be able to achieve,&quot; he said on condition of anonymity. &quot;It is almost like a con. You can&apos;t spray perfume on a turd. It will smell nice for a while, but eventually it will smell like what it is.&quot; He said he was once offered, but turned down, a \u00a32m two-year contract by the Sudanese government to produce PR about Darfur. With such fees on offer competition is growing. &quot;Firms distinguish on whether they are being asked to do anything unethical rather than whether their client is acting in that way, rather as a lawyer would take on the case of a criminal,&quot; said a senior partner in a leading firm which contested the recent Kazakhstan contract. &quot;We are paid to put the best case on behalf of the client.&quot; Another PR firm with an office in London, Marston Nicholson, produces the Kazakhstan Live website, which has featured items on folk music and apple harvests. Morris International Associates, a London firm, manages UK media relations for the Saudi Arabian government, including arranging briefings with the London ambassador, Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf al-Saud, and press trips to the kingdom. In 2009 Saudi authorities executed, mainly by beheading, 102 men and women for offences ranging from drug possession and blasphemy to rape and murder, according to Amnesty International. In its latest annual report on the kingdom, the human rights organisation said: &quot;Torture and other ill-treatment continued to be widespread and committed with impunity. Commonly cited methods include severe beatings with sticks, electric shocks, suspension from the ceiling, punching, sleep deprivation and insults.&quot; Ann Morris, a director of the company, acknowledged the country had a mixed reputation and &quot;terrible things happen everywhere&quot;, but she insisted the Saudi government &quot;deserves to have the many, many positive things emphasised and pushed forward&quot;. She said: &quot;Our aim is very much to develop a better understanding,&quot; she said. It is quite often lop-sided. It is quite difficult for some countries to swim above that and show the good things they are doing. Nobody is suggesting any country is perfect but we are trying to get a balance.&quot; Her firm has arranged meetings with Saudi officials for the Guardian and other newspapers. PR consultants who profess to maintaining high ethical standards said they would not take contracts if they believed their clients&apos; values would reflect badly on them. &quot;You need to see the whites of their eyes and if you think they want you to spin and promote a picture of their regime which is untrue, it is an unacceptable contract,&quot; said Simon Cohen, managing director of Global Tolerance, an agency which has worked for the Dalai Lama, the Wallace &amp; Gromit&apos;s Children&apos;s Foundation and the Green Party. &quot;PR and communication agencies have to ask if the people they are working with are aligned with their values.&quot; Beneath the PR fa\u00e7ade Rwanda The PR says: &quot;The Rwandan government has gained significant international support in the past few years precisely because of the stability and reconciliation it has brought to the country.&quot; - An article written by James Musoni, minister of local government in conjunction with Racepoint, a London public relations firm, June 2010 A human rights NGO says: &quot;It uses the constitution opportunistically as a fa\u00e7ade, which hides the exclusionary and repressive nature of the regime; relies on power structures that sometimes run parallel to, and sometimes cross-cuts, the formal government; and in which the army plays a central role.&quot; - Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative report August 2009. Sri Lanka The PR says: &quot;We are ready to engage positively with anyone and everyone around the world who wishes to help us achieve our dream of a united and prosperous land and enable Sri Lanka to take its rightful place in the world as an island of unsurpassed beauty, enterprise and now peace.&quot; - Sri Lankan president Rajapaksa in an article pitched to the Guardian by Bell Pottinger, a PR group, in December 2009. Amnesty says: &quot;At the end of the war, atrocities against civilians and enemy combatants appeared to be fuelled by a sense that there would be no real international consequences for violating the law.&quot; - Madhu Malhotra, Amnesty International&apos;s deputy director for the Asia-Pacific region in March 2010 Kazakhstan The PR says &quot;Political stability, religious tolerance and a unique location at the crossroads of China, Russia and Europe gives Kazakhstan a stabilising role for the whole region \u2013 as well as making it the perfect host for the Congress of World Religions.&quot; Kazakhstan Live \u2013 website created for the Kazakhstan foreign ministry by Marston-Nicholson. The UN says &quot;I conclude that the use of torture and ill-treatment certainly goes beyond isolated instances.

Due to open on Saturday, it will be Apple&apos;s 300th store and its biggest yet, but the high-profile opening is also a welcome distraction from the recent launch of its misfiring iPhone 4. While Apple promised the new store would stock more iPhones than any shop in the world, it would not say whether the elusive white version would be available, which is widely expected to be released later this year with an improved antenna to cure the much-publicised fault, in which the devices lose their signal if held in a certain way. Apple cannot afford any more setbacks in the competitive smartphone space where, according to Nielsen, Google&apos;s Android phones have been steadily gaining market share and account for 27% of the market. Before the launch of the iPhone 4, Apple had a 23% share, Nielsen found. Senior Screen Digest analyst Dan Cryan said that trouble was brewing for Apple in the smartphone market, where Google is aggressively pushing its Android operating system for mobiles and tablet devices. &quot;The future is not without its challenges for Apple,&quot; he said. &quot;The rise of Android is set to pose a challenge to both the iPad and iPhone lines and Apple has yet to sink its teeth into the &apos;cloud&apos;. There is scope for improvement.&quot; Apple&apos;s retail strategy relies on filling its chic, spacious stores with attractive devices. The first retail outlet opened 10 years ago in Virginia, and Apple now has stores from China to Switzerland, from the iconic glass cube on New York&apos;s Fifth Avenue to the Louvre in Paris. Later this summer, new shops will open in Chicago, Paris and Shanghai, the latter featuring the largest pieces of curved glass ever manufactured. Each store is overseen by Ron Johnson, Apple&apos;s senior vice-president for retail. He said it would have more space for children, training, small business services and kit in stock than any of its other stores in the world. Apart from two small outlets in Westfield and Brent Cross, the often chaotic and crowded Regent Street store has served central London until now. Retail analysts Verdict estimate that despite the spacious layout the Regent Street shop has the highest sales density of any retailer in London, generating an average \u00a32,000 per square foot. Consumer electronics firm Dixons generates \u00a3536 and TopShop&apos;s flagship store at Oxford Circus \u00a31,000. &quot;For most people, what they call flagship stores, it&apos;s just for the brand and doesn&apos;t make money,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;It was a big bet to come to Regent Street and open a store like that, and it worked.&quot; Verdict&apos;s consulting director, Neil Saunders, said the combination of higher-end products, avoiding third-party dealerships and choosing high footfall locations had been key to Apple&apos;s retail success. &quot;It has a brand people are evangelical about,&quot; he said. &quot;Apple is a better retailer than most because it understands brand management, that retail is about selling aspirations and dreams and not just lumping products on a shelf.&quot; Not for the first time, Apple defied the analysts who predicted its retail strategy would fail because it went against the prevailing market trend. After 10 years, arch-rival Microsoft has just four retail stores in the US, while Apple has 28 in the UK alone. Retail accounted for 16.4% of Apple&apos;s revenue in the second quarter of 2010, up 78% from the previous year to $2.58bn. Johnson&apos;s interpretation of the Covent Garden project was to create a big, spacious retail space to embody the Apple brand. But without great products Apple has no retail strategy, so Johnson had better hope Apple can continue to keep its edge.\u2022 This article was amended on 6 August 2010.

If so, you&apos;re a dinosaur \u2013 your ways will soon become extinct. Or perhaps you cycle or walk to work, but return in the evening to a neighbourhood containing few friends or co-workers. If so, that lost sense of community is being linked to health and well-being issues. Worse still, those homeworkers hibernating away from human contact. The answer? The Victorian philanthropists&apos; model towns such as Saltaire and Letchworth Garden City. Let me explain \u2026 For those unfamiliar with the great Victorians such as Titus Salt and Ebenezer Howard, the founders of the above mentioned towns respectively, their ideas were as simple as they were revolutionary. Driven by religious conviction and appalled by the squalor and destitution urban workers were subjected to in the industrial age, they designed towns and factories. Clean and safe, arranged around green leafy surroundings, with schools and communal institutes a short walk from the mill or factory. Other new towns followed, such as Port Sunlight on Merseyside and Bournville in Birmingham. So pleasant and leafy were these towns, that as the mills closed and 20th-century capitalism rumbled on, so the 4x4s and BMWs rumbled in. Today, they are wealthy middle-class suburbs, the once alcohol-free environs making way for well-stocked wine cellars. However, the ideas and ideals behind their construction are beginning to re-emerge. The urban expansion of the industrial revolution is happening again in the developing world, most notably in China, prompting the same questions about provision for workers. Europe and America are reflecting on their own cities and workplaces, and questioning their appropriateness for the challenges of our age; health and happiness, community cohesion and environmental sustainability. In terms of health and happiness, according to Jody Aked, project manager at the New Economics Foundation&apos;s Centre for Well-being, nothing makes us glummer than the daily commute. &quot;A study in the US of 900 or so participants showed that, of all daily activities, commuting was the one that led to the least happiness \u2013 sex was the one that led to most,&quot; she says. On top of that, replacing a car with a bike or a swift pair of feet will yield obvious health benefits: &quot;The extent to which we engage with our surroundings, and walk instead of taking a car, has a positive impact on how we experience our lives.&quot; Building environmentally sustainable communities with sufficient employment and housing while reducing the need for the car provides an attractive model. The Dutch set the tone with new cities such as Almere (completed in 2007). Similar eco-town and urban developments are under way around the world, such as Tianjin, China, and Barangaroo, Australia. Ros Diamond, founder of Diamond Architects and a specialist in urban regeneration, believes these models are of critical importance: &quot;One of the discussions about sustainability is encouraging people to live, work and have leisure facilities which are in close proximity. Such new towns are being generated by necessity.&quot; And not simply a town planning or environmental necessity, but a necessity for our working lives too, argues Professor Binna Kandola, business psychologist and co-founder of Pearn Kandola: &quot;People working within the same community, and seeing one another all the time, form what evolutionary psychologists see as integral to a strong community. What such live/work communities are doing, is working with the way human beings are, as opposed to working against it, as remote working and globalised teams perhaps do.&quot; The most ambitious project of this kind was Dongtan, planned for Shanghai. Dr Andrew Davies, now a reader in innovation management, Imperial College, worked with Arup on the project. &quot;The idea of Dongtan was to be self-sufficient. People would live and work there in eco industry, there would be an institute for sustainability. The intention was, that by 2050, half a million people would live there, being close to zero carbon.&quot; The project is now on hold due to a local mayor being jailed for corruption, but the lessons learned from the development stages have fed directly into similar smaller projects. And the ambition lives on in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t move here for the beaches, that&apos;s for sure&quot;, says the Masdar project architect Gerard Evenden, of Foster and Partners. Its plot is merely a spare (and square) patch of desert next to the airport. Yet it&apos;s famous for zero-carbon credentials, and buildings that utilise traditional Middle Eastern materials and design alongside technological innovations: shade is offered by narrow streets, dense areas of trees and &quot;solar shading&quot;; it is powered by a solar farm and heated by geothermal bore holes. But Evenden is even happier talking about its social innovations. &quot;Masdar is rethinking how people live, how you create communities. If we want to avoid building cities of the past, we have to start thinking about this integration.&quot; The project is two and a half years in, and the first residents \u2013 students and academics of the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology \u2013 are due to move in this year. The city will grow in part based on the feedback of the early residents, and businesses, including General Electric, have committed to housing operations there. No one will be further than 250 metres from public transport. Most, however, may prefer to walk the shaded, car-free streets of its 6 sq km to admire the architecture and converse with friends. As Evenden says, while such experiences are not impossible outside Masdar, the chances of you crossing the road for a chat greatly diminish when it&apos;s an eight-lane highway. Little is being planned along similar lines in the UK, other than the Prince of Wales&apos;s commendable, yet not entirely successful, Poundbury. Former prime minister Gordon Brown&apos;s plans for eco-towns appear to have been shelved, replaced by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith&apos;s wish for communities to be broken up, replaced by economic nomads roaming around in search of jobs. Intriguingly, we don&apos;t have to go far back into our social history to find strong live/work communities. The mining towns killed off by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s ticked many boxes. If such communities were rebuilt on a larger scale, and this time offered diverse, safe and satisfying work, then you&apos;d have the ingredients for happiness and productivity. The Victorian visionaries knew it and today&apos;s architects know it: &quot;The early 21st-century city&apos;s high density/low public transportation model is not responding to what we might call &apos;happiness generation&apos;,&quot; says Diamond. But while the free market rules, the last word on live/work communities in the UK could be left to\u2026 Tesco. The retailer&apos;s seemingly limitless plans for expansion are now leading it into planning and developing new town projects, such as one recently approved at Bromley-by-Bow in east London that includes provision for 454 homes, 17 shops, a school, library, hotel and, of course, a supermarket. The idea of a town where Tesco would be the main employer and dwarf other retailers is one Davies laments: &quot;It just contradicts everything \u2013 you need diversity, you need competition. It is the opposite of sustainable.&quot; If you feel the red mist descending, then soothe yourself with Evenden&apos;s words on Masdar: &quot;The answer is to design and develop cities for their environment, and give people as much choice as we can in their lives within the city. All the lessons learned at Masdar we can take into the wider world.&quot; Walking past nameless neighbours, sucking in exhaust fumes or swaying in packed train carriages for hours on end, is unsustainable in so many ways. &quot;Masdar will become the norm in the future,&quot; says Evenden. &quot;It has to be.&quot; Living the dream: Poundbury On the outskirts of Dorchester, Dorset, sits an unusual urban community. The buildings look quaintly old, yet brand new. In fact, no building dates back further than the 1990s. For this is Poundbury, the culmination of perpetual architect-botherer Prince Charles putting his money where his mouth was, based on his 1989 book A Vision of Britain. Home to several hundred people, it also houses businesses including Dorset Cereals and (mirroring Cadbury&apos;s Bournville) the House of Dorchester chocolate factory. The two words that crop up most when talking to residents are &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;clean&quot;. The so-called Poundbury Code covers the sublime (no litter or dog mess), the ridiculous (black bin bags only) and the slightly scary \u2013 a &quot;three strikes and you&apos;re out&quot; rule for those deemed troublemakers. It is mostly self-governing, however, and Andy Joslin, production manager at House of Dorchester, says: &quot;I think it&apos;s good people have to follow rules, it&apos;s part of why I moved here. If you keep yourself to yourself, it&apos;s fine.&quot; Harriet McKay, a recent graduate, lives in Poundbury and works for Dorset Cereals. She too likes the area, and her walk to work is &quot;just one song on the iPod away&quot;. As for things to do, she mostly heads out to Dorchester. Her colleague Rob Ward, also early-20s, attempts: &quot;Last weekend we went to the market \u2026 and there was a square dance,&quot; before admitting, &quot;it can be a bit middle-aged&quot;. Achieving a live/work community may be some way off. McKay and Ward reckon they are two of only five in the 100-plus Dorset Cereals workforce to live there. Joslin, similarly, one of only two or three at House of Dorchester. &quot;Properties are just too expensive for most,&quot; he says. Yet the principles of community, employment and sustainability are stronger here than most UK planning projects. &quot;Initially I moved here for my first job and to see what happens \u2013 but living and working in the same community is definitely something I would look for in a future job,&quot; says Ward", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Work-life balance", "Housing", "Society", "Environment", "Money", "Planning policy", "Politics", "Global development", "Communities"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-06T23:02:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/09/news-corp-china", "sentences": ["China Media Capital, a $700m-plus private equity fund backed by the country&apos;s second largest media company, Shanghai Media Group, and the China Development Bank, will take a controlling stake in News Corp&apos;s TV assets for an undisclosed sum."], "title": "News Corp reduces China TV stake", "article": "Rupert Murdoch&apos;s News Corporation is to sell a majority stake in its three Chinese TV channels to a state-controlled private equity fund, a move that has been interpreted as an admission that it has failed to build a standalone broadcast business in China.

A Reuters report estimated that the three channels combined were generating no more than $50m in annual revenue while the Financial Times reckons the deal was worth about $160m. The move is being interpreted as further evidence of News Corp pulling back from China&apos;s tightly controlled media market. Last year News Corp reorganised its Asian satellite broadcasting business, Star TV, into separate India and Greater China units, and merged its English-language operations across Asia into one unit. In a statement News Corp said that the deal &quot;recognises the value we have created in Star China and enables us to continue to grow it for the future&quot;. However, analysts said that the deal was &quot;inevitable&quot; because China has limited foreign media companies to distributing content largely in the southern province of Guangdong, cutting out pan-China audiences. CMC, which was launched last year, has struck its first deal as part of what is viewed as a plan to build up its media assets so that they can to compete internationally. &quot;This partnership is an extension of our long-term co-operation with News Corp,&quot; the China Media Corp Chairman, Li Ruigang, who is also president of SMG, said in a statement. &quot;The entry of Chinese capital into the international media market will help facilitate its changes and development.

He oversaw the amalgamation in 2004 of the Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist), the biggest such merger in British higher education history. The merger was not without its challenges. Agreements with unions not to cut staff numbers following the unification, and a strategic decision to invest in new staff and facilities, meant the fledging university was \u00a330m in the red by 2007. Alan&apos;s business acumen \u2013 he was named north-west business leader of the year in 2006, not bad for an educationist \u2013 ensured this deficit was remedied. Within a year the university was back in the black, after selling off land, losing 650 jobs and securing more research funding. Alan had a vision for the university, outlined in the Manchester 2015 agenda, to reach the top 25 higher education institutions in the world by 2015. Manchester quickly climbed up the international academic league tables. It is now ranked 41st in the world, seventh in Europe and fifth in the UK, according to the Shanghai Jiao Tong University league table for 2009. Alan was a distinguished scholar, one of a new breed of social historians to introduce quantitative methods into their research. His interests lay in the secularisation of western societies. He traced this secularisation to Jewish monotheism, which he called &quot;a potent, creative cultural force&quot; that also led to &quot;a dichotomy between &apos;sacred&apos; and &apos;profane&apos; aspects of reality [and] established an intellectual framework within which secularisation was almost bound to occur&quot;. His books include Religion and Society in Industrial England: Church, Chapel and Social Change, 1740-1914, published in 1976, and The Making of Post-Christian Britain: A History of the Secularisation of Modern Society (1980). He was one of four editors of Australians: A Historical Library (1987), an 11-volume history of Australia. Born in Brisbane, Alan graduated from the Australian National University in Canberra with first-class honours and completed his master&apos;s in history in 1967. His academic career began as a history lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea, where many of his students went on to shape the island&apos;s future, including one who became the country&apos;s prime minister. He obtained a doctorate in modern history from Oxford University in 1973. His thesis was on the growth and decline of nonconformity in England and Wales. Alan returned to Australia as a lecturer at the University of New South Wales, where he was able to establish his academic reputation as a historian in the social and religious history of Britain and Australia. He was appointed professor of history at the university in 1981, before becoming its pro-vice-chancellor (research) in 1988. He was elected as a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia two years later. Alan&apos;s managerial career in higher education continued to develop, and in 1991 he became vice-chancellor and principal of the University of Tasmania, where he oversaw its merger with the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology. In 1996, Alan became the vice-chancellor and principal of the University of Melbourne. He is credited with the university&apos;s transformation, overseeing a dramatic regeneration of the physical structure of the university and attracting world-class academics to the institution. Considered by many to be less successful was the establishment in 1998 of Melbourne University Private (MUP), an independent body established to work alongside the University of Melbourne. The project was abandoned in 2005. The MUP building \u2013 now part of the public University of Melbourne \u2013 is named the Alan Gilbert Building. Alan&apos;s leadership credentials in higher education and his experience in overseeing the Tasmania merger prepared him for the creation in 2004 of the University of Manchester, Britain&apos;s largest university. The Manchester campus today is almost unrecognisable from when Alan took office, having undergone a \u00a3400m transformation. Under his stewardship the university managed to attract a number of academic heavyweights, including Nobel laureates John Sulston and Joseph Stiglitz. Alan knew when he embarked on the Manchester mission that the institution he would help mould would be as vital to the city and the region of north-west England as their support would be to the university. Alan became an officer of the Order of Australia in 2008. He retired from the University of Manchester earlier this year and had planned to return to writing. Alan displayed vision and inspiration as a university leader, and dynamism and flair as an entrepreneur. As a former colleague, I will miss Alan&apos;s generosity, compassion and his sharp Aussie wit. His death is a loss to the international academic community and not least to the generations of students that were his lifeblood and for whom he cared so passionately about.

Environmental campaigners welcomed the measure, saying the announcement went well beyond previous orders in naming specific facilities and outlining stiff penalties for firms that do not comply by the end of September. The notice from the ministry of industry and information technology covers 18 industries including steel, paper, cement and dyeing, according to Shanghai Securities News and other media. It includes companies across the country and will affect parts of the Aluminium Corporation of China, better known as Chalco, and Hebei Iron and Steel Group, the country&apos;s biggest steelmaker. &quot;There is no doubt this announcement is significant, especially because it is complete with real consequences; if they don&apos;t meet the target they will be barred from obtaining loans, for example,&quot; said Alex Wang, of the Natural Resources Defence Council. Other penalties include having sewage treatment licences revoked or being refused business licences. Beijing&apos;s target is to reduce energy intensity \u2013 the amount used to generate each unit of gross domestic product \u2013 by 20% from the 2005 level. It improved by 14.4% in the first four years of the plan, putting it in touching distance of its pledge. But in May premier Wen Jiabao said he would use an &quot;iron hand&quot; to increase energy efficiency after figures showed it had deteriorated by 3.6% in the first quarter. That probably reflected the effect of the economic recovery and a stimulus package that included large amounts of spending on resource-hungry infrastructure. Improvements in the second quarter smoothed out the effects of the drop, with efficiency falling by 0.09% over the first half of the year compared with the same period of 2009. According to the World Bank, Chinese industries use 20% to 100% more energy per unit of output than their US, Japanese and other counterparts. The government is keen to improve efficiency in part because of the environmental impact but also because of its concerns about energy security. &quot;[This announcement] shows how these five year plan targets can really mobilise behaviour \u2026 people&apos;s career prospects are riding on meeting them,&quot; added Wang. But he cautioned: &quot;As with all things in China, what will be critical is how they implement this. To what extent have they been able to identify all the outdated equipment out there \u2013 have companies managed to hide some of it from the government?&quot; Yang Ailun of Greenpeace said: &quot;The Chinese government have a 20% intensity target and were really struggling to implement it. Given that there&apos;s only half a year left, they really have to take more dramatic measures to meet it. The only kind of policies that can work within a very short time are shutdowns.&quot; She added: &quot;I think if they have actually announced it and named companies, for sure it&apos;s going to happen. In the longer term, to shut down the most energy inefficient facilities doesn&apos;t just make environmental sense but also economic sense.&quot; She said the new document in part reflected the fact the government now had a clearer plan for achieving its target and better information, but also showed the difficulties of implementing central directives. &quot;It tells us that it is not enough sometimes for the government to say &apos;This is how much your province or company needs to achieve&apos; \u2026 [giving] very specific names of things they want to close down makes it easier for them to check whether implementation is there. It also encourages other parties, such as the public and environmental NGOs, to help check.&quot; The list included 762 cement factories, 279 paper mills, 175 steel mills, 192 coking plants and an unspecified number of aluminum mills.

That was Figueras.   As home to the painter Salvador Dal\u00ed and inspiration for some of his greatest and strangest artistic endeavours, the Costa Brava fishing port of Cadaqu\u00e9s is used to the surreal. But the latest project involving the north-eastern Spanish town has astonished even the cosmopolitan inhabitants of a place that boasts more art galleries per square kilometre than anywhere else in the country. A Chinese developer has decided to build a replica of the town half-way across the globe in Xiamen Bay, where mainland China looks out towards Taiwan. Architects from developers China Merchants Zhangzhou visited Cadaqu\u00e9s in June, taking measurements, photographing buildings and worrying about whether Chinese fire engines would fit down its tiny streets. Sources at the company said they had found a spot that was geographically similar to Cadaqu\u00e9s, with its gently sloping hills and protected bay. &quot;Building work will start in September or October,&quot; a spokesman said. More than 100 acres of land will be used to build a near replica with a capacity to house some 15,000 Chinese holidaymakers who want to enjoy the Costa Brava experience without having to travel 6,500 miles. The Chinese version will not have the sparkling Mediterranean, the madness-inducing Tramontana wind or as many jellyfish as Cadaqu\u00e9s, but the promoters say they will try to get as close to possible to the real thing. &quot;We will recreate the essence of the fishing town and will reproduce the most characteristic elements of the architecture in a space which has a similar coastline,&quot; one of the architects, Hu Zheng, told the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia . That will mean copying the narrow streets and the white-painted buildings that look out across the perfect, open-mouthed bay where small, brightly painted fishing craft bob up and down. The promoters of the Chinese resort have decided they can improve a bit on the original, however, and will be adding an artificial island. Among other buildings the architects were keen to see were the warren-like collection of fishermen&apos;s cottages in neighbouring Portlligat, where Dal\u00ed lived. Topped with a giant egg sculpture, this is where the Spanish surrealist painted many of his most famous works \u2013 including a portrait of his Russian wife Gala looking out to sea. It is also where he indulged his fondness for voyeurism, encouraging selected guests to perform sex acts in front of him. Visitors to the house today are greeted by the same stuffed, wild bear with which Dal\u00ed tried to frighten away unwanted guests. The Chinese developers told officials in Cadaqu\u00e9s that they also wanted to make art a central part of the new town, with space for galleries and offers to some local Spanish artists to show their work there. &quot;We like the idea and the way they are treating us,&quot; said Joan Borrell, mayor of Cadaqu\u00e9s. &quot;We are small but well-known. If they want to imitate you then it means you must have got something right.&quot; Borrell said he hoped the Xiamen version would eventually attract Chinese tourists to the real thing. &quot;As with a work of art, seeing the copy often makes you want to see the original,&quot; he said. &quot;That would be wonderful for Cadaqu\u00e9s and for the whole of the Costa Brava.&quot; This is the second attempt to build a replica of the fishing town somewhere else in the world. A previous attempt was made at a Caribbean beach in the Dominican Republic, but Cadaqu\u00e9s says it was not consulted and does not recognise it as a genuine imitation. China Merchants Zhangzhou declined to comment officially on the project, though sources at the company confirmed that the project was still on track. Dal\u00ed would undoubtedly have approved of the endeavour. One of his favourite money-making habits was to sign, and sell-off, blank sheets of paper for prints and lithographs. As a result, he is one of the most frequently copied and forged artists in the world. Made in China Shanghai has built a version of Paris on its doorstep, complete with a scaled-down replica of the Eiffel Tower. The development has full-sized houses and boulevards and was designed to house up to 100,000 people. Thomas Hardy&apos;s vision of Dorchester inspired Chinese town planners to build a replica of the English village for wealthy Chinese families in Chengdu, central China. Eager buyers flocked to the development, which is called &quot;British Town&quot;. A Himalayan town was used by the Chinese to create a tourist version of Shangri-la. The project was inspired by English writer James Hilton&apos;s 1933 novel Lost Horizon where he describes Shangri-la as an imaginary Himalayan utopia. The &quot;new&quot; Shangri-la was declared a tourist paradise by order of the Chinese government. A Chinese businessman drew up plans for a lasting tribute to singer Michael Jackson by building his own Neverland ranch on an island near Shanghai. The cost was expected to be about $15m and the site would include a man-made lake, cinema and a zoo.

The American would like to inject a little perspective. While in Britain we have been celebrating Andy Turner&apos;s European gold medal win, Oliver is not sure we should be getting quite so carried away. For one thing, he discounts European hurdlers as a force on the world stage and used actions rather than words yesterday at Crystal Palace&apos;s Diamond League meeting when he won in 13.06 while Turner was last. &quot;Speed-wise they&apos;re fast,&quot; concedes the 28-year-old, who admits that Turner \u2013 a friend and former training partner \u2013 regularly beat him over the flat, &quot;but hurdling wise they&apos;re not that good. Outdoors I don&apos;t really pay attention to any European guy. They&apos;re going to run like 13.2sec or something? I open the season running that.&quot; If Oliver is dismissive of European hurdling, he is more disparaging still of Britain&apos;s funding structure that, he says, too often &quot;rewards mediocrity&quot;, as he describes the motivation that drove him from working in a shoe shop with a personal best of 13.2 four years ago, to a earning a living as a Nike athlete running 12.89 last month \u2013 two-hundredths of a second off the world record. &quot;I was working in Finish Line, you know, like Foot Locker. I had won the Berlin golden league; I&apos;d won some other meets; I was ranked number six or seven in the world; and I worked five or six hours a day. I didn&apos;t like that lifestyle so I had to do something to change it. &quot;I remember Andy said to me one time: &apos;How come you have to go to work, you ran 13.2?&apos; I was like: &apos;Yeah, I&apos;m an American who ran 13.2, I don&apos;t have no contracts or nothing. They don&apos;t pay me for running 13.2.&apos; I had to go to work to make money. That&apos;s why Americans always do better, because we don&apos;t reward mediocrity. If I was a European running 13.2 they&apos;d probably be trying to get me the world or something. As an American you run 13.2 and you&apos;re just one of a bunch of people.&quot; Oliver critically compares Britain&apos;s top sprint hurdlers, Turner and William Sharman, whose personal bests are 13.28 and 13.3 respectively, to the in-form American Ryan Wilson. &quot;He&apos;s run 13.1 three or four times this season. He&apos;s having a great year, but he doesn&apos;t have a contract. He&apos;s American, but if he was from anywhere else he&apos;d be the star of the country.&quot; As Oliver discusses Britain&apos;s hurdling shortcomings, he fidgets like a kid, jigging his long legs, rotating his shoulders, fiddling with a slab of his favourite Swiss chocolate. &quot;Sitting still is hard,&quot; he says, grinning an immaculate white smile, demonstrating that as well as world\u2011class hurdling, fabulous teeth are also missing from the British way of doing things. An American housewives&apos; favourite, he has become a regular fixture on female chat pages, his topless photos dubbed &quot;morning eye candy&quot;. But Oliver would rather talk about hurdling than being a pin-up \u2013 &quot;I was born with my looks, but I&apos;ve earned my career as a hurdler&quot; \u2013 launching a damning appraisal of this country&apos;s standards. &quot;UK Athletics, I&apos;d tell them to stop rewarding these people for mediocrity. That&apos;s what needs to be told to them. I was reading this new guy came in [Charles van Commenee] and he started taking all this funding from people until they reached a better standard. Then everybody started reaching that standard. News flash! It wasn&apos;t because they couldn&apos;t do it, it&apos;s because they weren&apos;t asked to do it. Put the standard higher and everybody will reach it.&quot; In an event where Oliver describes the hurdles, rather than other hurdlers, as his opposition \u2013 he is friends with the world record holder, Dayron Robles, and the second-fastest hurdler in history, Liu Xiang of China \u2013 the Florida-based athlete has reserved a rare piece of venom for one British hurdler. &quot;I like Andy, he acts like he has sense. But that Sharman dude he talks like he&apos;s already run 12 seconds before, or he&apos;s won something. I don&apos;t like that. I don&apos;t know why he acts like he&apos;s doing something when he&apos;s only run like 13.3. I think that really aggravates a lot of people. You need to be more\u00a0humble.&quot; Last year Sharman produced an impressive semi-final performance at the world championships in Berlin \u2013 which Oliver missed because of a calf strain \u2013 beating Robles with a personal best and blowing kisses to the crowd as he crossed the line. He finished fourth in the final. &quot;If he went to a world championship and everybody was there he wouldn&apos;t even be close to making no finals. So he needs to just be humble. Basically know your role, know what&apos;s going on. Like me, I&apos;ve always thought I could be really good, but I wasn&apos;t so blatant or disrespectful, talking or running around, running off my mouth like I was doing something already.&quot; Hailing from a nation where track and field is eclipsed by homegrown sports, Oliver says it is only in his home town of Denver that he attracts interest. &quot;At home we&apos;re all like mini Usain Bolts,&quot; he says, describing the local newsreels. China, though, is where he gets the most attention, a legacy of Liu&apos;s world-record run of 12.88 in 2006. &quot;In China all the hurdlers are stars because of Liu Xiang,&quot; says Oliver, his eyes lighting up at the memory of running in Shanghai in May. &quot;You come off the airplane and they&apos;re at the airport like you&apos;re Kobe Bryant or something. They come running up and they want to take all these pictures, there&apos;s TV cameras and all kinds of stuff. It was crazy.&quot; Having made a habit of breaking the 13-second barrier \u2013 just one of 12 men to do so \u2013 Oliver is now routinely asked when he will break Robles&apos;s world record set in 2008. He shakes his head. &quot;I focus on winning, not running fast times. If you win the race you get to do the victory lap. If you told me I could have a world record or Olympic gold I&apos;d take the Olympic gold every time,&quot; he says, giving the example of Britain&apos;s former world record holder Colin Jackson, now relegated to fifth on the all-time list following Oliver&apos;s performances this year. &quot;Now Colin is just the top British [and European] record holder,&quot; says Oliver. &quot;I wonder if he would have rather won an Olympic gold medal. I wonder looking back what he would prefer to have now that he&apos;s fifth on the all-time list. I bet he&apos;d rather take Olympic gold. That can never be taken from you.&quot; Popular on the circuit \u2013 every single coach, physio and athlete who passes Oliver is keen to shake his hand or say hello \u2013 the American, who trains in a sports complex next to Disneyland, describes himself as the Mickey Mouse of athletics. &quot;The most popular one. Everybody wants to come see Mickey. He&apos;s the coolest and he sells tickets. Maybe once I start getting good they can put me on a poster and I&apos;ll sell tickets, too.&quot; If the Olympic and World Indoor bronze medallist continues his rich vein of form, it surely will not be long before that happens.", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-15T08:30:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/16/china-overtakes-japan-second-largest-economy1", "sentences": ["The headline growth figures also mask huge disparities of income in China, which has a population of 1.3 billion; the UN estimates that 300 million have been lifted from poverty since the reforms began, but while luxury boutiques spring up in Shanghai and Beijing, hundreds of millions still live in severe hardship, particularly in rural areas."], "title": "China overtakes Japan as world's second-largest economy", "article": "China overtook Japan as the world&apos;s second-largest economy during the second quarter of this year, marking another milestone in the country&apos;s transformation from impoverished communist state to economic superpower. With its red-hot economy growing at around 9% a year, some experts now expect China to outstrip the United States as soon as 2030, its financial strength carrying broad political implications. Official data published today showed a faltering Japanese economy growing by just 0.1% in the three months to June, with GDP of $1.28tn (\u00a3826bn) eclipsed by China, which had economic output of $1.33tn.Although it is not the first time China has outpaced Japan in a single quarter, most economists now expect the emergent economy to end the year firmly ahead. China&apos;s spectacular growth since Deng Xiaoping began to introduce free-market reforms three decades ago has seen it bounding up the world league of economic powers. Just 10 years ago, it was the sixth-largest in the world but has since outstripped Britain and France in 2005 and Germany in 2007. It overtook Germany as the world&apos;s largest exporter last year and also became the largest car market. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, described the figures as a &quot;symbolic&quot; shift. He said: &quot;Clearly it was inevitable, it was a just a question of when it would happen \u2013 just as it is pretty inevitable in the long run that it will be bigger than the US as well, because it has four times the population.&quot; For now, China remains a distant second behind the US. The International Monetary Fund expects China&apos;s GDP to reach $5.36tn this year, while the US is expected to hit $14.79tn. The UK projection is $2.22tn. Japan is expected to have GDP of $5.27tn. Nick Parsons, head of research at National Australia Bank, said the global financial crisis, which pitched more developed economies into recession, has underlined the shifting world power. &quot;The Chinese economy has more than doubled in size in the past 10 years and will double in size again in the next 10 and I don&apos;t think the financial crisis has accelerated that change as much as it has cemented it,&quot; he added. For Japan, the figures reflect the continued decline of a nation that has held the second spot since 1968, when it overtook West Germany, the result of a remarkable rise as a manufacturing and financial giant in the wake of the second world war. But the &quot;economic miracle&quot; came to a juddering halt at the beginning of the 1990s when a property bubble burst. What followed was a lost decade in the doldrums and the country has never fully recovered. Today, it faces deflation, an ageing and shrinking population and only minimal growth. Economists also cited the figures as evidence that the global recovery was still facing strong headwinds. China&apos;s breakneck growth has not come without cost, causing huge social upheaval, including large-scale migration from the countryside to cities, which are growing at an unprecedented rate. Consultancy firm McKinsey reckons that China&apos;s urban population will almost double by 2025, when it will have 221 cities with populations of more than 1 million, compared with 35 in Europe. China has continued growing through the recession, in part owing to a $586bn stimulus package. The headline growth figures also mask huge disparities of income in China, which has a population of 1.3 billion; the UN estimates that 300 million have been lifted from poverty since the reforms began, but while luxury boutiques spring up in Shanghai and Beijing, hundreds of millions still live in severe hardship, particularly in rural areas. Japan&apos;s people are still among the richest in the world, with GDP per capita of $39,700, compared with $46,400 in the US and just $3,600 in\u00a0 China. The rapid advances in China have also led to environmental problems: in 2006, the country overtook the US as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. This month, Beijing ordered more than 2,000 highly polluting, unsafe or energy inefficient plants to shut down within two months, underlining how the one-party regime can direct sudden change. The growth of China has made it hungry for natural resources and energy, driving up the cost of commodities and raising the potential for conflict. It has been busy doing trade deals in Africa, Latin America and Asia, without the kind of human rights and reform demands often attached by the west. The US has already blocked an attempted takeover of an American oil firm by a Chinese state-controlled rival while Australia has prevented the Chinese buying mineral firms. There are also concerns that the global economy has become unbalanced, with huge trade deficits between China and the developed world. China is said to make four-fifths of the world&apos;s toys and almost three-fifths of its clothing. Developed economies are hopeful that China will become a market for their goods and services as its consumer market grows, but at present it accounts for just 2% of UK exports. Critics in the US and Europe argue that China is benefiting unfairly because it keeps its currency, the yuan, artificially low, benefiting its exporters. According to a different measure, using purchasing power instead of current exchange rates, China had already overtaken Japan. Hawksworth said China&apos;s growth will begin to slow progressively to around 3.5% to 4% in 20 years&apos; time. This is in part because of an ageing population, due to its one-child policy, as well as increasing pressures on wages and a growing reliance on domestic demand as exports slow. There have recently been a series of high-profile strikes at Honda and other factories in southern China, as workers demand better wages and conditions, while a series of suicides at Foxconn, which makes iPhones and other Apple products, has raised concern and led to higher pay.

Steve Ingham, its chief executive, put the strong performance down to rapid growth in emerging markets such as China and South America as well as more permanent job vacancies. &quot;As soon as the confidence creeps back into the white collar market, then people feel confident enough to move on and of course that creates a vacancy for us, it is that churn that is driving business for us,&quot; said Ingham.Despite the jump in profits, the shares closed down 5p at 368p on concerns about the economic headwinds that could affect the business and caution from Ingham who said: &quot;It is the nature of our business that visibility is short and the general level of business confidence and economic activity may be threatened by fiscal consolidation in the UK and Europe&quot;. Michael Page, which finds jobs for people in financial, accounting and legal services, reported sluggish demand on the domestic front with the same number of UK placements on its books as for the equivalent period a year ago. &quot;In the UK, market conditions had stabilised in the latter part of 2009 and there was growing evidence of a gradual recovery in the first half of 2010,&quot; said Ingham. The company said signs of a pick-up in the UK job market first became evident in the fields of financial services, retail and sales, but virtually all disciplines were now showing an improving trend. Despite the domestic weakness the company was able to report a pre-tax profit of \u00a361.4m for the six months to 30 June, up from \u00a343.2m a year ago. It has sought to reduce its reliance on Britain and financial services recruitment and to that end it said 70% of gross profits were generated overseas and within that more than 50% came from recruitment in the healthcare, mining and business support services sectors. An important measure for analysts covering recruitment firms is the gross profit generated by each consultant. Collins Stewart analyst James Gilbert said that at Michael Page that figure peaked at \u00a3146,000 in 2006 and after sharp falls during the credit crunch recovered to \u00a380,500 in the period. &quot;This remains some 45% below the 2006 peak underlining that activity levels are still a long way below their peak.&quot; Michael Page said growth at its businesses in Asia and Latin America was up 43% on last year with Ingham reporting booming demand at its offices in Shanghai and Beijing and plans to expand further in the region. &quot;We&apos;re performing at record levels in both Shanghai and Beijing \u2026 China&apos;s a fantastic opportunity for us in the first half,&quot; he said, adding that India, where it does not yet have a presence, was also on the company&apos;s radar.", "tags": ["Michael Page International", "Unemployment and employment statistics", "Business", "Economic growth (GDP)"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-16T18:57:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/aug/17/kane-and-lynch-2-dog-days-review", "sentences": ["This time around, Lynch is living in Shanghai with his girlfriend and Kane has one final job to complete."], "title": "Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC | Game review", "article": "A former mercenary and a self-medicating psychopath respectively, Kane and Lynch return for a second slice of grisly, gun-heavy entertainment. This time around, Lynch is living in Shanghai with his girlfriend and Kane has one final job to complete. This last payday should be straightforward but straightforward does not a shoot-em-up make and, within a level or two, it&apos;s all gone mammaries skyward. A local crime lord&apos;s daughter is dead at their hands. Lynch&apos;s girlfriend has been abducted. Hundreds of well-armed gangsters are on their tail, former allies have turned on them and the police are also shooting to kill. And thus the scene is set for assorted stand-offs and carefully timed gun play. Given the ancestry and the typical evolutionary process of games, it won&apos;t come as a surprise that Kane &amp; Lynch 2 ups the intensity and gore quotient considerably. It cleverly masks some of the excesses with handily positioned, pixellated censorship \u2013 which, to be fair, adds to the documentary sense of the game. Yes, the shaky cam stuff is a shortcut to immediacy but, as Paul Greengrass will tell you, it works and it&apos;s that verit\u00e9 grit, and the realism of the visuals, that give Kane &amp; Lynch its not-so-unique selling point. Without those, and the not-bad-at-all multiplayer mode, this would be an alarmingly short disappointment. That&apos;s not to say this is a bad game. It&apos;s not. The impressive film-like visual quality is backed up with palpable tension, well judged AI and enormous, hard-to-monitor arenas that you can&apos;t get through with gung ho ultra violence: you need to be patient, pick your weapon, work out the lay of the land and make sure you have cover and ammo to spare. Enemies will not fall from a single gunshot unless you have the right weapon or get a perfect headshot. The chances of this \u2013 thanks to shaky cam, the gritty, grey (often almost photo-realistic) colour scheme, the distance between you and your assailants and the evident efficiency of their body armour \u2013 are small. Very small. As a challenge, Kane &amp; Lynch is a tough one. It&apos;s a shame then that the ending is oddly abrupt and it doesn&apos;t take a great deal of time \u2013 approximately 6-8 hours \u2013 to get there.

The handheld camera wobbles and shakes as it tracks our antiheroes&apos; every move, dropping to the dirt whenever one takes a bullet and lurching woozily as they sprint down alleyways, while the nastiest moments are censored by a mess of blocky pixels. Splatter fans might miss the gory thrill of a headshot, but there&apos;s something grotesquely effective about this stylistic trick; the suggestion that it&apos;s too disgusting to show adds to the mock-doc realism. With some exceptional sound design capturing the shuddering intensity and near-deafening cacophony of a gunfight, the opening stages in particular are immersive and thrilling, the mean streets of Shanghai captured in authentic detail. It&apos;s third-person action as shown on YouTube and an invigorating aesthetic that will surely be imitated in future titles. The accidental shooting of a crime lord&apos;s daughter propels the plot, as Kane and Lynch are chased through the city by both police and gangsters, while attempting to locate the latter&apos;s Chinese girlfriend. The pursuit culminates in a gruesome and gratuitously shocking sequence from which the game never recovers, with the two forced through uninspiring locations such as factories, warehouses and train yards that could be in any city. The action, meanwhile, refuses to pause for breath, save for the odd profanity-laced cinematic moment, and the relentless, one-note pacing starts to pall. At a mere six hours long, the story tries not to outstay its welcome, though some will be disappointed at the abruptness of its ending. Fortunately, the inventive Fragile Alliance multiplayer mode makes a welcome return, offering a series of expansive stages for online heists, with the potential to betray your team-mates and claim the loot for yourself when the getaway vehicle arrives. There are several variants on this theme, including the single-player arcade mode, which suffers from the occasionally suicidal behaviour of your computer-controlled team-mates. Sadly, the visual verve isn&apos;t quite enough to compensate for the unconvincing shooting. Most weapons feel either underpowered or inaccurate; despite sounding like you&apos;re embroiled in urban warfare, you may as well be using water pistols.

His long and active life was made possible thanks to his boundless energy and enthusiasm. He was born in Salford, Manchester, the fourth of seven children. His family soon moved to London where his father worked in West End theatres. They could not afford to keep Ron at school, so he took a string of odd jobs before joining the army, where he became a lightweight boxing champion and played rugby. When he was posted to Shanghai, he was shocked by the poverty around him and was detailed to collect frozen corpses from the streets in winter. When the Japanese invaded in 1937, he escaped first to Singapore and then to Java, where he was wounded, and on to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and India, earning him the nickname &quot;Lucky&quot; Garside. After eight years away from home, he was shipped back to the UK by way of Australia. Within two weeks he had joined up as a paratrooper and was dropped at Arnhem, in the Netherlands, again having a lucky escape when his glider crashed. After the second world war, Ron was a film distributor in Berlin, working with many actors and directors. In Berlin he met his future wife, Dilys, an army secretary. Returning to London, they married and had two children, Theresa and Christopher. Ron then worked for 27 years for Reuters in Fleet Street, usually walking the 10 miles to work and back. On retirement, he taught himself French and classical guitar, and took his French O-level aged 69. He would go off for weeks at a time to France on a motor scooter, making friends wherever he went. He remained a keen walker, and knew the North York moors and the Welsh hills intimately. Aged 82, he climbed Mont Ventoux, in Provence, with his grandchildren. In later years, despite his failing eyesight, he continued to read French and German poetry, much of which he could recite perfectly to any willing audience.

There were demands for Zuma, who was thousands of miles away at the World Expo in Shanghai during a state visit to China, to return home as cities were paralysed by marching public sector workers. The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) warned that its historic alliance with Zuma&apos;s governing African National Congress (ANC) had reached a critical low. Zwelinzima Vavi, secretary general of Cosatu, said government corruption had derailed the alliance&apos;s agenda. &quot;The emergence of a &apos;new tendency&apos; focused on taking over the ANC and using access to the state for a selfish accumulation agenda disrupted the emerging unity of purpose, which has led to a paralysis in both the alliance and government,&quot; he said. &quot;The alliance is unable to convene an alliance summit for fear of an implosion as a result of fundamental differences on the question of where the power lies.&quot; Vavi condemned a lack of decisive leadership. &quot;The alliance is again dysfunctional; the centre cannot hold,&quot; he said. Cosatu&apos;s role as potential kingmaker was evident in 2007 when, having lost patience with the then president, Thabo Mbeki, it threw its weight behind Zuma. Some critics say that Zuma&apos;s promises to the labour movement and others are now coming home to roost. Vavi recently told an angry crowd demonstrating over low pay that Zuma earns more than R2.2m (\u00a3193,000) a year. &quot;He has blood like we have blood,&quot; he said. &quot;He has a big family like we do. He has children to feed like we do. Our needs are the same.&quot; Analysts said Cosatu, which forged ties with the ANC in the struggle to end apartheid, would have too much to lose from a split. But William Gumede, author of Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC, warned that the political fallout could be damaging. &quot;It&apos;s a big moment for the alliance,&quot; he said. &quot;These are some of the people who brought Zuma to power. As this strike goes on, the same people are potentially talking about getting Zuma out. &quot;Zuma has wanted to please everybody but in this kind of situation you can&apos;t please everybody. If he chooses one side then he loses the other. The strike could be a tipping point.&quot; Cosatu, which says it has 2m members, has warned of a &quot;total shutdown&quot; of the South African economy next week if the government does not meet its demand for an 8.6% wage rise and 1,000 rand (\u00a388) monthly housing allowance. Cosatu said it had filed seven-day strike notices for members to join the state workers in a stoppage that would then hit mining and manufacturing. Police and army medics could also join in, bringing the country to a standstill. In a major show of strength today, thousands of workers marched through cities waving placards, wearing union T-shirts and singing apartheid-era protest songs. The strike by about 1.3 million state employees is now in its eighth day and has shut schools and crippled hospitals. Frustration with government was palpable in a country where half of young black men are unemployed. In Johannesburg workers danced, blew vuvuzelas, sang anti-Zuma songs and chanted: &quot;We are going, we are going to Luthuli House [the ANC headquarters].&quot; In Bloemfontein, thousands marched peacefully through the streets, carrying banners such as: &quot;We behaved during the World Cup. Now reward us with 8.6%.&quot; The strike has divided South Africans because of its human costs. Nomvula Mokonyane, the premier of Gauteng province, said at least 53 premature babies were left unattended at various hospitals when nursing staff left their posts. Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, the health minister, who worked an all-night hospital shift, said he saw nurses receiving threatening phone calls for continuing to work. The National Aids Council expressed fears about the effects on HIV-positive people, saying it had received reports of patients struggling to get access to medicine. The Health Professions Council of South Africa condemned &quot;shocking effects&quot; on patient welfare. Marella O&apos;Reilly, its acting registrar and chief executive, said: &quot;The dismal picture portrayed in our public hospitals as a result of the strike is one of disgrace, embarrassment and failure.&quot; The South African army has sent doctors and other personnel to help at 47 hospitals across the country. But the SA National Defence Union is now considering a stoppage in solidarity with public servants. The police union has also said its members will down tools on Saturday. But police management obtained a court order barring police from striking and said officers who joined the protests could be fired. There have been reports of teachers being abused for crossing school picket lines, and even some children suffering intimidation. Exams have been postponed in some provinces. Steven Friedman, director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy, said the unions were disappointed with Zuma. &quot;The strike illustrates that, from the perspective of the trade unions, the government they are dealing with now is exactly the same as before Zuma was elected. The Zuma presidency was held up to Cosatu as more pro-labour. But it hasn&apos;t been and it will be interesting to see how union leaders react. &quot;Will the unions campaign against Zuma in two years&apos; time? There are two questions. Do they have the votes to do it? Probably not. And who would they put in his place? There is no obvious candidate.&quot; Friedman also ruled out a split between the ANC and Cosatu. &quot;There&apos;s not much incentive on either side to pull the alliance apart. I guess that the ANC and Cosatu have had their honeymoon and now this is the death knell. There will be a more adversarial relationship, but that&apos;s nothing new.&quot;", "tags": ["Jacob Zuma", "ANC (African National Congress)", "South Africa", "World news", "Protest", "Africa"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-26T16:45:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/30/china-dior-fashion-ad-campaign", "sentences": ["Given the history of Orientalism in western sartorial practice, is it any surprise that Christian Dior&apos;s latest ad campaign, &quot;Shanghai Dreamers&quot; shot by Chinese artist, Quentin Shih, features a series of photos where a strikingly-styled white model clad in Dior couture towers over rows of digitally reproduced Chinese women and men dressed in cultural revolution drag?", "In considering Asian consumers, it would be wise to have fewer fashion moments like Karl Lagerfield&apos;s admission last December: &quot;I haven&apos;t left the hotel since I arrived in Shanghai, not that there is much of it left over,&quot; made before debuting a short video he directed, in which a fictionalised Coco Chanel visits the Shanghai of her dreams.", "The mainstream media needs to put pressure on Dior to apologise for its embarrassing Shanghai Dreamers campaign.", "Rather, Dior and Galliano should know better than to commission these photographs for their Shanghai storefront, should have sent Chinese models for Shih to shoot, and should understand that the modern Chinese Dior customer will not recognise herself or himself in these photographs."], "title": "Chinese people as identical Maoist robots?

And no, your eyes have not deceived you \u2013 the Chinese people in the background literally all look the same. Of course, fashion has always blithely forged ahead with little concern for blatant cultural appropriation (see: the past 20 years of Galliano&apos;s fashion career) or cultural appropriateness (see: images of colonial and imperialist splendour in the return of plantation chic and harem chic.) But can and should they continue to get away with it? Earlier this month, China&apos;s economy surpassed that of Japan&apos;s to become the second largest in the world. LVMH, the company that owns Dior and Louis Vuitton, among other brands, and the world&apos;s largest maker of luxury goods, recently reported a 53% rise in half-year profits, with a 21% sales gain in the Asian markets.

It is precisely nothing more than a dream, because in what other reality could 1960s Chinese labour camp workers possibly be played by Danish supermodel Freja Beha and Lagerfeld&apos;s French muse Baptiste Giabiconi? In one scene, Lara Stone as Coco Chanel informs the two actors that &quot;the Chinese invented quilting&quot;, followed by one of the Chinese labourers lamenting: &quot;I much prefer to have blue jeans.&quot; The message couldn&apos;t be clearer \u2013 the Chinese are ignorant of their own history, desire to imitate the west, and need a cultured European to educate them. My reading of the Chanel film might seem hyperbolic until you take stock of the similarities between images in fashion portraying China and Chinese people as inscrutable, ignorant, backward, jejune, and robotic, and the rhetoric employed by pundits who are predicting the Chinese do not know how to handle their growth and will inevitably crash and burn if they don&apos;t change course. The west is both transfixed and utterly horrified by China&apos;s rapid development, and the fashion world, as much as it would like to see itself as the final frontier for nonconformity, is no different. Whatever you think of China&apos;s human rights record, economic policies, politics, culture, or social conditions, old-school racism just can&apos;t fly. The mainstream media needs to put pressure on Dior to apologise for its embarrassing Shanghai Dreamers campaign. But they have been silent, with the exception of Art Info, who focused most of their critique on the photographer, Quentin Shih. Shih, a native Chinese artist, born in 1975, has gone on the record to say that the ad campaign was entirely his idea and that he meant no he meant no offence. Rather, Dior and Galliano should know better than to commission these photographs for their Shanghai storefront, should have sent Chinese models for Shih to shoot, and should understand that the modern Chinese Dior customer will not recognise herself or himself in these photographs. If fantasy is part of the appeal of fashion, then wouldn&apos;t it be worthwhile for Dior, Chanel, and other couture houses to figure out how Chinese people fantasise and see themselves? Surely, the vision does not include wearing a Mao suit, carrying a migrant&apos;s work bag, and dressing exactly like everyone else. Just as with their economy, which they have lately proved themselves as competent as any other nation at managing, it&apos;s possible that Chinese consumers have more nous than the likes of Dior give them credit for.", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "Race issues", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-30T14:05:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/aug/31/china-tibet-ballet-wyer", "sentences": ["Pete Wyer&apos;s The Far Shore was created for the Shanghai Expo and was to be premiered next week as the highlight of the event&apos;s &quot;UK National Day&quot;.", "The organisations&apos; joint statement said: &quot;[We] very much regret that The Far Shore, a cultural collaboration between English National Ballet and Shanghai Ballet, has become a political vehicle.", "The British Council is a non-political organisation that runs a range of cultural relations programmes in China to build and strengthen long-term cultural, academic and economic ties between the two countries.&quot; The ENB and Shanghai Ballet will instead perform a new work, The Weight of Love, to Stravinsky&apos;s The Rite of Spring."], "title": "British ballet dedicated to people of Tibet is pulled from China expo", "article": "A British composer says he is &quot;deeply disappointed and dismayed&quot; by the British Council&apos;s decision to cancel a performance of his ballet in China because it was dedicated to the people of Tibet.

China experts said they appeared to be pre-empting complaints from the Chinese government, which is highly sensitive to criticism of its rule in Tibet. Wyer wrote on the score that the piece was loosely inspired by the folk tale which inspired Tchaikovsky&apos;s Swan Lake, adding: &quot;It is a story of truth triumphing over deception and darker forces.

The dedication was a small personal gesture and nothing to do with politics. It is standard artistic practice for a composer or artist to dedicate their work to whoever or whatever they like. In this case I dedicated the work to the Tibetan people and their culture \u2013 a culture that is appreciated by many Chinese people in China, too.&quot; He added: &quot;I am an artist, and not an activist. But like many artists, I am concerned about serious issues and causes, and express that through my music.&quot; Wyer said he had long been interested in Buddhism and in Tibetan and Chinese religious culture, developing his interest in Tibet after attending one of the Dalai Lama&apos;s teaching sessions and meeting a nun imprisoned for shouting out her support for the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. He is currently writing an opera inspired by her; an aria from the work was previewed at the Royal Opera House in May. Professor Robert Barnett, an expert on Tibet at Columbia University, described the decision to axe the ballet as &quot;a special feature of the way people handle Chinese diplomacy \u2013 a pre-emptive tribute where you make concessions before they are asked, in case they are asked \u2026 we don&apos;t see that with other powers.&quot; He said that Chinese diplomats understood that different countries had different values, adding: &quot;Presumably the correct thing is to go to China and say &apos;We are very sorry if this upsets you. We didn&apos;t know it was going to happen but we are not able to do anything about it because British values are that we can&apos;t affect the private views of an artist.&apos;&quot; It is understood the Chinese authorities had no knowledge of the dedication. Mark Pritchard MP, vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on China and secretary of the APPG for Tibet, argued that Chinese leaders&apos; &quot;habitual over-sensitivity on freedom of speech&quot; had led to the cancellation. &quot;It appears the Chinese authorities have, in effect, forced the British Council to cancel this impressive ballet over what were clearly personal remarks,&quot; he said. Wyer said he hoped the ballet will be performed elsewhere. ENB, which owns the choreography rights, declined to comment.

Imperial, which was invited to set up the partnership by Singapore&apos;s government, will benefit financially from sharing expertise and the college hopes the partnership will lead to long-term benefits. The college aims to tap into &quot;generous research funding&quot; available in the Asian city-state, Prof Partridge said. &quot;I don&apos;t think anybody knows the exact bottom line, but I can categorically say that Imperial is not going to do this in any way at a loss.&quot; International students are a significant source of revenue for British universities, and increasing numbers want to study here. Overseas applications rose from just over 55,000 last year to over 71,000 this February. At present the proportion of overseas medical students at UK schools is capped at 7.5%. A foreign medical student who starts at Imperial this autumn can expect to pay \u00a326,250 a year. Other top British universities which have expanded abroad include Nottingham, which has a campus in Malaysia, while Liverpool has set up a partnership with a Chinese university in Suzhou, near Shanghai. The new medical school will admit its first 50 students in 2013. A British student who trained at the Singapore school would have no automatic right to practise in the NHS, as it is outside the EU. However, the college hopes to set up student exchanges between the UK and Singapore. Sir Keith O&apos;Nions , rector of Imperial College London, said: &quot;We are extremely proud to be working with Singapore, a country we have long admired for its support and application of world-class science, engineering and medicine. &quot;We have many members of the Imperial family already in Singapore \u2014 the country is home to nearly 2,000 of our alumni.&quot; Paul Madden, British High Commissioner for Singapore, said the partnership was a further example of the &quot;deep linkages&quot; between Britain and Singapore in science, culture and trade. Imperial&apos;s school of medicine, formed in 1997, is one of the largest in the UK. Over 2,000 undergraduates and 500 postgraduates studied there in the last academic year.", "tags": ["Imperial College London", "Medicine", "Singapore", "Higher education", "Education", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-01T10:14:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/01/the-northerner-bridlington-formby-north-west-business", "sentences": ["Intrigued by this, I invented an expat called Bill Berry (after my favourite Northern fruit) and added him to the map, in Shanghai."], "title": "The Northerner: Why every day is a good news day in Bridlington", "article": "White rabbits. Welcome to September. Another month gone, autumn&apos;s nip is in the air. What better way to keep summery cheerfulness alive than to bathe in the warmth of the Bridlington Free Press&apos;s &quot;good news&quot; page, an online concentration of all the uplifting stories published by the paper during the week. Given the gloom of most journalism, the headlines read like a startling parody: Bridlington is one of the best places in the world, Nursery is outstanding, Hospital brightened up, Golden couple celebrate, Sponsored night trek is a huge success. Even the Guardian figures: our travel blogger Tony Naylor&apos;s discovery of the fabulous snack caravan at Bempton Cliffs is up there with the rest of the bliss. Alright, too much cheeriness can be yawn-inducing, or even worsen the mood of those already prone to gloom. But at least English doesn&apos;t have an exact equivalent of the German term schadenfreude \u2013 deriving enjoyment from the misery of others \u2013 although something similar perhaps influences the selection of media stories outside the delightful world of the BFP. ******* Not in Formby, mind you. The local Formby Times has found a contemporary way of using the net for traditional community-strengthening via its Open Mic section. This serves the simple purpose of showcasing local singers and bands, of whom there are impressive numbers. I have cloth ears and no wish or reason to engage musicians of any sort, but I much recommend Open Mic for enjoyable reading, quite apart from its main purpose. Arts criticism has always baffled me, but it often has a curious vigour. Take this example, about two songs from Open Mic&apos;s girl trio Stealing Sheep: &quot;If &apos;With a wand&apos; is a strawberry \u2014 lush, cheery and sweet, then &apos;What if the lights went out&apos; is more of an avocado, soft, lovely but unfamiliar.&quot; Mmm. And there&apos;s more. &quot;Whilst it retains the same beauty and innocence of the first EP, a new distinctive, refined sound has developed, as wisdom and love collide.&quot; ******* Trying to track the reality of the northern economy is a challenging task, with misery merchants and over-optimists waging an endless war. I find that a good guide, at least west of the Pennines, is North West Business Insider, which someone obligingly emails to me several times a week. Today&apos;s has just landed, and a swift scan through its stories shows how the picture is neither black nor white, but grey. A warning that take-up of office space in Manchester was down 28% during the second quarter of 2010 is balanced by property companies&apos; conclusions that &quot;demand remains strong for industrial lettings in established locations&quot;. Two other developments add interest. At a time when every day brings another story about a pub closing, the Preston-based firm Amber Taverns has secured \u00a36.25m credit from Lloyds TSB to buy 60 failing pubs over the next four years. Last year, Amber bought 23 pubs from the bankruptcy administrators of a Liverpool chain, saving 100 jobs. Secondly, Business Insider reports on a bright suggestion from Somerset county council that it could twin up with Cumbria and Suffolk in a Local Enterprise Partnership based on shared dependency on the nuclear industry. The word &quot;local&quot; seems at odds with such long-distance links, but Somerset argues that the nuclear &quot;theme&quot; creates a sort of virtual neighbourliness which would qualify for the government-supported status. Insider sadly understands, however, that &quot;Cumbria thinks Somerset is too far away&quot; \u2013 an unenterprising attitude more commonly held by the south about the north. ******* Did you know that there was a website called Big Cat Monitors? Don&apos;t go there if you are at work, because you&apos;ll spend all day doing little else. It&apos;s particularly popular in Derbyshire, according to the Matlock Mercury, which reports the latest in a long list of vast feline sightings in or around the Peak District. &quot;Shocked cyclist&quot; Adam Gladwin, 28, described a &quot;huge animal crossing the road in front of his bike&quot; that almost stopped him from pedalling to work at 5am. He tells the Mercury: &quot;I was unsure whether to keep going. I called in to the paper shop and told them what I&apos;d seen and they said there had been other sightings in the area. I&apos;ve also heard that the creature has been going in the bins at DFS.&quot; A sofa-eating cat! Whatever next? Or does he mean that the animal was relieving itself? Given the possible resemblance of a DFS bin to a very large litter-tray, that raises all sorts of possibilities for Big Cat Monitor. Watch that space (but not when at work). ******* The Blyth and Ashington News Post Leader has always been favourite of mine, because of its apparent inability to decide on a simple name. This week I discovered its excellent Where in the World? section, another clever and interesting use of the web by a local paper. In previous Northerners I&apos;ve highlighted similar features, which essentially invite expat readers to explain why they didn&apos;t stay loyal and local, describe where they&apos;ve gone and generally keep in touch. I remember a man from Huddersfield who told the Examiner there how he was helping to build an enormous tunnel in Hong Kong, just as his forbears bored beneath the Pennines for their trains and canal barges. But the News Post Leader has a truly exceptional range of colours and symbols to choose for the &quot;pin&quot; which shows where you are on a map of the world. Most participants have gone for red, with a sizeable minority favouring the mini-sunflower alternative, but in all there are 31 options, one of them called &quot;mold&quot;. Intrigued by this, I invented an expat called Bill Berry (after my favourite Northern fruit) and added him to the map, in Shanghai. Something went wrong with the co-ordinates and he ended up in the North Sea, just off Blyth, but I can report that &quot;mold&quot; is a rather tasteful shade of bluey-green. The map is also rather sweet in the definition its users seem to have of expat. One of the little pins is in Bedlington, just a few miles away, and another in Blyth itself. But she moved from Ashington, where Blyth is considered as remote as the moon. Martin Wainwright recommends Plan ahead for this year&apos;s Heritage Open Days, which allow access to an amazing variety of usually closed, secret or otherwise hidden sites on September 9 \u2013 12. My own city, Leeds, has more than anywhere else in the UK \u2013 yo! \u2013 but you&apos;ll undoubtedly find something curious and worthwhile near you. If you&apos;re anywhere near the Lakes this weekend, head for Windermere to watch an estimated 9,000 participants leap into its chilly waters in the Great North Swim, as the nation unites against obesity.(NOTE: This event has since been cancelled. See comments below) And finally\u2026 I should have given you an actual example of Bridlington&apos;s good news, so here is one: the local town crier Michael Wood came second in his profession&apos;s national championships. His cry includes the excellent passage: &quot;Pensioners, enjoy a daytime donkey ride, or maybe a midnight skinny dip, in Bridlington Bay: Acapulco of the North East! God bless Yorkshire. God save the Queen.&quot; He tells the Free Press: &quot;I actually had a group of Americans in the crowd tell me that they were wondering where they should visit next and now they knew.&quot; Spot on.", "tags": ["UK news", "Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-01T11:15:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/sep/01/apple-press-conference-live", "sentences": ["Update on new retail stores first off: Paris, Shanghai and London."], "title": "Apple press conference \u2013 live coverage", "article": "     Ping! Steve Jobs does his thing.  Photograph: Robert Galbraith/Reuters    7.16pm: Looks like we&apos;re all wrapped up here. Let&apos;s have a run through of what Apple has announced today: \u2022 Ping, a social network for music, is built inside iTunes. Available on iTunes 10 desktop app and iOS apps, users can follow their favourite artists and other &apos;Pingers&apos;, view their stream and converse around music. Available immediately. \u2022 AppleTV cut in physical stature and price, to $99. Available later this month, AppleTV will no longer store your media \u2013 it will be based on renting content and streaming media from connected devices. Fox and ABC are on board from launch with more to be announced in the future; renting a HD TV show will set you back 99 cents, $4.99 for a first-run HD movie. \u2022 A whole new range of iPods, including an iPod Touch with front and rear-facing cameras and FaceTime. The rear-facing camera will be be able to record HD video content. \u2022 iOS4.1 available from next week for iPhone and iPod Touch, including a new Games Centre and many a bug fix. Thanks for joining us, keep the discussion flowing.  7.13pm: Martin takes to the piano for a closing rendition of Yellow. His little girl&apos;s called Apple, remember. All clicking into place now.  7.10pm: Jobs: &quot;We started doing music stuff for a really simple reason: we love music. And even though we&apos;re more successful now than when we started, that hasn&apos;t changed one bit.&quot; Jobs introduces Coldplay&apos;s Chris Martin (!!!!) on stage to perform, Mr Johnson has been royally ditched by the polo-necked one.  7.08pm: &quot;Strongest line-up of iPods ever,&quot; Jobs sums. &quot;Ping is going to be really popular, very fast, because 160m people can turn on as soon as they want, starting today.&quot;  7.06pm: Price of AppleTV was $299 \u2013 users said they wanted something more affordable, now lowered to $99. Available later this month, pre-order today.  7.02pm: Jobs now giving a whistlestop tour through the new AppleTV interface.  On &quot;AirPlay&quot;, coming in November with iOS4.2: can stream content from an iOS device to an AppleTV.  6.58pm: Rotten Tomatoes review site also integrated with AppleTV. Can also stream music, photos and video from own computer via the AppleTV box set.  6.56pm: ABC and Fox on-board from launch, other broadcasters should follow, Jobs hopes. You can also stream Netflix and YouTube content through your AppleTV.  6.55pm: Here&apos;s the news on AppleTV content: $4.99 to rent first-run HD movies, day and date they come out on DVD. Get cheaper as time goes on. To rent HD TV shows: 99 cents.  6.52pm: AppleTV customers also don&apos;t want to manage storage, Jobs says, or syncing to their computer.  So here&apos;s the announcement on 2ndGen AppleTV: One-fourth the size of previous iteration, palm-sized, HDMI connector, wifi and ethernet connector. All HD when available, all rentals (no purchases) \u2013 that&apos;s the new model. No storage because of rentals.  6.50pm: &quot;One more thing...&quot; time: AppleTV. Introduced four years ago, &quot;never been a huge hit, nor has any other competitive product.&quot; But the people who have them love them, Jobs says. So what&apos;s new to AppleTV? They want HD, they want Hollywood movies and TV shows, they want to pay lower prices for content, they don&apos;t want a computer on their TV.  6.47pm: All activity based around artists and performance can be seen by your followers, whom you can automatically accept as followers or moderate case-by-case. Ping is also available on iPhone, iPod Touch (there&apos;s a new button in middle of iTunes app). &quot;Social network for music, created by Apple, built into iTunes.&quot; And it&apos;s available today...  6.46pm: Ping has an interface very similar to Facebook&apos;s, with the lingo of Twitter. But all is based around music artists.  6.44pm: &quot;Be as private or as public as you want. The privacy is super easy to set up,&quot; says Jobs. Over 17,000 concert listings; Ping is available for sign-up to more than 160m iTunes users.  6.41pm: To reiterate, Apple has launched a social network for music, dubbed Ping. You can &quot;follow&quot; updates from your favourite artists. &quot;Social music discovery,&quot; says Jobs. &quot;Follow and be followed&quot; \u2013 you (seemingly) opt-in to being followed by other people and &quot;set up a circle of friends.&quot;  6.39pm: Announces iTunes 10: a new logo (ditched the CD), &quot;more elegant and simple&quot;. The iTunes store&apos;s biggest focus is discovery: what are my friends listening to? Favourite artists up to? Concerts? Email? There must be a better way. Ping \u2013 social network for music. &quot;Facebook and Twitter for music&quot; \u2013 social network all about music built into iTunes.  6.37pm: Here&apos;s the iTunes news: people downloaded 11.7bn songs from iTunes, over 4.3m TV episode, 100m movies, 35m books, and over 160m accounts with credit cards and one-click shopping.  6.35pm: So a new array of iPods so far. Has Jobs got anything else up his sleeve? (Currently running through the new iPod adverts).  6.33pm: Edit videos on the iPod Touch with iMovie app. Can make FaceTime calls between iPhone 4s and new iPod Touch. 8GB for $229, 32GB for 299, 64GB for $399.

And a rear camera with HD video recorder.  6.30pm: 8GB iPod Nano for $149. iPod Touch news: most popular iPod, as of the past 12 months. Number one portable game player in the world. Outsells Nintendo and Sony portable game players combined, 50%+ market share in US and worldwide.  6.26pm: Rotatable screen on the new iPod Nano, introduced to a solitary &quot;whoo!&quot; from the California crowd. That went better in rehearsal, clearly.  6.25pm: Almost half as small, almost half as light as its fifth generation predecessor \u2013 the new iPod Nano with 24hour battery life.  6.23pm: Fifteen hours of music on the 5thGen Shuffle: $49, available in five different colours. On the Nano 6thGen: smaller, no clip wheel, touchscreen, &quot;multi-touch&quot; screen.  6.21pm: Bringing back the buttons to iPod Shuffle 4thGen, even smaller than 2ndGen: has voiceover and playlists, too. And a clip, importantly.  6.19pm: Here&apos;s the biggie: iPods. How many sold? 275m. Secret to its success: never rested on our laurels, says Jobs. &quot;This year we&apos;ve gone wild.&quot; New design for every single model of iPod. &quot;Biggest change in iPod lineup ever&quot;.  6.19pm: iOS4.2 comes out in November, free update for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.  6.17pm: Jobs demo&apos;s printing: looks very smooth. Bit of a biggie: AirPlay is AirTunes, allowing you to stream audio and video over wifi devices.  6.15pm: Next week iOS4.1 will be available. Sneak peek at 4.2 (which will come later this year for iPad). Multitasking, folders, games centre, wireless printing, &quot;AirPlay&quot;.  6.14pm: New game out later this year from Epic Games. Invites on stage the president, Mike Capps to introduce. MC: codename for this new game is Project Sword, social integration. &quot;Project Sword is a gorgeous action packed RPG adventure. Everything you see is in realtime.&quot;  6.09pm: Games centre new and built in with iOS 4.1: APIs for developers. &quot;All about multiplayer games,&quot; challenge friends, compare scores, discover new games. Apple moves into mobile social gaming.  6.08pm: 250,000 apps on App Store, 25,000 iPad apps. First big(ish) announcement: iOS 4.1 to include: Proximity sensor bugs fix, bluetooth bugs fix. Adds high dynamic range photos, HD video upload over wifi, TV show rentals and a game centre.  6.06pm: New iOS activations per day: 230,000 per day (new activations). If we counted upgrades (hints at Android) that would be a lot higher. Over 6.5bn apps in App Store. 200 apps downloaded every second.  6.05pm: How many iOS devices shipped? 120m since launch.  6.05pm: iOS news: &quot;a revolution in touch and apps,&quot; says Jobs.  6.04pm: Over a million people are visiting in some stores around the world.  6.04pm: Really cool stuff to show us, says Jobs. Update on new retail stores first off: Paris, Shanghai and London. London store update: &quot;beautiful, restored old building. Lot of restoration required.&quot; Not so much a retail update then, Steve. Covent Garden was the 300th Apple store in the world, in 10 countries. Soon to open first store in Spain.  6.00pm: Jack Johnson fades to mute and we begin. Steve Jobs enters stage right to whoops and hollers.  5.58pm: &quot;Switch your phones to silent, please,&quot; asks a mystery voice from behind the black curtain. On the projector comes the scene from California, lots of happy-looking folk sharing jokes and listening to Jack Johnson.  5.54pm: 99-cent rentals of movies through iTunes? According to &quot;people familiar with the matter&quot; cited by Wall Street Journal. Fox and ABC are said to be the companies on board:  &quot;Some of these people said Fox agreed to participate in 99-cent rentals for a short period of time, and agreed to the lower-cost price only for broadcast shows it both produces and airs, such as &quot;Glee,&quot; &quot;Bones&quot; and &quot;Lie to Me.&quot; The Apple proposal won&apos;t affect cable shows such as FX&apos;s &quot;Justified,&quot; or Fox network shows, including &quot;American Idol,&quot; for which Fox doesn&apos;t control the digital rights. &quot;According to the people familiar with the matter, part of the calculus for Fox is that News Corp. wants Apple&apos;s help with other digital projects, including the iPad version of The Wall Street Journal and a digital news offering known inside News Corp. as the &quot;Daily Planet,&quot; the name of the fictional paper in Superman comics.&quot;  Five minutes to go...  5.49pm: Would you believe it? Sony has moved to trump the Cupertino company&apos;s announcement(s) from its temporary hovel at Berlin&apos;s IFA fair. Sony will offer a cloud-based media streaming service on Playstation 3s, Bravia TVs, Blu-Ray players and Sony&apos;s personal computers. Initially it will stream movies, with music to be added by the end of this year, reports the BBC. Any more before Apple takes the stage in 10 minutes? (In other news: it&apos;s filling up here at the UK press screening in Barbican. Not as many MacBooks as you might expect. Friendly-looking, yellow-shirted staffers saunter round with purple placards, directing media and guests to their seats. Free water and free wifi await. How&apos;s it looking from the comfort of home?)  5.40pm: To cover all bases, The Inquirer is hedging its bets on Apple announcing an update to AppleTV (not before time, I hear you grumble):  &quot;[...] Amazon has made an announcement that would appear to be a spoiler for Jobs&apos; dreams. It will be offering a subscription service that will deliver TV shows and movies over the Internet, which sounds jolly similar to the rumours and speculations we&apos;ve been hearing about Apple&apos;s ITV plans. &quot;The Internet retailer has pitched a web-based subscription service to several major media companies, including NBC Universal, Time Warner, News Corp and Viacom. Amazon&apos;s video content subscription push is a challenge to rivals such as Netflix, Google&apos;s Youtube, and if Jobs announces it, Apple.&quot;   5.36pm: With 20ish minutes until kick off (6pm UK time), speculation is mounting. The Financial Times cites sources inside the media industry when it says Apple will increase the amount of time customers can sample singles in the iTunes store from 30 seconds to 90 seconds. Users will also be able to make purchases direct from web pages, rather than opening the iTunes application, the FT predicts.   Hello and welcome. Web stream or no web stream, sit back and enjoy our minute-by-minute coverage live from (the UK screening of) Apple&apos;s California press conference. Speculation about what Apple could announce ramped up a gear last night, with the company announcing it will *stream* the announcements online \u2013 but only to devices running its own operating systems. Is &quot;social streaming&quot; now almost certain to be visited on iTunes? Here&apos;s our own Charles Arthur:  &quot;This looks very likely, given Apple&apos;s $85m purchase last year of Lala.com, which it closed in May. Why purchase it to close it? Lala would stream music to users&apos; PCs, for a price. And for years people have been talking about the likelihood of iPods getting streaming, or some sort of Napster-style subscription service. But while selling iPods was a good business, subscriptions weren&apos;t (witnessed by the failure of so many companies that tried to offer it). &quot;It&apos;s only now, as those other streaming services have started to make it into a viable business - one enabled by apps on phones and computers - that Apple seems interested. After all, at present the money paid to those services goes to Spotify or we7; why, you can see the Apple execs reasoning, shouldn&apos;t Apple get a slice?&quot;  Apple could also announce a price cut to AppleTV \u2013 Steve Jobs&apos;s &quot;hobby&quot; \u2013 which has underwhelmed the market since launch.  The Financial Times predicts an update to iTunes will allow 90-second streaming of singles in the iTunes store, as opposed to the 30-second clips it currently allows.     The invite to Apple's September press conference. Music, perhaps?    Gizmodo pontificates about the possible launch of an iPod Touch with front-facing and rear-facing cameras, saying such a device would be a &quot;ninja assassin squad against a whole range of other middling gadgets&quot;.

He was also highly regarded internationally for haunting stop-motion animations, such as Dojoji Temple (1976) and House of Flame (1979), in which the figures are manipulated and photographed frame-by-frame so that they appear to move on their own. Like his one-time collaborator Tadanari Okamoto, with whom he toured his independent films from 1972 to 1980, his exercises in stop-motion puppetry were influenced by European practices. But Kawamoto&apos;s ornate works are also deeply rooted in Japanese folklore and aesthetics, with an overarching philosophy based on Buddhism. They are a powerful reminder of the more artisanal traditions within Japanese animation that are often ignored by western commentators&apos; focus on commercial anime. Kawamoto completed a total of 10 short works and the features Rennyo and His Mother (1981) and A Book of a Dead Person (2005), as well as overseeing the 2003 omnibus Winter Days, which brought together 35 of the world&apos;s leading independent animators, including Yuri Norstein, Alexandre Petrov, Bretislav Pojar and Koji Yamamura, to visually interpret a verse by the haiku poet Matsuo Basho.     Briar-Rose or The Sleeping Beauty (1990), a dark fantasy with Freudian undercurrents, directed by Kihachiro Kawamoto    Most of Kawamoto&apos;s animations used puppets that he created. The Demon (1973), about a terrifying encounter deep in the forest, adheres closely to the pared-down presentational style typified by bunraku puppet theatre, with its plain black backdrops and minimalist designs. House of Flame (1979), based on a Noh drama, is a stunning tale of a ghostly maiden confined within the purgatory of her earthly desires. He also experimented with collage techniques in films such as The Trip (1973), a surreal rendition of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Prague, drawing on Buddhist concepts of suffering. In 1988, he made To Shoot Without Shooting, a co-production with Shanghai Animation Film Studio, in which an ambitious Chinese archer&apos;s quest for perfection presents an allegory for the nuclear arms race. Born in Tokyo, Kawamoto became entranced by puppets as a youngster after being shown how to make them by his grandmother. He made figurines of popular stars of the day and staged them in dramatic tableaux. Despite being an avid movie fan, he originally had no plans to make a career out of his hobby. He was drafted after graduating in architecture from Yokohama National University in 1944, although he remained stationed in Japan for the remainder of the second world war. In 1946, after an introduction from an old school friend, he entered Toho film studios as an assistant in the art department, but lost his job in 1950 after a series of labour disputes rocked the company. Kawamoto supported himself until 1953 by making dolls of popular western movie stars, which were photographed for the magazine Asahi Graph. This brought him to the attention of Tadasu Iizawa, a playwright and journalist who enlisted Kawamoto to provide the puppets for a series of photo storybooks for children, several of which were issued in English-language editions. &quot;Even though these were really dolls, I call them puppets because they were actors within the books,&quot; Kawamoto said. Under the mentorship of the veteran animator Tadahito Mochinaga, Kawamoto and Iizawa produced Japan&apos;s first stop-motion works with a series of television commercials and the critically lauded Beer, Those Were the Days\u2026, a 12-minute colour promotional film for Asahi Breweries that was shown in cinemas in 1956. During this time, Iizawa introduced Kawamoto to the film The Emperor&apos;s Nightingale (1949), made by the Czech animator Jir\u00ed Trnka. Kawamoto was impressed by the way Trnka &quot;was able to tell a story in a poetic style through the use of puppets&quot;. While it kept him gainfully employed, Kawamoto soon became disillusioned with advertising work and creating puppets for children&apos;s television. He took the bold step of writing to Trnka out of the blue, inquiring about the possibility of studying at his studios in Prague to come closer to his ambition of creating more personal animations. Kawamoto was invited to spend a year at Trnka&apos;s studios in 1963. Several years after returning to Japan he completed the short film The Breaking of Branches Is Forbidden (1968). Kawamoto later revisited Trnka Studios to make Briar-Rose or The Sleeping Beauty (1990), a dark fantasy with Freudian undercurrents set in a fairytale world of castles and exuberant medieval pageants. The film evoked Trnka&apos;s works as well as the magical tales of the Brothers Grimm. In 2005, after the completion of A Book of a Dead Person, Kawamoto was honoured with a retrospective of his work at the Karlovy Vary film festival A number of other high-profile international retrospectives have been held, including a British touring programme in 2008, which I organised. I had met Kawamoto in 2004, in the makeshift studio space donated by Tama Art University for the production of A Book of a Dead Person, on which he was then working with the university&apos;s students. I was struck by his intellectual sharpness, his generosity and the general air of tranquillity with which he went about his work.

The report predicts that 8.65m electric vehicles and 9.23m plug-in and hybrid electric vehicles will be sold globally in 2020, up from around 5,000 and 657,000 respectively in 2009. When fuel-efficiency measures and switches to lower-carbon transport such as trains and coaches are included, the report for investors predicts that the market will be worth $677bn (\u00a3440bn) a year in 2020 \u2013 up from $113m in 2009. In contrast, HSBC predicts smaller growth in the renewable energy sector, from $203bn in 2009 to $544bn in 2020. Nick Robins, head of the HSBC Climate Change Centre of Excellence and lead author of the report, said the predicted rise of the transport sector stems from growing confidence in the area over the past year as major manufacturers launched low-carbon cars. But he acknowledged that it has been a difficult year for the low-carbon economy, with growing signs of what he terms &quot;carbon default&quot;, such as the US failure to deliver a clean energy bill; Australia&apos;s move away from climate change laws; and the economic crisis squeezing green spending. &quot;It is not unmitigated gloom,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is more disaggregated than last year.&quot; The US failure has been quite damaging to sentiment among investors around the world, he added. Angus McCrone, chief editor at Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) said: &quot;There is a dichotomy between what is happening on the public front and behind that.&quot;. Clean energy shares, as tracked by the WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index, has under-performed the US stock-market overall \u2013 as measured by the Standard and Poor&apos;s 500 index \u2013 by 20% so far this year, he points out. But he also notes that BNEF predicts 2010 will be a record year for cleantech investment at between $180-200bn, a little higher than 2008&apos;s $173bn total. He also said that microgeneration \u2013 for example domestic solar panels \u2013 is &quot;taking off on all sorts of places, including the UK&quot;. The HSBC report predicts the overall low-carbon energy market \u2013 both generation and use \u2013 will triple to $2.2tn in 2020, under its most likely scenario, but suggest it could be as low as $1.5tn if governments renege on existing climate change and energy commitments or as high as $2.7 trillion if current commitments are exceeded. The report argues that the European Union will remain the largest market but will lose market share from 33% now to 27% in 2020, while China will gain market share, from 17% to 24%, pushing the US into third place. Officials in Shanghai yesterday underlined China&apos;s ambitions in green technology, announcing that they would invest $2.8bn in electric vehicles and charging networks by 2012. China has recently overtaken the US as the world&apos;s biggest energy user, become the largest single investor in green energy in the G20 group and has been the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases for several years. The HSBC report predicts, unlike some other analysts, that the EU will meet its target of 20% renewable energy by 2020 but will fail to meet its 20% increase in energy efficiency by the same date. It plays down the promise of biofuels, suggesting a market of $93bn by 2020, because of concerns over their sustainability. But McCrone says that after two to three years of decline the biofuels market has bottomed out and that the remaining companies can take confidence from the mandated targets for biofuel use in the EU. Finally, the amount of upfront capital required in the green economy will more than triple to $1.5tn a year in 2020, according to HSBC. This may look large, said Robins, but not compared to the sums already needed to invest in energy. For example, the International Energy Agency predicted in 2009 that investment of $1.1trn a year (PDF) was needed until 2030 to ensure projected energy demand was met.", "tags": ["Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars", "Motoring", "Travel and transport", "Technology", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Renewable energy", "Energy", "Solar power", "Wind power", "HSBC", "Business", "Guardian sustainable business"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-06T16:10:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/06/andy-murray-defeat-us-open-tennis", "sentences": ["Beijing and Shanghai are next up, by which time the &quot;little niggles&quot; Murray complained about will have cleared, no doubt."], "title": "Andy Murray needs to fix his body after US Open defeat, not his game", "article": "At the risk of sounding like a cheap shrink, there are good reasons to believe that Andy Murray is not the happiest man on Planet Tennis this morning. Defeat in the third round of the US Open at the expert hands of Stanislas Wawrinka, the second best Swiss in tennis, has left him sore, sorry and bewildered. He flew home from New York spiritually and physically shredded, confused as to why the well-muscled legs that normally carry him to every last inch of a tennis court as if he were some sort of human jet had let him down when it mattered most. He called it &quot;pins and needles&quot; but the blade went deeper than that. He was cut to the heart. What worried Murray most was that all the hard work he puts in \u2013 probably more than anyone on the circuit \u2013 and the precise pre-tournament planning he had constructed with his mother, Judy, and part-time coach, Alex Corretja, had not inured him to the A-game of an opponent he had beaten five times in eight matches. The most recent of those was last year at Wimbledon over five sets and, before that, he won in straight sets at this tournament en route to his first grand slam final in 2008. Yesterday, it all went wrong in just under four befuddled hours. Wawrinka, for one, was surprised by Murray&apos;s lethargy in the later stages of the match. He reckoned Murray had a &quot;little bit of an injury&quot;, which is why he chipped and lobbed to such good effect. Significantly, Wawrinka shrugged off his own more obvious problem, a seized-up right quad in the third set, giving Murray the illusion of a way back. There was no comeback, not that the Scot did not fight but, as John McEnroe observed, the struggle was internal. Murray later agreed with that diagnosis. And that is where Murray&apos;s search for solutions resides. There is not much wrong with the essential mechanics of his game, yet a player who could serve in his sleep foot-faulted four times, something seasoned observers could notremember him doing \u2013 ever. The machine clunked badly, and Murray could not work out why. There will be accusations of choking, an absurdity. The man does not have a give-up gene in his body. The fact he has lost in big matches is an obsession with all but the man himself; every player loses. The difference here is he lost to someone he should have beaten, especially given his recent form, and he has been robbed of the opportunity of going very deep into the tournament. It is long forgotten that Roger Federer, who denied him here and in Melbourne, the player generally and rightly regarded as the best the game has ever had, did not win his first major until his 17th slam. This was Murray&apos;s 20th and he is still only 23. To be judged alongside legends is tough. Murray will win a major one day because he is too good not to. Yet, even by his own downbeat standards, he left town like someone who had been ejected from his own party with a half-empty bottle of champagne and no cab number. Last year was similar, but it emerged later that he had injured a wrist in losing to Marin Cilic. It was as if he did not want to use even that legitimate excuse for his defeat, and we might yet discover that he was suffering some unseen physical ailment this time. That, in fact, would be his perfect solution. It would mean it was not his tennis that let him down but his body. His body he can fix. His tennis, he will reckon, should not need attending to because he has worked it into a pleasing groove since he was a small boy. He did go on the attack more against Wawrinka than he had done in earlier matches but the strategy brought him mixed results. If he was injured, it would explain why he tried to cut the points short, but that does not totally add up. Wawrinka was hurting more, yet moved more with greater ease, even at the end, when he pulled out a couple of remarkable winners, leaving Murray stranded at the net. Beijing and Shanghai are next up, by which time the &quot;little niggles&quot; Murray complained about will have cleared, no doubt. Then it is the homeward loop to London via Paris to round off a year of hugely contrasting form and mood. It is unlikely he will have picked up a new coach by then, but you never know with Murray. After the match, he was as near to inconsolable as he gets. He was polite but kept it short. Being quizzed about losing was not what he&apos;d had in mind earlier in the day.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "US Open tennis", "Tennis", "Sport", "US Open Tennis 2010"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-06T19:41:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/06/jamie-burnett-shanghai-masters", "sentences": ["Jamie Burnett&apos;s 5\u20132 victory over Tian Pengfei, a Chinese wild card, enabled Scotland&apos;s world No37 to progress through two rounds on the opening day of the Shanghai Masters because Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan, who was awaiting the winner, did not travel to China &quot;for family reasons&quot;.", "In Shanghai Ken Doherty had to win the last three frames for the 5-4 victory which prevented Mohammed Sajjad becoming the first Pakistani to win a main tour match."], "title": "Jamie Burnett progresses at Shanghai Masters by beating Tian Pengfei", "article": "Jamie Burnett&apos;s 5\u20132 victory over Tian Pengfei, a Chinese wild card, enabled Scotland&apos;s world No37 to progress through two rounds on the opening day of the Shanghai Masters because Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan, who was awaiting the winner, did not travel to China &quot;for family reasons&quot;.

Many people seem to be. Even Athol Fugard, in a recent interview with the Guardian, appeared to contrast theatre that aimed to be political and that which aimed to entertain. He argued that writers were increasingly being pressured to write for audiences that only had &quot;attention spans of 10 minutes between adverts&quot;. But do these two elements of politics and entertainment have to be mutually exclusive? Of course not. Isaac Butler of the Parabasis blog makes this point in response to Emma Adams&apos;s blog on this site last week, writing that &quot;the most successful works of political art also function as quality pieces of entertainment (or are very short)&quot;. He goes on to cite a whole range of plays that prove his point \u2013 from Beckett&apos;s Catastrophe and Pinter&apos;s One for the Road to Tony Kushner&apos;s Angels in America \u2013 before adding that he has &quot;recently gotten into mysteries and thrillers in both book and cinema form [because] they seem to be the one area where authors can deliberately insert their own politics and get away with it&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s no reason you can&apos;t give the audience a thrilling ride and some deeper politics at the same time,&quot; he concludes. James Carter on the Full of IT blog has a different take on Fugard&apos;s comments. He disputes the claim that there is a current lack of political work, but asks: &quot;Do political plays become irrelevant when they continually preach to the choir?&quot; Carter recounts that, at a festival of political drama at New York&apos;s Ohio Theatre he attended a few years ago, it was the few shows from a rightwing perspective that provoked the most discussion and debate among the predominantly liberal audiences. While he does not suggest &quot;everyone go out and write plays supporting the Republicans&quot;, he does think that for work to have real value it needs to find a way of genuinely provoking its audience. &quot;If you have a play about the economy, figure a way to do it on the steps of The Federal Reserve or in front of the bull statue on Wall Street,&quot; he writes. &quot;A play about war? Find a way to do it next to an Army recruiting centre ... &quot; Of course, on a more fundamental level, the trouble with talking about &quot;political theatre&quot; is that it implies that there is such a thing as non-political theatre. All art exists within some kind of social context and is therefore intrinsically politicised; a failure to recognise this fact can lead to hypocrisy. Look, for example, at the controversy surrounding Peter Wyer&apos;s new ballet, The Far Shore, which was meant to be performed by the English National Ballet at the Shanghai Expo. Wyer dedicated the piece to &quot;the people of Tibet&quot;, and as a result the British Council have pulled it, saying that it has become &quot;a political vehicle&quot;. This act of censorship is itself highly political, aimed as it is at placating the Chinese government. The trouble is that we tend to think of things as being non-political only because we have imbibed a particular set of values so deeply it does not occur to us to question them. Blogger Chris Goode cites Haskell Wexler to illustrate this:   Suppose a guy says, &quot;I make films where I make the best bucks ... I&apos;m most interested in entertainment and screw all this ideology stuff.&quot; Now you couldn&apos;t find a stronger political statement than that \u2013 yet no one says that&apos;s a political statement. Whereas if I say, &quot;I make films that I feel are positive human statements that enlighten or enlarge man&apos;s view of life and of the earth and of one another,&quot; well, that becomes a political statement. Now that&apos;s because our culture has adapted itself to accept consumerism, to accept the profit motive, to accept the personal selfish attitude as &quot;non-political&quot; ...  Perhaps the best way for a piece of art to be political, then, is for it to interrogate values we take for granted \u2013 whatever those values happen to be.", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-08T15:22:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/sep/09/chinese-commodities-probe", "sentences": ["There is also talk of a probe by the government into possible illegal activity in Shanghai.", "Analysts at Fairfax said:  Commodities [have fallen] in China in response to reports of Chinese investigations into potentially illegal fund activity on the Shanghai market."], "title": "Mining shares shake off fears of Chinese commodities probe", "article": "Metal prices are edging lower, with copper at a one week low, although so far mining shares are holding up reasonably well.

My immediate reaction was: you must be crazy. Cable&apos;s narrow interpretation of quality is an astonishing insult to the thousands of British scientists who help this country (and its ministers) have a well above average reputation and global influence. Cable didn&apos;t mention that most of the 46% he considers less worthy is actually classed (by the independently run Research Assessment Exercise) as internationally or nationally recognised for its &quot;originality, significance, and rigour&quot;. In fact, in 2008 it found that only 2% of UK research &quot;falls below the standard of nationally recognised work&quot;. It is this work that should be cut. If Cable goes further, what will be the impact? The two biggest killers in Britain are heart disease and cancer. If the recognised work was eliminated, that would lead to a 40% cut in research for heart disease and a 28% cut in cancer research. Britain&apos;s ability to tackle the biggest threats to national health would be significantly disabled. Cable acknowledged that investing in science is critical to economic performance. He cited OECD evidence showing that investment in innovative research was crucial for future economic success, and quoted the organisation&apos;s conclusion that cutting back investment in innovation &quot;will damage the foundations of long-term growth&quot;. I couldn&apos;t have put it better myself. And, further, he pointed out that in the face of financial crisis, smart governments \u2013 such as the US and Sweden \u2013 were actually increasing investment in research. But when he says we will &quot;economise&quot;, to &quot;screen out mediocrity&quot;, this is exactly what the research councils do already. The Medical Research council, for example, spent \u00a3704m in 2008/09 on research. In the past year, 1,475 research grant applications were made to the council, but only 279 were funded. The research councils ensure that taxpayers&apos; money is spent only on the best research, with the potentially highest impact on improving human health and welfare. Of course, there is waste in science. In medical research, for example, Iain Chalmers and Paul Glasziou from Oxford have argued that sometimes the wrong questions are asked by scientists, poor experimental designs are used, studies remain unreported, and those that are published are incomplete. But it&apos;s not a matter of cutting research. It&apos;s a matter of improving it. In medicine that means including patients in decisions about what questions to answer, improving the quality of research designs, and ensuring the results of research are fully and freely reported. There is another reason to question Cable&apos;s rationing plan: his impending attack on universities. The university \u2013 the main centre for UK science \u2013 is funded from two sources: the research councils (which distribute \u00a32.8bn annually) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (\u00a37.4bn). This dual funding gives universities stability. In the latest independent rankings of the world&apos;s universities, the UK is second only to the US in the quality of its education and research. This week, Cambridge beat Harvard to first place in one important league table. Yet it is the depth and breadth of our university sector that is extraordinary. The UK had 30 of the 200 best universities in the world. For a small nation of just 62 million people, that is extraordinary: Germany had 12 places, Japan 10 places. Does this success mean that we can safely trim a little fat from our science budget? No. The Shanghai Jiao Tong ranking system, which is especially sensitive to success in the sciences \u2013 reveals that Asia, and especially China, is rapidly catching up with western centres of excellence. Cable pointed out this week that China has increased government funds for science by 25%. Any deceleration in UK investment will inevitably diminish our relative success against a major competitor. Cable says the government&apos;s spending priorities &quot;will help to define what we value as a nation&quot;. One of Britain&apos;s last remaining comparative advantages in the world is its science, and the universities which support that science. It&apos;s hard to believe that intelligent ministers who understand the arguments for science are going to preside over cuts that could not only set UK science back a generation, but also inflict a needless wound on our physical, mental, social and economic health.

According to a recent study by the Zhejiang forestry bureau, the number of boar has risen to 150,000, up from 29,000 at the start of the decade. Local media have been filled with warnings of the impact on crops and other species. Corn yields in the worst affected area are expected to fall by one-third because so many plants have been trampled upon. Neighbouring Jiangxi province reported a similar problem last month and issued 7,200 hunting licenses to cull the boar population. In Zhejiang, this has been difficult because the province borders Shanghai, which is currently hosting the Expo, a high-profile world fair that has prompted a tightening of shotgun controls.", "tags": ["Wildlife", "Farming", "Environment", "Animals", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-13T10:45:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/17/akqa-dentsu-takeover-bid", "sentences": ["The agency now has offices in London, New York, Washington DC, Shanghai, Berlin and Amsterdam and employs more than 800 people."], "title": "Dentsu lines up $600m bid for digital marketing agency AKQA", "article": "AKQA, the global digital agency network founded by Ajaz Ahmed, is understood to be the subject of a $600m (\u00a3383m) bid from Japanese advertising agency giant Dentsu. Dentsu, which is desperate to build its position in Western markets such as the US and UK, is understood to have put in a pre-emptive bid for AKQA which its owners are putting up for sale. General Atlantic, the Connecticut private equity firm, took a majority stake in AKQA in 2007, reportedly for between $200m and $250m. Morgan Stanley, which advised General Atlantic when it bought into AKQA, is in the process of holding meetings with potential buyers. One source with knowledge of the sale process described Dentsu&apos;s bid price as &quot;crazy&quot;, with one report valuing the agency netowrk at about half the sum. It is understood that General Atlantic are in favour of the deal but chairman Ahmed and chief executive Tom Bedecarre, who own about 10%, are not so sure about the tie-up. However a source close to the company played down the move by Dentsu, pointing out that the agency is regularly approached with offers. &quot;There is plenty of inbound [approaches] on an almost weekly basis. That doesn&apos;t in any way indicate a sale,&quot; said the source. The source claimed that the board was steadfastly focused on taking AKQA public in the future through an IPO. Ahmed founded AKQA, which has clients including Nike and McDonald&apos;s, in 1995 in his very early 20s. The agency now has offices in London, New York, Washington DC, Shanghai, Berlin and Amsterdam and employs more than 800 people. Last year Dentsu put in a premium bid of $700m to try to buy Microsoft&apos;s digital agency network Razorfish, the largest in the US by revenue, but still lost out to Publicis Groupe which paid $530m in a deal that also included a media commitment. In January, Dentsu US acquired Innovation Interactive, which includes digital agency 360i. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Developed to challenge old stereotypes of Britain as a nation of fog, bowler hats and Monty Python, the building is composed of thousands of long, clear acrylic rods holding rare seeds sticking out like a hedgehog from a large hollow cube. One MP out here with me at the UK-China Forum for the Future branded it &quot;a cross between a stealth bomber and a disused skate park&quot;. But Chinese visitors love it; it&apos;s become the UK&apos;s busiest tourist attraction anywhere and it&apos;s tripled the number of UK investment deals under discussion in China. Not bad for 25 million quid. Yet the sheer scale of the export challenge faced in the &quot;dandelion&quot; should inspire some new lessons for British economic strategy and our ambitions for &quot;export-led growth&quot;. The pace of change in cities such as Shanghai is simply breathtaking. The Shanghai stock exchange only opened in 1991. But by 2020 it aspires to be one of the world&apos;s top financial centres. Yet the stark reality is that our exports to China \u2013 a market that has grown at 10% a year for 30 years \u2013 may be growing fast but they remain tiny. Exports last year were \u00a35.1bn in value but just over 2% of the UK total. We traded three times more with Ireland. Now, when the Americans think about exports to China, they quickly start an argument over the value of the yuan. Thursday&apos;s splash in the China Daily reports on US Congress hearings investigating whether the yuan is undervalued. In fact Congress may be misguided. If the yuan was revalued, America would simply import its low-cost goods from somewhere else. Europeans, on the other hand, are much more concerned about the myriad of constraints on companies&apos; access to the Chinese market. One businessman here told me that in 20 years he hadn&apos;t heard the European Chamber of Commerce so vexed about the difficulties of doing business. But views are mixed. Many say foreign small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in China are doing well. And in the UK&apos;s principal export opportunity \u2013 financial services \u2013 City of London people, here on the Lord Mayor&apos;s annual visit, reflect that business isn&apos;t getting harder, but it&apos;s not getting easier either. It remains stuck in what one leading regulator described to me as China&apos;s &quot;slow-motion&quot; reform plan. Next year China publishes its next five-year plan ahead of important leadership changes in 2012 and communist politicians from senior levels down have all expressed their determination to press on with &quot;reform and opening up&quot;. The Communist party is widely soliciting ideas from the public, including from China&apos;s 500 million-plus online citizens; calls to reduce income disparities and strengthen the social safety net top the list of ideas. Herein lies the real clue to opening China \u2013 and, indeed, maximising China&apos;s impact on global growth over the next 10 years. A smaller story in Thursday&apos;s China Daily vividly describes the challenge. A Chinese village in eastern Anhui province is pioneering reforms to China&apos;s medical system. The village lies in the province that is the first to test wide-ranging reforms to its &quot;grassroots&quot; medical system that will cost $125bn and offer new access to drugs and basic insurance. For despite China&apos;s gigantic steps forward since 1978, the nation has become the world&apos;s first simultaneous superpower and developing nation, with a GDP/capita of $3,600 but a limited social safety net of healthcare, pensions and unemployment benefit. This accounts for why most Chinese workers save \u2013 rather than spend \u2013 almost half of their income. Yet only when this savings rate comes down will the real power of Chinese growth begin sucking in exports of the kind that Britain provides so well \u2013 and on a serious scale. Indeed this may be one of the keys to rebooting growth in the post-crisis era. Privately, senior politicians and policymakers are not really popping the champagne corks at the prospects for global growth. For the G20, it seems that the moment of immediate crisis is past. Politically, globalisation is no longer in the best of odours and there is now no driving force on the international stage pushing a global plan for growth. Crucially, the great motor of the global economy \u2013 namely the American consumer \u2013 is seriously damaged. Don&apos;t underestimate this; over the past 25 years the US consumer has come to be worth some $10tn \u2013 that&apos;s roughly 20% of global GDP. But the financial crisis has destroyed around $8tn of this wealth and the damage will take years to repair. That means the great hope for world growth may soon become the rise of the great Asian middle class. On some estimates, this new economic powerhouse could match the US and European middle class in numbers by 2015 and stand 2 billion people-strong by 2020 \u2013 with the biggest slice in China. For some time now, Chinese domestic consumption has been growing; for the first time, it hit more than half of domestic consumption last year. But China&apos;s 1.3 billion people won&apos;t seriously make an impact on global growth until China&apos;s welfare state begins to look like a safety net we would recognise in Europe. So if we want exports to China to really grow, Europe would do well to add some help and advice about social security to the calls for economic freedom.

But it should not, he adds, confuse &quot;meddling and strangeness&quot; with &quot;calculation and coldness. It should also be a work of love.&quot; If these are his goals, Royle only half succeeds. His baroque, athletic prose does indeed confer a strong sense of the &quot;strangeness&quot; of English, &quot;which, after all, belongs to no one&quot; and should be continually reinvented. Royle is adept at doing just this. &quot;No, not stertorous,&quot; reflects our narrator three pages in, remembering his ailing father, &quot;rather wheezeful, softer, gulping, an immeasurably beautiful strange ancient fish glopping glooping groping rasping for air, at air\u2026&quot; But in this quest for literary uniqueness, there is too much calculation and coldness; something of the &quot;love&quot; needed to make it a full-blooded work of art is missing. In many ways Royle&apos;s meandering prose \u2013 which seems at once anarchic and meticulously arranged \u2013 is appropriate to the subject matter: the disarray and isolation a man experiences when his father dies. Separated from his partner who lives overseas, the man is left alone to clear through a lifetime&apos;s worth of objects and haphazard associated memories. As his psychological health frays, he embarks upon a bizarre side project: to build an aquatic life centre in the house where his parents lived. There are moments of delightfully eccentric humour and impressive linguistic experimentalism, but after a while the relentless lexical contortions feel strained and overworked \u2013 rather more like an intelligent but jargon-laden academic essay than an intimate tale of love and loss. Ruiyan Xu&apos;s The Lost and Forgotten Languages of Shanghai  is perhaps a more edifying exploration of the limits of language. It opens with a disastrous gas explosion in the Sawn Hotel in downtown Shanghai, which sends a shard of glass flying into 32-year old businessman Li Jing, puncturing his cranium in a place that causes a very rare type of brain damage, Broca&apos;s aphasia. In a single stroke, he loses his ability to speak Chinese, but he retains his memory of English, the language he spoke up until the age of 10. Suddenly, the &quot;particularities of Chinese, its single-syllabled words, its dependence on the shift of tones to find meaning&quot; have been rendered alien to him; and in their place &quot;an older, more primitive tongue&quot; comes &quot;gargling out of his throat&quot;. Crucially, the loss of Chinese also severs his connection to his Chinese-speaking wife and young son. Out of frustration he renounces language altogether, spurning the efforts of specialists until a doctor from Oklahoma is recruited to come and work with him. Enter Rosalyn, a heavy-drinking refugee from a painful divorce; someone who is as much a stranger to Shanghai as Li Jing has suddenly become; someone who, like him, has been &quot;airlifted out of her life and dropped into an entirely new one&quot;. Able to communicate with each other in ways they can with no one else, it is not long before unbidden feelings develop between them; an intimacy that Li Jing&apos;s wife, struggling to keep her husband&apos;s crumbling business afloat, quickly becomes aware of. Xu&apos;s emotional fluency is what makes this novel work: in contrast to Royle, the love in this book is unfettered, and from this she draws out complex and intriguing questions about language, culture and understanding. Emotional perceptiveness is also at the root of Cate Kennedy&apos;s The World Beneath. Set in contemporary Australia, it tells of an estranged mother and father, who were once passionate environmental campaigners but have now settled down to ordinary, compromised lives, and their quiet, anorexic, angry 15-year-old daughter Sophie. Out of the blue the father, Rich, decides to take Sophie on a six-day hike in the outback (having been hitherto almost entirely absent from her life). Unsurprisingly, all does not go according to plan.

State broadcaster CCTV said Beijing had suspended ministerial and provincial-level contacts, including talks on increasing flights, and postponed a meeting on coal. The row began more than a week ago, when a trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard ships near uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries. The two countries have a long history of tensions over territory, resources and other issues. But after several years of improving relations and increasing trade, they have more to lose if ties are damaged, meaning they will be wary of letting the spat get out of hand. A foreign ministry statement read out on television said Japan&apos;s refusal to release the captain had &quot;already caused serious damage to Sino-Japanese bilateral contacts&quot;. Earlier, in a statement on the Chinese foreign ministry website, spokesman Ma Zhaoxu warned: &quot;If Japan insists on making one mistake after another, the Chinese side will take strong countermeasures, and all the consequences should be borne by the Japanese side.&quot; Xinhua news agency added that Chinese vice foreign minister Wang Guangya had expressed &quot;strong indignation&quot; and made &quot;solemn representations&quot; to the Japanese ambassador, Uichiro Niwa, who has been summoned repeatedly since the row began. &quot;Regarding individual issues, what is needed is to respond calmly without becoming emotional,&quot; Noriyuki Shikata, a spokesman for the Japanese prime minister&apos;s office, told Reuters. Takeshi Matsunaga, assistant press secretary for Japan&apos;s foreign ministry, said the unilateral steps China had taken were &quot;regrettable&quot;. The court in Okinawa, Japan, said Zhan Qixiong could be held for another 10 days for further questioning. Authorities have released the other 14 crew members. He was arrested on 8 September and under Japanese law prosecutors can hold him for up to 20 days while deciding whether to charge him. Japan has accused the captain of deliberately striking a patrol ship as it tried to intercept his vessel, and obstructing officers. But China has said the detention is illegal and has repeatedly demanded the authorities free him. The dispute led to small-scale anti-Japanese protests in China yesterday, the anniversary of 1931&apos;s Mukden incident, which led to occupation by Japan. But a huge police presence protected the Japanese embassy in Beijing and buildings in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and Japan&apos;s new foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, praised China&apos;s &quot;considerable efforts to restrain them&quot;. Maehara, who is thought to be more hawkish on China than his predecessor, repeated Tokyo&apos;s call for Beijing to handle matters calmly, stressing it was being dealt with according to Japanese law. But he added that the isles \u2013 known as the Diaoyu islands in China and Senkaku islands in Japan \u2013 were an &quot;integral part of Japanese territory&quot;. &quot;Territorial issues do not exist in this region,&quot; Maehara told broadcaster NHK. The Nikkei business daily reported earlier today that Japan may start drilling near a gas field in another disputed part of the East China Sea if China does so. Japanese officials said on Friday that China had moved drilling equipment to the area, having scrapped scheduled talks over joint exploration in the wake of the trawler incident.

TMO Renewables developed a strain of &quot;turbo-charged&quot; bacteria that can turn tea bags, cardboard, wood and other household waste into fuel for cars and trucks. The Guildford-based company signed a 20-year, $25m-a-year deal with US firm Fiberight. The technology is part of a wave of &quot;second generation&quot; biofuels that are not made from crop plants. The use of rubbish is aimed at addressing concerns that growing plants for fuel will raise food prices. &quot;With TMO&apos;s bacteria on board, which speeds up the breakdown of cellulose in the waste, the efficiency with which we convert rubbish into bioethanol will rise by around 35%,&quot; said Craig Stuart-Paul, chief executive of Iowa-based Fiberight. &quot;[TMO Renewables] is three to five years ahead of most of its competition in the US.&quot; In 2008, TMO Renewables built the UK&apos;s first bioethanol plant that runs on grasses, cardboard and other waste. Key to its success was the incorporation of genetically engineered bacteria that can break down cellulose into simpler sugars, which can then be fermented to produce bioethanol. The TMO process relies on a strain of bacteria known as TM242 which grows at high temperatures of around 60C. &quot;It has an unusually broad appetite, such that Fiberight&apos;s process will be able to turn waste into bioethanol is just 24 hours,&quot; said Hamish Curran, CEO of TMO Renewables. The Fiberight deal is TMO&apos;s first commercial contract. &quot;We can finally roll out a technology that will truly break the mould of fuel generation. It&apos;s going to reduce how much garbage ends up in landfill generating methane, and provide extremely sustainable transport fuels,&quot; he added. In the next five years, 15 plants using TMO&apos;s process will be built. Stuart-Paul said the potential market in the US is considerable. By 2011, US legislation calls for 17.1m gallons of bioethanol to be used in cars. &quot;We&apos;re going to be making 50% of that,&quot; he said.According to Curran, developing TMO&apos;s process in the US rather than in the UK was a logical and commercially attractive proposition. &quot;The US government is substantially ahead of Europe, and in particular the UK when it comes to making biofuel companies feel welcome. The debate the UK had last week about scaling back biofuel production is just another example of this.&quot; Claire Wenner, head of biomass and transport at the Renewable Energy Association in London, agrees. &quot;It&apos;s just so sad that we are losing these companies to the US,&quot; she said. &quot;Why aren&apos;t we building these plants in the UK? Sustainable development in the UK keeps getting knocked back by skittish politicians. We just need to go for it, like the US is.&quot; Next up, TMO hopes to partner with companies in China. &quot;Shanghai has 20 million people and Beijing has 19 million so there&apos;s an awful lot of waste that&apos;s ready to be turned into bioethanol.

Is Moscow better than Sydney? Would Hong Kong squeeze in above Manchester? Or Bangkok above Brighton? It would be a nonsensical exercise. Better in what respect? They are all vastly different types of human settlement, meeting different aspects of human need in different cultures and climates. True, there would be no shortage of data, though it would be of variable robustness and gathered on different bases in different countries. We could compare expenditure on public transport, or the area of open space, or unemployment. But to come to a single ranking, we would then have to manipulate the data: should a measure of the state of public health outweigh a measure of investment in public transport? Exactly the same problems arise with world rankings of universities. Each time a new set is published, universities shoot up or down the league tables, and vice-chancellors the world over engage in their traditional exercise of deploy (if up) or deplore (otherwise). But, in the real world, nothing has changed. The relative strengths of UK universities vis-a-vis their international peers vary only marginally and incrementally year on year. All that has changed is that the league table compilers have adopted new metrics and applied new weightings to them, but they still fall miles short of capturing anything like the variety, the dynamism and the diversity of the modern university. The basic problem is that there is no definition of the ideal university. Is it big or small? Is it better at research or at teaching? Is it a specialist science and technology institution with heavy research income \u2013 or does it focus primarily on the humanities and social sciences? Is it adventurous or risk averse? Next, what are the data? On teaching, there are simply no robust data on which global comparison can be made. Some tables rely on curious proxies, such as the number of PhDs awarded per academic, the number of undergraduates admitted per academic and the income per academic. None of these say anything about the quality of teaching. We might expect measures of research excellence to be robust, because top research is a globalised activity. Yet we would be disappointed. Take research income. There is a world of difference between scientific and medical institutions \u2013 where research is expensive and grants tend to be large \u2013 and other types of institution. This helps to explain why a world-class institution such as the London School of Economics can be ranked in one table no higher than 86th. What&apos;s more, research income is an input measure, and will tend to be higher in countries investing seriously in research. It does not speak to the quality of output, where UK universities have consistently demonstrated outstanding return on investment. Research citations can be a measure of quality, but need to be intelligently applied. There are big cultural variations between disciplines, and citation indices are not well attuned to capturing research excellence in the humanities, arts and social sciences. This isn&apos;t easy territory. Get it wrong and you end up with some truly bizarre results. For example, one of the recent sets of rankings concludes that Egypt&apos;s Alexandria University trumps both Stanford and Harvard for their influential research measured by impact. Global rankings have afforded annual light entertainment, but they are now seriously overreaching themselves.

The remarks follow Beijing&apos;s abrupt suspension of high-level contacts. China announced the measure in protest at Japan&apos;s decision to extend its detention of trawler captain Zhan Qixiong, whose ship collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels a fortnight ago near the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both countries and which the Chinese call the Diaoyus. &quot;What is most important is that government officials in Japan, China and other countries try not to fuel narrow-minded, extreme nationalism,&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, told reporters. &quot;For the peace and development of east Asia and the Asia-Pacific, we want to use all available means of communication to ask that this be resolved without the situation escalating.&quot; Sengoku said there were no plans for the prime minister, Naoto Kan, to discuss the crisis with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York later this week. China&apos;s foreign ministry said a meeting between the two leaders would be inappropriate. &quot;This matter has already seriously damaged China-Japan relations,&quot; Jiang Yu, a ministry spokeswoman, told reporters. &quot;The key to solving this problem is in Japan&apos;s hands.&quot; The US voiced concern at the prospect of a prolonged estrangement between China and Japan, which are engaged in long-standing disputes over the islands as well as drilling rights in oil and gas fields in the East China Sea. A US state department spokesman, Mark Toner, said Washington expected the row to be &quot;resolved through appropriate diplomatic means&quot;. Japan&apos;s refusal to release Zhan has fuelled anti-Japanese sentiment among Chinese internet users and led to cultural exchanges being called off. Chinese travel agencies have cancelled package tours to Japan, affecting thousands of tourists, while a youth association withdrew an invitation to 1,000 Japanese youngsters to attend the World Expo in Shanghai. The Japanese band Smap, which has a huge following in mainland Asia, has postponed two concerts in China after a local ticket agency suspended ticket sales over the weekend, according to the Sports Nippon tabloid. The boyband was scheduled to play in front of 80,000 fans at the expo venue next month. The centre-left administration in Tokyo has repeatedly called for calm on both sides, having made closer ties with China a key part of its foreign policy since taking office a year ago. The finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said Japan would respond in a &quot;level-headed manner&quot; to avoid any impact on the countries&apos; economic ties. China became Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner last year, with bilateral trade reaching 12.6tn yen (\u00a395bn) in the first half of this year, up more than 34 percentage points compared with the same period last year. Analysts said it was in both countries&apos; interests to defuse the crisis, given the strength of their economic ties and shared concerns about North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. &quot;They have all the reasons to improve bilateral relations and co-operate further in economic and other relations, especially when China&apos;s economic growth is very fast and when Japan&apos;s is slow or even contracting,&quot; said Victor Gao, director of the China National Association for International Studies in Beijing. &quot;Improving relations between the two countries is in their mutual interest. It is crucial for both to exercise maximum restraint and avoid anything which may escalate tensions.&quot; Nationalist messages flooded internet forums. On one popular portal, Netease, a user from Ningxia, north-west China, wrote: &quot;Our national humiliation can never be forgotten. As an ordinary common person, all I can do is be angry and boycott Japanese goods; if there is a war, as a reserve officer, I will not hesitate!&quot; Others attacked the Chinese government for not taking a stronger line. Aside from the anti-Japanese vitriol flooding online forums, protests in China have been low-key. A strong police presence ensured that demonstrations in Beijing on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the start of Japan&apos;s occupation in 1931 passed off peacefully. China&apos;s decision to suspend contacts at the ministerial level and above came after a Japanese court approved a request by prosecutors to hold Zhan until 28 September, when they must either indict or release him. Gao suggested that Tokyo could offer to release the captain, whose mother died following his arrest, on humanitarian grounds, and because tomorrow&apos;s mid-autumn festival is traditionally a time for family reunions in China. &quot;It could be an expedient way to wind this down without causing anyone to lose face or requiring either to compromise their principled position on the Diaoyu islands,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-21T11:00:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/21/ronnie-o-sullivan-snooker", "sentences": ["Mark Williams, a double world champion, gave his views after beating Ali Carter, winner of the Shanghai Masters this month, 3-1 to reach the last 16: &quot;Ronnie&apos;s break should stand at 140 because he&apos;d shaken hands [with his opponent, Mark King] before he potted the last black."], "title": "Ronnie O'Sullivan 'happy' to quit snooker over 147-break row", "article": "The 12bet.com World Open in Glasgow continued to revolve round Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan even on his day off. His threat to retire does not deserve to be taken seriously in the light of similar threats which have come to nothing but controversy continued over the last black of his record 10th 147 on Monday, which he did not intend to attempt until the referee, Jan Verhaas, persuaded him to do so to avoid disappointing the fans. Mark Williams, a double world champion, gave his views after beating Ali Carter, winner of the Shanghai Masters this month, 3-1 to reach the last 16: &quot;Ronnie&apos;s break should stand at 140 because he&apos;d shaken hands [with his opponent, Mark King] before he potted the last black.

Because the circuit has produced 73 maximums, 39 on television, it is uneconomic for World Snooker to insure against them. The World Open does offer a \u00a34,000 highest-break prize which O&apos;Sullivan will pocket unless another maximum by another player compels him to share it. &quot;I&apos;ll give the \u00a34000 to charity because it&apos;s not the money,&quot; O&apos;Sullivan said. &quot;It would be nice if there was a bigger prize. I think there should be really. But I won&apos;t be losing sleep over it.

O&apos;Sullivan said in an interview with Talksport to his long list of threatened retirements, none of which has been carried through because he always acknowledges that he would miss the game very much: &quot;I was talking to Barry Hearn yesterday and I told him: &apos;If you like, this is my last frame of snooker ever.

The countries are locked in an increasingly tense row over Japan&apos;s detention of a Chinese captain after his trawler collided with a coastguard vessel near disputed islands. China&apos;s premier Wen Jiabao this week threatened further retaliation if the man was not released. Xinhua said the Japanese citizens were under investigation by officials in northern Hebei province for entering a military zone without authorisation and videotaping military targets. &quot;The state security authorities in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei, have taken measures against the four people according to law after receiving a report about their illegal activities,&quot; it added, without giving details. It cited a rare statement from state security officials as its source. A Japanese foreign ministry official confirmed four people were being investigated. Japanese news agency Kyodo said the four worked in the construction business. &quot;The prime minister and chief cabinet secretary have repeatedly said that we would like to address the relationship with China in a calm manner. This is the basic stance and it remains unchanged,&quot; the Japanese foreign ministry deputy spokesman said following the announcement. Earlier, the US secretary of state urged both sides to resolve the maritime issue quickly. State department spokesman PJ Crowley told reporters that the Japanese foreign minister Seiji Maehara raised the sea dispute in a meeting with Hillary Clinton during the UN general assembly in New York. &quot;The secretary&apos;s response was just to encourage dialogue and hope that the issue can be resolved soon,&quot; Crowley said. &quot;Our sense is that neither side wants to see the situation escalate to the point that it has long term regional impact.&quot; China has summoned the Japanese ambassador six times over the issue and on Sunday cut off ministerial and provincial level contacts. China&apos;s national tourism association has urged domestic travel agents to stop promoting trips to Japan and a youth organisation withdrew an invitation to 1,000 young Japanese people to attend the Expo in Shanghai. The countries have clashed over the East China Sea islets \u2013 known as the Diaoyu islands to the Chinese and Senkaku islands to the Japanese \u2013 on several previous occasions. But James Manicom, who has studied Sino-Japanese maritime disputes in depth, said there were notable differences. &quot;In previous years it has been nationalist groups going there to try to demonstrate their claim \u2013 in 1996 you had Japanese protesters and in 2004 Chinese activists tried to land on them as well,&quot; he said. &quot;Secondly, the two countries are less prepared to keep a lid on these things because they are attuned to just how important their maritime claims are.&quot; Both sides had surveyed resources in the disputed area, said Manicom, a post doctoral fellow at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Ontario. &quot;[China] is becoming very sensitive about what happens in waters around it.

The HSBC chief executive is understood to have lost out in a brutal power struggle for control of the bank caused by the decision of the chairman, Stephen Green, to join the government. Geoghegan is to be replaced by the head of the investment bank, Stuart Gulliver, who was paid \u00a310m last year, while the chairman&apos;s slot is to be filled by the highly regarded finance director, Douglas Flint. The boardroom upheaval is unprecedented and follows days of speculation about the machinations inside an organisation that has traditionally prided itself on seamless management succession. Banks rarely replace two such crucial boardroom posts at the same time for fear of sparking concerns about instability. Even during the financial crisis banking groups tried to avoid such upheaval. The 18 members of HSBC&apos;s board are not due to assemble in Shanghai until Wednesday to ratify the new management team, put together by Sir Simon Robertson, the former Goldman Sachs banker responsible for finding Green&apos;s successor. But after days of speculation the boardroom changes leaked last night \u2013 even though the board had not met to consider them \u2013 suggest the board was riddled with differences about who should succeed Green. An HSBC spokesman was adamant last night that no decision had been made. The appointment of Gulliver as chief executive is likely to infuriate the Liberal Democrats, who criticised Barclays when it promoted its investment banking head, Bob Diamond, to chief executive this month. Gulliver is another &quot;casino banker&quot; and was the highest paid banker at HSBC last year, with a package of more than \u00a310m. The Lib Dems are concerned that by appointing investment bankers to the helm of banks, the industry is not taking seriously its concerns about reducing the risk in banks. Ordinarily, Geoghegan would have expected the chairman&apos;s role to be his because the bank traditionally hands the job to its chief executive, although this contravenes corporate governance guidelines. But shareholders lobbied the board not to elevate Geoghegan and it had considered whether it could break even further with tradition by appointing a non-executive director, John Thornton, another former Goldman banker, as chairman. It was the prospect of this break with the past that forced Geoghegan into a denial that he had threatened to resign if he was not given the chairman&apos;s role. Investors are now likely to ask questions about the way Robertson handled the succession process. Despite the denial, Geoghegan&apos;s career had appeared to be in the balance as City sources said that the board was in an impossible position: if it appointed him to the highest profile role in banking, it might appear that the chief executive had been holding the board to ransom. City sources said Gulliver had been agitating for promotion for some time and he is now expected to move to Hong Kong, where the bank has decided the office of the chief executive should be based. It is almost unheard of for a finance director to leapfrog the role of chief executive and be installed as chairman. While shareholders will be reassured that the new chairman will have a firm grip on the business, they will also want a new finance director to be named quickly. Flint is the longest serving HSBC director, and is held in high regard with just one blot in his career: the disastrous takeover of the sub-prime lender Household Bank in the US, which caused the bank&apos;s first ever profits warning. Flint and Gulliver were being groomed for promotion along with the Asian head, Sandy Flockhart. The pairing of Flint and Gulliver will be a popular choice inside HSBC although few had believed that the hot-headed Geoghegan would be forced out after just four years as chief executive. While the City awaits confirmation of the changes at HSBC, management upheaval is also underway at other major UK banks.

Again.  Roy Hodgson Plainly the Liverpool manager is a very nice man. You like him, I like him and Liverpool fans really want to like him but are having a little trouble right now because their world is falling down around their ears. But I have to admit I have been a little saddened by his repeated insistence in the last day or so that everything that is going wrong at Liverpool is his fault, and not that of the players. I mean, he might not have fixed all the club&apos;s problems but he hardly caused them all did he? It gets you wondering what else in life he feels responsible for. The recession? The dodo&apos;s extinction? Justin Bieber?  3pm Games kicking off everywhere.  3.05pm: Liverpool have taken the lead against Sunderland and it&apos;s an absolute shocker! Sunderland won a free-kick inside their own half and Michael Turner went to knock the ball back to his goalkeeper. Somehow, though, he only succeeds in rolling the ball about five of the 30-odd yards between him and Mignolet, and with no other Sunderland players looking Fernando Torres charges on to the loose ball, before drawing the keeper out and then squaring the ball for Kuyt to jab home. That&apos;s almost as amusing as Darren Bent&apos;s infamous beachball goal. Liverpool have started well though - they had a goal (correctly) chalked off for offside shortly before this one.  3.08pm: &quot;So Harry Redknapp&apos;s going 4-5-1 today for Tottenham&apos;s game against [Scott Parker],&quot; ponders Andy by email. &quot;But he seems to have a back four entirely made up of Mrs Redknapp.&quot; Wouldn&apos;t that be a back one, then?  3.10pm: &quot;The BBC are claiming that Turner was giving the ball back to his keeper to take the free kick, rather than passing it to him as the free kick,&quot; points out Alec Cochrane. &quot;Is it the slice of luck that Liverpool finally needed to get the season off?&quot; There was some consultation between the referee and his linesman before the goal was actually awarded and that would seem a perfectly plausible thing for Turner to argue.  3.13pm: Arsenal, you won&apos;t be surprised to hear, have had the best of the early running at Emirates Stadium, and Arshavin just hit the woodwork twice in a matter of seconds.  3.14pm: Mark Schwarzer gets in the way of a Steven Pienaar drive at Craven Cottage.  3.16pm: Blackburn had a goal disallowed at Blackpool a few moments ago - Chris Samba bundled the ball over the line from close range but Kalinic was penalised for a foul in the build-up. Not long before that at the other end Michel Salgado had to head an Ian Evatt flick off the line, via the crossbar.  3.19pm: Patrick Cullen risks the wrath of all mankind by having a pop at Roy Hodgson. &quot;I&apos;ve just seen a bit of Hodgson&apos;s press conference yesterday, where in answer to Daniel Agger&apos;s criticism of Liverpool&apos;s play he basically said that Agger should know better than to talk to journalists because he&apos;s &apos;knocking on 30 now&apos;,&quot; he writes. &quot;Agger is 25 - could this vague idea of who his players are, how old they are and even which position they might be best off playing in have something to do with Liverpool&apos;s less than impressive start to the season?&quot; That is a touch worrying, isn&apos;t it?  3.21pm: Blackpool 0-1 Blackburn. This had been coming - Blackburn have been applying a fair bit of pressure in the last few minutes and they take the lead through a Charlie Adam own goal. He misjudged a header back to his goalkeeper and wound up nodding it past Matthew Gilks. Much hilarity on Sky Sports News - where Alan McInally was busy talking to the studio and completely missed the goal happening. He didn&apos;t even realise it had happened until Jeff Stelling told him.  3.24pm: Penalty to Sunderland! Poulsen handball in the area.  3.25pm: Liverpool 1-1 Sunderland. Reina went the right way and managed to get something on Bent&apos;s low effort but couldn&apos;t quite stop the ball squirming underneath him.  3.27pm: West Brom&apos;s turn to hit the woodwork at Emirates Stadium, as Odemwingie cuts inside and lets fly only for Almunia to tip his effort onto the bar.  3.29pm: West Ham 1-0 Tottenham. Tottenham are behind at Upton Park and, unlikely as this may sound, it wasn&apos;t even Scott Parker that got it. Mrs Redknapp was powerless to stop Frederic Piquionne as he rose to thump home a header from a Mark Noble corner.  3.31pm: &quot;Interesting to see that not only have Spurs turned up with Mrs Redknapp in defence Harry trusts her so much there isnt a defender on the bench,&quot; points out John Tumbridge.  3.32pm: It&apos;s all getting nicely bad-tempered at St Andrews, where an incident that started with Hugo Rodallega thrusting his head up against that of a Birmingham player somehow wound up with all 22 players rushing over to get involved. Because that always helps. No cards shown at the end of it though.  3.34pm: &quot;An early goal is a curse when you&apos;re in a run of poor form,&quot; sighs Gary Naylor of Liverpool&apos;s plight. &quot;There was just too long to hold on.&quot;  3.35pm: At Emirates Stadium Samir Nasri crashes a volley over the bar, but West Brom have been more than holding their own for most of the game.  3.36pm: Penalty to West Brom! Almunia gets a yellow card for bringing down Odemwingie.  3.37pm: Almunia saves the penalty! Chris Brunt aimed his shot low to the keeper&apos;s right, but it wasn&apos;t particularly well struck and Almunia smothers it. It remains 0-0 at Emirates Stadium.  3.39pm: &quot;I&apos;ve just noticed that Mrs Redknapp is on the bench for Tottenham too,&quot; parps John Tunbridge. &quot;No, wait - sorry, that&apos;s Sandro.&quot;  3.42pm: Oh dear - shocking omissions dept. - I somehow seem to have failed to paste in the Blackpool v Blackburn teams earlier. Genuinely sorry - I had copied them onto a word document but obviously failed to transfer them in here. Here they are now: Blackpool: Gilks, Eardley, Evatt, Cathcart, Crainey, Vaughan, Adam, Taylor-Fletcher, Harewood, Campbell, Ormerod. Subs: Kingson, Southern, Grandin, Varney, Sylvestre, Phillips, Keinan.Blackburn: Robinson, Salgado, Samba, Nelsen, Givet, Nzonzi, Jones, Pedersen, Mame Diouf, Kalinic, El-Hadji Diouf. Subs: Bunn, Olsson, Emerton, Andrews, Mwaruwari, Hoilett, Chimbonda.Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral)  3.43pm: Fantastic save from Robert Green just now to keep West Ham ahead against Tottenham - palming Luka Modric&apos;s volley onto the bar. Kieron Dyer has gone off injured for West Ham, to be replaced by Pablo Barrera.  3.45pm: And now Mark Schwarzer manages to block Mikel Arteta&apos;s 25-yard howitzer at Craven Cottage.  3.48pm: Half-time whistles going everywhere now - will confirm the scores in a moment ...  3.50pm: Here we go then. An underwhelming four goals across the six games so far in the Premier League Arsenal 0-0 West BromBirmingham 0-0 WiganBlackpool 0-1 BlackburnFulham 0-0 EvertonLiverpool 1-1 Sunderland  Scott Parker  Frederic Piquionne 1-0 Tottenham  3.51pm: And here&apos;s the Championship latest too.

And Nasri is having a shocking game. Most Arsenal fans have been picking on Arshavin this season (I have no idea why), but Nasri is misfiring, misplacing passes, and failing to clear the first man on free-kicks and corners. Let&apos;s have Rosicky please.&quot; Hmm, I must say I can understand the frustration with Arshavin - he&apos;s such a gifted player but he does disappear from games at times. Rosicky is another player I&apos;ve heard criticised a lot by Arsenal fans recently but he&apos;s started the season very well.  3.59pm: &quot;Sodding Justin Bieber ruined the season premier of CSI this week,&quot; rails Andy in Shanghai in response to my preamble. &quot;He was supposed to play a disaffected orphaned teenager, fallen in with domestic terrorists, who helps bomb a police funeral. They kept his same look and hair and he just looked like Justin Bieber but not smiling the whole time. I hate him. Just thought I&apos;d throw that out there.&quot; To be absolutely honest I still don&apos;t really know who Justin Bieber actually is. Only that people seem to talk about him a lot on Twitter.  4.04pm: Liverpool 1-2 Sunderland. What a start to the second half for Sunderland, as Darren Bent meets a cross from the right with a diving header at the back post.  4.07pm: OK, I was wrong. It is all Roy Hodgson&apos;s fault. Would Sam Allardyce consider Liverpool well-enough suited to his services?  4.08pm: Arsenal 0-1 West Brom. My word - West Brom have their first away goal of the season and it&apos;s enough to put them in the lead at Emirates Stadium. It&apos;s fully deserved too - they ended the first half stronger than their hosts and they&apos;ve started the second better too. Thomas wriggles free down the left and rolls the ball across the six-yard box for Odemwingie to jab home.  4.11pm: Arsenal 0-2 West Brom Wow. Manuel Almunia may have saved a penalty earlier but any credit he bought himself is totally wiped out here as he lets in an absolute howler. Jara&apos;s near post effort was neither well-placed nor particularly fiercely hit, but as the keeper crouched to block he somehow contrived to knock the ball in with his own knee. Shocking.  4.14pm: Championship leaders QPR have taken the lead at home to Doncaster. Incidentally, it would be remiss of me not to mention that while the second West Brom goal itself was a shocker, Chris Brunt did play Jara in with a fantastically cheeky little backheel down the right.  4.16pm: Arsene Wenger is unsurprisingly making changes at Emirates Stadium - sending on Jack Wilshere and Thomas Rosicky for Emmanuel Eboue and Abou Diaby. Nasri comes close to getting one goal back but it&apos;s blocked by his own team-mate Arshavin.  4.18pm: &quot;Justin Bieber? I believe Wenger has him lined up as cover for Almunia,&quot; toots Gary Naylor. &quot;Word is that he&apos;s better than Fabianski.&quot; Probably not worse than Almunia either on this evidence.  4.20pm: Over at Upton Park, Tom Huddlestone has blown a fantastic chance to equalise for Tottenham, missing the target after rounding Robert Green.  4.21pm: Liverpool 2-2 Sunderland. Steven Gerrard brings Liverpool level, heading home from inside the area after Fernando Torres&apos;s cross is deflected into his path by Michael Turner.  4.25pm: Arsenal make their last change, sending on Carlos Vela for Koscielny. Well you might as well at this stage, mightn&apos;t you?  4.27pm: Arsenal are all over West Brom, who are unsurprisingly happy to try to defend the result at this stage, but the Baggies are doing a sensational job at the moment of getting bodies in the way every time anyone tries to have a shot.  4.29pm: Everton look the more likely side to break the deadlock at Craven and Mikel Arteta just thumped another effort just over the bar.  4.31pm: &quot;I&apos;ll take 2-0 if that&apos;s the final score,&quot; honks West Brom fan Richard Hooker. &quot;But it would be a disappointing result because this is an opportunity for WBA to really do something about our goal difference.&quot;  4.31pm: Arsenal 0-3 West Brom Simply incredible scenes at Emirates Stadium, where West Brom - just as Richard Hooker had hoped - are turning this into a rout. Jerome Thomas gets the third.  4.34pm: Arsenal 1-3 West Brom You would imagine it&apos;s going to be too little, too late, but Samir Nasri has at least reduced the arrears for Arsenal, skipping past a pair of challenges inside the area before firing across Scott Carson into the far corner. About 30 seconds earlier he had hit the bar from the edge of the area.  4.36pm: Yet another fantastic save from Schwarzer at Craven Cottage, parrying a Yakubu effort that looked bound for the bottom corner.  4.37pm: &quot;There can be few more tragic sights in football than Almunia haring off his line,&quot; sighs Hugh Collins - making reference to West Brom&apos;s third, in which Almunia was drawn off his line as he attempted to close down Brunt down by the goalline but instead left room for the West Brom player to play Thomas in. &quot;He has all the purpose and grace of a hungover man running to catch a bus.&quot;  4.38pm: West Ham oh-so-nearly extend their lead against Tottenham, Mark Noble&apos;s effort kept out by a superb save from Carlo Cudicini. Still no goals at St Andrews, but Birmingham have just sent Kevin Phillips on for Cameron Jerome.  4.41pm: QPR have made it 2-0 at home to Doncaster, while Leeds have taken the lead in the Yorkshire derby.  4.44pm: Blackpool 1-1 Blackburn. Ian Holloway&apos;s side have scored - as they invariably do at home - and Matt Phillips is the man who gets the goal, cutting inside to drive home just seconds after coming off the bench for his Blackpool debut.  4.46pm: &quot;It&apos;s a little galling for Arsenal fans that the first entry following the third and fourth goals of the Arsenal-West Brom game begins &apos;Yet another fantastic save from Schwarzer&apos;,&quot; sighs Maher Sattar. &quot;Wenger had all summer to sign a decent keeper, and yet he refused to spend the \u00a32m extra it would have taken to bring the Fulham stopper to the Emirates.&quot; It&apos;s a fair point, though it&apos;s also true that Arsenal&apos;s problems today have run deeper than just Almunia.  4.49pm: Arsenal 2-3 West Brom Well, well, well - I was just about say that Arsenal haven&apos;t exactly been knocking the door down these last few minutes but Nasri pops up again in the area, stroking the ball nonchalantly home after being played in by the penalty spot. Five minutes of injury time to be played.  4.51pm: Blackpool 1-2 Blackburn Brett Emerton has put Blackburn back ahead.  Full-time: West Ham 1-0 Tottenham  4.53pm: Huge chances at Emirates Stadium and Anfield go begging, as Rosicky skies a shot over the crossbar and Daniel Agger heads wide from four yards out.   Full-time: Arsenal 2-3 West Brom  Full-time: Liverpool 2-2 Sunderland  Full-time: Birmingham 0-0 Wigan  Full-time: Fulham 0-0 Everton  Full-time: Blackpool 1-2 Blackburn  So, to confirm ... Here are today&apos;s Premier League results: Arsenal 2-3 West BromBirmingham 0-0 WiganBlackpool 1-2 BlackburnFulham 0-0 EvertonLiverpool 2-2 SunderlandManchester City 1-0 ChelseaWest Ham 1-0 Tottenham And here are the Championship results Burnley 0-0 Bristol CityCardiff 2-1 MillwallCoventry 1-2 PrestonDerby 5-0 Crystal PalaceLeeds 1-0 Sheffield UnitedNorwich 0-2 HullNottingham Forest 3-1 SwanseaQPR 3-0 DoncasterReading 3-0 BarnsleyScunthorpe 1-1 IpswichWatford 3-1 Middlesbrough  That&apos;s it, then What an afternoon it&apos;s been in the Premier League. Chelsea beaten at lunch-time, Tottenham defeated at West Ham, Liverpool held at home to Sunderland and - most unlikely of all - Arsenal losing at home to West Brom. Manuel Almunia will get a lot of the flak and not undeservedly - West Brom&apos;s second came from an absolute howler on his part and he was also at fault for the third. But he was not the only player to underperform. Let us not forget that he also saved a penalty, and West Brom had other chances besides.  But while the headlines will inevitably focus on Arsenal&apos;s deficiencies, West Brom deserve a lot of credit. They were energetic and swift on the break but most importantly they were (missed penalty aside) clinical. Peter Odemwingie looks like quite the signing. Anyway, that&apos;s all from me, though I&apos;ll be back later this evening to provide minute-by-minute coverage of Roma v Inter in Serie A.

For 18 years it has been attracting audiences to its exotic blend of poetry and performance. In June it was deemed good enough to represent France at the World Expo in Shanghai. But after a summer which has seen France crack down on its foreign Roma population and draw the ire of Brussels for the policy, the future of the circus and its loyal band of artists hangs in the balance. The authorities have refused to validate work permits for the five Romanian musicians whose instruments are crucial to the performances. The French employment inspectorate insists that the cancellation of the permits has no connection with the wider political climate, which has seen around 1,000 Roma return to their home countries in nearly two months and around 200 unauthorised Roma camps cleared by police. They say there are problems with the circus&apos;s functioning, accuse its owner of underpaying the musicians and question the use of child performers. Such claims are dismissed as &quot;pure invention&quot; by Alexandre Roman\u00e8s, the circus&apos;s charismatic founder. &quot;They&apos;re making up all these reasons. It&apos;s complete fantasy,&quot; he said, as he sipped coffee outside his caravan on the outskirts of Paris. Responding to the authorities&apos; chief criticism \u2013 that of low pay \u2013 he added: &quot;They get four times the minimum wage, and they are fed and housed. When I contacted a lawyer and told her what they [the authorities] were trying to claim, she just burst out laughing.&quot; Roman\u00e8s, a published poet and friend of the late writer Jean Genet, is unequivocal about what he believes to be the real reasons for the sudden move, taken for the first time in the circus&apos;s two decades of existence. For him, it is just another sign of France&apos;s growing hostility towards his people. &quot;As this woman from Luxembourg [EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding] said, we thought Europe was protected from this kind of thing, but clearly it isn&apos;t. What I have noticed is that, instead of waging war on poverty, the French government is waging war on the poor,&quot; he said. In order to try to revoke the authorities&apos; &quot;unjust&quot; decision, 59-year-old Roman\u00e8s and his wife, D\u00e9lia, have started an online petition. Urging the authorities to let the circus &quot;employ those Romanian and Bulgarian artists with whom they want to work&quot;, the appeal has more than 7,000 signatories. A &quot;night of support&quot; on 4 October will aim to rally the troops. One of the most vocal Roman\u00e8s fans is Reinhard von Nagel, a world-famous harpsichord maker and esteemed Ma\u00eetre d&apos;Art appointed by the French culture ministry. There was no doubt, he said, of the political nature of the refusal of permits. &quot;In France, as in other countries, there are laws for and against things, but they are not always applied. If you want to attack someone, you find a law and you apply it. That is what the authorities are doing in the case of Alexandre and D\u00e9lia,&quot; he said, criticising the &quot;zealousness&quot; of the authorities implementing the &quot;hunting down of the Roma&quot;. &quot;It is a policy which I have no hesitation in declaring to be fascist. It bothers me deeply,&quot; said Von Nagel, a German who has lived in Paris for decades. At a meeting last weekend with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand, the culture minister, he brought the Cirque Roman\u00e8s to the minister&apos;s attention. &quot;I told him that if the Cirque Roman\u00e8s is shut, I don&apos;t know if I can stay in France,&quot; he said. President Sarkozy&apos;s policy of paid &quot;voluntary returns&quot; for all those foreign Roma found to be living on French soil without permission has been denounced as unfair and unworkable by human rights activists, foreign politicians and even members of the president&apos;s own right-wing UMP party, one of whom \u2013 like Reding \u2013 enraged the government by comparing the evacuations across France with Vichy-era roundups of French Jews and Gypsies. For the Roman\u00e8s family, who dislike the term Roma and prefer to be proud Gypsies, the situation is telling. Even though they are both French citizens \u2013 Alexandre since birth \u2013 they feel they are being stigmatised by a crackdown which is supposedly only a question of legality. This was not helped by the leak this month of an interior ministry memo that singled out Roma camps as the target for this summer&apos;s expulsions. &quot;Even we, Gypsy artists who are legal citizens, are being attacked,&quot; said D\u00e9lia, 40, a Romanian-born singer who fled her native Transylvania during the communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu. &quot;I found it extraordinary that they sent us to represent France at Shanghai and that, when we came back, they weren&apos;t letting our musicians work. It&apos;s mad, really bad. They want to get rid of us. They just don&apos;t want to have to see us.

China&apos;s leading consumer group, Bright Food, has emerged as one of the frontrunners to acquire UB, which is being sold by its private equity owners Blackstone and PAI. A takeover would attract attention from politicians worried about the increasing number of British companies falling under foreign control. There was an outcry last year when the American multinational Kraft snapped up Cadbury after launching a hostile bid. Based in Hayes, west London, UB employs 7,000 people in Britain at 11 factories. Gerry Murphy, former boss of Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, has recently been appointed to the UB board. If Bright Food clinches a deal, it would mark the first time a Chinese company has taken outright control of a major European food company. UB&apos;s brands also include Jacob&apos;s Cream Crackers, McVitie&apos;s biscuits, Penguin and Hula Hoops. Chinese companies are eager to acquire products for the country&apos;s burgeoning middle class, as well as gain exposure to western marketing techniques and technological know-how. Although the Shanghai-based firm is in advanced talks about a takeover of UB, other international food groups such as Kellogg, Kraft, Pepsico, Nestl\u00e9 and several Indian companies are also circling. Blackstone and PAI bought UB for \u00a31.6bn in 2006 from a private consortium that acquired the biscuit-maker in 2000, when it was listed on the London stock exchange. Last year, UB notched up sales of more than \u00a31.3bn and trading profit of \u00a3223m, but has net debt of \u00a31.3bn. A possible row over the foreign ownership of UB could be blunted by the fact that Blackstone and PAI are foreign themselves, based in the US and France respectively. But Chinese ownership could be harder to swallow for politicians worried that Beijing&apos;s interests are more strategic and geopolitical than economic. United Biscuits was founded in 1948 after the merger of two Scottish businesses, McVitie &amp; Price and MacFarlane Lang, with a move into nuts, crisps and other snacks two years later. The private equity firms had considered a stockmarket listing, but pulled back amid uncertainty about the economic outlook and poor reception that greeted Ocado&apos;s float in the summer. Blackstone will be eager for a successful exit from UB, following stalled flotations this year of two of its portfolio companies \u2013 Merlin Entertainment, the owner of Madame Tussauds, and Travelport, a group travel-booking business. Blackstone has six potential flotations in the pipeline. The private equity partnership saw off competition for UB four years ago from Premier Foods, the owner of Branson pickle, which had struggled to raise enough cash to win the auction, but could again emerge as a potential buyer. UB was taken private at the turn of the millennium by a four-member consortium that included the private equity firms Cinven, PAI and MidOcean, as well as Kraft. The group has operations in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as in Britain. UB says it has been working to make its snacks healthier in a bid to boost sales to a more health-conscious public. During 2009, a number of its biscuit brands were relaunched with reductions in saturated fat, including an 80% cut in McVitie&apos;s digestives and 75% in McVitie&apos;s Rich Tea and HobNobs. PAI and UB have been considering selling the snacks and biscuits division separately with America&apos;s Campbell Soup keen to bid for the snacks arm. But Bright Food&apos;s enthusiasm to take over the whole firm is viewed as a more profitable outcome for the company than a break-up. The Chinese company is advised by Rothschild, while JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are running the sale for PAI and Blackstone. Bright Food was formed three years ago when the Shanghai municipal government announced it was merging Shanghai Bright Dairy Group, the holding company for Bright Dairy, with Shanghai Sugar Tobacco and Jinjiang Food. The new conglomerate, named Bright Food, is managed by Shanghai&apos;s local administration and the state-owned assets supervision and administration commission. A spokesman for Bright Food confirmed to Bloomberg that &quot;we are in talks about buying United Biscuits&quot; but gave no details.", "tags": ["Mergers and acquisitions", "Business", "Food & drink industry", "Private equity", "China", "World news", "Mondel\u0113z", "Nestl\u00e9", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-26T17:46:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/sep/27/miners-unilever-astrazeneca", "sentences": ["Analysts were looking for the next bid in the food sector after reports that private equity owned United Biscuits could be sold to Shanghai-based Bright Foods."], "title": "FTSE lifted by miners and Unilever but AstraZeneca dips on drug setback", "article": "A rise in mining shares and a spot of merger news have combined to push the FTSE 100 ahead in early trading, but AstraZeneca has fallen back on another drug disappointment. Shares in the pharmaceutical group are down 28p at \u00a333.06 after it said its experimental prostate cancer pill zibotentan had failed to improve survival in clinical trials. So Astra has decided not to make any regulatory submissions for zibotnetan at the moment. The disappointment for Astra follows similar unsuccessful trials for recentin in colon cancer earlier this year and vandetanib for lung cancer in 2009. But Astra did receive a positive recommendation from European regulators for heart drug brilinta on Friday, and Brian White at Shore Capital kept his buy recommendation on the company. He said:  [The zibotentan] news extends a period of poor results for AstraZeneca&apos;s oncology franchise. Despite consensus forecasts suggesting 2015 sales in excess of $500m on a non-risk adjusted basis and some excitement (elsewhere) in the investment community about the potential for zibotentan given its novel mechanism (and some encouraging Phase II data) we felt that this was a high risk approach, especially given the negative results from Abbott&apos;s atrasentan in prostate cancer which also targeted the endothelin-A receptor. Despite the observation that zibotentan development continues in other prostate cancer settings we have not included sales of zibotentan in our forecasts.   Overall the FTSE 100 has edged up 2.05 points at 5600.53, with miners boosted by Goldman lifting its estimates and some metal price targets, including copper and nickel.

Unilever is the biggest riser in the leading index, up 46p to \u00a318.39 after it agreed to buy VO5 and Tresemme hair products business Alberto Culver for $3.7bn. Analysts were looking for the next bid in the food sector after reports that private equity owned United Biscuits could be sold to Shanghai-based Bright Foods. Clive Black at Shore Capital said:  Aside from general curiosity the significance of any UB deal is the read across to stocks like Greencore (buy) with its large private label activity, Northern Foods (hold) with its Fox&apos;s biscuits, Goodfellas pizza and private label sales and Premier Foods (sell) with its multitude of largely ambient brands and private label grocery goods.

As part of an 82 page report on the European hotel sector, the bank repeated its outperform recommendation on Whitbread and raised its target price from \u00a318.12 to \u00a319.20, compared to the company&apos;s closing price of \u00a316.28, up 6p. Credit Suisse believes Costa could be worth \u00a3507m or 291p a share, and said that demerging Costa from the rest of Whitbread was likely to be on the agenda of new chief executive Andy Harrison. Harrison joined Whitbread from Easyjet earlier this month and is due to take full control towards the end of November. Credit Suisse said:  We expect little immediate strategic change at Whitbread following new chief executive Andy Harrison&apos;s arrival. [However] a separation of Costa from the group looks likely in the medium term. We believe Costa will be capable of supporting its own growth objectives from 2012 and believe the business is worth 291p per share.  [Otherwise] the possible separation of pub restaurants from Premier Inn remains a possibility but we see no immediate catalyst to justify such an outcome. We reiterate our positive view on Whitbread following 6% and 9% upgrades to 2011 and 2012 earnings per share driven by stronger revenue per available room and margin assumptions.   Elsewhere software group Sage topped the FTSE 100 risers, up 8.1p at 266.3p. Barclays began coverage of the European software sector and gave Sage an equalweight rating, but traders also heard talk of possible bid interest for the company, with a price of 380p a share mentioned. Autonomy added 29p to \u00a318.00 and Micro Focus International rose 19.2p to 385.2p as Barclays put an overweight recommendation on both businesses. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 25.06 points lower at 5573.42 as worries about European sovereign debt outweighed the positive impact of a spate of takeovers. The decision by Moody&apos;s to cut its ratings on Anglo Irish Bank&apos;s debt unsettled investors ahead of an announcement on the cost of the Irish bank bailout, expected on Thursday.

The former Goldman Sachs banker John Thornton, the non-executive director who lost out in the race to become HSBC&apos;s chair, is thought to be preparing to tell the board that he does not intend to stand for re-election at next year&apos;s meeting. With the board assembling in Shanghai for a scheduled meeting on Wednesday , Thornton will be given an opportunity to make his intentions clear after days of speculation about deep rifts within the board of one of the world&apos;s biggest banks. How to limit the damage caused by the tussle for the helm of HSBC will be the main topic on the agenda. The board has already been rocked by leaks threatening to destabilise a bank that weathered the financial crisis without a state bailout. Thornton had been a candidate for the chairman&apos;s seat, which is being vacated by Stephen Green in December to allow him to join the government as trade minister. But the bank chose its finance director, Douglas Flint, to fill the role and so opened up the position of chief executive after Mike Geoghegan decided to retire on being told he would not get the job. The current head of investment banking, Stuart Gulliver, is to become chief executive at the end of the year. Leaks that suggested Geoghegan had threatened to quit if he was not made chairman \u2013 strenuously denied by him and the bank \u2013 forced HSBC to convene an emergency meeting by phone on Friday and announce the boardroom changes that were originally slated to be released on Wednesday after the Shanghai meeting. Asked about Thornton&apos;s position on Friday, Green said: &quot;There is no change to announce at all.&quot; Although he later conceded that there were &quot;a few questions to be answered&quot; over speculation that Thornton was seriously being considered as the next chairman but that he was unable to comment further. While Sir Simon Robertson, the former Goldman Sachs banker who had led the process to find Green&apos;s successor, confirmed that Thornton had been a candidate for chairman, he said it was &quot;very invidious&quot; to name other candidates. Green has said the board would &quot;reflect&quot; on whether an inquiry was needed into the source of the leaks, which he said were &quot;blatantly wrong&quot;. Geoghegan is leaving with cash and shares worth up to \u00a317m if the bank meets performance targets, plus a pension pot of at least \u00a313m.

And I&apos;m breaking with realistic traditions of cinematic narration by suturing different elements together to make a multi-temporal piece.&quot; We&apos;re in the Shanghai Blues restaurant in London, at the start of a four-hour journey in which the 50-year-old installation artist and film-maker will try to explain, and make me appreciate, Ten Thousand Waves, the dizzyingly complex nine-screen installation he&apos;s been working on for the past six years. I feel slightly worried. I&apos;ve not seen Waves in its entirety yet, and my guide is someone who has swallowed not just some excellent dim sum, but also the forbidding language of film theory. Julien tells me that Waves&apos;s starting point was the 23 Chinese cocklepickers who drowned in Morecambe Bay in 2004. This isn&apos;t surprising: his work has often engaged with immigrants and their journeys; his own parents came to London from Saint Lucia. In 2007, Julien made Western Union: Small Boats, a multi-screen work about &quot;clandestines&quot; trying to cross the Mediterranean from Libya to escape war and famine. Julien&apos;s dramas have always been deliberately aestheticised, striving for a poetic quality; you know you&apos;re not watching a TV news bulletin. His impressionistic Looking for Langston, about the poet of the Harlem Renaissance, Langston Hughes, won a prize at the 1989 Berlin film festival. So Waves, while mourning victims of globalisation, has a discombobulating nature. In the course of its 50 minutes, we see the great Chinese actor Maggie Cheung, best known for Hero and In the Mood for Love, play the goddess Mazu, fabled in the Fujan province from where the drowned immigrants hailed. According to myth, Mazu would assure the safety of seafaring folk as they struggled amid 10,000 waves. This failed, sad-eyed goddess becomes our spirit guide to Julien&apos;s vision of China. We go to a nearby screening room. Julien isn&apos;t the first to make a film inspired by the cocklepickers. In 2007, Nick Broomfield gave us Ghosts. &quot;I wanted to straddle the line between drama and documentary,&quot; wrote Broomfield at the time. &quot;On the one\u00a0hand, using real people and improvised dialogue; but on the other,\u00a0imposing more of a narrative structure. Drama always works best when it feels real, anyway.&quot; Julien, however, eschews realism and overt narrative. &quot;I admired Ghosts,&quot; he says. &quot;But I always think, &apos;Realism \u2013 why bother?&apos; There are other more fruitful approaches. That&apos;s why I don&apos;t lament the passing of the Film Council: it didn&apos;t engage with innovation in the moving image at all.&quot; His first move was to invite Wang Ping, the Shanghai-born Chinese-American poet, to England, to write a poem about Morecambe Bay. Called Small Boats, it is intoned over Julien&apos;s images; music from Jah Wobble and the Chinese Dub Orchestra also features. At one point, Wang&apos;s verse about the immigrants widens its focus: We know the tolls: 23, Rockaway, NY;  58, Dover, England; 18, Shenzhen; 25,  South Korea; and many more. We know the methods: walk, swim, fly,  metal container, back of a lorry,  ship&apos;s hold. We know how they died: starved, raped,  dehydrated, drowned, suffocated,  homesick, heartsick, worked to death,  working to death. We know we may end in the same boat. Julien visited China repeatedly, to immerse himself in its culture. &quot;When I was a kid, I watched kung fu films and later I watched lots of Chinese cinema, but I&apos;d never spent time there. I&apos;m an outsider looking in, I guess.&quot; He steeped himself in the mythology of the south-east, met up with artists in Shanghai whom he roped into his project, and attended a conference of artists called Farewell to Post-Colonialism. We settle down to watch a one-screen, miniature version of Waves. The screen before us splits into nine sections across which images flit, dissolve and riff off one another. Editing it, I suggest, must have been the very devil. &quot;There&apos;s a very good piece of software for editing multi-screen, time-based installations,&quot; says Julien. Of course there is. When Waves receives its UK premiere in October, at London&apos;s Hayward Gallery, there will be nine screens arranged at angles on the ground floor: a micro-labyrinth through which spectators will be able to wander. But they will never see what I experience here: a simultaneous vision of the whole work. &quot;That&apos;s what I mean by frustrating the ontological gaze,&quot; says Julien. &quot;In the gallery, you won&apos;t be able to see the whole work at once, so any narrative you establish is necessarily fragmented.&quot; &apos;They subverted me and I liked it&apos; Julien has choreographed viewers in this way before. &quot;In one work, I put chairs in the middle of several screens so you have to look over your shoulder to see the screen behind. The spectators would move chairs to the side so they could see the whole thing. They subverted me, which I liked.&quot; The freedom Julien gives his spectators, he says, makes them co-conspirators in his project, each creating their own artwork before they hit the gift shop. The installation moves from harrowing recordings of emergency calls at the time of the tragedy to lovely images of Beijing-born master calligrapher Gong Fagen at work; there are ghost stories, reconstructions of pre-war Shanghai movies, and flickering images of Pudong, the Shanghai district that has become China&apos;s hub of crony capitalism (one economist recently described Shanghai as &quot;the world&apos;s most successful Potemkin metropolis&quot; \u2013 meaning there is little behind the moneyed facade). Julien fits a great deal into 50 minutes: not just the tragedy of human trafficking, but a shorthand, parodic account of China&apos;s march towards modernity. Julien has certainly done something innovative with the moving image here: the relationship between each of the screens is redolent of that between orchestral instruments, allowing for contrapuntal effects as well as variations on and restatements of earlier themes. The images are sumptuous Sino stereotypes, though: at one moment, we seem to be watching a simulacrum of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; at another, a recreation of the east-meets-west clubland of 1920s Shanghai (complete with silk dress-clad prostitutes waylaying fedora-wearing clients). Hasn&apos;t Julien fallen prey to depicting China through western eyes, making it unedifyingly exotic? &quot;No! They&apos;re parodic of those stereotypes. They&apos;re representations of representations, subversions of a western exotic.&quot; Tea on a balcony facing east As if to prove the point, we watch a striking sequence in which Cheung seems to be floating, goddess-like, over British seas and Pudong alike. But then a man in a red hoodie wanders into shot, working the wires that hold Cheung aloft. Any suspension of disbelief about the high-flying white-robed deity is extinguished. So yes, her representation is subverted. &quot;I thought, &apos;Why not do this? Why not have a multi-temporal thing where you can see the crew filming in a Shanghai studio backlot from the 20s?&apos; I wanted to draw attention to artifice and, at the same time, show the skills of the people who aren&apos;t usually regarded as artists. They guy who kept Maggie afloat was doing something very skilled, very artistic.&quot; We head to the Victoria Miro gallery,\u00a0where Julien&apos;s accompanying photographs to Waves are being hung: they are huge images you&apos;d readily take for exotic depictions of China, past and present, if you hadn&apos;t heard the artist explain why they&apos;re not. I finish by taking tea on the balcony with this black, gay, film-theory swallowing graduate of St Martin&apos;s art college, now a globetrotting art-world\u00a0doyen, eternally seeking new ways of looking. From the balcony, we\u00a0gaze out towards the East End and\u00a0the Bow estate where Julien grew up. He has come a long way. Will his family be at the show&apos;s opening? &quot;My sister and her children will, and that&apos;ll be great. But\u00a0mum probably won&apos;t.&quot; He shrugs.\u00a0&quot;She doesn&apos;t have to if it&apos;s not\u00a0her thing.&quot; This is a shame: she&apos;ll\u00a0miss one of the most mesmerising experiences her adopted\u00a0home city has to offer today. \u2022 Ten Thousand Waves, part of Move: Choreographing You, is at the Hayward Gallery, London SE1 (0844 875 0073), 13 October to 9 January.

He begins to recover, but can no longer communicate in Chinese, reverting to the halting English he first spoke as a child in the US. This proves disastrous for his relationship with his wife Zhou Meiling and small son Pang Pang.

The Canal, by Lee Rourke (Melville House,\u00a0\u00a39.99) A man sits, day by enervating day, on a canalside bench near a rundown estate in north London. At first his only companions are the coots, moorhens and tiresomely symbolic swans of the polluted river. He observes the manoeuvres of expensively dressed office workers in the building opposite. He makes ponderous pronouncements to himself; compares the thud of bricks thrown by the local feral youth to the sound of falling bodies from the World Trade Centre. His study is boredom \u2013 he even quits his job to pursue it. He is joined on the bench by an enigmatic young woman, intense of speech, in love with the gratuitous soul-sickness of the post-millennium age. As, it seems, is this book, burdened with mock profundities and anorak anxieties. There is some humour \u2013 swiftly gagged. What remains is urban disaffection writ large in prose both unedited and unedifying. Saraswati Park, by Anjali Joseph (Fourth Estate, \u00a312.99) A shabby Bombay suburb is the subject of a subtle novel infused with multiple regrets. Mohan and Lakshmi, largely indifferent to each other now their children have dispersed, welcome Mohan&apos;s nephew Ashish, a directionless final-year English undergraduate, to share their small apartment. Mohan, a letter-writer for illiterates at the GPO, reads Henry James and daydreams; Lakshmi is bullied by her autocratic older brother and in thrall to daytime television. Ashish is willingly seduced \u2013 first by a wealthy fellow student, and then, by an older tutor. Very little happens, yet how true to life it seems \u2013 the background of disconsolate rains and chattering mynah birds entirely Bombay, the preoccupations universal. &quot;Mohan thought, &apos;A man goes on a journey . . .&apos; He had no idea what the rest of the sentence was&quot; \u2013 a typical statement in a generous book where absolutes are neither sought nor found. London Triptych, by Jonathan Kemp (Myriad Editions, \u00a37.99) Kemp&apos;s history of male prostitution is an ambitious work in which he aims to &quot;give voice to the voiceless&quot;. London is the liberating focus for three characters spanning a century. Jack Rose is catapulted from an East End slum to train as a rent boy, going on to become one of the shadowy &quot;panthers&quot; with which Oscar Wilde surrounded himself before his disgrace. Colin Read, a repressed artist in the introverted 1950s, is inspired and terrified by Gore, the man who models for him. The most poignant section of the narrative belongs to David, a late-90s clubber with a poet&apos;s soul, betrayed by his lover, and in prison. It&apos;s fast-moving and sharply written, though the frequent explicit sex scenes make the whole seem jadedly one-dimensional, and an improbable intersection of the main figures is a clumsy detraction.", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-01T23:15:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/03/premier-foods-shareholders-shakeup-call", "sentences": ["Traders think British food companies are significantly undervalued and point to recent action in the sector such as the Kraft takeover of Cadbury, and the disclosure last week that Bright Food of Shanghai is in exclusive talks to buy private equity-owned United Biscuits, maker of Jaffa Cakes and McVitie&apos;s biscuits."], "title": "Premier Foods investors pile on pressure for asset sales to cut debts", "article": "Shareholders have opened fire on Premier Foods for failing to cut debts of \u00a31.4bn and are calling for a shake-up at the company that produces brands such as Hovis, Mr Kipling, Bisto, Branston and Homepride. The calls come as Premier Foods&apos;s share price has crashed to 16p \u2013 close to an all-time low \u2013 and as new chairman Ronnie Bell, a former boss of Kraft in Europe, prepares to take over from David Kappler tomorrow. The company is viewed as a potential takeover target, despite its \u00a3400m pension deficit. &quot;They need to sell parts of the business to bring in cash to pay down debt, and urgently,&quot; said one investor who asked not to be named. Several other UK shareholders said there was growing impatience about Premier&apos;s lack of progress in making asset sales to cut debt, which soared after it bought Hovis bread-maker RHM in 2007 for \u00a31.2bn. Shareholders have also questioned the future of chief executive Robert Schofield, but he is understood to have the backing of Bell. Analysts say Premier&apos;s share price performance since flotation at 215p in 2004 has been disastrous and the food group&apos;s market value has fallen to \u00a3400m. Martin Deboo at Investec Securities said: &quot;We don&apos;t think the \u00a3100m of organic free cash flow is sufficient to de-leverage Premier quickly enough.&quot; Deboo has identified disposals worth \u00a3300m that could help to cut debt. In 2009, amid fears the company could breach its banking covenants, Schofield masterminded a financial restructuring that raised \u00a3400m from a cash call on shareholders. Premier has scrapped dividend payments and this summer revealed it had plunged into the red after making wrong-way bets on derivatives linked to its acquisition of RHM. &quot;Bell has a lot on his plate and needs to get Premier&apos;s balance sheet into a much stronger state,&quot; said one broker. A spokesman for Premier said the group was &quot;not against&quot; disposals as long as they made financial sense and did not reduce the company&apos;s overall profitability. Premier added: &quot;We are 150% engaged in reducing our debts and liabilities.&quot; But Investec said recently: &quot;We think Premier has been guilty of too much complacency in the past over the gravity of balance sheet issues, and the imperative to slim down the business via disposals.&quot; With US investors Warburg Pincus, Franklin Templeton and Paulson now shareholders, speaking for 40%, Investec believes there will be &quot;a much keener focus on delivering value&quot;. Speculation has swirled in the City that Premier is a takeover target, with Associated British Foods, Kraft of the US and Tata of India cited as possible bidders. Traders think British food companies are significantly undervalued and point to recent action in the sector such as the Kraft takeover of Cadbury, and the disclosure last week that Bright Food of Shanghai is in exclusive talks to buy private equity-owned United Biscuits, maker of Jaffa Cakes and McVitie&apos;s biscuits. Premier has grown by leaps and bounds under Schofield: in 2006, it paid \u00a3460m for Campbell&apos;s UK and Irish business, adding Oxo, Batchelors, Homepride and Fray Bentos to its range. RHM brought in labels such as Ambrosia, Loyd Grossman and Bisto. In August, Schofield bowed to investor pressure and told pension trustees and unions he wants to ditch the group&apos;s gold-plated retirement scheme for its 17,000-strong workforce to help cut borrowings. Premier has a handful of pension schemes with total assets of about \u00a32.5bn. According to the latest accounts, the schemes showed a combined funding deficit of \u00a3431m. Management has already secured concessions from pension trustees over how speedily the deficit must be repaired. It is committed to pay in \u00a340m a year up to 2014. Further payments are capped at least until 2022. However, in the coming months the company and pension trustees will receive a triennial valuation for the deficit. This could show a considerably worse funding hole compared with the last triennial valuation, conducted in April 2007. The biggest shortfall is expected in the \u00a32bn pension scheme relating to RHM.

But the drive from Chonqing airport into the city centre was jaw dropping \u2013 simultaneously awesome and terrifying. For miles and miles, through one valley after another, towering cranes tend to the crowded skeletal skyscrapers. Pylons march across every hill, roads and flyovers push between the tower blocks. The hoardings shielding the unending construction show blue lakes, red flowers, green forests, white waterfalls \u2013 all against a backdrop of unremitting grey. Nearer downtown, completed skyscrapers that would be landmarks in any sane city line the road.

Chongqing is Gotham meets MegaCityOne meets the 21st century \u2013 China&apos;s century. I&apos;m told 1,000 cars a day join the roads \u2013 from the traffic jams I can believe it \u2013 and that city maps are out of date the moment they are printed. The municipality is home to 33 million people and its economy grew 14% in 2009. This growth-on-steroids needs energy, steel, concrete, and the murky air is thick with the pollution that comes with that. What is driving the city&apos;s growth? The manufacturing of 1m cars and 2m motorbikes a year, with the help of Ford and Suzuki; the burgeoning chemicals industry (BP); and many of the 1.2-1.5 million people who lost their homes when the Three Gorges dam flooded the valleys. Ironically, I&apos;m here to give a talk for the British Council about reporting on low-carbon living to local journalists, officials and academics. I&apos;m wondering where I can possibly start. But, as the evening flows, green shoots appear. Chongqing has recognised its problem with a five-point action plan to make the city &quot;safe, smooth [to travel], liveable, forested and healthy&quot;. New buildings must meet tough energy efficiency standards or they cannot be sold. And from next year a train with an average speed of 100mph will rocket people the 900 miles to Shanghai. Reading the state press I am told of a green energy symposium in Shanxi province - synonymous with coal \u2013 that was attended by 30,000 delegates. Across the country, over 1500 small coal mines will be closed in 2010 (leaving 10,000 open). Arriving in Kunming, site of the biggest solar plant in China, the rooftops twinkle with thousands of the glossy black panels. The rumour is that the city has spent 30 years of environmental funds in just three. Outside the city, in the village of Shalang, methane pools are converting organic waste into natural gas for heating and cooking. And in Chengdu, the local newspaper received 3 million entries to a low-carbon living quiz competition. So lots of green action. But, as is comprehensively conveyed in my colleague Jonathan Watts&apos;s excellent new book, When A Billion Chinese Jump, the black is outpacing the green when it comes to development in China. The country leads the world in wind and solar power manufacturing and installation, but is also the world&apos;s most polluting nation, with emissions set to rise for many years. Asking Chinese people about global warming and what to do about it, I find no scepticism about the basic premise that human&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions are causing climate change. But there is either apathy \u2013 &quot;people don&apos;t care about climate change, they don&apos;t think it is something that means they have to change their lives&quot; or a blame-the-west attitude &quot;You have been polluting for decades \u2013 we are just starting on this new life.&quot; That new life is distinctly familiar. The burgeoning Chinese cities I visited looked very like many in the US \u2013 high-rise, car-obsessed and with fast-food outlets and global fashion brands on every corner. The carbon footprint of that high-consumption new life is huge, which is why China&apos;s per-person emissions in some places has already surpassed those in the west. But before you think I am China-bashing, consider this. Half the country still lives in rural poverty and perhaps a third of China&apos;s carbon emissions are expelled making the goods consumed by us by the container-load in the west. Those rural poor have a right to prosper. There is also evidence that Chinese people are in fact less apathetic and reluctant to act then we are in rich industrialised countries, probably because they live with smog, droughts and floods we rarely experience. And there are those green shoots. Back in Hong Kong I see something green I can&apos;t possibly imagine in the UK.

Prada, a brand more counterfeited than sold in China, is contemplating a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange to take advantage of the world&apos;s fastest-growing market of upwardly mobile, status seeking, brand conscious consumers. In the declining west, large transfers of wealth towards the already rich over the last two decades have ensured that such companies still have plenty of customers in the developed economies; but for sheer numbers and future potential, Asia is impossible to beat. Earlier this year the Chinese Academy of Social Science&apos;s business blue book declared that China had passed the US to become the world&apos;s second largest market for luxury goods. China&apos;s luxury spending had reached $9.7bn, more than 27% of the global market; and on current trends, the report predicted, China will be number one within five years. Small wonder that in April, Louis Vuitton opened two stores in Shanghai on the same day; that sales of Bentleys are booming in China; that Audi and other upmarket car companies attribute their buoyant results to growth in Asia; and that French couture houses, private jet manufacturers, peddlers of luxury yachts and other big ticket items are eyeing an Asian future. The average Asian person (and certainly the average Chinese person) may be a great deal poorer than his or her European counterpart, but the rich are very rich and there are more of them in Asia than anywhere else: their numbers are up 26% on last year to 3 million, with China alone accounting for 477,000 acknowledged millionaires. The true figure may well be much higher. The fuzziness that surrounds economic data in China was highlighted by another recent, startling report. In his second examination of China&apos;s &quot;grey economy&quot; \u2013 the undeclared wealth squirrelled away by China&apos;s luckier citizens \u2013 Professor Wang Xiaolu, deputy director of the China Reform Foundation, concluded that in 2008 China&apos;s hidden cash amounted to 10 trillion yuan, equivalent to 30% of China&apos;s GDP. If he is right, it means that the disposable income of China&apos;s consumers is some 90% higher than official estimates. That is good news for the retailers of handbags, but whether it is good news for China is a matter for debate. The publication of the business blue book triggered a series of anguished responses in the Chinese press, questioning whether this was a sign of healthy development or, more likely, of the dramatic increase in inequality that has been a striking feature of China&apos;s economic rise. The People&apos;s Republic has gone from being one of the world&apos;s most equal to one of the world&apos;s most unequal societies, with a Gini coefficient of 0.46, well above the internationally recognised warning line of 0.4. Professor Wang&apos;s work, which might have served to correct the impression of extreme inequality, in fact did the opposite. The bulk of the grey income, he confirmed, was in the hands of the already affluent. This matters, not only to the individuals and households affected, but also to China&apos;s leaders. They are worried about increasing social tensions as a result of inequality and corruption. They are also, since the global crisis, urgently trying to rebalance China&apos;s economy away from the export-led growth of the last 30 years, and towards increased domestic consumption. But the Chinese consumer has proved slow to spend, partly because most Chinese people, perfectly reasonably, worry about putting their slim surpluses aside to meet educational, health and pension expenses, and partly because they do not have enough to begin with. It is not for Prada and other purveyors of luxury items to worry about that, but it is certainly causing headaches in Beijing.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Globalisation", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Equality", "Society", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-07T20:30:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/09/andy-murray-shanghai-masters", "sentences": ["The view and the prospects are brighter this week in coastal Shanghai, where Murray has a good chance in the penultimate Masters event to join Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic among the eight best players in the world at the O2 Arena in Greenwich from 21 November.", "If he slips up in Shanghai \u2013 he is on Nadal&apos;s side of the draw, has a bye in the first round and plays the winner of the world No37, Radek Stepanek, and the Chinese qualifier Bai Yan, on Tuesday \u2013 there are more points on offer in Paris in a month&apos;s time, but that would be an ugly route to the O2."], "title": "Andy Murray aims for mastery in Shanghai", "article": "Through the stinging Chinese smog, Andy Murray is looking towards London, where a place in the World Tour Finals on the banks of the Thames next month dangles like the shiniest consolation prize in sport. There&apos;s $5m (\u00a33.13m) at stake and his No4 world ranking, not to mention a chance to revive a season that has witnessed more highs and lows than The Star Spangled Banner. Murray, who turned his game around substantially on the American hardcourt leg (without a coach) before his disappointing exit at Flushing Meadows last month, crashed out of the China Open in Beijing on Friday, the fourth straight day of what international health monitors called &quot;hazardous&quot; smog. The Scot admits he played poorly in losing in straight sets to Ivan Ljubicic, praising the 31-year-old Croat for his solid serve, but no amount of camouflage will disguise his concern at being bested from the baseline to the net by a player 11 places below him in the ATP rankings. Murray, who has one of the best returns in the game, won only 12 points on Ljubicic&apos;s serve, going down 6-3, 6-2 in little more than an hour. He said after his tough first-round win over Albert Monta\u00f1\u00e9s that he had identified the parts of his game he needed to work on; so, apparently, did Ljubicic. The view and the prospects are brighter this week in coastal Shanghai, where Murray has a good chance in the penultimate Masters event to join Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic among the eight best players in the world at the O2 Arena in Greenwich from 21 November. To put their seasons in perspective, Nadal qualified as long ago as June, when winning the French Open in his grand sweep of the game&apos;s major clay, grass and hardcourt summer trophies; Federer made his place safe at Flushing Meadows; and on Friday in the horrendously polluted Chinese capital, en route to defending his Open title there today, Djokovic joined them. The rest of the queue is tightly bunched and Murray is at the head of it. While he is only 70 points in front of Robin Soderling, the real dogfight will be between the eighth\u2011placed Fernando Verdasco and his Spanish compatriot David Ferrer. Verdasco leads 7-4 in that series. Murray will make it comfortably enough but he needs to lift his game after arriving in China at the start of the week complaining of jet lag and an unspecified bug. If he slips up in Shanghai \u2013 he is on Nadal&apos;s side of the draw, has a bye in the first round and plays the winner of the world No37, Radek Stepanek, and the Chinese qualifier Bai Yan, on Tuesday \u2013 there are more points on offer in Paris in a month&apos;s time, but that would be an ugly route to the O2. Nadal is still the man.

The building was the showpiece of the Games \u2013 and therefore of modern China. Entwining momentum with sturdiness, chaos with order, its vortex of 42,000 tonnes of steel latticework is a marvel of imagination and engineering, one of the great new buildings in the world. How strange, then, that when it came to meeting Ai Weiwei, the man who designed it, he turned out to be a gentle, thoughtful, but bear-like man. The architects of the stadium, Herzog &amp; de Meuron of Switzerland, called him the project&apos;s &quot;creative consultant&quot;, but Ai said, characteristically, of his role: &quot;I don&apos;t need a title \u2013 I would prefer &apos;the Untitled&apos;.&quot; Ai is China&apos;s leading artist, one of the most remarkable in the world, and on Tuesday, his work arrives for the first time in Britain, perhaps the most awaited event yet to be unveiled in Tate Modern&apos;s Turbine Hall. The timing of Ai exhibiting in London could not be more fortuitous: his installation opens four days after the Nobel peace prize committee in Stockholm had shown itself less enamoured of China&apos;s regime than politicians and businessmen when awarding\u00a0the prize to imprisoned dissident Liu Xiaobo. Ai is based in a studio complex in a peculiar and intriguing corner of Beijing. 798 Arts Zone and the series of studios beyond it constitute a cranny where old streets and buildings have been spared by the bulldozer and turned into a kind of trendy theme park in which the authorities seem not only to permit but \u2013 unusually for them \u2013 encourage cultural activity. This is where the pavement cafes are found, along with art galleries and boutiques that sell Mao chic clothing (silk dressing gowns printed with pictures of the Red Guard). His father was Ai Qing, a painter and China&apos;s leading poet, who had worked in Paris and was influenced by Gogol and Dostoevsky. He was first imprisoned \u2013 as a communist \u2013 by the nationalist regime and then as a dissident during Chairman Mao&apos;s cultural revolution. In 1967, when Ai was 10, Ai Qing and his family were exiled to a hard labour camp in a remote village at Xinjiang, in the Gobi desert. &quot;There,&quot; says Ai, &quot;my father was punished by being made to clean the public toilets for five years. He was beaten and kept in very severe physical deprivation.&quot; Ai Qing died in 1996. Such an upbringing obviously moulded the artist Ai became. &quot;I know what I know,&quot; Ai says, &quot;because, as a child, I have seen the opposite of freedom. I have seen many people killed, the results of stupidity and cruelty, and the results of courage.&quot; In 1978, Ai enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy, before founding an avant garde circle called the Stars. In his third year, in 1981, Ai won a scholarship to go to the US, working in New York&apos;s East Village, where he lived for 12 years and, he says, &quot;found myself among friends, artistically \u2013 I wanted to stay forever&quot;. But in 1993, when his father fell ill, Ai returned to China despite his green card, establishing a studio called East Village, then his current one, Real/Fake \u2013 an oblique pun on the name of an exhibition he staged in Shanghai called Fuck Off . There, his\u00a0 installations included painting a Coca-Cola label on to an ancient Han vase and dropping another to smash it, a photograph of which featured on the cover of a book entitled So Sorry. Another part of the studio&apos;s programme involved Ai&apos;s wife, Lu Qing, lifting up her skirt and showing her knickers to the portrait of Chairman Mao that presides over Tiananmen Square along with modern China&apos;s other icons, Nike and Valentino. \u00a0These antics were not to the taste of every artist on the Chinese fringe, some now seeking to acknowledge and explain, rather than challenge, the new economic order. One critic, Xu Bing, told the New Yorker: &quot;These things [Ai&apos;s installations] are not without value&quot;, but although China &quot;still has a lot of problems, like the disparity between rich and poor\u2026 it really has solved many problems. China&apos;s economy is developing so quickly \u2013 I&apos;m interested in why this has happened. Not everyone can be like Ai Weiwei, because then China wouldn&apos;t be able to develop, right?&quot; It was a fine stroke by Herzog &amp; de Meuron to turn Ai from rascal of the Chinese alternative into the muse for China&apos;s second most recognisable monument after the Great Wall. It meant Ai could do what most Chinese cannot: speak his mind about the regime. On the eve of the Olympics, he said: &quot;I feel outraged at the Chinese government and I am disgusted by the way power is abused in this country.&quot; But the Olympics, he said, were &quot;a good opportunity for greater transparency in China&quot;. Ai&apos;s problems with the regime continued, ironically, because of his greatest gift to Chinese prowess, the Bird&apos;s Nest. He&apos;s never visited the building he inspired: &quot;I have never been in a stadium in my life,&quot; Ai says. &quot;I doubt I will ever go into the Bird&apos;s Nest.&quot; He left Beijing for the Olympics, &quot;not as a boycott \u2013 as some have said,&quot; he explained. &quot;I don&apos;t want to have to talk about it all the time. I am much more interested in what is going to happen to [the stadium] after the Games. I would like it to become a place where people like to go, bring their children or can come for mass weddings, or maybe mass divorces or, best of all, to have barbecues together.&apos; But his critique goes much deeper than either slogans or subversive barbecues and is not restricted to China. \u00a0It is in the stadium design itself: one of the most striking things about the Bird&apos;s Nest is the way the latticework makes the arena open to the exterior. Many observed that this was a\u00a0way of keeping the smog from settling, by admitting a breeze. But there was another reason, too, Ai says. &quot;It is intended to be a statement about the need for a more open society, open discussion, greater transparency. I don&apos;t believe you can relate architecture to political statements, but architecture will always relate to ideology. And I do not see ideology as a matter of left and right, or east and west, any more. I see the tension in ideology,&quot; he says, &quot;as being between a more interesting state of mind and a more dreadful state of mind. The artist should be for the interesting against the dreadful.&quot; Thinking of this kind makes Ai not only a great artist, but a thinker of the world&apos;s next political and intellectual phase, beyond the turgid babble of contemporary politics. One of his recent tweets to 48,000 followers read: &quot;One day people will wake up and find themselves unable to believe that we have been through an age of stupidity and humiliation&quot;.\u00a0 His recent Study of Perspective features Ai&apos;s middle finger stuck up at the White House and Tiananmen Square. The Chinese authorities remain acutely aware of Ai&apos;s complex and innovative heresy and in China, an &quot;edgy&quot; artist has to face greater challenges than mockery or dismissive critics. While he was exhibiting in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, in August 2009, Ai&apos;s hotel door was kicked down in the early hours by police goons who then beat him about the head. Ai&apos;s &quot;installation&quot; in the province was a public list of more than 5,000 schoolchildren killed by the 2008 earthquake, based on door-to-door inquiries (the regime\u00a0steadfastly refused to disclose how many lives were lost; it is a\u00a0&quot;national secret&quot;). A month later, in Munich, Ai suffered a haemorrhage as a result of the blow. He was in the Bavarian capital to cover the walls of the Haus der Kunst with thousands of brightly coloured school backpacks spelling out Chinese characters quoting the lament of a mother of a dead child in Sichaun interviewed as part of Ai&apos;s project: &quot;She\u00a0lived happily for seven years in this world.&quot; When we finished our conversation in 2008, Ai said he would next have to choose between taking a nap and playing with his beloved cat, whose name is Come Over. And 18 months ago, Ai broke his resolution never to sire a child under the present Chinese regime \u2013 Lu Qing bore him a son. This week, this kind of man, this kind of artist, unveils what he has to say in London, and whatever it is, may we take note.\u00a0", "tags": ["Ai Weiwei"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-09T23:09:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/10/intellectuals-detained-nobel-celebration", "sentences": ["Jiang Danwen, the deputy secretary general of ICPC, said police had warned him not to comment on the prize and were now parked outside his Shanghai home."], "title": "Intellectuals held in China crackdown after Liu Xiaobo gets Nobel peace prize", "article": "More than 30 Chinese intellectuals have been detained, warned or placed under house arrest in a crackdown aimed at stifling celebration following the award of the Nobel peace prize to the imprisoned democracy advocate Liu Xiaobo.

The authorities appear to have focused particular attention on the ICPC, of which Liu was a member. The group&apos;s deputy secretary general Jiang Bo is among at least 10 members who have been warned. Two are under house arrest and one \u2013 Zhao Changqing \u2013 has been detained. Supporters hope that Liu Xia will collect the prize on behalf of her husband at the award ceremony in Europe later this year. If she were then to be denied re-entry into China, they say this might pave the way for the authorities to release Liu Xiaobo before the end of his jail term so he could join her overseas. This scenario seems optimistic given the Chinese government&apos;s recent unwillingness to release political prisoners, but the award has inspired hope. Jiang Danwen, the deputy secretary general of ICPC, said police had warned him not to comment on the prize and were now parked outside his Shanghai home. He said, however, that the inconvenience was worthwhile. &quot;Actually I feel very happy. The reaction shows the award has really shocked the government.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Nobel peace prize", "Liu Xiaobo", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-10T14:27:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/10/nikolay-davydenko-nadal-federer-shanghai", "sentences": ["Nikolay Davydenko&apos;s English lends itself to chuckles and he acknowledges his season has dwindled away to irrelevance \u2013 but Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer know the erratic Russian will be one dangerous joker in the Shanghai Masters this week."], "title": "Nikolay Davydenko will play a better game than he talks in Shanghai", "article": "Nikolay Davydenko&apos;s English lends itself to chuckles and he acknowledges his season has dwindled away to irrelevance \u2013 but Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer know the erratic Russian will be one dangerous joker in the Shanghai Masters this week.

David Nalbandian is the only other player to manage that feat in two separate official tournaments. Davydenko&apos;s season, though, has veered between promise and serial disappointment and, although holding on to sixth place in the ATP world rankings, three months out with an injured wrist spiked not only his chances in the major tournaments but any hope of returning to the O2 next month. He had his Chinese audience amused and bemused when he admitted in broken English fractured into further shards, no doubt, en\u00a0route to Mandarin: &quot;I know I will not qualify for London this year [so] just enjoying now my last couple tournaments what I play this year and take rest before early, just practising, preparation for the next season in December.&quot; If that translates roughly as don&apos;t put your rickshaw on my winning here, it would be as well not to take Davydenko seriously; he will be dead keen to resurrect something from the ashes of a wretched summer. He expressed mild surprise that Federer, who has not played since losing to Novak Djokovic at the US Open, had not arrived early to practice for a tournament he has played nine times. The Swiss will need no incentive beyond pride, though, to get his game back to working order when he does arrive tomorrow. He is burning to reclaim his No1 position and a fifth victory here would convince him it is not an unreasonable ambition. Nadal, who beat Ga\u00ebl Monfils to win in Tokyo today and is on the crest of a surreal wave of form, is another late arrival, along with Andy Murray. The tournament organisers plan to showcase the top four \u2013 Federer, Nadal, Murray and Djokovic \u2013 on what they are billing as Super Wednesday. Davydenko does not figure in those plans and instead will be the warm-up act on Tuesday \u2013 probably against the Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky.

The cancellation was announced today after news that Liu Xiaobo&apos;s wife had been placed under house arrest as part of a crackdown by the Chinese authorities aimed at stifling celebration following the award. Liu Xia was allowed to meet her husband after the announcement of the award on Friday and told followers that he was dedicating the prize to the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre. But later in an update on Twitter and in emails to friends she said that since returning from the visit she had not been allowed to leave her apartment and that her phone had been cut. Since then, contact with her has been cut off. She joins more than 30 Chinese intellectuals who have been detained, warned or placed under tight surveillance since the Nobel committee announced that it was giving the award to Liu. The Norwegian minister of fisheries and coastal affairs, Lisbeth Berg-Hansen, arrived in China today for a week-long visit to the World Expo in Shanghai, said the Norwegian ministry&apos;s spokesman, Magnus Hodne. Berg-Hansen was supposed to meet China&apos;s vice-minister for fisheries on Wednesday but the Chinese cancelled the meeting, Hodne said, adding he did not know the reason. The democracy campaign Freedom Now urged world leaders to condemn the crackdown in China. The Dalai Lama criticised China&apos;s response, Japan&apos;s Kyodo news agency reported. China&apos;s government &quot;must change&quot; and &quot;does not appreciate different opinions&quot;, it quoted him saying. Freedom Now pointed out that Liu&apos;s wife, Liu Xia, had not been charged yet was not allowed to leave her apartment and had been denied contact with friends and the media. &quot;Liu Xia is under enormous pressure,&quot; said Yang Jianli, one of Liu&apos;s lawyers and an adviser with Freedom Now. &quot;We hope that world leaders will immediately condemn this shameful act by the Chinese government and urge Liu Xia&apos;s immediate and unconditional release.&quot; Shang Baojun, a lawyer for Liu Xiaobo, told Reuters that he had been unable to contact Liu Xia. &quot;She&apos;s probably at home with communications cut off, under surveillance - she&apos;s called it house arrest,&quot; he said. About a dozen reporters stood outside the main gate of her apartment building today blocked by security guards from entering. Supporters had hoped that Liu Xia would collect the prize on behalf of her husband at the award ceremony in Europe later this year. The Norwegian Nobel peace prize committee announced on Friday that Liu, a former literature professor who co-drafted the Charter 08 campaign for increased political liberties in China, was this year&apos;s winner. World figures including Barack Obama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the former Czech president V\u00e1clav Havel applauded the decision, but the Chinese government responded with fury as it regards Liu as a criminal. The foreign ministry summoned the Norwegian ambassador and declared the decision a &quot;blasphemy&quot; and insult to the Chinese people. Censors blacked out foreign broadcasts of the announcement and police were mobilised to quell any sign of domestic support for Liu. About 20 of those targeted by the crackdown were at a celebration party in Beijing on Friday night that was broken up by police. Three are now under eight days&apos; administrative detention for &quot;disturbing social order&quot;, while the others have been put under house arrest or heightened surveillance. State media today suggested that the prize was an example of western pique at China&apos;s economic success. &quot;The awarding of the Nobel peace prize to &apos;dissident&apos; Liu Xiaobo was nothing more than another expression of this prejudice, and behind it lies an extraordinary terror of China&apos;s rise and the Chinese model,&quot; said the Global Times.

Not only has he yet to qualify for the World Tour Finals in London next month (though missing out is an improbable if catastrophic scenario), but his likely first opponent in the Shanghai Masters on Wednesday gave him nightmares the last time they met. Radek Stepanek, ranked No30 in the world, 26 places below Murray, might not always send a chill through the upper echelons of tennis, but the 23-year-old Scot has good reason to be wary of the 31-year-old Czech. On a converted ice rink at Bercy in the Paris Masters a year ago Murray slipped up badly 14 hours after seeing off James Blake in a long, tough match that finished way past midnight. He did not get to bed until 4am after the marathon with the American. By early evening he was back on court, sweeping Stepanek aside 6\u20111 in the first set only to grow weary by the shot and lose the concluding sets 6\u20113, 6\u20114. Whether it was mood or muscle that gave up on Murray, defeat only briefly fazed him as he had already qualified for the game&apos;s end-of-season party on the banks of the Thames. Murray missed Shanghai last year with an injured wrist that had kept him out for nine weeks. Then he embarked on a run of form that took him all the way to the final of the Australian Open \u2013 via that hiccup in Paris. This year it has been much tougher and he dreads missing out on sharing the grand stage with seven of his close rivals. Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic are through, but Murray&apos;s game has gone seriously off the boil as he tries to nail down one of the five remaining places. &quot;Murray will have to at least reach the quarter-finals in Shanghai [to qualify] and maybe better depending on how the others do,&quot; the ATP statistics expert Greg Sharko said. &quot;There are still many players involved in the race and until some of them start losing, it&apos;s very difficult to [work out] exact scenarios.&quot; Murray then has to defend points in Valencia, where he won last year, and come through Bercy. Yesterday the Scot said he felt &quot;a bit better than I was&quot; after collapsing in straight sets against the world No 17, Ivan Ljubicic, in the quarter-finals of the China Open in Beijing last Friday. The smog in the capital, officially designated &quot;hazardous&quot; five days in a row, cannot have helped the unspecified illness that struck Murray down on his arrival in the country. Even though a light-grey covering hangs over Shanghai much of the time, pollution is not such a pressing issue in the coastal port, where offshore winds can budge the smog. The venue, an hour from the centre of the city, also has a retractable roof, and it came into use today when rain interrupted J\u00fcrgen Melzer&apos;s match against Tsung-Hua Yang of Taipei. The Austrian was taken to a tie-break before winning 6-4, 7-6. Stepanek should have no such struggle in the first round against the 21-year-old Chinese qualifier Yan Bai, who is coming off two minor domestic wins and is ranked No465 in the world. With 1,000 points on offer for the winner, Murray has all the incentive he needs to shrug off his China blues. He is back in Shanghai for the first time since beating Roger Federer in a terrific performance to reach the semi-finals of the Masters Cup two years ago, since when he has hit the heights and the pits. Murray said of his form: &quot;I have to see when I play my first match. I feel OK. I would like to win some matches here. It would be nice. But, you know, I&apos;ve got a pretty tough first-round match against Stepanek.&quot; It was not rhetoric to inspire a symphony but, inside, he could well be dancing a jig; trying to divine Murray&apos;s psyche is as much a challenge for the media as it can be for opponents.

It&apos;s some times hard to tell how he&apos;s feeling. He was seriously downbeat at his first press conference here yesterday afternoon, yet, when he bumped into a colleague moments later, he smiled like a kid at Christmas. It may be us (the press pack). Perhaps, en bloc, we put him on the defensive, behind a metaphorical baseline, ready to bang back replies to awkward questions until we give in and go home. For a decade, Tim Henman &quot;endured&quot; our inquiries on behalf of an expectant nation, only revealing in retirement that he wasn&apos;t always as candid as he might have been. Tim preferred to give us anodyne answers he thought we would be satisfied with. More than a few writers felt let down by Henman, an essentially decent man whose political skills didn&apos;t match his backhand. Murray, a better player than Henman, may yet prove to be a better politician. I have a feeling that, once he wins a major, the kid inside who tweets and laughs a lot, whose innocent pleasures extend to worrying about his fantasy football team and sending up members of his travelling entourage, will relax a little. Maybe then we&apos;ll understand him a bit better. Shanghai full of pleasant surprises It is two years since I first came to China, for the Beijing Olympics. What a different place it is, and how different is Shanghai from the smog-ridden, landlocked capital to the north. This extraordinary port, one-time playground of Errol Flynn and a thousand other rascals in days of prewar hedonism, is the scene of the penultimate of the nine Masters 1000 events. It is also a throbbing monument to change, good and bad, a city packed with enough bankers to start a depression and consumer goods beyond the dreams of the vast majority of the population. Shanghai is proud to have more skyscrapers than Manhattan. It is louder and dirtier, too, and cafe chat is about the rise of the Yuan and the doings of the Hang Seng index. If China does overtake the US as a superpower, this is where it will happen, not Beijing. But it is also a place whose citizens are as kind as saints and who make living in such an intense atmosphere of helter-skelter transformation a little more pleasant with their manners and humility. For a week every year, Shanghai is also the hub of the tennis world. Given the tour finale in London is only a month away, the Masters has attracted the top 20 players in the world, several of whom still have realistic hopes of making the final eight to play at the O2 Arena, alongside Rafa Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, who are already through. If Murray gets past the quarters, he should be, too, although he&apos;s at the front of a packed field. Less hopeful now is Fernando Verdasco, ranked ninth in the world and who suffered his fourth defeat in a row on Monday, going out in straight sets to the 47th-ranked Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands. You don&apos;t have to be bananas to play tennis but it helps Since landing on Planet Tennis a year ago as a full-time explorer, I&apos;ve been struck by the quirks and foibles of some of the natives. There has been no shortage of them in Shanghai this week. The local media were determined to find out what Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, a Frenchman of reassuring eccentricity, had to say on the apparently vexed subject of Chinese bananas after he beat Feliciano L\u00f3pez in the first round. Q: The last time you came to Shanghai was two years ago. In some Chinese news, it said you don&apos;t like Chinese banana. Is that true? Tsonga: I don&apos;t like what? Chinese banana? Q: Chinese banana. Tsonga: Oh, no, no, I don&apos;t have problem with Chinese banana. Because they are different? Chinese banana is different than the other one? Which brings us neatly on back to Andy ... &quot;To be honest, I think bananas are pathetic fruit,&quot; he writes in his autobiography, Hitting Back. &quot;They don&apos;t look great for a start. They&apos;re not straight and I don&apos;t like the black bit at the bottom. I&apos;m more a peaches and plums sort of guy. And apples ...&quot; That was funnier even than Maria Sharapova&apos;s banana moment in New York four years ago. After winning the US Open, she riled at the accusation that her father had sent her secret signals from the grandstand using the dreaded fruit. &quot;I believe, at the end of the day, personally, my life is not about a banana,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s not about what I wear. It&apos;s not about the friends that I have. My career right now is about winning a tennis match. And right now, I&apos;m sitting here as a US Open champion, and the last thing I think people need to worry about is a banana.&quot; Fat is a Taiwanese issue One player who used to have problems with his food is the Taiwanese wild card Yang Tsung-hua, who gave J\u00fcrgen Melzer a fright in the first round. &quot;People called me the Little Fatty,&quot; he revealed. &quot;I think that&apos;s a nickname. It feels close. That doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m really fat.&quot; He&apos;s not anymore. Yang, who has lost five kilos recently, played well enough against the 12th-ranked Austrian to go within a serve of stretching their match to three sets.

Hundreds of worldwide cleantech experts \u2013 including companies themselves \u2013 nominated the list, which also included so-called &quot;passive&quot; nominations and validations derived from analysing market data, taking votes of confidence in a company&apos;s ability to achieve high growth and high-market impact from market transactions such as investment rounds, and major customer and partnership announcements. To be on the list, companies must be independent, for-profit, cleantech companies that are not listed on any major stock exchange. In 2010, 4,616 nominations were received from 3,260 unique sources, resulting in a longlist of 3,138 companies.

Here members of the expert panel combine their votes with scores carried through from the first stage. Ultimately firms are scored on three key criteria: their innovation, their market&apos;s size and growth, and the company&apos;s ability and resources to execute its technology.

There&apos;s a name Andy Murray had not thought about going into the Shanghai Masters and tomorrow he will look across the net at the young Chinese wild card and see an opponent with nothing to lose and a potential fan base of many millions. Yan, a 21-year-old from Nanjing who has a big, flat right-handed serve (with a useful kicking second serve) and a wickedly top-spun forehand, did not reveal much about himself after an accomplished first-round dismissal of the 31-year-old Radek Stepanek, 6-3, 6-4. That is the same Stepanek, ranked 30th in the world, who, the last time he played Murray, beat him in three sets in the Paris Masters a year ago. No, Yan corrected us, he was not the best player in China \u2013 he is ranked fourth domestically \u2013 but he conceded he has won his last two local Futures tournaments, success that boosted him 277 places in the ATP world rankings in only three weeks, leaving him just 461 spots below the world No4 Murray. His win in front of maybe 200 friends and passing enthusiasts out on Court Three looked to be the biggest shock of the tournament. Still, on the evidence, it was not such a surprise. Yan broke the Czech early in both sets and held his nerve, the sign of a maturing talent. Murray had already geared himself up for revenge against Stepanek. Now he has a fresh challenge in every way \u2013 against one of his biggest fans. It lost a little in the translation, but the drift of Yen&apos;s sentiment was clear when he observed: &quot;We have been watching him since he came out. He has been our model.&quot; Presuming the royal &quot;we&quot; has not really invaded the sporting lexicon of Chinese tennis, it is safe to say the impression he gave of a humble and dedicated young professional is an accurate one. Yan&apos;s first hero was Andre Agassi (Murray&apos;s, too), and there is much of the American&apos;s blazing-eyed energy about him when he moves to finish a point. Stepanek had few answers in their first-round match and, at the end, was being aced and rattled at will. For Yan, it was his Wimbledon. The ballboys and officials could not contain their enthusiasm, nor could those fans who shouted for Yan to throw them an item of his kit. Stardom becomes him. &quot;My rival is much better than me,&quot; he whispered of Stepanek. &quot;It&apos;s my first time in a top-level tournament so it&apos;s really an unexpected performance for me.&quot; And he said of Murray: &quot;He&apos;s a talented player \u2013 much better than me. I hope to learn from him in our match, and I think it will be a good learning opportunity for me.&quot; Acknowledging Murray probably has never heard of him, Yan said: &quot;I don&apos;t think that he has any specific preparation against me. Anyway, I&apos;ll do my best.&quot; Yan has suffered from what he described as a &quot;belly&quot; injury and only returned to competition in July after two operations. &quot;I think it is an inherited problem from my parents.&quot; So the mystery lingers about Mr Yan. Murray probably would have preferred to play the devil-he-knows Stepanek, whom he has beaten consistently, Paris notwithstanding.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-12T21:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/13/andy-murray-yan-bai-shanghai", "sentences": ["Andy Murray needed a convincing return to form after crashing out so spectacularly in the quarter-finals of the Chinese Open in Beijing last week, and he just about did it in seeing off the Chinese wild card Bai Yan 6-2, 6-2 in the second round of the Shanghai Masters today."], "title": "Andy Murray clicks into gear to beat Chinese wildcard Bai Yan", "article": "Andy Murray needed a convincing return to form after crashing out so spectacularly in the quarter-finals of the Chinese Open in Beijing last week, and he just about did it in seeing off the Chinese wild card Bai Yan 6-2, 6-2 in the second round of the Shanghai Masters today. As important as the result and the performance were the 90 points Murray adds to his tally in the ATP rankings to move closer to qualifying for the World Tour Finals in London next month. This was not a complete rehabilitation but there were moments when Murray&apos;s tennis clicked very pleasingly indeed, albeit against an opponent 461 places below him in the rankings. He came to the net, hit his baseline shots cleanly and tried a few variations, notably a string of drop shots, not all of them brilliant. Murray&apos;s stated aim was to get back to form and to sew up a place in the final eight at the O2 Arena, alongside Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, who have already qualified. A win in the quarter-finals here should do it. Next up for Murray is the Frenchman J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy. If the draw goes to form, Murray is heading for a semi-final against Nadal. There were moments against Yan \u2013 who pulled off the shock of the tournament by beating the experienced Radek Stepanek in the first round on Tuesday \u2013 when Murray&apos;s wicked forehands and big serve looked as if they would blow his opponent away. But Bai, a fledgling on the ATP tour, dug in to avoid what would have been humiliation in front of his own fans. The Stadium court, which holds 15,000, was barely a quarter full and Murray was not without his supporters among the scattered fans, going on the four Saltires drapped over balconies. He raced to 4-0 in the first set, dropping only four points. Yan fought back after Murray double-faulted twice in the sixth game, then saved three set points on his own serve and one against Murray&apos;s serve before succumbing. The second set followed a similar pattern and the crowd went silent as Murray led 3-0, due largely to Yan&apos;s erratic ground strokes. Then the Chinese player, a 21-year-old novice from Nanjing, broke Murray to stem the flow, before dropping serve straight away. There was a further minor struggle as Bai hit a purple patch in the seventh game, saving two match points. He saved a third on Murray&apos;s serve before the world No4 finished it off with yet another drop shot. It was by far the best of them.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-13T10:32:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/13/china-censorship-freedom-speech", "sentences": ["Signed: Li Rui, former standing vice minister of the organisation department of the CCP central committee, member of the 12th central committee of the CCP Hu Jiwei, former director of People&apos;s Daily, standing committee member to the 7th National People&apos;s Congress, director of the Federation of Chinese Communication Institutes Jiang Ping, former head of the China University of Political Science and Law, tenured professor, standing committee member to the 7th National People&apos;s Congress, deputy director of the executive law committee of the NPC Li Pu, former deputy director of Xinhua news agency Zhou Shaoming, former deputy director of the political department of the Guangzhou military area command Zhong Peizhang, former head of the news office of the central propaganda department Wang Yongcheng, professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University Zhang Zhongpei, researcher at the Imperial Palace museum, chairman of the China Archaeological Society Du Guang, former professor at the Central Party School Guo Daojun, former editor-in-chief of China Legal Science Xiao Mo, former head of the Architecture Research Centre of the Chinese National Academy of Arts Zhuang Puming, former deputy director of People&apos;s Press Hu Fuchen, former director and editor-in-chief at China Worker&apos;s Publishing House Zhang Ding, former director of the China Social Sciences Press at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Yu You, former editor-in-chief of China Daily Ouyang Jin, former editor-in-chief of Hong Kong&apos;s Pacific magazine Yu Haocheng, former director of Masses Publishing House Zhang Qing, former director of China Cinema Publishing House Yu Yueting, former director of Fujian Television, veteran journalist Sha Yexin, former head of the Shanghai People&apos;s Art and Drama Academy, now an independent writer of the Hui ethnic minority Sun Xupei, former director of the News Research Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Xin Ziling, former director of the editorial desk at China National Defence University Tie Liu, editor-in-chief of Wangshi Weihen magazine (Scars of the Past)."], "title": "China must abandon censorship | Open letter", "article": "Dear members of the standing committee of the National People&apos;s Congress: Article 35 of China&apos;s constitution as adopted in 1982 clearly states that: &quot;Citizens of the People&apos;s Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration.&quot; For 28 years this article has stood unrealised, having been negated by detailed rules and regulations for &quot;implementation&quot;. This false democracy of formal avowal and concrete denial has become a scandalous mark on the history of world democracy. On 26 February 2003, at a meeting of democratic consultation between the standing committee of the political bureau of the central committee of the Chinese Communist party and democratic parties, not long after President Hu Jintao assumed office, he stated clearly: &quot;The removal of restrictions on the press, and the opening up of public opinion positions, is a mainstream view and demand held by society; it is natural, and should be resolved through the legislative process. If the Communist party does not reform itself, if it does not transform, it will lose its vitality and move toward natural and inevitable extinction.&quot; On 3 October, America&apos;s Cable News Network (CNN) aired an interview with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao by anchor Fareed Zakaria. Responding to the journalist&apos;s questions, Wen said: &quot;Freedom of speech is indispensable for any nation; China&apos;s constitution endows the people with freedom of speech; the demands of the people for democracy cannot be resisted.&quot; In accord with China&apos;s constitution, and in the spirit of the remarks made by Hu and Wen, we hereupon represent the following concerning the materialisation of the constitutional rights to freedom of speech and of the press. Concerning the current state of freedom of speech and press in our country We have for 61 years &quot;served as master&quot; in the name of the citizens of the People&apos;s Republic of China. But the freedom of speech and of the press we now enjoy is inferior even to that of Hong Kong before its return to Chinese sovereignty, to that entrusted to the residents of a colony. Before the handover, Hong Kong was a British colony, governed by those appointed by the Queen&apos;s government. But the freedom of speech and freedom of the press given to residents of Hong Kong by the British authorities there was not empty, appearing only on paper. It was enacted and realised. When our country was founded in 1949, our people cried that they had been liberated, that they were not their own masters. Mao Zedong said that &quot;from this moment, the people of China have stood&quot;. But even today, 61 years after the founding of our nation, after 30 years of opening and reform, we have not yet attained freedom of speech and freedom of the press to the degree enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong under colonial rule. Even now, many books discussing political and current affairs must be published in Hong Kong. This is not something that dates from the [territory&apos;s] return, but is merely an old tactic familiar under colonial rule. The &quot;master&quot; status of the people of China&apos;s mainland is so inferior. For our nation to advertise itself as having &quot;socialist democracy&quot; with Chinese characteristics is such an embarrassment. Not only the average citizen, but even the most senior leaders of the Communist party have no freedom of speech or press. Recently, Li Rui met with the following circumstance. Not long ago, the Collected Works in Memory of Zhou Xiaozhou were published, and it originally included an essay commemorating Zhou that Li had written for the People&apos;s Daily in 1981. Zhou&apos;s wife phoned Li to explain the situation: &quot;Beijing has sent out a notice. Li Rui&apos;s writings cannot be published.&quot; What incredible folly it is that an old piece of writing from a party newspaper cannot be included in a volume of collected works! Li said: &quot;What kind of country is this?! I want to cry it out: the press must be free! Such strangling of the people&apos;s freedom of expression is entirely illegal!&quot; It&apos;s not even just high-level leaders \u2013 even the premier of our country does not have freedom of speech or of the press. On 21 August 2010, Wen gave a speech in Shenzhen called, &quot;Only by pushing ahead with reforms can our nation have bright prospects.&quot; He said: &quot;We must not only push economic reforms, but also promote political reforms. Without the protection afforded by political reforms, the gains we have made from economic reforms will be lost, and our goal of modernisation cannot be realised.&quot; Xinhua news agency&apos;s official news release on 21 August, &quot;Building a beautiful future for the special economic zone&quot;, omitted the content in Wen&apos;s speech dealing with political reform. On 22 September, Wen held a dialogue in New York with American Chinese media and media from Hong Kong and Macao, and again emphasised the importance of &quot;political system reforms&quot;. Wen said: &quot;Concerning political reforms, I have said previously that if economic reforms are without the protection to be gained by political reforms, then we cannot be entirely successful, and even perhaps the gains of our progress so far will be lost.&quot; Shortly after, Wen addressed the 65th session of the United Nations general assembly, giving a speech called &quot;Recognising a true China&quot;, in which he spoke again about political reform. Late on 23 September, these events were reported on China Central Television&apos;s Xinwen Lianbo and in an official news release from Xinhua news agency. They reported only Wen&apos;s remarks on the circumstances facing overseas Chinese, and on the importance of overseas Chinese media. His mentions of political reform were all removed. For these matters, if we endeavour to find those responsible, we are utterly incapable of putting our finger on a specific person. This is the work of invisible hands. For their own reasons, they violate our constitution, often ordering by telephone that the works of such and such a person cannot be published, or that such and such an event cannot be reported in the media. The officials who make the call do not leave their names, and the secrecy of the agents is protected, but you must heed their phone instructions. These invisible hands are our central propaganda department. Right now the department is placed above the central committee of the Communist party, and above the state council. We would ask, what right does the central propaganda department have to muzzle the speech of the premier? What right does it have to rob the people of our nation of their right to know what the premier has said? Our core demand is that the system of censorship be dismantled in favour of a system of legal responsibility. The rights to freedom of speech and the press guaranteed in article 35 of our constitution are turned into mere adornments for the walls by means of concrete implementation rules such as the &quot;ordinance on publishing control&quot;. These implementation rules are, broadly speaking, a system of censorship and approvals. There are countless numbers of commandments and taboos restricting freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The creation of a press law and the abolishment of the censorship system has already become an urgent task before us. We recommend that the National People&apos;s Congress work immediately toward the creation of a press law, and that the ordinance on publishing control and local restrictions on news and publishing be annulled. Institutionally speaking, the realisation of freedom of speech and freedom of the press as guaranteed in the constitution means making media independent of the party and government organs that presently control them, thereby transforming &quot;party mouthpieces&quot; into &quot;public instruments.&quot; Therefore, the foundation of the creation of a press law must be the enacting of a system of [post facto] legal responsibility [determined according to fair laws]. We cannot again strengthen the censorship system in the name of &quot;strengthening the leadership of the party&quot;. The so-called censorship system is the system by which prior to publication one must receive the approval of party organs, allowing for publication only after approval and designating all unapproved published materials as illegal. The so-called system of legal responsibility means that published materials need not pass through approval by party or government organs, but may be published as soon as the editor-in-chief deems fit. If there are unfavourable outcomes or disputes following publication, the government would be able to intervene and determine according to the law whether there are cases of wrongdoing. In countries around the world, the development of rule of law in news and publishing has followed this path, making a transition from systems of censorship to systems of legal responsibility. There is little doubt that systems of legal responsibility mark progress over systems of censorship, and this is greatly in the favour of the development of the humanities and natural sciences, and in promoting social harmony and historical progress. England did away with censorship in 1695. France abolished its censorship system in 1881, and the publication of newspapers and periodicals thereafter required only a simple declaration, which was signed by the representatives of the publication and mailed to the office of the procurator of the republic. Our present system of censorship leaves news and book publishing in our country 315 years behind England and 129 years behind France. Our specific demands are as follows: 1. Abolish sponsoring institutions of [Chinese] media, allowing publishing institutions to operate independently; and truly implement a system in which directors and editors-in-chief are responsible for their publication units. 2. Respect journalists and make them strong. Journalists should be the &quot;uncrowned kings&quot;. The reporting of mass incidents and exposing of official corruption are noble missions on behalf of the people, and this work should be protected and supported. Immediately put a stop to the unconstitutional behaviour of various local governments and police in arresting journalists. Look into the circumstances behind the case of writer Xie Chaoping. Liang Fengmin, the party secretary of Weinan city [involved in the Xie Chaoping case] must face party discipline as a warning to others. 3. Abolish restrictions on extra-territorial supervision by public opinion by the media, ensuring the right of journalists to carry out reporting freely throughout the country. 4. The internet is an important discussion platform for information in our society and citizens&apos; views. Aside from information that truly concerns our national secrets and speech that violates a citizen&apos;s right to privacy, internet regulatory bodies must not arbitrarily delete online posts and online comments. Online spies must be abolished, the &quot;fifty-cent party&quot; must be abolished, and restrictions on anti-censorship technologies must be abolished. 5. There are no more taboos concerning our party&apos;s history. Chinese citizens have a right to know the errors of the ruling party. 6. Southern Weekly and Yanhuang Chunqiu should be permitted to restructure as privately operated pilot programmes in the independent media. The privatisation of newspapers and periodicals is the natural direction of political reforms. History teaches us: when rulers and deliberators are highly unified, when the government and the media are both surnamed &quot;party&quot;, and when the party sings for its own pleasure, it is difficult to connect with the will of the people and attain true leadership. From the time of the great leap forward to the time of the cultural revolution, newspapers, magazines, television and radio in the mainland have never truly reflected the will of the people. Party and government leaders have been insensible to dissenting voices, so they have had difficulty in recognising and correcting wholesale errors. For a ruling party and government to use the tax money of the people to run media that sing their own praises is something not permitted in democratic nations. 7. Permit the free circulation within the mainland of books and periodicals from Hong Kong and Macao. Our country has joined the World Trade Organisation, and economically we have already integrated with the world \u2013 attempting to remain closed culturally goes against the course already plotted for opening and reform. Hong Kong and Macao offer advanced culture right at our nation&apos;s door, and the books and periodicals of Hong Kong and Macao are welcomed and trusted by the people. 8. Transform the functions of various propaganda organs, so that they are transformed from agencies setting down so many &quot;taboos&quot; to agencies protecting the accuracy, timeliness and unimpeded flow of information; from agencies that assist corrupt officials in suppressing and controlling stories that reveal the truth to agencies that support the media in monitoring party and government organs; from agencies that close publications, fire editors and arrest journalists to agencies that oppose power and protect media and journalists. Our propaganda organs have a horrid reputation within the party and in society. They must work for good in order to regain their reputations. At the appropriate time, we can consider renaming these propaganda organs to suit global trends. We represent ourselves, hoping for your utmost attention.

Not only has he a got a first-up win under his belt in the Shanghai Masters to move within a couple of results of qualifying for the World Tour Finals in London next month, but he has shaken off a virus that threatened to ruin his season. He revealed last night he has endured severe headaches, a sore throat and tiredness for several weeks rather than risk taking an unknown remedy that might cause him to fail a drugs test and wreck his career. Instead, he stuck to non-prescription anti-inflammatory tablets, pain-killers and a lot of vitamin C. The world No4 said he had only just recovered from the unspecified illness that has dogged him since Stanislas Wawrinka embarrassed him in the quarter-finals of the US Open and which seriously restricted his preparation and on-site workouts in Beijing last week. &quot;When I started training again,&quot; he said, &quot;I got sick again. I had a really bad throat and sore head in Beijing. I felt really tired so I only practised 45 minutes a day. The cardiovascular work you do is very important when you play long rallies against the best players, and that takes some time to get back. &quot;But I&apos;d rather be feeling sick for a few more days than risk failing a drugs test. I feel OK now. My throat is fine.&quot; Murray \u2013 who was similarly inconvenienced last year \u2013 played so poorly losing to Ivan Ljubicic in the quarter-finals of the China Open last Friday that his season was in danger of imploding. Today all was well, from head to hands and feet, as he disposed of the promising young Chinese wild card Bai Yan, 6-2, 6-2 in the second round of the penultimate Masters 1000 tournament. Murray served well, hit his ground strokes cleanly and felt comfortable enough to experiment with several drop shots \u2013 so much so he murdered one point in the second set by extending the rally when he had Bai at his mercy. &quot;I feel pretty relaxed about qualifying for London,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to enjoy the last few tournaments of the year now that there&apos;s not as much pressure. If I make the quarters, it should be pretty much good enough.&quot; Bai, who shocked everyone by beating the experienced Radek Stepanek in the first round, said: &quot;At certain periods, I put pressure on [Murray], but he is very strong. I was a bit slow getting into the game and he won pretty easily in the end. But I learnt a lot. The gap is fairly obvious in terms of physical conditioning and tactics.&quot; The Scot was full of praise for Bai. &quot;I was told he&apos;d been out for 18 months with a bad illness and some injuries. I guess he would be inside 400 after this week. I thought he was good. He&apos;s only played eight or nine tournaments this year. If he was from the UK, I&apos;m sure we would be very, very excited about him.&quot; Murray plays the Frenchman J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy in the last 16 tomorrow and has legitimate ambitions of a semi-final against Rafael Nadal, who got past Wawrinka 6-4, 6-4 without looking totally convincing.

I was happy with the way I played today, too.&quot; While a smiling Murray, Federer and Djokovic made it through to tomorrow&apos;s quarter-finals with plenty to spare, Nadal looked mentally and physically drained losing to J\u00fcrgen Melzer, who stretched him in the semi-finals of the French Open and did so again in front of a stunned audience here, winning 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. The world No1 last lost a set 6-1 a year ago at the O2, to Nikolay Davydenko. That was a humiliation; this was a minor shock, not totally unexpected, given that the Spaniard hinted earlier in the week he was struggling at the end of what has been another demanding if trophy-laden season. &quot;Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and today wasn&apos;t my day,&quot; Nadal conceded. &quot;I didn&apos;t play well. I arrived to this part of the season playing well, but probably a little bit more tired than usual.&quot; Melzer said: &quot;I felt he was uncomfortable after a few games. His backhand was sometimes just dying in the net. The key was to put a lot of pressure on him. You cannot let him play his game. He&apos;s just too good.&quot; Murray, meanwhile, plays another Frenchman, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, tomorrow and said: &quot;I feel way better than I did 10 days ago.&quot; Ten days ago he was as low as he has been all season, struck down by illness that left his head throbbing and robbed his limbs of energy as he staggered away from the China Open in Beijing. But Murray has learned how to come back from adversity. Today his tennis was full of punchy forehands, more drop shots \u2013 a few of them excellent, a couple not so good \u2013 and a nerveless service game that kept Chardy deep behind the baseline. Talented and dangerous, Chardy rarely stretched the relaxed Scot in the 81 minutes their match lasted in front of a small crowd at the 15,000-seat main stadium court at this well-appointed complex on the outskirts of Shanghai. &quot;The two weeks between now and Valencia [where he won last year] will be important for me so that I train properly and get myself in good match shape again,&quot; Murray said. &quot;There&apos;s not much point in trying to get stronger or faster because there&apos;s not really enough time. But I&apos;ll try to improve that little bit by spending more time on the court and then December is when I&apos;ll work really, really hard again. &quot;I know exactly where I&apos;m going to be and what I&apos;m going to do in terms of the Hopman Cup and preparations for the Australian Open. But I&apos;ll sit down after here and talk about what the goals are physically in that period and to make sure I spend enough time on the court, enough time in the gym.&quot; While Nadal chose to play on after the US Open, reaching the semi-finals in Bangkok and winning in Tokyo last week, Federer rested \u2013 and he looks ominously fresh and strong, beating the Italian Andreas Seppi 6-3, 6-4 tonight.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport", "Rafael Nadal", "French Open"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-14T08:15:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/oct/14/china-tennis-shanghai-masters", "sentences": ["It is certainly an interesting time to be in Shanghai, the acceptable long-time waterfront of China&apos;s love affair with money.", "Sport is very much a lever in the process of cultural and financial integration in the People&apos;s Republic, and the Shanghai Masters, a rich tournament intricately linked with the spread of tennis across the world, is one obvious manifestation of that seemingly unstoppable process.", "What the Shanghai event has yet to crack \u2013 after eight years in various forms \u2013 is an audience.", "Every day outside the players&apos; hotel, the Hilton in the old French Concession of downtown Shanghai, a gaggle of 20 or 30 giggling girls dripping in teenage haute couture queue for hours to catch a glimpse of the millionaires who entertain them on court.", "&quot;Federer held a clinic in Shanghai the other day [with] the best 11- and 12-year-olds."], "title": "Home heroes required to seal China's burgeoning interest in tennis | Kevin Mitchell", "article": "For years China was a Communist mystery. Now it is a capitalist conundrum as well. As prominent former party leaders campaign this week for press freedom in response to the attacks on the Nobel Prize winner and dissident Liu Xiaobo, it is clear the old order is still wrestling with the global element of financial and political change. It is certainly an interesting time to be in Shanghai, the acceptable long-time waterfront of China&apos;s love affair with money. If it occurs at first that sport has little to do with these high-powered intrigues, the evidence suggests otherwise. Sport is very much a lever in the process of cultural and financial integration in the People&apos;s Republic, and the Shanghai Masters, a rich tournament intricately linked with the spread of tennis across the world, is one obvious manifestation of that seemingly unstoppable process. For a start, Rolex, one of the chic symbols of international wrist candy, have upped their commitment to $3,240,000 (\u00a32.02m). And, just as importantly, the top 20 players in the world are happy to come here. This is no throwaway hit-up in the boondocks. It is a serious piece of tennis&apos;s lucrative jigsaw. What the Shanghai event has yet to crack \u2013 after eight years in various forms \u2013 is an audience. It is a crowded market in a very crowded country and attendances this week in the 15,000-seater showpiece Stadium court at the well-appointed five-year-old venue on the outskirts of this vast port city have been meagre. They will pick up at the weekend when the elite and the favoured take their places to watch the glamorous conclusion. In the lead-up, though, Chinese tennis fans are content to watch the likes of Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer on television. TV, as everywhere, is the engine that drives sport in China, and tennis has to get in the queue with several equally ambitious rivals. Football and basketball have been huge here for years, golf is the perennial deal-making sport for big business, boxing is popular and rugby, snooker and cricket are also competing vigorously for attention in a fickle marketplace. Where once ping-pong and martial arts prevailed, now there are suitors from sports that have worldwide connections salivating over the biggest honeypot in the world. This month it is tennis&apos;s turn, after the China Open in Beijing last week and now the penultimate Masters 1000 of the season. If tennis is beyond the vast mass of Chinese as a sport to play because of the cost, it has a small but growing fan base to encourage the clearly solid corporate support. Every day outside the players&apos; hotel, the Hilton in the old French Concession of downtown Shanghai, a gaggle of 20 or 30 giggling girls dripping in teenage haute couture queue for hours to catch a glimpse of the millionaires who entertain them on court. But what the fans crave \u2013 and what the game is hunting for across China \u2013 are a few more local heroes. This week they had Zhang Ze, who nearly beat the former world No3 Ivan Ljubicic (Murray&apos;s conqueror in Beijing last Friday), Wu Di, who battled the flu in losing bravely to Taiwan&apos;s Lu Yen-hsun (the world No42who beat Andy Roddick at Wimbledon), and Nanjing&apos;s Bai Yan. So obscure was Mr Bai, the western media (yes, including the Guardian) transposed his first and second names when he beat the 30th-ranked Radek Stepanek, the well-travelled Czech who put Murray out of the Paris Masters last year. We knew who Mr Bai was by the time he walked on to the main Stadium court against Murray in the second round, but he found that challenge beyond him. &quot;Chinese male players, especially,&quot; Bai said after his 6-2, 6-2 defeat, &quot;are still in the beginning stages of the professional game. None of us has played much at the highest level. What we need are [more] overseas coaches and players.&quot; The mainland Chinese are simultaneously encouraged by and jealous of their Taiwanese neighbours. Taipei&apos;s Yang &quot;Little Fatty&quot; Tsung-Hua, who gave the highly regarded J\u00fcrgen Melzer a scare, is another player from the ostracised island who made an impact this week. One man who has a handle on where Chinese tennis is going is Brad Drewett, a national junior champion in Australia who went on to be a decent player on the circuit (he reached 34th in the world in the early 1980s), and who is now responsible for the development of sport in Asia as the chief executive of ATP International. He knows how tough it is to find and groom prodigies, but says China has plenty of raw talent. &quot;The programmes here have developed significantly over the last five years and there are many very good junior players,&quot; he said. &quot;Federer held a clinic in Shanghai the other day [with] the best 11- and 12-year-olds. The feedback I got was there were a number of very exciting young prospects. &quot;I would hope in five, six to seven years we will have some significant players who are not just playing, but competing, and competing well, on the ATP World Tour. If that were to happen, the potential is unimaginable.&quot; Drewett would love his Chinese partners to find tennis equivalent of the NBA giant Yao Ming, who is back home this week with the Houston Rockets and attracting massive crowds. The financial impact of such a discovery would be enormous. Drewett acknowledges the achievements of Li Na, who is ranked among the top 10 women in the world, but knows the key to unlocking the Chinese treasure chest is finding, &quot;the first truly great male professional player&quot;. None has appeared yet, but Drewett maintains: &quot;It&apos;s not a matter of if, it&apos;s a matter of when.&quot; In the country of the Long March, time and patience are familiar friends.

ESTONIA       PopopTallinn Daggers - Island Phi Ley       Tallinn Daggers is an electronic pop duo from Tallinn that consists of Ardo Kivi and Joosep Volk. Since they united in 2009 they have released one digital EP, The Last Escape, and a handful of singles. They are known for their very energetic live shows and listener-friendly habit of giving away their music. FINLAND       GlueBig Wave Riders - Big Sound       Formed just before the summer, Big Wave Riders aim to be the next big thing in Finnish indie music. While they ready their debut EP, we can enjoy a taste of their first recordings with Big Sound&apos;s fast tropical beat and early 80s garage vibe. FRANCE       ZikNationHutchinson - Oh My Lover       Hutchinson is an electro-rock duo featuring Olivier Deniaud and Eric Tanguy, who make their music in the very creative city of Nantes. It&apos;s a hobby that doesn&apos;t stop them being rather good. You might have had a hard time guessing they were French. GERMANY       BlogparteiMIT - Pudong       German band of the moment is definitely MIT. With the advanced electronica of their second album Nanonotes, which was produced by Simian Mobile Disco member Jas Shaw, and especially with the video to Pudong, they have hit the spot in Germany&apos;s blogosphere. MIT may rightly be seen as a concept for taking Kraftwerk&apos;s legacy into the future. GREECE       Mouxlalouloudago.quiet - Everyone I Ever Met       go.quiet is the project of Christina Kassesian and housework. Everyone I Ever Met, the primary result of their collaboration, is soothing, compelling, heartbreaking, mysterious and gloomy. An enticing dip into melancholy that urges you to lean closer to the speakers to fully feel everything that is being played and sung. There&apos;s a beauty in the melody that conjures up a cinematic romanticism with the soft-spoken, whispered, gentle vocals to amplify this emotion. ICELAND       I Love Icelandic MusicCaptain Fufanu - Lava       Captain Fufanu are two youngsters and probably the brightest hope of the Icelandic electronic music scene. Hrafnkell Fl\u00f3ki Einarsson and Gu\u00f0laugur Halld\u00f3r Einarsson (sons of a different Einar, so not brothers) aka Kaktus and Gulli played their first gig at the age of 16 in 2008. The duo mix dub, techno, house and experimental electronica. The song Lava is unreleased. INDIA       IndiecisionKaav - Daya       Kaav is an alt-prog trio from Kochi. The band&apos;s expansive, instrumental soundscapes are based in an understanding of local Carnatic music, with the trappings of a more alternative Oceansize - think a dosa-eating Explosions In The Sky. Daya is taken from a recently-released eponymous three-track EP, which we highly recommend you download  here for free. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarGhaust - Sleep And Release       With only two members, Ghaust, who hail from Jakarta, build an instrumental trip crossing through different genres, where post-rock/shoegaze influences and crushing sludge/doom tempo collide with hardcore punk and heavy rock. Sleep And Release explores a cumulative void, expressing emotions that can only be conveyed with music. IRELAND       Nialler9Sacred Animals - Chosen Seed       Sacred Animals is a solo project of Darragh Nolan. His debut release is the lush four-track EP Welcome Home and serves as a perfect introduction to his fanciful and feral, wild like nature ballads. The music recalls Radiohead, Bon Iver and Guillemots without ever really sounding too much like any of them. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelACE And The Deck - Mr. Grieves (Pixies cover)       ACE And The Deck take the Pixies&apos; Mr. Grieves, stir it up with reggae, shake it up with psychobilly, throw in some surf punk and cut it with a generous helping of arak. Their debut album is a veritable musical arsenal taking the best from all genres, and hits the market on December 13. ITALY       PolaroidHavah - The Competition Dies       Michele Camorani was a member of La Quiete, one of the most important screamo hardcore bands of the past decade. This is his new solo project, and the sound is very different. Imagine a Blank Dogs song locked up in a dark basement all alone for 20 years - that&apos;s how obscure and cursed Havah&apos;s music can be. Sometimes, suddenly, pop melodies come to the surface, but soon they&apos;re buried into the noise once again. It&apos;s definitely worth downloading Havah&apos;s first album for free via his MySpace. JAPAN       JPOP LoverHotel Mexico - Its Twinkle       Hotel Mexico are not from Mexico, but are a glo-fi and chill electro band hailing from Kyoto. Its Twinkle is taken from the recently released His Jewelled Letter Box EP and is full of radiant guitar melodies, ambient bells, airy synths and more reverb than any respectable song has the right to use. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaHello Seahorse! - Un A\u00f1o Quebrado       Once a twee-pop band, Mexico City&apos;s Hello Seahorse! morphed into a gloomy sounding beast on their third album, Bestia. Now they&apos;ve delved deeper into their tormented souls and came out with their fourth album in four years, Lejos. No Tan Lejos. Produced by the legendary Money Mark in Los Angeles and by local wizard Yamil Rezc, the 11 songs lay a rich forest of synths where Lo Blondo&apos;s banshee-like voice soars with operatic tropes. Say &quot;Hola!&quot; to this seamonster. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamSpace Siren - This Radar       Amsterdam quartet Space Siren have strong indie-rock pedigree behind them. Featuring members who previously made up the noisy, melancholic band Seesaw, who released a number of great albums on the reliable Transformed Dreams label early in the 2000s, Space Siren carry the torch on wonderfully. Thick layers of guitar distortion hark back to an era when Sonic Youth ruled the independent underground. The percussion drives every song. And, somehow, amidst the haze of overdrive, there&apos;s room for the strong, moody vocals of Gwendolien. NEW ZEALAND       Counting The BeatSecret Knives - The Northwest States       Secret Knives is the solo bedroom recording project of Ash Smith, who also plays in Over The Atlantic. The Northwest States begins with a pop melody and lyrics about lost love over programmed beats and a nice rumbling bass line. Then the layers of guitar start to build until the song soars into a shimmering shoegaze crescendo. The song is from Secret Knives&apos; new album Affection, available for free download from here. NORWAY       EardrumsDunderhonning - St\u00f8v       Dunderhonning is a young quartet from Harstad in the north of Norway. They have just released their debut full-length album on Guano Recordings, Sakte Ut Av Fokus, where they play warm, poetic, dreamy and powerful pop/rock. They sing in their native language and dialect, which suits the songs and their expression well. People who have heard and loved the music of Kr\u00e5kes\u00f8lv may find these two close to each other in style. Their album is high on my list of the best Norwegian albums this year. Highly recommended. PERU       SoTBLongPlayer - Chica A Go-Go       It&apos;s time to welcome the debut of LongPlayer, a powerful quartet that formed in Lima in 2009 and is led by experienced Pipe Villar\u00e1n. Their first single, Chica A Go-Go, carries a pleasant melancholy and is full of crunchy guitars and surprise trumpet appearances. Their self-titled debut album, which comes out on October 21, promises to deliver a classic rock lesson and will undoubtedly be one of the best of the year. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Noiserv - 06:00am - Mr. Carousel       Since his first presence in MAP a year ago, Noiserv (aka David Santos) has played internationally, recently in Scotland and Slovenia, and has shared the stage with Bill Callahan, Camera Obscura, Damon &amp; Naomi, Perry Blake and The Swell among others. In July, he released a new EP, A Day In The Day Of The Days - a musical diary of one fictional day. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseMinus - Hasdeu       Minus is Daniel Stanciu, a young man from Bucharest who combines massive mountains of bass with glitchy, twinkling Game Boy melodies and a healthy dose of synth funk. The EP from which Hasdeu was taken can be listen to and downloaded on Minus&apos; page at Local Records. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopBear Bones - Oil &amp; Lacquer       Islay-born singer Ben Harrison&apos;s thick brogue and some inspired bursts of accordion make eight-strong Bear Bones an unmistakably Scottish proposition and Oil &amp; Lacquer a heavenly way to spend four minutes. Fans of Belle &amp; Sebastian won&apos;t be disappointed. Since it&apos;s exactly two years since the Music Alliance Pact was launched, as a bonus you can also download a free anniversary compilation here which contains mostly exclusive and rare tracks contributed by 23 previous MAP artists from Scotland. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...Typewriter - Cry So Well (The Suntan Mix)       Ten years and three line-up changes later, Typewriter have finally released their labor of love, Indian Head Massage. Their debut album is chock full of well-crafted power-pop tunes and guitar riffs, whimsical lyrics and one of the most dynamic rhythm sections in the country. As a live four-piece, Typewriter shed all inhibitions to deliver a spine-tingling dose of forgotten melodies to awaken the senses, but on record they take the time to flesh out the minute details that make each song stand out. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Goldfish - Fort Knox       Hailing from Cape Town, Goldfish is made up of Dominic Peters and David Poole, who are one of the hottest jazz/electro duos this side of the equator. A mix of &quot;funky riffs, acid jazz melodies and instantly catchy dance floor songs&quot; is what they are about and Fort Knox is the epitome of their unique sound. This duo have made their mark in the dance scene and world domination is in sight. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKGo-yo - The Blue Devil       Singer-songwriter Go-yo writes songs about cynical self-consolation. After debuting with a self-titled single offering lo-fi piano pieces last year, he has begun a venture into the realm of trip-hop and electronica with the recent release of first full-length album I Came Alone. While songs such as Let The Little Bird Fly maintains Go-yo&apos;s original, melancholic piano sound, The Blue Devil creates an atmosphere similar to that built by Air&apos;s score for The Virgin Suicides. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseMother Of The Forest - Br\u00e4nna Broar       This suddenly prolific artist has just released another EP, this time with guests such as Mattias Alkberg and Magnus Ekelund. Vocals are processed and distant in the mix, adding to both the spookiness of the tracks and the prominence of the staccato electronic bursts that punctuate and enliven each song. SWITZERLAND       78sThe Legendary Lightness - Airplane       The Legendary Lightness is the side-project of the two drummers from Swiss indie outfits Schnitzer and Gabardine. The singer-songwriter duo hail from Zurich and has just released a splendid single called Airplane. It&apos;s an airy piece of music, providing you with the musical layer for daydreaming. Airplane will be featured on an EP which will be sold at concerts and is limited to 100 copies. Their debut album is scheduled for release this winter. UNITED STATES       I Guess I&apos;m FloatingTwin Shadow - Yellow Balloon       The description for this artist should be short and sweet: spin the track, buy the album and become very happy. Twin Shadow, the one-man project of Brooklynite George Lewis Jr, is full of smooth synths, dark vocals and compositions operating under the influence of 1980s music but not cheaply ripping it off like loads of chillwave acts. Simplicity and melody merge seamlessly in Yellow Balloon, like many of the tracks on debut LP Forget. VENEZUELA       BarquisimentoLos Mentas - El Kiosko       Los Mentas is a rockabilly band with a new and nostalgic proposal and a strong dose of punk-rock flavor. Other influences like tango and swing can also be found in their work. Richard &quot;Chicha&quot; Blanco, Carlos Aray, Hector &quot;Lukas&quot; Paredes and Juan Olmedillo are Los Mentas, and El Kiosko is included on their debut album.", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Blogging"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-15T11:52:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/oct/16/tokyo-japan-pico-iyer", "sentences": ["Now that Shanghai looks in parts like Beverly Hills and Delhi is lighting up with Thai restaurants, there are few cities on the planet that are less western than Tokyo \u2013 even if it&apos;s not necessarily a part of any east that you might recognise."], "title": "Big in Japan: why Tokyo is top", "article": "It makes perfect sense that Tokyo is Guardian readers&apos; favourite overseas city. Now that Shanghai looks in parts like Beverly Hills and Delhi is lighting up with Thai restaurants, there are few cities on the planet that are less western than Tokyo \u2013 even if it&apos;s not necessarily a part of any east that you might recognise. The abiding allure of Japan&apos;s huge network of tiny details is that, like something in a Salman Rushdie novel, it seems to blur all notions of high and low, east and west, old and new into one state-of-the-art global amusement park that is wildly fresh and novel in its best incarnations, and at least zany in its worst. I&apos;ve lived at a safe distance from Japan&apos;s capital for 23 years now, in Kyoto and Nara, three or four hours away by train and several centuries away in terms of their antique pasts. But if I were going to Tokyo tomorrow, I would, on arrival, hold off on the &quot;maid cafes&quot; in the nerds&apos; electronic hive of Akihabara, on the Hysteric Glamour fashions around Harajuku, even on the gleaming shops of the Ginza that have long made Tokyo seem an early visitor from the 23rd century. Instead I&apos;d begin by looking for the old.     Tokyo's Ginza district. Photograph: Alamy    The evergreen riddle of Japan, after all, is that all its revolving-door fashions, fascination with the west and hunger for the new never seem to make it any less Japanese at the core; the place is like a froth of shifting surfaces and flashing images projected on an old, strangely shaped piece of wood that never moves. My Japanese wife is mad for Marilyn Manson and Metallica and used to gun her Honda Hurricane around the winding streets of Kyoto. But every day, before she heads out in her leather jacket, she places fresh water in a bowl around the small shrine she&apos;s set up, and an apple for the gods; she cleans every item of clothing either of us have used the previous day; and then she puts on a CD of monks chanting and sits stock-still in her chair in meditation. Much of Japan is like that still, and if you&apos;re arriving in Tokyo soon \u2013 especially if you&apos;re coming from far away and are jet lagged \u2013 the first place I&apos;d recommend you see is the Tsukiji fish market (tsukiji-market.or.jp) visiting ideally as close to 5am as possible. Nothing will convince you more quickly that you&apos;re not in Kansas (or Hampstead) any more, and the sushi you can try nearby will tell you you&apos;re not at Wagamama either. From there I&apos;d suggest heading to Ueno, a slightly down-at-heel area, built around a park, that still has a\u00a0faintly rural feel and reminds you of what Tokyo used to be when its Meiji refashioners, in the late 19th century, took their cues from London and Paris. Wander through the Tokyo National Museum (tnm.go.jp/en), which has perhaps the best collection of classical Japanese art in the world. At dusk, for this opening immersion, I would head towards Asakusa Kannon Temple, whose great front gate makes you feel as if you&apos;re entering a Hiroshige woodcut. One of the centres of Shitamachi, the old &quot;Low City&quot; of Edo (even by the end of the 18th century the city was the world&apos;s largest in terms of population), it still has echoes of the time when it sat at the heart of a bustling entertainment district, home to the country&apos;s first cinema and first music hall. The power of Japan, for me, lies in everything you find here that you couldn&apos;t imagine seeing in another country, even \u2013 sometimes especially \u2013 when what you think you&apos;re enjoying is something foreign, deliciously lost in translation. Last month, McDonald&apos;s outlets across the nation were serving Tsukimi, or &quot;Moon-Viewing&quot; burgers \u2013 a moon-like fried egg between the buns \u2013 in honour of the harvest moon that has been ritually observed for millennia across east Asia. On your second day, there&apos;s something to be said for going to Kamakura (city.kamakura.kanagawa.jp/english), the leafy, temple-filled mini-Kyoto that&apos;s only an hour away from Tokyo by train. Just ramble through its leafy lanes, walk into shrines that look deserted, breathe in the quiet of a place that was Japan&apos;s capital from 1185 to 1333 and has been a kind of resting place ever after. It&apos;s part of the curiosity of contemporary Japan that it presents you with some of the most jangled and mishmashed, unattractive urban landscapes in the world and yet, in many places, every little shop and cafe you enter will be immaculate and exquisite, whether it plays only Beatles records or Mozart. The details are often perfect, even as the whole sounds like 15 languages shouted all at once. And to savour Japan, it makes most sense to seek out its privacies, its secret corners; until I came here, I\u00a0never realised that the society famous for its conformist surfaces is \u2013 for that very reason, perhaps \u2013 a home to wild obsessives, who have collected every King Crimson bootleg in existence or will show you their collection of videos of ancient Hawaii Five-O episodes. In these ways, it&apos;s best to browse Tokyo, to get lost, almost as if you were in some virtual reality; more than any city I know, the place is like a website, alight with odd links, hobbyists&apos; addenda, animated figures and racing graphics. And once you&apos;ve tasted a\u00a0little of the old city, like striking a\u00a0gong or a temple bell before a feast, you can fling yourself into the new. The Mori Art Museum (mori.art.museum/eng) on the 53rd floor of the Mori Tower in the Roppongi Hills complex, say, whose sleek passageways and views over the city and make it look like a high-definition TV screen writ large. There are dog rental stores around town, vending machines selling underwear and whisky, and three-star Michelin restaurants with only a single table and a few seats at the bar (Yukimura, 1-5-5.Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku, +81 3 5772 1610). At the New Otani hotel (newotani.co.jp/en/tokyo) you can enjoy a\u00a0400-year-old Japanese garden and a rooftop rose garden with 2,000 bushes, where fireflies flicker in the summer.     Bar in Roppongi, Tokyo. Photograph: Alamy    The very best side of Tokyo comes out \u2013 though perhaps this is true of every place \u2013 when you can see the strange and the familiar all at once. Go out drinking in Roppongi on a Saturday night and you&apos;ll half-believe you&apos;re in LA, or at least Hong Kong, among the Romanian restaurants and Filipina hostess clubs; then, on Sunday morning, walk down Omotesando street, past all the note-perfect French cafes and high-end boutiques, with the Kings Road of Takeshita street just a short hop away. On Sunday afternoons, on Jingu Bridge, at the end of Omotesando, &quot;cosplay&quot; (a mix of &quot;costume&quot; and &quot;play&quot;) girls from the suburbs come out in their wild outfits, dressed as nurses or goths or dominatrices or Alice in Wonderland. Costumes, you will soon register, are as outlandish as uniforms are constant in Japan, if only because the same people who are dressed down for six days every week get their own back by dressing up on Sundays. Right behind the bridge, wide pathways take you to the Meiji shrine (meijijingu.or.jp/english), where you are back in the thick, textured, slightly elusive place that has altered very little over centuries. Shrine maidens dressed all in white \u2013 traditionally they were virgins \u2013 are selling good luck charms for passing exams to the wild teenage girls in microskirts and fishnet stockings whose hairstyles seem to have been copied from Lady Gaga. Everywhere in Japan there are things that are worth doing just because they can&apos;t be done in quite the same way anywhere else. Try to arrive at a\u00a0fancy department store at 10 am, when it opens, to see the scores of perfectly coiffed employees lined up to call out a formal welcome. Try Isetan (isetan.co.jp) in Shinjuku; you can spend the next many hours lost in the capacious food halls in its basement. Look for the three-course &quot;teishoku&quot; set lunches, which will offer you the same food you&apos;d spend \u00a320 on at dinnertime for a third of the price. And never spurn a convenience store, because there is more in their small heaven and earth than is dreamed of in your philosophy. The first time I came to Japan, as a sightseer 25 years ago, I made sure to take myself to Tokyo Disneyland (tokyodisneyresort.co.jp) so I could see the whole seamless, public and well-organised society in miniature; I could get a (cartoon version, but defiantly partisan) tour of Japanese history in one pavilion, eat melon sorbets in another and see on every side how Japan had taken something deeply American and made it entirely its own (and cleaner, quieter, more efficient). In time though, after I came to live here, I began to see how much of Japan can be enjoyed as a kind of theme park, where most people are dressed up to play a part, as polite, chirpy and eager to please as one of Walt Disney&apos;s Mouseketeers, and inhabiting what looks less like real life and more like a super-synthetic version of The Happiest Place on Earth. There are 35 million people in Greater Tokyo \u2013 more than in all of Canada \u2013 and when you arrive at Tokyo station you may feel that they&apos;re all streaming past you at the same time. Two million souls do indeed pour through Shinjuku station every day. But what ultimately stays with many a\u00a0visitor to the epicentre of Japan are the moments of stillness, of collectedness, of almost mysterious remoteness, where you see the changeless nerve centre from which all the wild changes arise.

It is fair to say Andy Murray is feeling pretty relaxed about playing Roger Federer in the final of the Shanghai Masterstomorrow. Novak Djokovic, who lost the other semi-final and his No2 ranking to Federer, might have appeared the marginally softer option, but not to Murray. Not long after the Scot had thrashed his old friend Juan M\u00f3naco 6-4, 6-1 in front of a buzzing audience in the splendid 15,000-seater showpiece stadium of the Qizhong Centre today, Murray explained why he is relishing another showdown with Federer. He&apos;d played him in two Grand Slam finals, he said, and, although he lost both times, he had finally come to realise he needed to be more aggressive against Federer and Rafael Nadal. He subsequently beat both of them in the same tournament with that attitude and strategy in the Masters 1000 tournament in Toronto this summer. After two years in the top five, most of that time at No4 with two brief spells at No2, Murray feels comfortable among the game&apos;s elite and is by some way Britain&apos;s most consistently successful player in the modern era. The way he is playing, after a slump and a virus, he expects his best tennis to come when he plays the best players. &quot;I really enjoy playing Roger,&quot; Murray said, not a sentiment that would spring to mind among many of his contemporaries. &quot;It&apos;s a great experience every time you get to play against him.&quot; Still, he didn&apos;t half mind playing M\u00f3naco, whom he has known since they were teenage prodigies together in Spain. They went into the semi-final \u2013 M\u00f3naco&apos;s first at this level, Murray&apos;s fifth of the year \u2013 1-1 in career matches, but parity was parked at the door this time. From the moment he took the first game to love until he aced M\u00f3naco with the final shot of the match 85 minutes later, Murray controlled nearly every passage of an entertaining if ultimately one-sided contest. M\u00f3naco, who had seen off Nadal&apos;s conqueror, J\u00fcrgen Melzer, in a fascinating quarter-final, had little left. The match turned on one remarkable rally in the first set. M\u00f3naco was serving at 4-5 and had Murray pinned way behind the baseline, but the Scot, with a busted string, retrieved three smashes and could hardly believe it when the Argentinian belted the last one long. That single exchange devastated M\u00f3naco. &quot;What happened?&quot; he said, in answer to the obvious. &quot;On the other side of the net was Andy Murray. I lost focus and he made an unbelievable point \u2013 with a broken string. I had five [actually three] smashes and I couldn&apos;t finish the point. He broke, and won the set. &quot;At the beginning of the second set, my legs started feeling very tired, so I had very few chances after that and didn&apos;t take any of them. Andy played very well today.&quot; Certainly Murray should push Federer more vigorously than did Djokovic today. Federer won 7-5, 6-4, despite dropping serve in the second set.

Nobody dominates his own discipline like Nadal, yet there is a price to pay for his near year-round commitment to a game that relies so heavily on his genius, and the levy in Shanghai last week was defeat by the Austrian J\u00fcrgen Melzer, a result that shocked all but those close to the peerless Spaniard. It was not just his dropping the first set 6-1 that reminded us Nadal might not be Superman after all. It was the transparency of his body language and his restrained appeal for a change to the calendar that described a champion suffering for his art. As Nadal saw it after losing to the 12th-ranked Melzer for the first time: &quot;When you are in this part of the season, it seems like it&apos;s never gonna end. But that&apos;s our sport \u2026 I am fine.&quot; Yet, as Melzer showed when hitting 37 clean winners past one of the all-time great retrievers on Thursday night, Nadal is not fine. He is knackered. And so the obituary writers descended on him. ESPN called it a &quot;Shanghai Shocker&quot;. &quot;All good things come to an end,&quot; CNN announced after his fourth defeat in 37 matches dating back to June. Nadal has won 66 of 74 all year. In his career, the 24-year-old Mallorcan has won 467 and lost 100. Nadal does not make excuses for losing. Still, in a reasoned plea to the ATP to move some of the minor events towards the end of the year, tournaments the leading players do not need for their ATP points, he used the word &quot;tired&quot; six times. Friends say Nadal is struggling to conserve energy for the last big heave of the season, next month&apos;s World Tour Finals in London. As one confidant put it: &quot;He is exhausted. He just wants to get to the end of the season then take a rest.&quot; The last time Nadal dropped a set 6-1 was nearly a year ago at the O2 Arena against Nikolay Davydenko ahead of another physical meltdown at the Australian Open in January. After losing to Andy Murray in Melbourne, he had to retreat to Mallorca to heal body and mind. The results since that rehab have been spectacular \u2013 three grand slams, and an unassailable lead at the top of the ATP rankings \u2013 because this has become the pattern of his tennis. We have come full cycle again. Towards the end of another trophy-laden campaign, Nadal&apos;s chronically suspect knees and sturdy spirit start to ache under the weight of expectation and physical commitment. It is not only a wonder that he can beat everyone when it matters; we ought to marvel that he can drag himself on to court in the first place. With every passing month and triumph, the humble Spaniard states a convincing case to be hailed the world&apos;s most dominant athlete. With Tiger Woods yet to regain his winning form, only Usain Bolt, surely, challenges him as the biggest individual star in sports that can be gauged by their international spread. An argument might be made for Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino boxing wizard, but not with any conviction. No footballer stands out like Nadal does, no cricketer, basketball player, swimmer, jumper, rider, driver or hitter. Nadal is more dominant in tennis than anyone in, for instance, golf, where Martin Kaymer will overtake Tiger Woods as the world No1 if he finishes first or second in this month&apos;s Andalucia Masters \u2013 without persuading anyone he is a better\u00a0golfer. So, how much better than everyone else in tennis is Nadal, and how long will his reign last? A lot, and, it is clear, only for as long as his body holds out. On clay he has been out of sight for several years; on grass he is a betting favourite at every Wimbledon; on the various versions of hard court the case has been made since his breakthrough at Flushing Meadows this year that he is now a consistent threat on the surface, and not just to Roger Federer, whose domain it has been since 2004. The reason? Quite apart from his innate genius, Nadal has worked hard to overhaul his game. He has put considerably more muscle in his serve and now he also has a backhand serviceable enough under pressure to allow him to hold court position, rather than running around the serve to employ his lethal forehand. That has given him several yards more safe territory along the baseline, enabling him to dictate play earlier in rallies. That luxury alone is a boon for his tendinitis, the one enemy that has threatened his career more seriously than any opponent. It is hard It is hard to see who can spike Nadal&apos;s rise when he is healthy. Federer says he still has the hunger and he, too, has adapted his game to plug gaps. However, the great Swiss, whom millions of admirers will always regard as the best of all time, will never be No1 again, according to John McEnroe, and it is hard to disagree. Federer is 29, yet, despite having no history of serious injury, complains frequently of minor back trouble, especially in defeat, over the past year. If the Federer machine is winding down, domestic contentment may quickly appeal as an alternative to the struggle with Nadal as he strives to add to his record 16 majors. Novak Djokovic, at 23 and ranked second in the world, is seen by many as the king in waiting. Unarguably, he has the talent. But the temperament to win consistently at the highest level is not yet apparent, a comment that also applies to the world No4, Andy Murray, who is a year older. Outside the top four, men&apos;s tennis is peopled by excellent contenders, most of them in their mid-20s, capable of occasional upsets, but not one of them \u2013 Melzer included \u2013 would you back to beat Nadal if he wakes up fit and in the mood to win. Nadal has 12,390 ATP points \u2013 more than 5,000 ahead of Djokovic and nearly 6,000 clear of Federer, a stunning lead. Who among the others competing for a place in the elite eight at the O2 Arena \u2013 Robin Soderling, Davydenko, Tomas Berdych and Mikhail Youzhny \u2013 would any sane gambler back to beat Nadal in a major? As with Federer until a couple of years ago, defeat invariably arrives for Nadal only when his own game dips. It happened last week. It will happen again. But there can be little doubt we are in the Nadal era, one that will last as long as his fragile knees and remarkable spirit sustain him.", "tags": ["Rafael Nadal", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-16T23:10:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/17/andy-murray-roger-federer-shanghai", "sentences": ["There is something about the gasp of a Chinese sporting crowd unlike any other \u2013 a sharp, high-pitched rush of delight, embellished with the odd squeal \u2013 and what welcome sounds they were for Andy Murray as he sealed a remarkable recovery over the past week by beating Roger Federer in the final of the Shanghai Masters."], "title": "Andy Murray beats Roger Federer to win Shanghai Masters title", "article": "There is something about the gasp of a Chinese sporting crowd unlike any other \u2013 a sharp, high-pitched rush of delight, embellished with the odd squeal \u2013 and what welcome sounds they were for Andy Murray as he sealed a remarkable recovery over the past week by beating Roger Federer in the final of the Shanghai Masters. If he holds this form \u2013 and the signs are encouraging \u2013 Murray will hear cheers in a variety of languages to lift him in the coming weeks from Valencia to Paris then London, for the season&apos;s grand finish, the World Tour Finals in London next month. It has been a quite impressive return to his best for a player who only 10 days ago looked as sad as a stale kipper when he walked away from the quarter-finals of the China Open in Beijing physically and spiritually wrecked. But the virus that had drained him since his disappointing third-round exit at the US Open for weeks has gone, his strength and confidence are back and so is his occasional smile. &quot;It was a very, very good week for me,&quot; he said, reflecting on a tournament in which he had the best numbers on serve and return, &quot;and a great match tonight. I&apos;m very happy.&quot; The showpiece stadium of the Qizhong Tennis Center on the western edge of the sprawling port city was not quite full to its 15,000 capacity for the deciding match of this Masters 1000 tournament under a waxing half moon, but passion filled the warm air nonetheless for the hour and 25 minutes it took the Scot to win 6-3, 6-2. It was his eighth win over Federer in 13 meetings. The Swiss will argue he has taken the ones that mattered, the US and Australian Open finals. But there could be no devaluing this performance, Murray&apos;s second win in their three finals this year, and Federer was gracious in defeat. &quot;He&apos;s capable of beating everybody right now,&quot; Federer said. &quot;He&apos;s proven it. He&apos;s beaten everybody multiple times \u2013 Rafa [Nadal], Novak [Djokovic], myself. That&apos;s what you&apos;ve got to do, and hopefully you can string those matches together when it really matters, in slams. He&apos;s having another good year. I&apos;m happy for him because he&apos;s a good player.&quot; It was Murray near his best, Federer some way short of his, as the 23-year-old&apos;s patient and occasionally brilliant tennis, built on a booming serve and fighting retrievals of lost causes, reduced his opponent to near impotence. As a contest, though, it did not quite live up to the anticipation. Federer beat him in the Australian Open and Murray won in the Rogers Cup in Toronto. This was the decider. Both were in cracking form all week. Murray, in the end, also denied Federer the 64th career title that would have tied him with Pete Sampras at No4 on the all-time list in the open era, but the Swiss has regained his No2 ranking ahead of next month&apos;s World Tour Finals in London. Neither had been broken in their four matches before the final but Federer cracked first, over-hitting at the end of a long rally in the first game. Murray&apos;s serve was in a powerful groove and he had Federer in trouble for the rest of the set. It is rare that you see Federer&apos;s composure snap \u2013 but snap it did, spectacularly so in the one fractious moment of a tight match, on his serve in the fourth game of the second set. He had been out-generalled in the first and was getting back into the match in a big way in the second when it went horribly wrong in the space of a minute. He smashed long, it was called out, overturned and the point replayed - but, when he pushed a forehand wide to drop serve, he unravelled before an audience mostly with his cause. Trailing 3-1, and having failed to convert two break points in each of the first and third games, Federer looked strangely resigned to his fate. He conceded later there was little he could do in the face of Murray&apos;s consistent returning game. He has come back from worse positions, though \u2013 many times in fact \u2013 but not here. Not against an opponent who strangled his serve and who won most of the several very long, high-quality rallies. Murray said later he was mildly surprised that Federer seemed to be &quot;ratty&quot; with the umpire and with himself. &quot;Against me, it&apos;s the first time it&apos;s happened,&quot; he said. &quot;It happens to everybody, at some point. All the players get annoyed. When you&apos;re trying to get yourself back into the match, and there&apos;s a couple of calls go against you, it&apos;s very, very frustrating.&quot; But that was always Federer&apos;s core strength, his immovable sanity when all about him was going crazy. From that point on, Murray needed only to keep his discipline and the $616,500 (\u00a3385,000) and the 1,000 ATP ranking points were his. The end when it came was anticlimactic, to say the least, Federer netting a regulation backhand. &quot;I served really big,&quot; Murray said later. &quot;I can still work on the variation a bit, but my second serve this week was very good \u2013 especially tonight. I didn&apos;t give him any chances to go for it. I threw some in with a lot of kick on them, some slice, some into his forehand. I varied that well, which sometimes against him I haven&apos;t done.&quot;", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-17T10:24:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/17/collagen-drinks-ageing-process", "sentences": ["Wander around department stores in Shanghai and Beijing and advertising slogans bombard you with promises such as: &quot;Take a collagen drink for 30 days and have skin as soft as a\u00a0baby&apos;s.&quot; Cosmetics firm DHC China uses fish collagen in its drinks, but promises that they do not smell fishy."], "title": "The collagen drinks that promise to fight the ageing process", "article": "Age may be respected in China, but wrinkles are definitely not \u2013 fighting the process is a boom industry.

For opera and theatre, in the thick of it:\u00a0centre of the stalls halfway towards the back, or as close to the orchestra pit\u00a0as you can. You want to get a panorama of the stage but not be looking down \u2013 unless it&apos;s dance, when\u00a0sitting towards the middle of the first circle means you can see the patterns and how the whole thing comes together. Alan Davey, chief executive, Arts Council England What is the optimum way to appreciate architecture? Walking is the only way. You want a good mix of weather and a day off. Manchester is a great place for this: it can be sunny, but always rains a little bit, so you&apos;re forced inside occasionally. You&apos;ve got to push yourself, break some rules and go to places you&apos;re not allowed. You can&apos;t appreciate architecture until you&apos;ve been told off for going to a room you&apos;re\u00a0not supposed to. Tim\u00a0Abrahams,\u00a0associate editor, Blueprint magazine Which works withstand repeated viewings? A great work is more than a one-liner. Personally, I would plump for anything\u00a0by C\u00e9zanne. His composition, the light, the beauty and intelligence \u2013 he was an extraordinary artist and always pushing the form. Will\u00a0Gompertz, BBC\u00a0arts editor Is it ever OK to heckle at a live performance? Not unless you enjoy being humiliated in public \u2013 always remember that, if you heckle, the comedian is the one\u00a0with the microphone. And if you\u00a0don&apos;t mind being picked on, sit\u00a0in\u00a0the front rows. Shappi Khorsandi, comedian How much should I trust reviews? The simple answer is that it depends what they&apos;re saying and who&apos;s saying it. Evelyn Waugh said that reading reviews is &quot;like sitting in a railway carriage and hearing a fellow traveller pointing out objects of interest and getting them all wrong&quot;. Mostly true, but some theatre critics do have a gift for describing a performance and giving an account of how the audience\u00a0responded. Others, following editorial policy, record merely whether the show is a hit or a miss. Others still are prescriptive: they write about the play or production or performance they would like to have seen, rather than the one they did. In short, they write about themselves rather than the event. If the overwhelming bulk of reviews are bad, it&apos;s foolish not to concede that you have a failure \u2013 but that&apos;s not the same as conceding that you&apos;ve done bad work. Richard Eyre, theatre director Is a theatre programme ever worth the money? A good programme adds to the pleasure\u00a0of an evening. It should tell you all you need to know about the background to the play and the writer. Best value in London: National Theatre programmes, which are pocket\u00a0encyclopedias; and Royal Court ones, where the programme is the play-text. Michael Billington, Guardian\u00a0theatre critic Which venues have the best and worst acoustics? I don&apos;t really care about a venue&apos;s acoustics; if I wanted a perfect sonic experience, I&apos;d stay at home and listen through my Grado headphones. Live rock isn&apos;t about a perfect sonic experience: if a band&apos;s powerful enough, they can overcome anything a venue throws at them. I always thought Alexandra Palace in London had terrible acoustics until I\u00a0saw Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds there: they sounded magnificent. Likewise, Brixton Academy has swallowed bands that weren&apos;t ready to play a venue that size (such as the Strokes); but REM and Coldplay, bands obviously used to playing bigger\u00a0places, sounded great there. Alexis Petridis, Guardian rock and pop\u00a0critic Should I read the caption to an artwork before looking at it \u2013 or after?  Do both: before, because you get an understanding of where an artist is coming from; and after, because the work can make a more sense. A lot of conceptual art is about the ideas, so it makes sense to get a framework. Ekow Eshun, outgoing artistic director, ICA Sometimes captions illuminate, but often they are dull, or try to tell you what to think. Generally, I ignore them. Use your eyes. Adrian Searle, Guardian art critic Artists use titles to encrypt or deceive as much as to assist the audience in reading their work. It depends on the artist. Ryan Gander, artist How do I get the perfect cinema experience? Choose your film carefully. And make sure you sit in the reclining seats, which cost a bit more. They&apos;re definitely worth it. I go in the afternoon: you have the whole cinema to yourself. Charlotte Rampling, actor Which performance of a show is the one to catch? Halfway through the run \u2013 when the cast is relaxed, but not bored. Not on press nights and not on Saturday nights, when their heads are too caught up with &quot;important people&quot; watching. Midweek matinees and Monday nights are best; the actors are less worried and enjoy it more. Rory Kinnear, actor Where can I see the most innovative new work? Try the Kaai or Kunstenfestival in Brussels, Hebbel Theatre in Berlin, PS\u00a0122 in New York, Frascati in Amsterdam, BIT in Bergen. In the UK, there&apos;s the National Review of Live Art in Glasgow or the Nuffield Theatre in Lancaster.  Tim Etchells, Forced Entertainment theatre troupe How can I tell if an actor doesn&apos;t know his lines? Copious sweating, stuttering and uncertainty. It&apos;s like being on a plane when the pilots aren&apos;t sure what they&apos;re doing. It&apos;s not always that actors don&apos;t know the lines, more a momentary lapse in concentration. Lyn Gardner, Guardian theatre critic What should I wear to the opera? Halfway between what you&apos;d wear for the ballet and what you&apos;d wear to a black tie party. If the ballet is a pale cashmere sweater and sparkly skirt, and black tie is a strapless LBD, the opera is perhaps a slinky but not skintight silk dress. You should have something of the night about you, but not in a sleazy way. For men? You can&apos;t go wrong with a dark, slim suit. Jess Cartner-Morley, Guardian fashion\u00a0editor Do critics ever consider the value for money a show offers? No. On that basis you would say that a five-hour epic that&apos;s truly ghastly must be of more value than Samuel Beckett&apos;s Breath, which lasts 30 seconds. One might be aware, when reviewing something in the West End, that people will be asked to pay \u00a350 or more, but on the whole critics don&apos;t account for that at all. Lyn Gardner \u00a0Is it worth buying tickets for preview performances? If it&apos;s the easiest way of getting tickets, it&apos;s well worth it. It&apos;s great to see something before reviewers, so you can judge for yourself. Alan Davey Not the first one. It&apos;s going to be shaky and awkward. Roy Williams, playwright What&apos;s the best way to enjoy an exhibition? Rain is always useful; it&apos;s the perfect weather for introspection. And mid-afternoon, midweek \u2013 when it&apos;s always nice and quiet. Jennifer Higgie, co-editor, Frieze magazine Is there a way to buy a ticket to a sold-out show? Yes. Shows sell out months in advance and people change their mind. Be flexible, always call the box office, and go for the returns. In plenty of West End theatres, if you arrive an hour before curtain-up, you can get house seats at a fraction of the normal price. Tania Harrison, arts curator, Latitude festival Is it worth taking children to the theatre? Children enjoy the attendant things with theatre: the ice-cream, lights going down, the magic of it. Any good production can make that come alive and it&apos;s probably more important to see how their tastes develop. The worst way is to force it, and insist they see Shakespeare, or enjoy Tennessee Williams. Children don&apos;t have to buy into the hegemony of what is good. Rory Kinnear Where can I find the next big thing in pop? The weekly indie club White Heat in London&apos;s Soho has uncovered its fair share of alternative stars: Klaxons, the Horrors and Bloc Party all played there before they had record deals. Krissi Murison, editor, NME What&apos;s the best destination for a culture-stuffed holiday? London, Paris and New York remain amazing places to visit for sheer complexity and intensity. Rio de Janeiro has one of the most dynamic art scenes in the world, as do Mumbai, Dehli, Beijing, Shanghai, Beirut, Cairo and Tel Aviv. Besides the great European capitals, Glasgow, Oslo and Stockholm offer a true polyphony. Hans Ulrich Obrist, curator, Serpentine gallery, London Should I research an artist or play before seeing their show? Never read the play first if it&apos;s new, and always see the work before getting the context. Try to find out what it means to you first before reading up on it. Judith\u00a0Knight, director of ArtsAdmin Where can I spot the art stars of tomorrow? Simple: go to art-school degree shows. Both the BA and MA ones at St Martin&apos;s, Wimbledon, Chelsea and Glasgow will be packed with dealers, but you get a good sense of what&apos;s happening in art and which trends are emerging. Ekow Eshun How long should I spend looking at a single painting? There is no &quot;should&quot; about it. Look for as long as you like. Sometimes a glance is sufficient, an hour not long enough. One might return to works over years, or even decades, and they will continue to offer new insights. The\u00a0work itself might not change, but you do. Adrian Searle Some works might seem off-putting or even dull, but with persistence you might find them profoundly satisfying. Go to a museum to learn, not to consume. Jonathan Jones, Guardian art critic Do any arts venue cafes or restaurants offer decent food? Theatre and museum restaurants rarely offer good value, but some do have other attractions. The Whistler murals at Tate Britain&apos;s dining room are an attraction, and the wines there are famously impressive. Tate Modern&apos;s seventh-floor dining room has impressive City views. And the Wallace Collection&apos;s restaurant has a fantastic atrium setting. But one always ends up thinking: if only the food lived up to the surroundings. Richard Harden, co-editor of Harden&apos;s London Restaurants Should I attempt to see an artist&apos;s entire oeuvre?  It&apos;s impossible to see everything, but often one can fully experience an artist through just one artwork, or by exploring a single aspect of that artist. I&apos;ve always had the dream to see all the works of Vermeer. There are only a little over 70 works and an exhibition of all of them would be extraordinary, a\u00a0real epiphany. Hans Ulrich Obrist Which museum has the best gift shop? The Baltic&apos;s gift shop is probably the\u00a0best shop in Newcastle or Gateshead, let alone the best art or museum store. The Tate and V&amp;A also do it well. The National Gallery offers print-on-demand reproductions for any picture in the building on canvas: plus posters and greeting cards are all popular.

If that sounds a bit Arnold Schwarzenegger, it is: this is what passes for a Hollywood moment in the aid circles I frequent. It will take some time for the latest figures to come through, but what is being signalled is a renewed donor interest in investing in infrastructural development (such as transport and energy) to counter social spending rush of the last 10 to 15 years. This kind of spending has a long-term results horizon and may not lead to the sort of quick improvements in human development indicators aspired to in the millennium development goals (MDGs) - a point we will return to. However, it is absolutely crucial if any gains are to be sustained. You can sometimes parachute in short-term gains, and sometimes a simple policy change will look like progress (such as making primary education free at the point of use). But failure to invest in infrastructure will mean those gains are short-lived. So this shift is long overdue. According to World Bank figures, in the first half of the 1990s the share of aid to Africa spent on infrastructure and economically productive projects (in sectors such as agriculture, industry and services) was 53%. Ten years later (in the period 2000\u201304) the proportion of aid spent in these areas had dwindled dramatically, to only 31%. Meanwhile, spending on social sectors (such as health and education) had risen as a proportion of aid to Africa from 33% to 60%.\u00a0But the real question donors should answer is this: why does infrastructure spending have to come back? Where did it go in the first place? There are thousands of papers on development written every year, calling for all kinds of strange things. But try as I might, I am yet to find one suggesting that a reduction in spending on infrastructure is a sensible way forward for any country, rich or poor. What then explains the reduction?  It appears likely the answer lies with the MDGs, or at least MDG-style thinking. I am a big fan of the MDGs, but I also accept they have sometimes skewed spending priorities. If you are set on reaching particular social development targets by certain dates, there is a strong temptation to focus spending on addressing them directly, at the cost of building and maintaining the infrastructure required for long-term growth.  To give it a generous spin, it is possible there was an over-emphasis on infrastructure spending in the past, and that the balance was simply being redressed when social spending became the &quot;in thing&quot;. Remember too that spending on social sectors like health and education also leads to growth. But neglect infrastructure for too long, and gains quickly turn sour. The World Health Organisation estimates, for example, that the costs of new coverage to meet the water and sanitation MDG will be about $18bn per year, but this is dwarfed by the figure \u2013 some $54bn per year \u2013 needed to maintain present services.\u00a0It seems we have the Chinese to thank for the realisation that the turning point has long since been reached. The talk of Africa is the impact of Chinese aid on infrastructure, particularly roads. They are just turning up and getting it done, or so the story goes. A $20bn loan to Africa announced in 2007 at a meeting of the African Development Bank in Shanghai, and directed specifically at trade and infrastructure, is only one of various examples of China leading the way in this sector. Yes, the aid is tied, but African governments cannot be heard complaining.\u00a0What do we learn from this? First, that while there are lots of trade-offs in development, and sometimes it may be right to focus on short-term spending rather than longer term growth, such decisions should be made based on sound analysis, and not according to fairly random objectives set by a committee in New York. And second that China has a lot to teach the west about how to spend aid, as well as a lot to learn.", "tags": ["Global development"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-18T08:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/18/china-xi-jinping-military-commission", "sentences": ["He was party secretary of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces before taking the top job in Shanghai when Chen Liangyu was brought down by a corruption case.", "What else is there to say?&quot; Ni Lexiong, a professor at Shanghai&apos;s University of Political Science and Law, told Associated Press: &quot;Barring anything unexpected, Xi will be taking over as party leader&quot;."], "title": "Chinese vice-president Xi Jinping appointed to key military post", "article": "Chinese politicians have appointed the vice-president, Xi Jinping, to a key military position, state media reported today, reinforcing expectations that he will become the country&apos;s next leader.

The state news agency Xinhua announced that Xi had become a vice-chairman of the central military commission, which oversees the People&apos;s Liberation Army, after a four-day meeting of the party&apos;s central committee. Xi, 57, is a &quot;princeling&quot;, the son of a party veteran, Xi Zhongxun, who was an ally of Deng Xiaoping and helped to oversee the economic opening process in southern China. Xi Jinping was sent to the countryside as an educated youth during the cultural revolution and later studied chemical engineering at the prestigious Tsinghua University, going on to gain a law doctorate. He was party secretary of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces before taking the top job in Shanghai when Chen Liangyu was brought down by a corruption case. Months later Xi joined the party&apos;s standing committee and took responsibility for the Olympics. It was around that time that Henry Paulson, the then US treasury secretary, described him as &quot;the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line&quot;. Xi&apos;s wife, Peng Liyuan, is a popular folk singer. In an official magazine she described him as frugal, hard-working and down-to-earth. Overseas, Xi may be best known for remarks that were never reported by China&apos;s state media. On a foreign trip last spring, he told his audience: &quot;There are some well-fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than point fingers at our affairs. China does not, first, export revolution; second, export poverty and hunger; third, cause troubles for you. What else is there to say?&quot; Ni Lexiong, a professor at Shanghai&apos;s University of Political Science and Law, told Associated Press: &quot;Barring anything unexpected, Xi will be taking over as party leader&quot;. Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based political analyst, said: &quot;Two years is still a lifetime in Chinese politics. While this is a step forward for him and the stability of the party, no one knows what lies ahead in terms of the final selection process. &quot;We don&apos;t know if Hu Jintao will follow Jiang Zemin&apos;s model and decide to remain as chairman of the central military commission for some time [after stepping down as general secretary and president].&quot; Joseph Cheng, head of the Contemporary China Research Centre at the City University of Hong Kong, told the Associated Press Xi&apos;s rise reflected the party&apos;s determination to see balance and consensus. &quot;Hu may have other preferences, but rocking the boat and changing the plan is too risky and the cost too high,&quot; he said. Some had expected Xi to take the post last year, largely because Hu was appointed to the commission three years before taking over. Moses said analysts would be watching for a clearer articulation of Xi&apos;s views after today&apos;s announcement, particularly with regard to the armed forces. &quot;We are not sure exactly what Xi stands for or against \u2026 his own policy preferences remain quite unclear,&quot; he said. &quot;We really have a much clearer sense of Li Keqiang&apos;s views; he is quite loquacious. Xi prefers not to have a high public profile.&quot; Many expect Li to take over from Wen Jiabao as premier in 2012. The annual plenum also discussed the country&apos;s next five-year plan, which will begin in 2011. As expected, the communique from the meeting suggested the plan would aim to strengthen the embryonic welfare system and promote equality. Analysts will be watching keenly for more details of what happened at the plenum, in light of Wen&apos;s recent calls for political reform recently. It is unclear precisely what the premier has in mind, but his comments are highly unusual for a Chinese leader and most Chinese media did not report them. The meeting communique said party leaders had pledged &quot;vigorous yet steady&quot; efforts to promote political restructuring, Xinhua reported. Administrative changes are routine within the party.

It is an odd sentiment, perhaps, for someone so clearly brilliant in his calling but one consistent with a player and a human being whose core values are rooted in a Scottish upbringing big on respect and hard work. The most important message of the many he took immediately after he had thumped Federer 6-3, 6-2 in an hour and 25 minutes on Sunday night was from his grandmother, Shirley. &quot;My gran had broken her hip not long ago and she had surgery just before I came here two weeks ago,&quot; he said in the recently emptied press conference room of the Qizhong Tennis Center, an hour from the heart of this hectic metropolis. &quot;She had the surgery just towards the end of [the] Beijing [Masters, the previous week]. She was obviously happy because she sent me a message after the match and said, &apos;My hip feels a lot better now&apos;. She&apos;s a bit worried because it&apos;s [brother] Jamie&apos;s wedding in 10 days, so I&apos;m hoping she&apos;ll be up and about for that.&quot; This was Murray at his contented best \u2013 not dancing on the tables or wild-eyed with ill-considered boasts, just quietly proud of what he has achieved and hoping that the next month or so will be similarly fulfilling, on and off the court. &quot;I&apos;m obviously chuffed to have won the tournament,&quot; he said, &quot;but chuffed for that reason, too,&quot; he added, referring to his grandmother&apos;s health and his brother&apos;s upcoming nuptials. He was relieved, as well, he said, that Jamie will not be having any speeches, sparing him the ordeal of performing. As for his tennis, Murray said: &quot;It&apos;s important for me to stay grounded because I&apos;ve been very inconsistent this year. That&apos;s something I need to work on. This tournament was great but I want to try to finish the season as well as possible. The only way for me to do that is to work hard and go into every match thinking it&apos;s going to be incredibly difficult.&quot; It would not be Murray if he did not find a reason to lower his expectations. That said, his realism is warranted. Although Rafael Nadal, earlier in the week, and Federer, when it mattered in the final, were below par, the men&apos;s game is a dangerous place to be complacent at the moment. Novak Djokovic, so dominant in Beijing and earlier in the week in Shanghai, did not quite perform in the semi-finals against Federer, but his is a game of obvious threats in all parts of the court. Federer alluded to the evenness of the competition at the summit of the men&apos;s game. Still, the Swiss had not dropped a set in Shanghai until Murray broke him in the first game of the final and went on to take the first set comfortably. Murray faltered briefly in the second before capitalising on his opponent&apos;s glaring fall-off in spirit when a line call went against him in the fourth game. Federer&apos;s smash was called out, the decision overruled and the point replayed. He lost it \u2013 and the plot thereafter. Murray, meanwhile, is on the rise. He has the World Tour Finals to look forward to in London next month \u2013 alongside Nadal, Federer, Djokovic and four other players yet to qualify \u2013 and he could hardly be better placed, mentally or physically. &quot;That was the best I moved, probably since Australia,&quot; he said of his court positioning. &quot;When I move well, it makes such a big difference to my game.&quot; The Scot returned to London last night and will rest until Saturday before resuming his practice on the court, so he does not lose what he has worked hard to get back after a miserable patch of form recently. &quot;I don&apos;t like spending a week or 10 days off the court,&quot; he said, &quot;because I feel as if I am losing my rhythm. I want to keep hitting the ball like this.&quot; Then it is off to the Valencia Open to defend the tournament Murray won last year, beating Mikhail Youzhny in the final, and Paris for the final Masters 1000 tournament, before the O2 arena and what has become an exciting climax to the season.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-18T23:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/19/france-wild-boar-numbers-rise", "sentences": ["Hunters have had their guns confiscated temporarily, as a security measure until the end of the Universal Exhibition in Shanghai, which is only 300km from Hun&apos;an."], "title": "Survival of Europe's fittest", "article": "There is plenty of game of all sizes \u2013 deer, hares and pheasants \u2013 for the most recent hunting season in about 40 d\u00e9partements south of the Loire in France. But once again, for sheer numbers, nothing can compete with the wild boar. Despite a nationwide drive to check their numbers, launched last year by the environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, and despite a tenfold increase in the number being shot by hunters over the last 30 years (more than 560,000 were slaughtered in 2009), the boar population is still rising steadily. The problem is not restricted to France. In Germany, Italy and across almost the whole of Europe, wild pigs have seen a spectacular population boom in recent decades. They now pose a wide range of problems: damage to crops; rising tension between farmers and hunters; road accidents (20,800 collisions with vehicles in France in 2009); in Germany, wild boar are still feeding on mushrooms, truffles and berries contaminated with caesium from the Chernobyl disaster nearly 25 years ago; and the animals are carriers for parasites and infectious diseases. As a number of specialists have pointed out, the wild boar population needs to be managed more effectively: it is now out of control in some areas. But what is to be done? The top priority is to understand why boar have proved so successful. These members of the pig family are omnivorous, opportunistic and highly mobile \u2013 able to cover between two and 15km a day. They are exceptionally good breeders, too, finding various ways round hunting strategies that have successfully checked the proliferation of deer or mountain goats. &quot;Under favourable environmental conditions, the sows start reproducing after only a year, whereas other ungulates [hoofed mammals] take twice as long. Every year they produce a litter of five piglets on average, whereas most other species only have one at a time,&quot; says Eric Baubet, head of the boar study programme at France&apos;s Wildlife and Hunting Agency (ONCFS). &quot;The females seem to be reproducing increasingly young and the conventional pattern for reproduction, with a pause in the summer, is often no longer valid,&quot; says Fran\u00e7ois Klein, who co-ordinates research into deer and wild boar at the agency. Could this be a response to global warming or changes in crop cycles, or a form of &quot;social destructuring&quot; due to the shortage of adult males? Whatever the answer, culling guidelines for hunters must make allowance for the animals&apos; reproductive precocity. Greater support is also needed for the development of tools to monitor the spread of populations, perhaps following the example set by the ONCFS, which has modelled population distribution in terms of sex and weight. &quot;Applied to the Doubs d\u00e9partement [in eastern France] this model gives us a better grasp of how the numbers vary with different rules for shooting,&quot; Baubet says. It shows, for instance, that &quot;when the number of boar is rising, the guidelines issued to hunters for many years only to cull young females and to spare the reproducing adults are not enough to stabilise the population&quot;. In practice, no single method is effective all the time. This is partly because shooting conditions (number of hunters, length of season, and so on) vary from one area to another. But above all the pigs are constantly opening up new habitats, which the hunters have difficulty reaching. They have, quite understandably, occupied nature reserves, but also army camps, motorway junctions and even quiet nooks in the outskirts of big cities. Such locations are &quot;black spots&quot; for the pest controllers, a problem highlighted by the first phase of France&apos;s nationwide drive, now nearing its end. One of its aims is to set targets for each d\u00e9partement, and the campaign has revealed a highly contrasting picture with a few areas suffering the majority of the problems. As regards crops, for instance, less than 4% of the areas (mainly in France&apos;s central or Poitou-Charentes regions) account for half of all the damage. Wolves and frying pans The people of Yanshan, a small village in Zhejiang province, China, are at their wits&apos; end. Their fields, which overlook Lake Qiandao, a major tourist attraction, are being eaten up by wild boar, present in such large numbers they are upsetting the ecosystem. One morning Wang Genxiang woke up to discover that the hogs had devoured sweet potatoes she was planning to sell at the nearby market, a loss amounting to about 500 yuan ($75) and a minor disaster for a family who barely earn 10,000 yuan ($1,500) in a year. A survey of the wild boar population around 10 towns by the province&apos;s forestry commission suggests that their numbers have increased fivefold in just 10 years, to reach 150,000. Efforts to replant forests in the area are thought to have contributed to their spread. Over the past 20 years the area occupied by woodland in Chun&apos;an district has increased from two-thirds to three-quarters. This natural environment makes it easier for the boar to multiply, but jeopardises farming. Nor is this is an isolated case. The Chinese press has reported similar problems in other provinces, such as Jiangxi, in the south-east, and Chongqing municipality, in central China. For the time being no compensation is available for farmers&apos; losses in Chun&apos;an district, fuelling discontent. But the provincial government is considering possible measures. &quot;This year they have wrecked at least a third of our crop,&quot; says Wang. One morning in August she found four boars eating food reserves just outside her front door. Local farmers have set traps, built stronger fences, installed scarecrows and loosed their dogs, but it makes no difference. The local authorities are counting on hunting to remedy the situation. Some 13,000 people in the province have both a firearms licence and a shotgun. About 50,000 wild boar are thought to have been killed in the past five years, but it is clearly not enough. This year farmers have run into another obstacle. Hunters have had their guns confiscated temporarily, as a security measure until the end of the Universal Exhibition in Shanghai, which is only 300km from Hun&apos;an. Zhou Yangyi, a researcher at the Zhejiang Institute of Environmental Science, thinks hunting is not the right answer anyway. Allowing hunting could lead to abuses and endanger other species, he warns. On the contrary he advocates the introduction of predators, particularly wolves, to restore the balance of the ecosystem. In the meantime Yanshan farmers are organising night-time patrols equipped with makeshift weapons such as frying pans and other kitchen implements, to make enough racket to scare off their bristly bete noire.

This took one-year deposit rates to 2.5% and one-year lending rates to 5.56%. Here is a round-up of analysts&apos; views: Li Daokui, an academic adviser to the People&apos;s Bank of China The interest rate rise will make people feel safe and prevent them from taking out their money [from banks] to invest in stocks or the property market. While China&apos;s economic growth has stabilised at a relative high level, the trend of rising inflation has showed little signs of easing. Ben Simpfendorfer, Royal Bank of Scotland The decision suggests the acceleration in growth and official worries about property and inflation are more serious than anticipated. Moreover, while tightening is expected to contain growth and inflation over the next two to four quarters, more serious economic and financial reform is needed to resolve medium-term risks. Helen Qiao &amp; Yu Song, Goldman Sachs We believe this is a positive development \u2026 The rate hike only increases borrowing costs by a small margin, but its signalling impact is much more meaningful. It conveys at least two important messages: First, top policymakers in China are watchful of the increasing risks on inflation, especially at a time when energy price deregulation is happening more quickly and second, Chinese leaders probably see less of a risk of a &quot;double dip&quot; in global growth and a severely negative impact on the Chinese economy. Meanwhile, we still expect the divide in the policy mix to continue, with easing in investment and fiscal policies to help support growth stability, and a tightening bias in monetary and property policies to manage inflation and asset inflation risks. Guo Yanling, Shanghai Securities It is not clear whether the central bank will start on a process of additional rate increases under the pressure of asset price bubbles and hot money inflows, but this signal shows that the government is clearly concerned about escalating inflation and rising real estate prices. Tao Wang &amp; Gao Xu, UBS We expect this rate hike to be the first of a series to come, before interest rates are normalised to pre-crisis level. Since the rate hike caught the market by surprise, we think the initial reaction is likely to be negative, especially for the property and related sectors. However, in general, we think the market should see the rate hike as a speed bump on the road, as it also reflects the government&apos;s confidence in the strength of economic activity. Qiang Wang, Grace Ng &amp; Lu Jiang, JP Morgan Chase The move signals that Chinese policymakers have become more confident on the real economy, especially regarding the strengthening momentum on domestic demand. Indeed, we have been highlighting that the Chinese economy had bottomed by the second quarter, and growth will pick up steadily going ahead. On the inflation front, we expect the headline CPI inflation rate to peak out in coming months, with the inflation rate to gradually stabilise at around 3% by early next year. Besides, our US team is looking for the Fed to stay on hold on [its interest rates] all the way through to the second quarter of 2012, and to begin a second round of quantitative easing in early November. These factors suggest that the room for further notable rate hikes in China would be somewhat constrained. Mark Williams, Capital Economics It is important to underline that the rate increase will have little direct impact on economic conditions. But by raising the income of savers (and thus most households), it is a small step that could promote economic rebalancing while also, at the margin, reducing the incentive for those with savings to shift them into equities or property markets. Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange, ING This is part of the moderate tightening cycle that we are seeing from Chinese authorities to balance their economy. It is part of the normalisation of interest rates in an economy which is growing at a modestly fast clip. Simon Derrick, Bank of New York Mellon The move follows a clear need by the Chinese authorities to take out some of the heat from the economy. Whether this will lead to a broader move on its currency is open to debate. It certainly leads to speculation that the US and China are in some sort of a deal which will perhaps see the US taking a more gradualist approach to quantitative easing.

He adds: &quot;China is barely under control. It threatens to explode.&quot; \u017di\u017eek&apos;s words echoed in my head as I leafed though Nadav Kander&apos;s epic book of photographs, Yangtze \u2013 The Long River, published this week by the German fine art company Hatje Cantz. It is a book that exudes a certain surface calmness in its detached gaze, its formal beauty and the muted tones of the often-vast landscapes Kander captures. However, the more you look, the more you experience a creeping sense of unease \u2013 a feeling that great chaos looms somewhere just out of the frame. That unease, it turns out, is an echo of the photographer&apos;s own distress and sympathy while making the pictures. From 2006 to 2008 Kander, as he told the Guardian&apos;s Jonathan Watts in an interview a few weeks ago, travelled along the Yangtze&apos;s banks from its mouth to its source \u2013 a distance of 4,100 miles that took him from the modernised city of Shanghai to the rural Qinghai province in the west of the country. &quot;Importantly for me, I worked intuitively, trying not to be influenced by what I already knew about the country,&quot; Kander writes in the book&apos;s afterword. &quot;After several trips to different parts of the river, it became clear that what I was responding to and how I felt while being in China was permeating ... my pictures; a formalness and unease ... [China is] a country that feels both at the beginning of a new era and at odds with itself.&quot; Kander won the 2009 prix Pictet for these photographs. The award focuses on sustainability and climate change, and last year&apos;s theme was the Earth itself. The Yangtze &quot;is a metaphor for constant change&quot;, as Kander puts it, and also a literal indicator of the destruction and devastation China is visiting on its land and its people as it ruthlessly pursues economic development on an unprecedented scale. It is the world&apos;s third-largest river and its banks are home to more people than live in the USA. Or, to put it another way, one in every 18 people on Earth lives along the Yangtze. &quot;The river,&quot; writes Kander, &quot;is embedded in the consciousness of the Chinese, even for those who live thousands of miles from it. It plays a significant role in the spiritual and physical life of the people.&quot; In his introduction to the book, former UN secretary general Kofi Annan tells another tale: &quot;It is estimated that millions of people do not have access to drinking water in China, yet nearly half of the nation&apos;s waste water is absorbed by the Yangtze, thus rendering it unfit for drinking. Toxins are destroying marine life; entire ecosystems are being altered or destroyed. The river, rank with pollution, is slowly dying.&quot; The book is a pictorial narrative of Kander&apos;s journey, divided into four chapters entitled &quot;The Mouth&quot;, &quot;The Upstream&quot;, &quot;The Flooding&quot; and &quot;The Upper Reaches&quot;. Kander is a master of what might be called &quot;epic stillness&quot;. His large-format camera takes in crowded cityscapes and intimate interiors; the empty, still, rural landscapes of the river&apos;s source and the scarred, desolate places where the pace of progress has been relentless and total. Young couples picnic beneath the giant span of a bridge; a woman crouches over a cooking pot amid the rubble of her town; a makeshift clothesline hangs between two posts underneath a huge geometric structure \u2013 &quot;the beauty of domesticity&quot;, as Kander puts it, &quot;pitted against the hugeness of our ideas&quot;. This is a poetic visual meditation on the Yangtze and all it contains \u2013 history, myth, memory, belonging \u2013 as well as a book that evokes, even in its detachment, the terrible power of the state and the helplessness of the ordinary citizen. Sometimes, the Yangtze seems like a river that has carried away China&apos;s past, leaving behind only remnants of buildings, communities, traditions. It calls to mind TS Eliot&apos;s &quot;brown God \u2013 sullen, untamed and intractable&quot;, except that Kander&apos;s Yangtze is grey and, even at its most vast, has been tamed by monumental dams and forded by vast bridges. (During the engineered flooding that attended the building of the Three Gorges Dam, started in 1994 and completed last year, 13 cities, 140 towns and 1,350 villages were submerged and 1.8 million people displaced from a 380-mile stretch.) The more Kander and his camera travel upstream, the more the Yangtze becomes a kind of phantom, passing though landscapes that seem dreamlike, either totally deserted or inhabited by one or two human figures who cling stubbornly to the remains of the old ways. There is even a &quot;ghost city&quot; called Fengdu, where the souls of the dead are meant to rest after death. It, too, was being slowly submerged as Kandar photographed its empty streets, the window frames and doors of the houses stacked neatly for future reuse. One Chinese man Kander befriended asked the question, &quot;Why do we have to destroy to develop?&quot; It is a question that reverberates through this haunting book, which is an already-historical record of a vanished or rapidly vanishing country. &quot;Nothing is the same,&quot; Kander&apos;s friend told him. &quot;We can&apos;t revisit where we came from because it no longer exists.&quot; \u2022 Nadav Kander: Yangtze - The Long River is on at Flowers East, London, until 13 November 2010.

But also a belief that we can change and learn to live within the Earth&apos;s means. How have you managed to embed sustainable thinking within your company?Developed a clear plan to turn a huge number of stakeholder views, scientific issues, different products and supply chain locations into a series of steps the business can follow to head in the direction of sustainability. Also, we have built a business case that rewards us for the progress we are making. What is the biggest challenge you face professionally?The sheer diversity of issues (packaging reduction to salt reduction; climate change to labour standards; fish sourcing to supporting communities), products (2.7bn individual items that we sell each year) and location (10,000s of factories, farms and raw material sources). What is the biggest driver for change in your company?A number of things reinforce each other: CEO drive from Stuart Rose and now Marc Bolland; a growing business case; trying to stay ahead of many good competitors and peers; and the high profile nature of Plan A that means you are under constant scrutiny. What is the one piece of advice you would offer to others seeking to create change?You reference it in the question: change! Understand how organisations and people change. Read the change guru John Kotter. Plan A in essence is a massive change management programme. It&apos;s changing every aspect of how we do business. How we develop and source products; recruit, retain and reward people; interact with our customers; run our lorries and stores. We will only become more sustainable by helping people change, whether as customers, employees, suppliers or investors. Hearts and minds! What one thing have you done at your company to drive sustainability that others could replicate as best practice?Listen to stakeholders; create external partnerships; lead change; create a business case; have a plan; get leadership from the top; be resilient. The list is long but if I&apos;m forced to say one thing, it&apos;s create a great team. A small number of good people centrally and across our various business units have done a huge amount to catalyse the change that now involves the whole business. People who can inspire, innovate and who have the guts to lead. Do you believe business has the capability to rise to the long term sustainability challenges?Yes but... I believe business has an enormous innovative capacity to tackle all the environmental and social challenges we face. However, business cannot operate in a vacuum. It needs to be aligned with the democratic mandate that governments bring and the actions of all of us as individual citizens and consumers. Here and now in 2010 I believe business can be the galvanising force for change, demonstrating to governments and consumers that change is not only desirable but possible. What makes you optimistic about businesses&apos; ability to rise to the sustainability challenge?For a long time environmental degradation and social inequality have been highlighted and witnessed through campaign groups and the media. But despite the sterling efforts of groups like Greenpeace, Oxfam and WWF to name but a few, the world is still careering along an unsustainable pathway. In the past couple of years businesses have begun to create practical alternatives to this pathway that crucially have the potential to be scaled. Again we must not be na\u00efve, the balance is still heavily weighted towards an unsustainable pathway, but for the first time I can begin to imagine a practical and achievable alternative. What is your biggest concern about our ability to create a more sustainable world?Probably the sheer scale of what needs to be done. On a global scale we are a relatively small retailer, selling nearly 3bn items per year. Scale this across a global marketplace and you have literally trillions of items being sold every year. Every one has multiple environmental and social issues that need to be improved, quickly.  Then we&apos;ve got the issue of equity, helping the poorest countries develop in a way that doesn&apos;t replicate the unsustainable model that has underpinned growth in the west over the last 200 years. It&apos;s tough, which is why planning is so important, prioritising issues, laying out targets to improve and measuring progress, whilst having a broad vision of a sustainable end point for your business. What have you done outside of work to live a more sustainable life?We labour on our allotment (if weeds had a value I&apos;d have my feet up by now!), collect the eggs from three chickens, compost assiduously, cycle plenty, recycle all we can, buy the best option in the shop, watch our energy use. We try hard, we believe in it, but equally it&apos;s a lifestyle that many in Britain would believe is achievable.  Which unsustainable behaviour are you most embarrassed about?Flying causes me guilt rather than embarrassment. I&apos;ve cut back dramatically on how much I fly with work in the past five years. I&apos;ve forgone the joys of San Francisco, Auckland, Montreal and Sydney to speak by videolink to conferences rather than in person. But then you see the value of a trip to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Columbo and Bangalore to speak to 500 of our suppliers about Plan A. A few tonnes of carbon, but maybe 100s of factories changing how they operate. I won&apos;t pretend I find it an easy circle to square other than to really challenge each journey.

This, it is claimed, was because she already had a nine-year-old daughter and was violating the rules of the one-child policy. Whatever the truth of these allegations, this kind of event is extremely rare now in China \u2013 especially in urban China, where it could not be kept secret. The officials involved could expect punishment for such an abuse of their power. In the very early years of the policy in the early 1980s such stories of forced abortion were not rare, but the way the one-child policy has been interpreted and enforced has changed with the times. This is partly because people are accustomed to its constraints: one child allowed for urban residents and two for rural residents, especially when the first is a girl. This acceptance means that there is much less need to employ coercive or punitive measures. When the policy was introduced in 1979, it was planned to last for a generation. The original goal was to slow the population growth rate. This has been achieved, but at the price of a rapidly increasing proportion of elderly dependent people, and a worrying excess of males in many parts of China. This is because couples choose to abort female foetuses in order to guarantee a boy, within the constraints of small family size and a strong tradition of son preference. The government has been considering options for relaxing the policy. China has undergone massive socioeconomic change during the past 30 years. With the freedoms that have resulted from wealth and globalisation, the one-child policy seems increasingly anachronistic. Increased wealth and freedom also make it harder for the government to enforce the policy. The cost of bringing up more than one child does not deter many wealthy people, and increased freedom of movement has made it difficult for family planning authorities to track down people if they choose to flout the regulations. One possibility for relaxation is that everyone could be allowed to have up to two children, with a space of at least five years between them. It is thought that this would be acceptable to the majority of people, would help to reduce the excess in male births and would help with the problem of care of the elderly. There are real concerns about what is known as the 4-2-1 phenomenon: families with four grandparents, two parents and one child taking care of them all. But the government feels that vigilance is still essential. It fears that an accelerated increase in population growth could threaten economic growth and stability. There are particular concerns about the increasing level of migration from rural to urban areas, which has fuelled substantial urban growth. So a softly-softly approach is being taken. In most of urban China now, an only child marrying an only child is allowed to have two children. Interestingly, many of the young couples who are now eligible to have two are choosing to have just one child. This is perhaps less surprising when one considers that east Asia boasts some of the lowest fertility rates in the world. (The fertility rate is the average number of children born to each woman, with replacement fertility therefore at around 2.1). Hong Kong has a fertility rate of one, Taiwan 1.1 and Japan 1.3, alongside a figure of 1.6 for China. Another recent change has been that couples no longer need to obtain permission to have a first child. This spelt the end of the very unpopular system of local birth quotas, which meant that couples were forced to delay pregnancy if the local quota was exceeded. These changes, together with declining fertility aspirations, have reduced (though not eliminated) the tensions associated with the government&apos;s efforts to control population growth. The Shanghai government is now considering incentives to encourage couples to have two children. Other city governments may feel the need to follow suit.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Abortion", "Population", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-24T14:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/28/chinese-city-wardens-women", "sentences": ["It does not directly point out that employers should not include criteria such as looks and height \u2013 it is too general to be implemented.&quot; One Shanghai cosmetic surgery hospital estimated last year that half its customers were undergoing operations for career-related reasons."], "title": "Chinese city wardens wanted: must be young, female and pretty", "article": "A good temperament might be an obvious requirement for a city warden. Good looks? Perhaps less so. But authorities in Chengdu, in China&apos;s south-western Sichuan province, have said they will hire only attractive young women for the law enforcement jobs, hoping it will improve their district&apos;s image. Others say it is a blatant example of widespread looks-based discrimination that hits women harder than men. Economists have noted the &quot;beauty premium&quot; in many places, but employment experts say it flourishes in China thanks to inadequate laws. The Xindu district government&apos;s advertisement stipulates that candidates must be female, aged between 18 and 23, over 5ft 2in (1.6m) tall, attractive and with a good temperament. Their contracts will end when they turn 26. China&apos;s urban law enforcement officers, known as chengguan, have a bad reputation, with many regarding them as little more than thugs. Xindu authorities said they created the women-only team to &quot;present the soft side&quot;. &quot;Their main job is to present a good image so they have to be good looking,&quot; said the human resources director of the law enforcement bureau. &quot;And when they get older, they will get married and have children so it will not be convenient for them to do such work. Having them leave at 26 is for their sake.&quot; He insisted it was unfair to describe them as &quot;flower vases&quot; \u2013 a Chinese idiom for women who are decorative but of little use. &quot;They need a good temper and communication skills as well,&quot; he told a Chengdu news website Lu Ying, former director of the Gender Centre at Sun Yat-sen University, said it was common for employers to pick out female candidates because they were prettier. &quot;The effect of looks discrimination is much bigger for women than men. What makes it worse is that for women, the job opportunities are less than for men already,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a very bad phenomenon. It is much worse when a government body does this because it will set a terrible example.&quot; Private companies are certainly not immune. A current advert for a sales assistant at the Zhengzhou Electric Bike Company requires a candidate with &quot;a smile to topple the city&quot; and even stipulates her vital statistics: 36-22.5-36. Li Fangping, a lawyer who has handled many job discrimination cases, said: &quot;In the current employment law it only says that opportunities should be open and equal to everyone. It does not directly point out that employers should not include criteria such as looks and height \u2013 it is too general to be implemented.&quot; One Shanghai cosmetic surgery hospital estimated last year that half its customers were undergoing operations for career-related reasons. Most of those were women. But the scorn that internet users have poured on Xindu authorities suggests that others in China have little tolerance for blatant discrimination. In 2004, the Hunan provincial government dropped its requirement for women civil servants to have &quot;symmetrical breasts&quot; after it was widely ridiculed.

Tianhe-1A, named for the Milky Way, is capable of sustained computing of 2.507 petaflops \u2013 equivalent to 2,507 trillion calculations each second. The US scientist who maintains the international rankings visited it last week and said he believed it was 1.4 times faster than the former number one, the Cray XT5 Jaguar in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. That topped the list in June with a rate of 1.75 petaflops. The US is home to more than half of the world&apos;s top 500 supercomputers. China had 24 in the last list, but has pumped billions of pounds into developing its computational ability in recent years. The machines are used for everything from modelling climate change and studying the beginnings of the universe to assisting aeroplane design. Housed in the northern port city of Tianjin, near Beijing, Tianhe-1A was developed by the National University of Defence Technology. The system was built from thousands of chips made by US firms \u2013 Intel and Nvidia \u2013 but domestic researchers developed the networking technology that allows information to be exchanged between servers at extraordinary speeds. Tianjin&apos;s weather bureau and the National Offshore Oil Corporation data centre are already using it for trial projects. &quot;It can also serve the animation industry and bio-medical research,&quot; Liu Guangming, director of the National Centre for Supercomputing, told China Daily. Tianhe-1A was in seventh place in the last rankings. Its domestic rival Nebulae, housed in Shenzhen, was at that time ranked second, capable of sustained computing of 1.271 petaflops. The next set of rankings is due next week, but Jack Dongarra, the University of Tennessee computer scientist who oversees them, told the New York Times that Tianhe-1 &quot;blows away the existing number one&quot;. Wu-chun Feng, a supercomputing expert and professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, told the NYT: &quot;What is scary about this is that the US dominance in high-performance computing is at risk. One could argue that this hits the foundation of our economic future.&quot; Professor Arthur Trew, of Edinburgh University, who oversees the UK&apos;s HECToR supercomputer, said the Sino-American battle to have the fastest device was not particularly significant. &quot;They are showing off with big machines \u2013 fine. It&apos;s the underlying message that is important. The fact they are pumping this kind of money into building these machines in general is far more important \u2026 Europe is being left behind,&quot; he said. &quot;Having the computer is only half the battle. You have to use it, use it sensibly, and actually produce results. That requires software and brains and a lot of investment on top of the machine.&quot; Trew added: &quot;The number of software engineers that China is turning out and putting into centres dwarfs anything we are doing in the west. I remember going to Shanghai and being astounded by the number of people they had \u2013 hundreds. Edinburgh is one of the largest centres in Europe and we have got 100.&quot; Essentially, supercomputers allow research that could not otherwise be done because it involves calculations too complex to solve by other means or where an experiment cannot be carried out. &quot;Where you have complexity and cannot experiment \u2013 because a system is too large or small, or [the effect] happens too quickly or slowly, or it is just too expensive \u2013 you have to simulate it \u2026 The range of applications is growing and growing,&quot; said Trew. The NYT calculated that Tianhe-1 could perform mathematical operations about 29m times faster than one of the earliest supercomputers, built in 1976. Scientists in the US are already contemplating exascale computing \u2013 aiming to develop devices capable of performing a million trillion calculations a second. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2010.

In China to present a statement of friendship signed by nearly 700 British scientists and artists, he was watching a parade that the reporter James Cameron reckoned to be &quot;the greatest show on earth&quot;. First came the troops and the &quot;military ironwork&quot;, grinding past for a full hour. This was followed by a much longer civil parade in which the people marched by in barely imaginable numbers, beaming with joy at their elevated leaders who gazed back with the slightly &quot;subdued&quot; expression of still unaccustomed new emperors. Float after float rolled by, showing model factories and locomotives. Children released balloons and elastic-powered model aeroplanes; the masses united to cry &quot;Down with American imperialism&quot;; and Picasso&apos;s peace dove was everywhere. Having recently migrated from earlier European congresses, this simplified bird appeared to have usurped the traditional dragons of Peking. The spectacle with which China celebrated the fifth anniversary of the communist liberation was brilliantly organised, as Casson felt obliged to admit. He was less impressed by the admiring expressions worn by many of the other international guests: &quot;Gold-rimmed spectacles misted with emotion, cheeks creased with years of well-meant service in this cause or in that, shirts defiantly open at the neck, badges in lapels, and there in the middle \u2013 could it have been? \u2013 an MCC tie.&quot; That particular specimen was Ivor Montagu, a cricket-loving friend and translator of the great Soviet film-maker Sergei Eisenstein. He was also a table tennis champion who preferred &quot;New China&apos;s&quot; disciplined &quot;physical jerks&quot; to the indolence of a capitalist world in which &quot;rich men&quot; disdained even walking as &quot;something you paid those less fortunate to do on your behalf&quot;. And he was by no means alone in his enthusiasm for &quot;New China&quot;. Sickened by the rapture of the communist regime&apos;s ardent western friends, Casson quickly retreated to the shaded &quot;rest room&quot; beneath the viewing stand. Here he lingered among yellow-robed Tibetan lamas, sipping tea and exchanging impressions with other doubtful Britons: the classically minded and no longer Marxist novelist and poet Rex Warner, and AJ Ayer, the high-living logical positivist who would come home to tell the BBC that China&apos;s parade had reminded him of the Nuremberg rallies. They may also have caught a fleeting glimpse of the Marxist crystallographer JD Bernal, who had no MCC tie but was sporting his Stalin prize medal, collected in Moscow on the way to China. Bernal was full of admiration for New China and its celebrations, but as hour followed hour he too descended from the stand to spend a moment &quot;sipping orange juice through a straw&quot; at the same table as the dalai lama. Enraptured or appalled, none of these British witnesses appears to have regretted the absence of Stanley Spencer. The 63-year-old painter, so famously associated with the little Berkshire village of Cookham, had managed to escape the entire show \u2013 thanks, he later explained, to &quot;some Mongolians&quot;, whose timely arrival at the hotel that morning had provided the cover under which he retreated upstairs to his room. It was the discovery that Spencer had been to China that persuaded me to look further into this forgotten episode. I soon realised that an extraordinary assortment of Britons had made their way to China in 1954, including the former prime minister and leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee. And all this nearly two decades before 1972, when President Nixon made the stage-managed and \u2013 even before John Adams got hold of it \u2013 distinctly operatic visit that has gone down in history as the moment when the west entered rapprochement with the People&apos;s Republic of China. Were these motley British visitors just credulous idiots, for whom &quot;Red China&quot; was another version of the legendary Cathay? That is what the 24-year-old Douglas Hurd and the other diplomats in the British embassy compound in Peking appear to have suspected of these unwelcome freeloaders. Or was something more significant going on? Nowadays, the rapidly increasing number of British travellers to China think nothing of getting on a plane to fly directly there. Yet Spencer had good reason to feel &quot;trembly&quot; as he and the five other members of his entirely unofficial cultural delegation approached the runway at Heathrow on 14 September 1954. Though Britain had recognised China a few months after the liberation, it had yet to establish proper diplomatic relations with the communist-led government, and the embarking Britons couldn&apos;t pick up a visa until they had reached Prague. That meant crossing the iron curtain dividing Europe. &quot;Did you go under or over it?&quot; one joker would later ask, making light of a passage that was actually more like falling over the edge of the known world. The travellers then had to fly across east Europe, pausing at Minsk and Moscow before heading across Siberia and then Mongolia \u2013 all the time relying on their hosts to finance, accommodate and entertain them, and also to provide the vibrating twin-prop planes in which they would hop to the far side of the world, landing every three hours or so to refuel. &quot;There are bears in there,&quot; Spencer mused, glancing anxiously down into a nameless Soviet forest at a moment when the engine sputtered &quot;Fit! Fit! Fit!&quot; There were troubles at home too. The cold war was entrenched, its dangers exacerbated by the advance of nuclear weaponry on both sides. Britain, meanwhile, was financially straitened, and reliant on loans from America, which demanded adherence to Washington&apos;s hard-line foreign policy including its trade embargoes against Russia and China. Under these circumstances, it was by no means just a handful of disgruntled communists and export-hungry businessmen who yearned to make Britain&apos;s political outlook more independent. The loss of power gave a distinctly anti-American resonance to the patriotic lament of Shakespeare&apos;s John of Gaunt \u2013 that &quot;This England&quot; should ever be &quot;leas&apos;d\u00a0out . . . Like to a tenement, or pelting\u00a0farm&quot;. China remained hostile and isolated behind the recently lowered &quot;bamboo curtain&quot;. Nevertheless, by the beginning of 1954 a thaw had begun to seem possible. Stalin had died in March 1953, and the Korean war had been brought to a ceasefire not long afterwards. There were indications that Moscow and its Chinese ally might be interested in making more than a slogan out of &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; with the west. It was, however, France&apos;s losing war in the area then known as &quot;French Indo-China&quot; that persuaded many in western Europe to adopt a more optimistic view of &quot;New China&quot; than President Eisenhower&apos;s bomb-wreathed &quot;domino theory&quot; of Asia&apos;s imminent fall to communism. On the morning of Saturday 24 April, the Chinese prime minister and foreign secretary, Zhou Enlai, flew into Geneva from Moscow. He came at the head of a large Chinese delegation to join France, Britain and Russia in a conference aimed at finding a settlement to the Indo-China war. Previously, west Europeans had known the Chinese leader only through anti-communist stereotypes, or the equally partisan hymns of praise issued by witnesses such as Hewlett Johnson, the inordinately optimistic &quot;Red Dean of Canterbury&quot;. But here he now was, anything but a Russian puppet or, for that matter, a primitive &quot;agrarian reformer&quot; of the kind many in the west imagined the Chinese communists to be. Diverse western Europeans were transfixed by the sight of this urbane and highly competent man, smiling into the cameras as he berated America \u2013 which had refused even to take part in the conference \u2013 and demonstrating his abilities as a regional leader by negotiating ceasefires in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Later in the year, James Cameron would describe Zhou as the man who, in the course of his short visit to Geneva, had produced &quot;the simultaneous double-effect&quot; of &quot;a nervous constriction in the diplomatic hearts and a violent sexual impulse in the persons of almost every European woman who clapped eyes on him&quot;. The flights to Peking began shortly after Zhou&apos;s European triumph. From Geneva, as at the Bandung conference the following year, Zhou invited the world to &quot;come and see&quot; what was going on behind the bamboo curtain. And Britons were among those who headed for the airport. The Labour leadership sent the opening delegation. Clement Attlee was at its head, accompanied by various other members of the National Executive Committee, including Aneurin Bevan and his former insurance minister Edith Summerskill. The cultural delegation, which comprised Casson, Warner, Ayer and Spencer, together with the geologist Leonard Hawkes and the young sinologist John Chinnery, followed later in the summer. Like the vague statement of friendship in its luggage, its membership had been decided by people close to the Britain-China Friendship Association, who were careful to come up with a group that could not easily be dismissed as communist fellow travellers. A delegation of Labour councillors and shop stewards was recruited at the last minute and guided, very reluctantly, by the communist &quot;artist-reporter&quot; Paul Hogarth. He had travelled a lot behind the iron curtain and could not now escape responsibility for chaperoning a very &quot;third rate&quot; Labour delegation whose members, as he told me, cared nothing for China new or old, and wanted only to get drunk at somebody else&apos;s expense. A more senior delegation of Labour MPs, including Barbara Castle, William Griffiths and various other &quot;Bevanites&quot; who had come into the Commons in the 1945 landslide, delayed its departure until early October so that its members could attend the Labour party conference, where they had joined Bevan in objecting, unsuccessfully, to Attlee&apos;s support of cold war policies. There were indeed some pilgrims among the travellers, who saw what they and China&apos;s presenters wanted them to see \u2013 docilely imbibing tea and statistics, smiling back at children in model nurseries, and sensing only a bright cooperative future in fields fertilised with the blood of murdered landlords. But the Attlee delegation was not like that. Its members had fought their own battles against communism in Britain, and they had been well briefed before leaving. They had also been given a detailed anticipation of the &quot;show&quot; they should expect from a collection of Chinese teachers, editors and intellectuals who had moved to Hong Kong. They liked the new marriage laws, the apparent abolition of prostitution, and also the new public health campaigns. As in Moscow, they were, perhaps, a little discomforted as they compared their own achievements while in government in Britain with China&apos;s prodigious construction of factories, mines, housing, schools and hospitals. They stood up to Mao over tea, deplored the regime&apos;s failure to do anything about the booming birth-rate and also criticised the communist-led government for imposing an absurdly distorted idea of the west on their people. If China really believed that the masses in the west sympathised with communism, and were only held down by an evil ruling class, then they might blunder into another war. Even those with strong communist loyalties tried to reduce China&apos;s exclusive reliance on the USSR. Thus, while JD Bernal was known for his mistaken support for the &quot;proletarian science&quot; of the bogus geneticist Trofim\u00a0Lysenko, he certainly did not spend his many lectures trying to convince New China&apos;s scientists to rely on such Soviet\u00a0models, arguing throughout for\u00a0a renewed exchange between Chinese scientists and their colleagues in the west. It was a similar situation with the artists Paul Hogarth and Denis Mathews. They were both happy to celebrate the liberation and the ongoing reconstruction of China. And yet they were also united in their opposition to the idea that Soviet socialist realism offered an adequate model for the future development of Chinese art. They argued this point forcefully with the artists who welcomed them and accompanied them around the country. Both insisted that it would be far better to consider the new forms of figuration pioneered by Picasso and Guttuso in western Europe. Meanwhile, confusion as well as unexpected light followed from the visitors&apos; habit of applying British analogies to Chinese realities. Attlee himself praised New China&apos;s still expanding network of cooperatives, seeing in them the principle of &quot;voluntary action&quot; that William Beveridge had insisted was the necessary attendant to the welfare state. The national secretary of the Women&apos;s Cooperative Guild, Mabel Ridealgh, likened China&apos;s extensive cooperatives to those of her own organisation and joined Castle in comparing China&apos;s food distribution system to the Co-op in Britain. Earlier post-liberation visitors had already set about Englishing the new Chinese scene. &quot;It&apos;s the same in Marylebone High Street,&quot; the veteran actor Miles Malleson had remarked in 1953: he was thinking of New China&apos;s appetite for dramas with a contemporary message. Basil Davidson had reserved a different English comparison for a communist group leader in the southern city of Canton. Aware of what the regime&apos;s critics said about such watchful cadres, he insisted that she was &quot;as much a spy on her 50 families as the chairman of my parish council, in rural Essex, is a spy on me&quot;. Hogarth was merely continuing in this line when he declared arriving in Shanghai to be like &quot;pulling into Manchester from Sheffield&quot;, while Hangchow (Hangzhou) was like &quot;a South Coast English seaside resort whose better days lay at the beginning of the century&quot;. He found a more original English line on China&apos;s revolutionary art. Visiting the Lu Xun museum in Shanghai, he enjoyed the discovery that those stark woodcuts, designed to galvanise illiterate peasants into action against both the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s reactionary nationalists, were descended from leafy English scenes portrayed by such far from revolutionary artists as Gwen Raverat, Robert Gibbings and Edward Bawden. There was a characteristically English way of looking at China&apos;s notoriously bloody &quot;agrarian reform&quot; too. In 1949, Mao had famously proclaimed that the Chinese people had at last &quot;stood up&quot;, and Hogarth was happy to confirm that claim. His drawing of a &quot;Shansi peasant&quot; shows a man standing very upright indeed: clasping the wooden hayfork that rises next to his head, he stares back with a resolute expression that is neither cringing nor deferential. Made in the field, as was this determined artist-reporter&apos;s way, Hogarth&apos;s drawing evokes an English analogy already employed by Joseph Needham, Davidson and other visitors \u2013 the English Diggers and Levellers of the 17th century, who had torn down fences and set to work digging up the commons land stolen from them under the new Enclosure Acts. It was at once an evasive strategy and a concerted attempt to assert an English tradition uncompromised by a mutually hated British imperialism. Yet it was Spencer who raised the art of being English in New China to its strangest heights. Twenty years earlier, he had recorded the desire to write the story of his life as if it were a wandering &quot;journey to China&quot;, and he had no sooner landed at the airfield outside Peking than he started peering around in startled recognition: &quot;As I drove along the roads from the airports to the towns it was almost comic to see these dreams of mine coming true on either side of the road.&quot; Other delegates cringed as he harassed the guides at various historical sites with peculiar offscript questions, and tormented helpless waiters with requests for fish and chips. As for New China&apos;s artists, Spencer had no prescriptions to offer about socialist realism. Instead he informed his audience at the Central Academy of Fine Arts that he was &quot;possibly the most marvellous visitor to China they had ever had&quot;. He ventured that his visit was &quot;something on a par with the coming of Buddha&quot;, later explaining that he had felt obliged to emphasise this fact &quot;because in England if people don&apos;t know who I am I am at once called upon to carry heavy suitcases&quot;. Britain&apos;s horrified charg\u00e9 d&apos;affaires in Peking, Humphrey Trevelyan, avoided that particular occasion but could not escape the &quot;fatuous performance&quot; in which Spencer, Ayer, Warner, Casson and Hawkes, the leader of the cultural delegation, presented their statement of friendship to the minister of culture, Kuo Mo-jo, a man whose purpose was so obviously to &quot;exploit the word &apos;peace&apos; for political ends&quot;. Trevelyan was particularly dismayed to hear Spencer &quot;guilelessly expatiating&quot; about &quot;the delights of Formosa&quot;. For Trevelyan, as for Kuo Mo-jo and his colleagues, Formosa was the American-buoyed nationalist island that the communist slogans fiercely insisted was really China&apos;s Taiwan. And now here was Spencer blundering on without ever really making it clear that the &quot;Formosa&quot; in his mind was actually a little island in the Thames at Cookham, with a creek, a picturesque old house, and a field in which the local Boy Scouts held their musters. Judging from the notes he wrote after returning home, Spencer made very short work of the Great Wall of China too. Indeed, he reduced it to the garden wall along which he had liked to walk as a child in Cookham. He had, as he explained, climbed up by the coal cellar and triumphed over many challenges as he made his way along its length: not the advancing Manchu army, but the leaning lid of the dustbin, the ivy that stretched over some sections, and the protruding branches of cherry, yew and fir that also had to be negotiated over that wall&apos;s rather less than 4,000 mile length. Spencer \u2013 who told Zhou that &quot;I feel at home in China because I feel that Cookham is somewhere near, only just around the corner&quot; \u2013 was uniquely idiosyncratic, but he was by no means the only delegate who seems to have journeyed to the far side of the world without ever really leaving England behind. As for the future of this attempted rapprochement between Britain and &quot;New China&quot;, the optimistic &quot;spirit of Geneva&quot; evaporated soon enough after the last delegates came home, and the blocs quickly refroze. Yet that moment of hopefulness was not entirely without consequences. Trade between Britain and China was renewed over the years to come, diplomatic relations were established, and cultural exchanges did develop. The Bevanite perspective within the Labour party cannot be said to have thrived, but the insistence on maintaining an independent British stance towards Washington was alive in the 60s, when Harold Wilson refused to commit British forces to America&apos;s war in Vietnam. Though insufficient to restrain Tony Blair from joining Bush&apos;s invasion of Iraq, it did continue to resound in the heartfelt declamations that the elderly Barbara Castle used to launch against various New Labour policies during her last years in the House of Lords. She informed me in no uncertain terms that the true delinquents of 1954 were those in power who refused to rise to the opportunities of the moment, and certainly not those like herself who went to China with the aim of lifting the bamboo curtain. Of the British artists who went to China in 1954, neither Spencer nor Hogarth would ever return. Mathews, however, would try to maintain the dialogue even as China went through the suppression of the Hundred Flowers campaign, the collectivisation of the briefly &quot;cooperative&quot; economy, and the monstrously costly &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;. He used his position as secretary of the Contemporary Art Society at the Tate Gallery to promote an exchange of exhibitions. Working directly with Chinese government agencies, he began by organising a survey show of British Graphic Art, which was taken to China by his fellow organiser and artist Richard Carline in 1955. He himself returned in 1960, accompanying an exhibition of recent paintings entitled Sixty Years of British Painting in Oils. He found China to be a very different place. Discussion was discouraged, the circulation of the show was curtailed, and he was prevented from renewing his acquaintance with some of the Chinese artists he had got to know in 1954. Mathews made no progress in his attempt to use the exhibition to create a comparative discussion about aesthetics \u2013 finding himself assailed with dogmatic slogans decreeing that all work produced in China since the liberation of 1949 must be superior to anything produced before, and that no painting of a shrimp, even by the venerated master Qi Baishi, could beat a portrait of Chairman Mao.", "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture", "Politics", "Society", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-29T23:07:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/30/this-weeks-new-films", "sentences": ["John Madden&apos;s Mossad thriller The Debt stars Helen Mirren and Sam Worthington; A Jewish Girl In Shanghai offers a Chinese animated take on the Holocaust; and Holy Rollers features The Social Network&apos;s Jesse Eisenberg as a Hasidic ecstasy smuggler."], "title": "This week's new film events", "article": "London Children&apos;s Film Festival It&apos;s a win-win at this kids&apos; cinema event: the anxiety of plonking your children in front of the screen for some (quality) passive entertainment is offset by energetic activities.

England&apos;s biggest film festival after London, and though it features some the highlights of its rival including Never Let Me Go, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, and The King&apos;s Speech, Leeds is very much its own show, with a mostly unseen slate of films from around the world. The emphasis is on new northern European cinema such as Norwegian black comedy The Art Of Negative Thinking or Russian art thriller How I Ended This Summer, but there&apos;s also room for the likes of hit Aussie thriller Animal Kingdom, not to mention strands on documentary (subjects include Sly Stone, Domino Records and the gay porn industry \u2013 not all at the same time, obviously), experimental cinema and fantasy \u2013 the latter including Fanomenon&apos;s traditional anime and gore marathon sessions.

There you will find documentaries on Joan Rivers and a matzo ball-eating competition, Israel&apos;s Muslim-Jewish comedy series Arab Labour, and Antoine de Caunes as a gay Jewish jazz musician in love with an Arab cross-dresser in He&apos;s My Girl. The serious films are hardly a chore either. John Madden&apos;s Mossad thriller The Debt stars Helen Mirren and Sam Worthington; A Jewish Girl In Shanghai offers a Chinese animated take on the Holocaust; and Holy Rollers features The Social Network&apos;s Jesse Eisenberg as a Hasidic ecstasy smuggler.

The Englishman&apos;s Ryder Cup team-mate Martin Kaymer continues to labour well off the pace at the Andaluc\u00eda Valderrama Volvo Masters, and barring a staggering change of fortune in the final round he will not manage to make the top spot his own. Kaymer must win or share second place with no more than one other player if he, rather than Westwood \u2013 absent because of an injured calf \u2013 is to succeed Tiger Woods when the American&apos;s 281\u2011week reign ends on Monday. Having started his tournament with rounds of 72 and 74, Kaymer will have seen his 70 as a welcome improvement. But realistically he needed to shoot around 66 to move into contention and have a chance of frustrating the ambition of the 37-year-old Worksop player. The leaderboard showed that the 25-year-old German stood nine shots behind Graeme McDowell and Gareth Maybin, the Northern Irish pair who were comfortably clear of the field and sharing the lead on six under par. McDowell, the US Open champion, had two double bogeys in his one-over round of 72, at the seventh and 18th, and while Maybin dropped shots at the first and second holes he improved with three birdies before the turn and then had pars all the way home. Ireland&apos;s Damien McGrane shared third place with Spain&apos;s Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez on two under. McGrane shot 70 and Jim\u00e9nez a level-par 71. Sergio Garc\u00eda showed encouraging form with a round of 69 to move into a share of fifth place with Thomas Bjorn, who had four early birdies and bogeys in a 71. Sweden&apos;s Niclas Fasth dropped from third to 13th by following a 66 with a 76, but he was still one shot better off than Kaymer. Despite winning four times this season, Kaymer will almost certainly have to wait for his chance to become the second German to top the world rankings. His countryman Bernhard Langer was No1 when the rankings were launched in 1986, conceding the position three weeks later to Seve Ballesteros. When Woods began his latest stint at No1, Westwood stood 35th and was making a comeback after slumping from fourth in 2001 to outside the top 250 less than two years later.

This gigantic and lengthy event, which finishes today, is defined through superlatives: with more than 70 million visitors it is the largest expo ever held, singlehandedly resurrecting an event which had become the object of retro-futurist nostalgia. There&apos;s more to the expo than mere PR puffery \u2013 what it says about architecture and the city is fascinating, and what it neglects to say, even more so. Like all expos since the 1950s, Shanghai 2010 has a theme, which is &quot;Better City, Better Life&quot;, and a sugary sinopop theme song bears the same title. It crams into the site all possible debates about the contemporary city \u2013 but crucially, it smooths them all into a flat, undifferentiated surface of interesting stuff. In this, it&apos;s of a piece with the New Confucianism currently espoused by the Communist party, where talk of the &quot;harmonious society&quot; has replaced talk of equality and class conflict. What makes this so surprising to the outsider is the impression of contradictions gone wild that marks both the expo and the city around it. In contemporary Shanghai, architectural styles all coincide \u2013 the crassest postmodern revivalism and the purest ascetic modernism. You see innumerable blocks of flats clad in neoclassical or neogothic detail, but they&apos;re arranged in the geometrically ordered towers-in-parkland style of 1950s high modernism, invariably with south-facing aspect. You find vertiginous skyscrapers treated as objects of national pride that were developed by and bear the logos of Japanese or Taiwanese capital. Some old neighbourhoods \u2013 whether the Tudorbethan villas built for French and British colonials and the indigenous bourgeoises, or the ultra-dense Lilong courtyard housing built for the Chinese masses \u2013 are restored to the point of sanitisation, some are rotting or demolished, others are reconstructed afresh. At the same time, a high rise boom creates a precipitous, sometimes unnerving and sometimes thrilling new landscape. This too is the product of contradiction \u2013 the pinnacles at the top of each tower are not pure capitalist spectacle but the result of state planning edicts, to stop extra floors being built on top. There is green infrastructure, in the form of an extensive metro system built at lightning speed, and a Maglev train \u2013 though the latter goes only from the Pudong business district to the less-than-green airport. Simultaneously, the city erects the most astonishing, Cyclopean multi-level expressways to induce people off bikes and into SUVs. The megalopolis at the centre of the Yangtze river delta, whose factories, refineries and power stations are going at full pelt, creating a charred, apocalyptic industrial maelstrom, suffers nowadays from the consequences of deindustrialisation, with numerous inner-city industrial structures ripe for creative reuse. All this raging tension is supposedly harmonious. It is fitting, in a society that still claims to cling to socialist values, while enforcing a spectacularly exploitative primitive accumulation. All this is especially glaring on the expo site itself. The vision of a &quot;Better City, Better Life&quot; takes place on a site cleared both of industry and some 60,000 inhabitants. Most of the press attention has been focused on the international section of this vast event. Here, contemporary architecture is at its most ephemeral, with each building designed to last only six months, which doesn&apos;t preclude most of them from making various gestures at sustainability. The structures range from silly (Belarus&apos;s cheerfully kitsch decorated shed) to sublime (Spain&apos;s uncanny wicker and metal canopy, by Scottish parliament architects EMBT). Yet the international incoherence is only a minor part of the expo&apos;s message. Crossing the river brings you to the infotainment part of the expo. Here, the eco Pavilion of Footprint is directly opposite the Oil Pavilion, decorated in blaring blue neon, just like the city&apos;s expressways. Elsewhere, there&apos;s some adaptive reuse \u2013 the Piranesian China Shipping Pavilion is an embellished shipyard, and the Pavilion of Future a decommissioned power station, just like Tate Modern. Here, tomes on the city of the future, from Thomas More to David Harvey, are piled up, with no sense that each was critiquing existing society through their visions of the future. In the next room, the underwater city of the future sits next to a lime-green illuminated model of a petroleum refinery. Any implication that one might lead to the other is wholly unintentional. Mao Zedong, the face on the banknotes used to purchase the sweatshop-made merchandise, considered contradiction the motive force of the class war. So it&apos;s no surprise that all these opposing forces are held in some kind of balance \u2013 but how long can it be kept up?", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "China", "World news", "Shanghai holidays", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-31T12:45:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/31/lee-westwood-world-no12", "sentences": ["My dad knows how frustrating it was when I dropped out of the top of the world rankings down to 266 \u2013 and he knows how hard I&apos;ve worked to get back.&quot; The acknowledgment among his peers that will count most will be that of the man he unseated when they meet in the WSG-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai this week."], "title": "'I had to work hard to get here,' says new world No1 Lee Westwood", "article": "Lee Westwood will stand the golf world tomorrow morning, the high point of a story punctuated by disappointments, fightbacks and, for the past two years, an irresistible surge to where his talents had always pointed him.

The world&apos;s most populous nation embarked on its once-a-decade exercise today, described by state media as &quot;the biggest social mobilisation of peacetime&quot;. Over the next 10 days, an army of registrars will interview 400m households from the frosty northern province of Heilongjiang to semi-tropical southern Hainan. The survey will cover wealthy professionals in coastal cities such as Shanghai and impoverished herders in the mountains of Tibet in the west. This is a landmark year, the first time the census will count people according to their actual location rather than their household registration or hukou - usually their hometown. That reflects the increasing number of migrants in China; around 210 million last year, according to an estimate by Beijing&apos;s Renmin University. It will cost around 700m yuan (\u00a365m) to tally China&apos;s 1.3 billion citizens. But the government believes the survey is necessary to assess the pace of urbanisation and the needs of its population, helping it to plan for the future and tailor welfare and other services. The capital alone requires 80,000 census takers, officials said. Beijing is full of green vinyl banners with slogans such as &quot;Support the census with a smile; contribute to development with statistics.&quot; China&apos;s vice-premier Li Keqiang urged people to co-operate in a televised appearance last week, explaining it would make statistics more accurate and promising that personal details will remain confidential. Xing Zhihong, deputy director of Beijing&apos;s population census, told China Daily that the information would be destroyed once population statistics had been compiled and released. Chinese media reported that census takers are fighting against suspicion, with doors being slammed in their faces. Some householders may be trying to hide unregistered children lest they are fined for breaching the &quot;one child&quot; birth control policies; others fear the registrars could be criminals casing their property or seeking personal details to defraud them. Academics suggest the mistrust also reflects changing attitudes as people grow wealthier. &quot;People no longer feel they should be managed,&quot; Zhang Yi, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences&apos; institute for population and labour economics, told the China Daily newspaper. &quot;Instead, they believe they should be served by the government. That is why they say no to census takers before they are convinced their privacy is protected.&quot; &quot;Census or not, it doesn&apos;t matter. In the end all statistics will be fake,&quot; huffed one commenter on the popular Tianya website. &quot;The sixth census is just another opportunity for the family planning bureau to collect more fines,&quot; complained a second Tianya user. Others complained it was a waste of money and said the hukou system offered enough information. Prof Duan Chengrong, head of the demography department at Renmin University, told the Beijing News that the census was still likely to miss many people. He said migrants often gave misleading answers on issues such as their length of residence, and would not be included in their hometown. He also warned it was hard to find enough competent census takers. Other problems include the irregular working hours of many migrants. A census taker in Guangzhou, where the exercise started early, reported having to visit one household eight times. The Beijing News said census-takers can ask police for help if residents repeatedly refuse to answer questions. In many places, officials are distributing small gifts such as shopping bags to those who complete the forms. Most respondents will answer 18 questions covering details such as their education and ethnicity, with one in 10 filling out a 45-part questionnaire. The results will be published next April. China&apos;s last census in 2000 tallied the population at just under 1.3 billion, with 64% of those living in the countryside. Researchers think that is likely to have underestimated the rate of urbanisation.

It has become a work with its own meaning.&quot; Ai has had something of a turbulent relationship with authorities in China ever since the age of 10, when his family was exiled to a labour camp, after his father, Ai Qing \u2013 China&apos;s leading poet \u2013 was accused of being a dissident. He lived in the US for more than a decade before returning to China in 1993 when his father fell ill. While he was exhibiting in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, in August last year, he was beaten about the head by police who raided his hotel, and suffered a haemorrhage a month later as a result of the blow.

This year he made a documentary on the story of Feng Zhengzu, the Chinese human rights activist who spent more than three months living in Narita airport, in Tokyo, after being denied re-entry to China eight times following a trip to see his sister in Japan. Ai said officials had told him the Shanghai government was &quot;frustrated&quot; about documentaries he had made. on sensitive incidents in the city. &quot;It&apos;s definitely some kind of political issue. It&apos;s just so weird. Nobody can explain the situation and even high officials who invited me only say &apos;Sorry, we can&apos;t help&apos; or &apos;We tried, but it&apos;s impossible&apos;.&quot; The final demolition order \u2013 which would give him 20 days to move out \u2013 could arrive any day, Ai said, but in the meantime he is planning to hold a farewell party at the studio on Sunday &quot;to celebrate its life and death&quot;.

In London the FTSE 100 hit its highest level in nearly 29 months, with other European markets also showing strong gains. US stocks also rallied, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 1% when Wall Street opened. The FTSE 100 rose by as much as 111 points to 5860, a 1.8% gain, taking the blue-chip index to its highest level since June 2008. It remained high after the Bank of England decided not to expand its own quantitative easing (QE) programme, and left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, while also keeping its own QE programme at \u00a3200bn. The European Central Bank also left rates unchanged at its meeting on monetary policy across the eurozone today. Last night the Fed announced a second round of QE in which it will inject $600bn (\u00a3370bn) \u2013 $75bn a month \u2013 into the economy through asset purchases by the end of June next year in an attempt to revive the flagging recovery. Most analysts had expected the Fed to pump in $500bn. However, some traders pointed out that the US economy still faces very serious problems, as will be shown when monthly unemployment data is released tomorrow. &quot;It seems that in the very short term, the market has received QE2 well, but with jobless data round the corner and the health of the recovery now under even closer scrutiny, any real vindication of the policy could take months to emerge,&quot; said Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, director of private client research at Charles Stanley, said the Fed was unlikely to be able to launch a third bout of QE next year. &quot;The final months of the QE2 programme are likely to be dominated by talk along the lines of &apos;will the Fed do a QE3?&apos; The newly appointed Congress is going to say &apos;no&apos;,&quot; he said. Asia rallies overnight When the reinvestment of maturing debt held by the Fed is added in, monthly Treasury purchases will be around $110bn, according to a statement issued by the New York Fed yesterday. Thus the total programme amounts to $850bn- $900bn. The Dow Jones closed up 26.41 points at 11,215.13 last night, its highest level for two years. Today it gained another 124 points in early trading to 11,339. In Asia, Japan&apos;s benchmark Nikkei index jumped 198.80 points today, or 2.2%, to 9358.78.

Good morning. This is Today for one day only with Simon Jeffery and Lucy Mangan. In the absence of the BBC&apos;s own Today programme we&apos;ll be with you on this live blog from 7am until 9am unless ...  ... unless well, that thing is true about the nuclear submarine commanders getting orders to assume that in the absence of the Today programme Great Britain is no more and the only recourse is to unleash nuclear armageddon. If so, we hope we get two or three minutes warning. If it comes to that, seriously now people, quit reading this live blog and call people you love. In the end, love is all we have.  But while we&apos;ll all still here and unvapourised - and seeing as the submarines appear to have been ok with Today&apos;s first missing hour from 6-7am, it&apos;s looking good so far - here are the headlines this morning. \u2022 Thousands of BBC journalists are on strike this morning in a dispute over pensions which has caused chaos to radio and television schedules. Radio 4&apos;s Today programme is off air and flagship TV news bulletins including Newsnight and BBC Breakfast will be affected. The National Union of Journalists general secretary Jeremy Dear said &quot;NUJ members across the BBC have consistently dubbed the proposals &apos;a pensions robbery&apos;. That hasn&apos;t changed. The BBC have now left members with no choice but to take action to defend their pensions.&quot;  Dan Sabbagh is our media editor and we&apos;ll have more from him later. \u2022\u00a0At least 49 people have been killed in the latest eruption of the Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia. Almost 100 people are now said to have been killed in the disaster and hundreds are still fleeing from their homes. \u2022 A plane has crashed in Cuba killing all 68 people on board. The Aero-Caribbean aircraft crashed as it was flying from the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba to the capital Havana, according to state media \u2022 The CEO of Qantas has announced in a press conference in Sydney that there was a possible fault in the engine of the Airbus 380 which had engine failure yesterday \u2022 and Michael Jackson&apos;s posthumous album will be released on December 14. Entitled, Michael, it is not yet clear which material it will contain  7.14am: It&apos;s now 14 minutes past seven. China is, as we all know, the world&apos;s emerging powerhouse, which means that relations between the UK and China are more important than ever. But it&apos;s not always an easy one. To help improve it, David Cameron is leading the largest ever delegation to China next week. Tania Branigan is our correspondent in Beijing. Tania.      Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    2010 saw a rocky start to relations between Britain and China, as Beijing cancelled a human rights dialogue following London&apos;s protests over the execution of Akhmal Shaikh, the Briton executed for drug smuggling despite strong evidence of serious mental illness. But both sides hope it will end rather better: David Cameron will arrive here on Tuesday with the largest ever British delegation. George Osborne, Vince Cable, Michael Gove and Chris Huhne will round out the team, along with around 50 business people. The focus is on partnership and that word beloved of China&apos;s leadership \u2013 harmony. Good relations are more important than ever for Britain given the tough economic outlook. While China&apos;s growth may have slowed \u2013 in part because the leadership sought to rein it in - it remains the envy of all other major economies. But London believes it has something to offer Beijing too: its commitment to open markets makes it a useful partner as the spectre of protectionism looms. Human rights will still play a small part; Cameron will reportedly raise the case of Nobel peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo, jailed for co-authoring a call for democratic reforms. China says he is a criminal and has reportedly pressed European governments to shun the award ceremony and avoid statements of support. But the British will hope that has minimal impact on the first prime ministerial visit for almost three years, and \u2013 from an economic point of view \u2013 arguably the most important for a long time.      Simon Jeffery Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian    7.19am: It&apos;s 19 minutes past seven. You are reading Today for one day only and coming up in the next half hour we have Michael White&apos;s paper review, Polly Toynbee&apos;s Thought for the Day and the sport.  7.25am: Twenty five minutes past seven. Over to Graeme Wearden on our business desk.      Its a busy morning in the City, where the Royal Bank of Scotland, have just reported financial results for the third quarter of 2010. RBS, which is 84% owned by the taxpayer, made a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.38bn between July and September - mainly due to the way it values its own debt and pays for the government guarantee of its bad loans through the asset protection scheme. Stephen Hester, the chief executive, would rather the City ignored those elements and focused on a \u00a3726m operating profit for the third quarter. In his words &quot;accounting treatment of some balance sheet items is volatile and can sometimes obscure our underlying story&quot;. The bank has quantified the tax it will have to pay for George Osborne&apos;s bank levy for the first time - \u00a3225m-\u00a3250m in 2011, rising to approximately \u00a3350-\u00a3400m in 2012. The investment bank, which always faces controversy because of the bonuses that it pays out,suffered a 20% fall in revenues in the third quarter but only a 3% fall in &quot;expenses&quot; suggesting that the bonus pool is still mounting. Another UK high street bank, HSBC, is due to announce its third-quarter results at 8.15am. \u2022 We&apos;re also had results from Rentokil this morning, which warned of tough trading conditions - especially for its City Link parcel delivery arm.  \u2022 There&apos;s better news from Carphone Warehouse, though,which has announced it will start paying a dividend to shareholders. \u2022 City traders believe that shares are likely to keep rising in London today, with stockmarkets across Asia already enjoying a good day - Japan&apos;s Nikkei gained 3% at one stage. IG Index has predicted that the FTSE 100 will jump by 26 points to 5889 when trading begins at 8am - which would be its highest level since June 2008. There is still asense of optimism following the $600bn quantitive easing package announced by the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday night. QE2, as it&apos;s been dubbed, has weakened the US currency. Sterling is still hovering around a nine-month high against the dollar, trading at$1.6222 this morning. \u2022 Later today we&apos;ll also get a fresh snapshot of the situation in America&apos;s troubled employment market. The non-farm payroll, due at 12.30pm GMT, is expected to show that 60,000 new jobs were created in October across America. Sounds good on paper, but economists warn that it&apos;s only half the number needed just to keep the unemployment ratesteady.  7.28am: It&apos;s now 28 minutes past seven.

Sean Ingle Photograph: David Levene    Good morning Simon. Although it&apos;s hardly a pleasant one for Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini, whose side lost 3-1 away at Lech Poznan in Poland last night.  That&apos;s City&apos;s third successive defeat on the bounce and the usually sauve Mancini seems to be feeling the pressure, telling reporters afterwards: &quot;At the moment everything is against us.&quot;      Lech Poznan's Artjoms Rudnevs challenges for the ball against Manchester City's Dedryck Boyata. Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters    Mancini also seemed at a loss to explain how Poznan won, claiming: &quot;They had nothing we did not. We had more chances than Poznan to score. It&apos;s better that these things happen now that we are still first in this group and fourth in the Premier League. We have 20 good players and we can change this but only if we stay together.&quot;  Come together more like, judging by the squallid newspaper headlines about boozing sessions at student parties and squad in-fighting in recent days. However another under-pressure manager, Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson, will be a much happier man this morning after his side came from a goal down to beat Napoli 3-1 - although he was grateful to his captain Steven Gerrard, who scored a thunderous hat-trick after coming on at half-time. &quot;We owe a big debt of gratitude to him,&quot; said Hodgson, using the royal &apos;we&apos;, &quot;but he&apos;d be the first to join me and say it was a good team performance in the second half. We deserved to win the game.&quot; Meanwhile down under, England have made a solid start to their first match of the Ashes tour against Western Australia. The hosts, who won the toss and elected to bat, are 156-4 after 57 overs with Stuart Broad taking three wickets for England. We&apos;ll hopefully have the latest from David Hopps in Perth in an hour&apos;s time.  7.48am: It&apos;s now 12 minutes to eight and its time for Thought for the Day. The writer is Polly Toynbee.      Good news: a report this week shows the number of donated organs for transplant has risen to its highest ever level. This is partly driven by a government campaign since 2008 that added 200 specialist transplant nurses to Intensive Care Units, encouraging families of the dying to save the lives of others. Less good news is that three people die every day waiting on the growing transplant list. Only 28% of people have signed up to the Organ Donor Register to make sure the corneas, livers, kidneys or other body parts they no longer have any use for can save the sight or the lives of several other people. Why not? Many are squeamish at the thought of having their own or their loved ones cut up after death. Opinion polls show virtually everyone would accept an organ if they needed one, but very many fewer are easy with the idea of giving bits of their dead bodies. Why is that? Some primitive refusal to accept death, a denial that this precious body \u2013 our own or a loved ones&apos; - really is nothing when the breath of live has left it. But it will rot or burn anyway, unless you&apos;re into cryogenics or mummification. Consign it to the grave or the crematorium and there goes the chance of giving someone else the life that you have lost. It should be easiest thing on earth to give away something you will never have any use for. How much saner it would be to presume that organs can be taken from that anyone who has not specifically registered a refusal to donate \u2013 but such is the timorousness of politicians they would rather let three patients a day die than present the robust rational case. The great advantage of writing this here instead of broadcasting a Thought for the Day is that all of you reading this have no excuse now not to click on this link and add your name to the official Organ Donor Register, RIGHT NOW!      Lucy Mangan Photograph: Linda Nylind    7.51am: Right, I&apos;m on deck, eager to play my part in this historical event - offering you a splendiferous alternative to the Today programme for - um - today. Think of me as Evan Davies without the piercings. Although frankly, if it&apos;s a slow news day, anything could happen by the end of the morning. Speaking of whom, although the great man himself is not in the studio, happily he is tweeting. Apparently his partner &quot;is worryingly enthusiastic about the programme on birdlife in The Wash which is replacing strike-hit @r4today.&quot; Didn&apos;t hear it myself as I&apos;ve been too busy trying to sleep-read the papers on the train on the way in since 6am, but I&apos;m glad SOMEONE&apos;S having a good time.      Simon Jeffery Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian    7.55am: Five minutes to eight and we now go over to Lee Glendinning in our Sydney weather centre for the weekend weather ahead, Lee ...           Apologies for the lack of light on Lee&apos;s face in the weather centre / her flat. I&apos;m sure Lord Reith had these kinds of troubles too.  8am: peep peep peeeeiiiiip. It is 8am on Friday 5 November and you are reading Today for one day only. For headlines, scroll down to the entry at 7am.  8.05am: Five minutes past eight. The big news out of the United States this week has of course been the Democrats&apos; drubbing in the midterm elections. But what does that mean for Barack Obama. We go over to Richard Adams in Washington for more. Richard     . Photograph: guardian.co.uk    Fallout from the US midterm elections continues as the Democrat and Republican parties jockey for position. There was some good news for the Democrats as the final results come in: late last night Patty Murray was declared the winner of the Washington state Senate election, defeating Republican Dino Rossi by 51% to 49%. That leaves the Democrats total in the 100-seat Senate at 53, while it&apos;s the third time Rossi has lost an election by a narrow margin. In 2004 he lost the Washington governorship race by just 133 votes. With the midterm elections out of the way American politicians can get down to the serious task of speculating about the 2012 presidential election, and especially the identify of the candidates. But two people were more concerned with denying that they were in the running. One favourite for the Republican nomination is New Jersey governor Chris Christie, although he insists he&apos;s not interested. &quot;Short of suicide, I don&apos;t really know what I&apos;d have to do to convince you people that I&apos;m not running,&quot; Christie told reporters at a pressconference. &quot;I&apos;ve said I don&apos;t want to. I&apos;m not going to. There is zero chance I will.&quot; So that&apos;s a maybe, governor? For Hillary Clinton, questions about her presidential ambitions followed her all the way to New Zealand, where she curtly ruled out running in 2012 or 2016 after being questioned by journalists during her visit there. But it didn&apos;t seem to make any difference to New Zealand&apos;s gaffe-prone prime minister John Key, who described her as &quot;President Clinton&quot; while thanking her at a joint press conference in Wellington yesterday.      Simon Jeffery Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian    8.10am: It&apos;s 10 past eight and you are reading Today for one day only. We are supposed to have a heavyweight political interview at this point - except we lost Michael Gove&apos;s number so that&apos;s all fallen a bit behind schedule. But expect Gove some time before 9am (this really is harder than it looks \u2013 our admiration for the Today staff is growing by the second.)  8.12am: Twelve minutes past eight. One bonus of our stumbling attempts to cover all the news in two hours, is (plainly, see 8.10am) to demonstrate how good our colleagues at Today are.      Paul MacInnes and Steve Hewlett. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    To explain why the NUJ is striking at the BBC this morning, the Guardian&apos;s Paul MacInnes spoke to Radio 4 Media Show presenter and media analyst Steve Hewlett. That&apos;s one you can maybe listen to over breakfast.  8.14am: You&apos;re reading Today for one day only, it&apos;s 14 minutes past eight. Our correspondent Tim Dowling is just catching up with some of the newspaper stories that Michael White missed. Tim,     Tim Dowling Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    The Guardian reports that an Channel 4 has scrapped an instalment of the daytime game show Countdown after a contestant, presented with the letters D,T, C, E, I, A, S, H and F, came up with the 8-letter word SHITFACE.      Photograph: Channel 4    The 9-letter SHITFACED apparently did not occur to him. His answer was sadly deemed inappropriate for a daytime audience, as indeed this story probably would be for the Today programme. Not here, though. The Daily Mail, meanwhile, claims that the government&apos;s migration cap contains a loophole exemption which could see the UK flooded with foreign DJs, magicians, models, ice hockey coaches, acupuncturists and polo grooms. The Telegraph says that David Beckham is &quot;hoping to become an American citizen&quot; and the Times has some kind of paywall that stops you looking at the website unless you pay a quid, so the hell with them.&quot;      Lucy Mangan Photograph: Linda Nylind    8.17am: I wonder how many strikes over pensions by various institutions and corporations across the nation there have to be before the importance of having such a thing impresses itself sufficiently on my consciousness for me to sort one out?  8.20am: It&apos;s 20 minutes past eight.

Allegra Stratton and Michael Gove. Photograph: Frank Baron/Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Yes he would he tells Allegra Stratton in our 8.24am interview. Gove says the Today programme can be an &quot;irritating presence&quot; but &quot;like test matches, like the proms, like the Malvern hills, is just part of the British landscape so it is a pity we are not getting it this morning.&quot;      Lucy Mangan Photograph: Linda Nylind    8.28am: It had to happen. Lawson-lust is about to bankrupt the country. I paraphrase slightly, but that is what I glean from the new figures released by ICM which say that the average cost of a new kitchen is now \u00a33,950, up 45% in the last five years, apparently in an attempt to ape celebrity chefs.  And that&apos;s before you add in the cost of strewing the place with fairy lights and stocking your walk in larder with organic pasta shapes, polished capers and poor women&apos;s dreams. Meanwhile the Building Cost Information Service offers an additional little amuse-bouche by estimating that the cost of new kitchens put into houses worth \u00a31m is between \u00a311,110 and \u00a3104,000. As someone who is currently trying to repaint grey melamine doors hanging off sad, sad plywood frames that haunt my dreams, begging in dry, dusty, degraded-glue voices to be put out of their misery, in a colour that doesn&apos;t make me retch every time set foot in my own kitchen, these are figures that make me feel like I missed a memo somewhere along the line.  A life memo. One that explains how to make the choices in which the world of six-burner stoves, double ovens and - yes! yes! - fairy lights on every surface becomes possible. It can&apos;t be too late.      Simon Jeffery Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian    8.33am: It&apos;s 33 minutes past eight and here is Will Hayler with today&apos;s racing tips. Now just imagine some banter between Will and I to complete the Today for one day only experience  8.36am: It&apos;s 36 minutes past eight.There&apos;s been a third night of rioting at a prison complex in South Yorkshire. Helen Carter sent us this report...      After two nights of rioting at Moorlands Young Offenders&apos; Institution, the disturbances spread to an adult unit on the same site near Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Prison Service chief executive Michael Spurr said additional staff were being sent to the prison &quot;to ensure stability&quot;. A total of 166 prisoners are being transferred to other prisons across the country after officers in riot gear, known as Tornado response teams, were called in to restore order for the third night. One prisoner was seriously injured and was taken to hospital for treatment.  The Prison Service said a third incident occurred last night at Moorland prison, on the male adult Category C side, when prisoners started throwing objects and damaging the wing. By 1.25am, all prisoners had surrendered and 166 are being removed to other establishments.  Spurr added: &quot;We have a good record of maintaining order and security in our prisons and are therefore taking these incidents extremely seriously in order to learn lessons.&quot;      Lucy Mangan Photograph: Linda Nylind    8.38am: Now with details of tomorrow&apos;s Saturday Guardian we now go to Kath Viner.

Anne Enright on why Irish writers are so good at short stories. Sheryl Crow on her adoptions. An Arctic adventure. The real people behind Twitter spoofs (they&apos;re all middle-aged men). Robbie Savage: the unlikely voice of reason in football. And there should be some news, too, provided it knows how to happen without the BBC watching. I&apos;m chuckling, as I understand is required at this point. The Saturday Guardian: you&apos;d be mad to miss it!

Tim Dowling Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    According to the Daily Mail, former England captain David Beckham is seeking US citizenship. But what are the implications for his career, not to say his vast fortune? We&apos;re now joined live from LA by Mr Beckham himself, who can hopefully shed some light on the story. &quot;Hello David, and welcome. First of all, is it true? Are you reallyseeking US citizenship?  David?... can you hear me David? David? Ah. Oh dear. Apparently we&apos;ve lost David due to technical difficulties. We&apos;ll try to get him for you and bring you that interview later in the programme...&quot;      Simon Jeffery Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian    8.43am: It&apos;s 17 minutes to nine, you are reading Today for one day only and here is Sean Ingle with the sport.     David Hopps and Sean Ingle. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/David Levene for the Guardian    Hello again. And, as promised earlier, it&apos;s over to David Hopps in Perth for the latest news from England&apos;s tour match against Western Australia. Good morning David, so how are England getting on in the first day of their Ashes Tour? A tough day, and not a particularly exciting one, but one that has turned out well for England. Stuart Broad launched the tour in perfect fashion by taking two Western Australian wickets before they had a run on the board. Notts&apos; Adam Voges made 72 as Western Australia fought back, but they are currently 201-6. Very much England&apos;s day. And what about Jimmy Anderson, who is playing his first game since cracking a rib sparring with Chris Tremlett on a pre-Ashes bootcamp? England&apos;s insistence that Anderson&apos;s boxing injury had been exaggerated has been backed up by his display today. He stepped things up the day progressed, took a deserved wicket, and as long as he suffers no reaction, worries that he won&apos;t be fit for Brisbane have been removed.     Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images    I see England picked Ian Bell ahead of Eoin Morgan. Is that a pointer to their thinking ahead of the first Test, which starts in just 20 days&apos; time? Do you expect the team that is out there today to face Australia come Brisbane? Andrew Strauss indicated that England would field their likeliest Test X1 in Perth. So that may mean no place for Eoin Morgan in Brisbane unless another batsman looks totally out of form. As for the bowlers, Steve Finn will need to prove his right to a place ahead of Chris Tremlett. Finally, how much do warm-up matches ultimately matter? Historically do they provide any significant pointers to what&apos;s to come during the Ashes? The last England coach Duncan Fletcher preferred 14 a side on England&apos;s last tour and they lost 5-0, so it&apos;s a relief to see England playing proper tour games again. But as long as they don&apos;t lose heavily \u2013 which really would be a worry \u2013 it&apos;s not the results that matter as much as the preparation. Thanks David. Elsewhere, Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has insisted he will not resign despite his side losing their third game in a row, a 3-1 away defeat at Lech Poznan last night. &quot;For me it is totally clear. I will stay at City until they fire me,&quot; he said. &quot;I have seen the owner Sheikh Mansour two or three times and we have a very good relationship.&quot; But, given his record at this stage of the season is worse than Mark Hughes&apos; last season, and the rumours of strife and unrest at the club, he clearly faces a bumpy ride. Which brings us nicely on to racing. The Breeders&apos; Cup meeting starts tonight at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, and our racing correspondent Greg Wood goes for Harmonious in the big race, the Breeders&apos; Cup Filly Mare Turf. How Mancini must crave some of that.  8.48am: More than a million Poles left the country and headed for richer corners of Europe - mostly Britain - when the country joined the EU in2004. Now Poland wants some of them back. Helen Pidd sent this report      Last night some of the top earning Poles in the UK were invited to a glossy event at the Polish embassy in London to persuade them that their native land has changed for the better since they left the motherland. These high-fliers were told that while Britain braces itself for a double-dip recession, the Polish economy is now growing faster than the economy of the whole Euro zone and 1.5% faster than the average growth of all EU members. Plus Poland is currently creating moreprofessional white collar jobs than the UK, according to literature handed out at last night&apos;s event. Polish Professionals in London (PPL), a networking group for upwardly young Poles in the City, reports a &quot;three-fold increase in vacancies since January this year, as well as a sharp increase in the number of Polish professionals who seek our help in relocating to their country.&quot; &quot;Poland suddenly became an interesting career choice,&quot; said Christopher Hume, managing director of AER International, a recruitment agency specialising in enticing expatriate Poles to return home. How long before Britons are heading to Warsaw in search of work?      Simon Jeffery Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian    8.50am: And now over to Andrew Sparrow, who has been speaking to the former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell about tuition fees.     Andrew Sparrow. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    The Liberal Democrats should not pretend that they agree with the Conservatives about everything. At least, that&apos;s the view of Sir Menzies Campbell, who told me this:  Where there are genuine differences, I think we should be comfortable expressing them. The public are not fools. The public don&apos;t imagine that there&apos;s been a merger. Anyone who has been following the local government results since May will know that there have been many occasions where the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives have fought each other in local government byelections. That&apos;s taking place, maybe at a grassroots level and not immediately obvious to the Westminster village. Our singularity we are maintaining. I have not ceased to be a Liberal Democrat simply because we&apos;ve found it necessary to join a coalition designed primarily for the purpose of restoring economic stability in this country.  Campbell reaffirmed his commitment to vote against the government&apos;s plans to raise tuition fees.  I was asking if I would sign a document giving an undertaking [to vote against an increase in tuition fees]. I did so in the full glare of publicity. I had my photograph taken. I was surrounded by students when my photograph was taken. I&apos;ve explained I&apos;m the chancellor of St Andrews University with a particular obligation towards students. Having done that I&apos;ve decided that I should maintain promise.  But Ming is reluctant to say what he thinks the party as a whole should be doing. It&apos;s up to other Lib Dem MPs to decide for themselves, he said.     Simon Jeffery Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian    The full interview will be available on Guardian.co.uk by 2pm.

Lucy Mangan Photograph: Linda Nylind    8.54am: Weather-out-the-window: I can say with full meteorological certainty that in N1 9GU, it is warm but quite grey. Reports from Mr Mangan in south-east London are that &quot;it&apos;s a bit damp but the cats have gone out&quot; and in Preston, my auntie Judy &quot;is wearing her good coat&quot;. Which may mean it&apos;s cold but dry or it may mean that she&apos;s off out tonight. She doesn&apos;t know how to answer her mobile so I&apos;m afraid I cannot clarify.  8.55am: Simon Hattenstone, the Guardian&apos;s very own Kirsty Young, sends this breaking news. And sport. And arts . . .     Simon Hattenstone. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    I was going to provide you with some news but I&apos;m secondary picketing. However, I did hear from somebody in the know (is that correct news style, and sufficiently double sourced?), that a pilot yesterday vening refused to carry a would-be deported aslyum seeker home to his possible death. This is the second pilot within a week to come out against Britain&apos;s inhumane asylum policy (please insert neutral tone) Although it could be argued that he refused to carry the asylum seeker because he didn&apos;t want the kerfuffle on his flight because it brings bad publicity to the airline. Now for the latest sport \u2013 Manchester City lost their third game on the trot last night, proving that wealth, health and success are not always natural bedfellows. Now for the weather. It&apos;s getting lighter, but still quite grey and the oldgas works are clearly visible. It was 8.39am just a few minutes ago which takes us to our arts correspondent, who happens to be me \u2013 well the new Mike Leigh film got five stars in the Guardian today, but I still reckon the Kids Are All Right is a better bet (lesbians, straights, kids, domestic bliss, domestic hell you name it) even though it only got four stars last week  8.58am: Our correspondent Ian Cobain is on his way to the High Court where lawyers for 100 Iraqi men who say they were severely mistreated after being imprisoned by British forces are demanding a public inquiry. He sends this...      The men say they were beaten, starved, deprived of sleep and subjected to sensory deprivation while being detained at a secret interrogation centre that operated near Basra between 2003 and 2008. The Ministry of Defence says the allegations are unproven and insists it can investigate the matter itself. But lawyers for the men question whether any MoD investigation will be independent and effective.      Simon Jeffery Photograph: Jocelyn Augustino/The Guardian    9am: It&apos;s 9am you are listening to Today for one day only \u2013 and we are still going because we really have no idea whatsoever how to schedule or time this stuff. It&apos;s hard. So here is a shipping forecast Hope that helps any sailors out there. (And nuclear submariners - we really want to know you&apos;re still out there with us)  9.06am: We&apos;re now crashing hopelessly into the rerun of Desert Island Discs, but here&apos;s Lucy with more news.     Lucy Mangan Photograph: Linda Nylind    The claim by former Countryfile presenter Miriam O&apos;Reilly that she lost her job because the BBC was keen to bring in younger female presenters instead becomes more intrguing the more I look at it. The two main accusations of ageism are that she was warned by director Dean Jones that &quot;you&apos;re going to have to be careful about those wrinkles when high definition comes in&quot; and offered black spray dye when a cameraman mistook her scalp for white roots. O&apos;Reilly is - and this is relevant to the upcoming point, so don&apos;t start bristling before you need to - a lovely looking woman. So the fear really does seem to be identifiable specifically as a fear of older women. Or women looking older. Or possibly of women looking as if they are not frightened of getting older. Sometimes I think this last is the real fear behind such (alleged) comments. Botox and plastic surgery, after all, don&apos;t actually make you look youthful. They make you look like you&apos;ve had Botox or plastic surgery. But they also say &apos;You&apos;ve got me. I&apos;m worried, I&apos;m vulnerable, I&apos;m willing to play the game.&quot; It&apos;s the suggestion of a willingness to conform that makes it attractive. That said, I&apos;ve just seen what I look like when I get up at 5 in the morning after three hours&apos; sleep and I&apos;m off to dip my head in a bucket of haemorrhoid cream. They say it tightens everything marvellously - as, I suppose, a moment&apos;s thought or study of the traditional application process would suggest.  9.09am: Nine minutes late, and there&apos;s still loads to get through. (How do they do it?).  Ahead of the Burmese elections on Sunday, we sent a reporter undercover to talk to people on the ground in a country that is resigned to the continuing rule of the military junta.  Our reporter travelled across the country, talking to people in roadside teashops, safehouses and secure hotel rooms. Our man describes the election as being everywhere and nowhere. Everywhere in subtle references: to unreliable electricity, to untraceable taxes, to unremitting poverty. It is nowhere because to talk openly of politics, to post a sign, to wear a T-shirt with a slogan is to invite trouble. And, of course, the most famous name in Burmese politics will not be on any ballot paper.  Nevertheless, Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi looms large still in the hearts and minds of the Burmese people, despite spending 15 of the last 20 years at the hands of the country&apos;s military rulers. Return to the site later to read our vital dispatch on the state of the nation ahead of elections that can at best be described as a sham.  9.18am: It&apos;s eighteen minutes past nine and there&apos;s a load more foreign news to cram in (John Humphrys never said that). \u2022 Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem reports that Israeli authorities have finally allowed four submachine guns into Gaza for the protection of John Ging, the head of the main UN agency in the besieged Palestinian territory. The UN requested permission to import the weapons three years ago following an assassination attempt by extreme militant groups, and it has just been granted now.

The authorities say he built it illegally but earlier this week he told the Guardian that he believed the decision was political \u2013 he has frequently annoyed officials by campaigning on sensitive issues. Ai tweeted this lunchtime that national security officers had visited him to say he could not leave his home in Beijing until midnight on Sunday \u2013 the day he had been due to hold the party. &quot;I feel there is no privacy at all in this land and am very angry,&quot; he added in a tweet following the police visit to his home. \u2022 Xan Rice, our man in Nairobi, reports on a curious development in the ongoing investigations in the post-election violence in Kenya a few years ago. Xan was on the scene at the time to report some of the worst incidences and has followed the twists and turns ever since... A senior Kenyan politician accused by local rights groups of stoking the 2007/8 post-election bloodshed has taken the highly unusual step of flying to the International Criminal Court in the Hague in a bid to clear his name. William Ruto&apos;s move highlights the deep concern among some of Kenya&apos;s ruling elite over the ongoing ICC investigation into the violence, which saw more than 1,300 people killed. Ruto is the most powerful politician in the Rift Valley province, where the worst ethnic attacks took place.  9.37am: Before we go back to bed, Steven Morris has some heartwarming breaking news from GW Hurley&apos;s toy shop in Burnham-on-Sea . . .     Steven Morris byline. Photograph: Jeff Morgan    It seemed to be Britain&apos;s most unwanted toy. For 40 years the cuddly lion stood on the stairs of the store, attracting the occasional admiring glance but no offers to buy. If this had been a children&apos;s story, Hurley&apos;s Lion as the toy was nicknamed, would, no doubt, have shed a tear when the family-run shop in Burnham-on-Sea closed every evening.But there is a happy ending. A customer finally came in prepared to stump up for the lion - at which point shopkeeper Colin Morris realised he could not bear to sell it. Morris said: &quot;When I talked to one of the ladies in the shop about it - she burst into tears. She had just become so attached to the lion over the years - we all have. So I told them I could not sell it. I have now taken it off sale - I just wouldn&apos;t let it go.&quot;  9.43am: We&apos;re on course to crash into the pips by a record 43 minutes. But that&apos;s about it, thanks for reading. I suspect the most we can claim for our substitute Today programme is that it showed how good the folks who do the real thing are.

In the City the FTSE 100 index jumped by 33 points to 5896, its highest level since June 2008.

The Fed&apos;s decision to launch a new $600bn (\u00a3370bn) stimulus package has pushed the dollar lower and driven up the price of commodities that are priced in dollars.

Copper on the London Metal Exchange jumped to $8,769.50 a tonne, the highest since July 2008. Non-farm payrolls due today The dollar steadied somewhat this morning after touching an 11-month low against a basket of currencies yesterday. On Tuesday, the Fed announced a second round of quantitative easing in which it will pump another $600bn \u2013 $75bn a month \u2013 into the economy through asset purchases by the end of June next year to get the sluggish economy back on track. Stock markets had been rallying for weeks in anticipation of the decision. By contrast, the Bank of Japan refrained from further monetary easing today, and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank held fire yesterday. US non-farm payrolls data today is expected to show that 60,000 new jobs were created in October across America, although it is unlikely to be enough to bring the near-10% jobless rate down. &quot;With the firing of census workers having ended and private demand for workers rising, payrolls should post their first increase since May, but it won&apos;t be enough to get the unemployment rate down quickly,&quot; said James Knightley at ING. David Buik at BGC Partners said: &quot;There is no quick solution to this issue. In the 60s, 70s and 80s recessions, which were unemployment driven, it took about eight months to redress the trend. Between 2000 and 2004 it took two to three years. This recession is the deepest for 80 years. It has been going 17 months and the end is not in sight. 65,000 jobs may have been created in October, but to see some light at the end of the tunnel we need to see 100,000 to 150,000 jobs being created.&quot;", "tags": ["Quantitative easing", "Stock markets", "Business", "Commodities", "Economics", "US economy", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-05T08:53:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/05/ai-weiwei-under-house-arrest", "sentences": ["Ai Weiwei \u2013 China&apos;s best-known artist and creator of Tate Modern&apos;s &quot;sunflower seeds&quot; installation \u2013 said today that he has been placed under house arrest because he planned a huge party to mark the demolition of his newly built Shanghai studio.", "I said: &apos;This is ridiculous, because I&apos;m not under house arrest and I&apos;m not going to lie to the public.&apos;&quot; Ai said he suggested they could either let the party go ahead and stop it if there was any wrongdoing, or ask the Shanghai government not to demolish the building \u2013 even if it were only a temporary stay of execution.", "It is like you use an axe to do all the housework because this is the only tool you have.&quot; The artist said the Shanghai government asked him to build the studio two years ago, hoping to create a new cultural district."], "title": "Ai Weiwei under house arrest", "article": "Ai Weiwei \u2013 China&apos;s best-known artist and creator of Tate Modern&apos;s &quot;sunflower seeds&quot; installation \u2013 said today that he has been placed under house arrest because he planned a huge party to mark the demolition of his newly built Shanghai studio.

If you don&apos;t know better, apparently, you demand to see the president&apos;s birth certificate \u2013 suddenly, every American is on border patrol \u2013 and you start claiming that there is nothing about separation of church and state in the first amendment, even though the supreme court has ruled on the point more than 25 times since 1878. Look, America is a very sad place right now, which is what the Tea Party movement and the midterm elections are about. I could analyse the particulars, but then I would be no better than the whole 24-hour media machine \u2013 which, given that unemployment is at 9.6%, is lucky that no one has noticed that they don&apos;t exactly do their job. If the news outlets were actually reporting, they would tell us the honest and awful truth: the United States is a post-industrial empire in decline, like England or Belgium or worse (is there worse?). There is no next. We are at next. And truthfully, it would not be so bad, if we could only come to terms with who we are: we are an amazing country still, but not in the way we believe. We are, in fact, kind of nerdy. We decry elitism, and yet it is precisely the high-falutin&apos; stuff that we are good at. We still have the best research universities on the planet \u2013 every world survey puts Harvard, Berkeley and Stanford at the top \u2013 and we still have companies like Apple and Google that no one else on earth can come up with. And, of course, our creative industries \u2013 movies and music \u2013 are still our biggest import, even if piracy is deflating their value. What are we not good at? Dumb stuff, the things they can do in China for cheap, the things we think we&apos;re good at, like making cars and clothes. So, here&apos;s the problem for President Obama, and now for all those shiny, happy Republicans who have just been elected: they don&apos;t need to speak truth to power; rather, they need to tell the truth to the weak. They need to tell &quot;folks&quot; that their future, maybe even their present, has been outsourced. Yes, the United States is still the great meritocracy it&apos;s always been; but now, if you aren&apos;t brilliant or beautiful or both, there isn&apos;t much to do, because they can do it cheaper in Shanghai or Mumbai. The Tea Party people should enjoy their rallies, because the rest of it is, indeed, quite bleak. For the first time in American history, then, social mobility has been replaced with class struggle.\u00a0Europeans have always been mystified that poor people in this country don&apos;t rise up and throw potatoes at Donald Trump \u2013 instead, they make him a reality TV star. But that&apos;s because everyone here us sure they are going to be rich like him someday, too. Maybe tomorrow. The American Dream, coupled with government subsidies of utilities and cheap consumer goods courtesy of slave labour somewhere else, has kept the poor huddled masses from rising up. But no more. They know better now. They are, so to speak, &quot;tea-ed off&quot;. To make matters worse, the current president, who is one of those beautiful and brilliant elite people that the world has not left behind, happens to be black. Ouch! This has got to really hurt. And so, all of a sudden, he&apos;s a socialist. The funny thing is, in the United States, there&apos;s really no such thing as socialism \u2013 instead, there are people here who will tell you, without embarrassment, that The Fountainhead is their favourite book ever. They don&apos;t think that it&apos;s pulp or that Ayn Rand is a nasty lady \u2013 they really think it&apos;s a good book, up there with Middlemarch and Moby Dick. Howard Roark is a hero and Objectivism is considered a form of human kindness. So, we just don&apos;t know socialism here. It&apos;s an absurd accusation. As for anything being a violation of the constitution: the reason that document has survived over 230 years, while others belonging to other republics are replaced as often as one changes the oil in a car, is that its provisions are vague. The &quot;necessary and proper clause&quot; allows Congress to pass any legislation it deems necessary and proper. Kind of hard to define the contours of that one, right?

There&apos;s a reason this society is so litigious and lawyers are so busy \u2013 it&apos;s because Sarah Palin can&apos;t be trusted to interpret the bill of rights for us. So,\u00a0you\u00a0see,\u00a0all\u00a0this\u00a0anger is misplaced. No point changing who is in Congress or who is in the Oval Office. Doesn&apos;t matter. Just moving deck chairs on the Titanic.

While a tense Webber was revealing the internal divisions that have hampered the Red Bull team&apos;s ability to capitalise on their performance advantage, Alonso was telling a journalist that his only recent outburst of high emotion came on Wednesday night, when he watched the referee at San Siro failing to notice that Milan&apos;s Filippo Inzaghi had scored against the Spaniard&apos;s beloved Real Madrid from an offside position. Beneath Alonso&apos;s display of equanimity, however, lies a nagging anxiety. For more than six decades the heart of every Ferrari has been its engine \u2013 the only bit of the car that the company&apos;s founder, old Enzo Ferrari, really cared about. And Alonso&apos;s fate this weekend may be decided by the success of a critical transplant operation. Alonso will recapture the title on Sunday if he finishes the Brazilian grand prix having extended the gap to 25 points or more over his nearest pursuer, enabling him to go to the final race of the season, in Abu Dhabi tomorrow week, already assured of the championship. But he has already made use of every one of the eight engines permitted to each competitor during the course of a year. In the last minute of the first practice session today Alonso coasted to a silent halt on a grass verge around the back of the circuit when his engine died. Ferrari had already announced that a change of power plant would be made between the morning and afternoon sessions but the failure did nothing to silence speculation that the limited number of effective engines available to Alonso may form the most serious threat to his late run for the championship, in which he has won three of the last four grands prix. The maximum useful life of a Formula One engine is about 2,000km but power losses start to occur after the distance of a single race \u2013 just over 300km. In the old free-spending days Ferrari&apos;s mechanics would have fitted a brand-new unit for every race and every qualifying session but now the engineers are having to shuffle through their restricted stock of power plants in order to find those that suffered the least amount of wear earlier in the season. &quot;Engines are OK for us so far,&quot; Alonso said after arriving here this week. But it was as early as the fourth race of the season, in Shanghai, that Ferrari adopted a new strategy after he suffered a failure for the second meeting in a row. &quot;We had some difficulties early in the year,&quot; Chris Dyer, the team&apos;s Australian chief track engineer, said today, &quot;and after China we sat down and made a plan for how we would manage the rest of the year. Since then things have gone absolutely to that plan.&quot; To run out of effective engines altogether would mean bringing in a ninth engine and incurring a 10-place grid penalty. &quot;Everybody plays the game of juggling the eight engines,&quot; Dyer said, &quot;making decisions about where it&apos;s sensible to use the fresh engines, based on the circuit characteristics.&quot; Luckily for Alonso, Interlagos and Abu Dhabi&apos;s Yas Marina are not circuits that make ultimate demands on sheer horsepower. &quot;They&apos;re not the easiest on the engines,&quot; Dyer said, &quot;but they&apos;re not the hardest either.&quot; In eight appearances at this demanding circuit in a suburb of S\u00e3o Paulo Alonso has compiled two second places and three thirds but no wins. Yesterday he partially deflected suggestions that a third championship would be sullied by the extra seven points gained when Felipe Massa was ordered to hand him a controversial victory at Hockenheim in July by expressing the hope that his Brazilian team-mate \u2013 victorious at his home circuit in 2006 and 2008 \u2013 would win both this season&apos;s remaining races. &quot;Felipe is normally very strong here,&quot; he said. &quot;And the best thing for us, and even for me in championship numbers, would be to have him winning the race.&quot; A win for Massa would deprive Alonso&apos;s rivals of the chance to score a maximum 25 points, significantly reducing their chances of closing the gap to the Ferrari leader. After various kinds of failure \u2013 including his own errors \u2013 blighted the promise of an opening win in Bahrain Alonso has watched the team pull themselves together for the second half of the season. &quot;The last four or five races were very important for us,&quot; he said. &quot;One retirement could have been our bye-bye to the championship. But everything went well because we kept our concentration, with no mistakes, and that&apos;s the way we&apos;ve got to continue.&quot; Two factors, he said, prompted the uplift in his fortunes. &quot;First, the performance of the car improved a lot. In the last two or three months we brought some updates to the car that really worked. Second there was luck, which maybe was not on our side in the middle part of the championship. Remember Monaco, where I crashed on Saturday morning at 60kph? If I crashed like that 100 times, 99 times I&apos;d go through to qualifying with no problems. It&apos;s not normal to break the chassis at that speed. But now the consistency is good, the car&apos;s performance is good and we&apos;ve been lucky \u2013 like in South Korea, where Webber retired and Sebastian [Vettel] as well. &quot;Now it&apos;s very exciting. It&apos;s like starting from zero. Whichever of the three or four contenders does the best job in the last two races will win the championship.&quot; For Dyer, who is in his 10th season with Ferrari, the battle is reminiscent of 2007, when he was Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s race engineer as the Finn made a late run to snatch the title from Lewis Hamilton. &quot;If anything this year is a little more difficult because in 2007 our car was as fast as anything out there,&quot; he said. &quot;This year we&apos;ve had to work a little bit harder. We&apos;re still not in a position where we have the fastest car but we&apos;ve closed the gap to the point where we&apos;ve put a lot of pressure on the other people.&quot; Alonso, who finished third in today&apos;s second session, behind the two Red Bulls, calmly acknowledges that Webber and Vettel have the benefit of faster machinery. &quot;We know they are the favourite on any circuit,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;ve been very dominant and we expect very strong competition with them \u2013 and with McLaren as well. On a bad weekend you can find yourself fifth or sixth very easily. But our approach will not change. Consistency will be the priority and getting on the podium will be our goal. Whether it&apos;s good enough to win the championship, we&apos;ll see in Abu Dhabi.&quot; Or perhaps, if Ferrari can squeeze the last ounce of speed and reliability out of one of those remaining engines, and Alonso&apos;s luck holds, even on Sunday.", "tags": ["Formula One", "Fernando Alonso", "Ferrari", "Mark Webber", "Red Bull", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-05T22:01:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/nov/06/lee-westwood-francesco-molinari-hsbc", "sentences": ["Going into tomorrow&apos;s final round of the HSBC Champions in Shanghai he was one shot behind the leader, his Ryder Cup team-mate Francesco Molinari, and looks set to hang on to top spot in the rankings despite the presence in a strong field of three players \u2013 Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Martin Kaymer \u2013 who could all have overtaken him just seven days after he reached the summit.", "The Korean is one of three players in Shanghai who are yet to celebrate their 20th birthday \u2013 the Italian Matteo Manassero and Ryo Ishikawa of Japan are the others \u2013 but it is Park who is having the best week of the prodigies."], "title": "Lee Westwood stays on Francesco Molinari's tail at HSBC Champions", "article": "Lee Westwood has made a solid start to life as the world&apos;s No1 golfer. Going into tomorrow&apos;s final round of the HSBC Champions in Shanghai he was one shot behind the leader, his Ryder Cup team-mate Francesco Molinari, and looks set to hang on to top spot in the rankings despite the presence in a strong field of three players \u2013 Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Martin Kaymer \u2013 who could all have overtaken him just seven days after he reached the summit. Westwood knows that overhauling Molinari in the final World Golf Championships event of the year will be tricky, particularly after the Italian eagled the 18th hole today by pitching in from 150 yards at the par four, but is confident that his game is in good shape despite a recent lay-off for a leg injury. &quot;I&apos;m gradually shaking the rust off. Today felt a lot more like normal and my leg feels as good as it&apos;s felt all week,&quot; Westwood said. &quot;We&apos;ve both played very well. Francesco&apos;s a good player and will be tough to hunt down but I&apos;m in a decent position and I&apos;ll go out with the same attitude of the first three days. &quot;But you don&apos;t discount anybody coming from behind, because I know what it&apos;s like. Three years ago, I was 10 behind with 10 holes to play and I got in a play\u2011off.&quot; There is obvious strength at the top of the leaderboard, but only eight shots back going into tomorrow morning&apos;s final round is the teenager Noh Seung-yul. The Korean is one of three players in Shanghai who are yet to celebrate their 20th birthday \u2013 the Italian Matteo Manassero and Ryo Ishikawa of Japan are the others \u2013 but it is Park who is having the best week of the prodigies. Like Severiano Ballesteros before him, he hit his first golf shots on a beach near his home. &quot;During the summer I would hit balls on the beach from 4.30 to 6.30 in the morning before going to school and, when classes were over, I would rush home to the range,&quot; Noh said. The 19-year-old turned professional two years ago, managed three runner-up spots in his first five starts and now has two wins, including one in the Malaysian Open this year, which made him the second youngest winner in European Tour history. Like the much-heralded Manassero and Ishikawa, Noh has a great temperament, something he attributes to his coach who advised him to block everything else out when performing under pressure. &quot;It was to be just me and the golf ball,&quot; said Noh. &quot;I adopted this approach and it has become second nature to me.&quot; Noh&apos;s stated aim is to compete on the PGA Tour in America like his hero and fellow countryman KJ Choi, who has blazed a trail for Korean men when it has traditionally been the women who have grabbed the big prizes in the professional ranks. Noh may be a long shot to get in front of Westwood tomorrow, but he will be a much shorter price to overhaul Worksop&apos;s finest in the world rankings in the years\u00a0to come.", "tags": ["Lee Westwood", "Golf", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-06T13:49:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/07/david-cameron-china-climate-change", "sentences": ["Artist Ai Weiwei, who helped to design the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium for the 2008 Olympics, has been placed under house arrest after planning a party at his Shanghai studio to draw attention to government efforts to demolish the building."], "title": "David Cameron letting China off climate change hook, says Labour", "article": "David Cameron was accused last night of sending the wrong signals on climate change to China, the world&apos;s biggest polluter, as he prepared to lead the largest-ever official UK delegation to the country. He will be accompanied by George Osborne, the chancellor, business secretary Vince Cable, the climate and energy secretary, Chris Huhne, and Michael Gove, the education minister, as well as more than 50 business leaders on the two-day visit starting on Tuesday. Efforts to boost bilateral trade, and concerns over human rights, are expected to head the agenda in talks with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. China is the UK&apos;s second-biggest trade partner after the EU. But last night Labour claimed that carefully constructed efforts to bind the Chinese into international efforts to invest in low-carbon technology and improve energy security were being undermined by government cuts. Shadow foreign secretary Yvette Cooper said William Hague, the foreign secretary, was giving the wrong message by slashing a \u00a314.4m fund set up in 2008 to provide expertise to China and other countries on low-carbon technology and to help them to move away from coal-based technology. Funding was cut by \u00a33m in the summer for the Low Carbon High Growth Fund and it is believed to be under further threat after the spending review. Hague has said he would examine other ways to finance the fund. Cooper said there was now a danger of international momentum being lost ahead of the UN climate change summit in Canc\u00fan starting later this month. The biggest success of the FCO fund was the designation of Jilin City in the north-east of China as the first pilot for a &quot;low carbon zone&quot;. &quot;Putting less emphasis on climate change in foreign policy is a big strategic mistake. We won&apos;t ever solve climate change in one country; it has to be a global effort, &quot; Cooper said. The visit will see Cameron having to walk diplomatic tightropes on several issues. His judgment on foreign affairs was called into question before the general election when he appeared to lump China together with Iran in a television debate, saying Britain should retain its independent nuclear deterrent because &quot;we don&apos;t know what is going to happen with Iran [and] we can&apos;t be certain of the future in China&quot;. Chinese officials will not want Cameron to raise human rights; but they are realistic, and know he will do so. He is expected to discuss the case of Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel peace prize winner serving 11 years for co-authoring a call for democratic reforms. A tough public condemnation of Liu&apos;s imprisonment, especially if delivered alongside a Chinese minister, would enrage Beijing. Since Liu was awarded the prize for his non-violent calls for political reform, the Chinese authorities have put scores of political dissidents and human rights activists in jail or under house arrest. Artist Ai Weiwei, who helped to design the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium for the 2008 Olympics, has been placed under house arrest after planning a party at his Shanghai studio to draw attention to government efforts to demolish the building. The party became a focus of attention for dissidents across the country. A Downing Street spokesman refused to say which cases the prime minister would want to discuss. Sir George Young, the leader of the Commons, told MPs last week: &quot;The prime minister will raise the serious issue about the human rights record of China. That issue will not go by default.&quot; A survey by the British Chamber of Commerce in China to coincide with the visit shows businesses broadly confident of increasing trade with the country \u2013 36% of respondents expect demand for their products and services to increase significantly while 44% expect a more modest increase. And 25% of respondents saw their performance in China as in line with that in other markets, while 30% saw it as above average and 21% as significantly above average.", "tags": ["Climate change", "David Cameron", "China", "UK news", "World news", "Environment", "Politics", "Green politics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-07T00:08:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/nov/07/xi-jinping-china-david-cameron", "sentences": ["In 2007, he was catapulted to the mega-city of Shanghai after the party secretary there was ousted in a major political-corruption scandal."], "title": "Xi Jinping: The man who'll lead China into a new age | Jonathan Fenby", "article": "Those foolhardy enough to forecast who will occupy 10 Downing Street or the White House in 10 years&apos; time would risk being told they needed their heads examining. China is different. Barring a major reversal of fortune, the future leadership of the last major state ruled by a Communist party is set until 2022. The man who will head the ruling group in the Zhongnanhai leadership compound, beside the Forbidden City, for 10 years from 2012 is a stockily built, 57-year-old apparatchik who comes from a group of senior figures in their 50s known as the &quot;princelings&quot; whose fathers pioneered the People&apos;s Republic. Married to a popular singer, Xi Jinping has emerged stage by stage since 2007 as the heir apparent when the incumbent, Hu Jintao, ends his 10-year term in 2012. Xi&apos;s rise to the top was apparently sealed last month when a Communist party central committee plenum appointed him vice-chair of the military affairs committee which oversees China&apos;s forces. David Cameron would do well to shake his hand, at least, when he visits Beijing this week. The appointment means that Xi is perfectly placed to take on the top three jobs of secretary of the Communist party, state president and civilian head of the military. Like Hu, he will often be referred to outside China as &quot;President Xi&quot;. But the Communist party post is much more important: China is still a Leninist state in which the party rules over the government. He has a reputation as a conciliator, a man who gets on with those around him. Chubby-faced, he smiles more often in public than the grave Hu and there are reports of a periodic twinkle of amusement in his eye. For the most part, photographs are confined to official appearances in a dark business suit with his thick, black hair perfectly parted, but one &quot;man of the people&quot; shot shows him in shirt sleeves kicking a football into the air. For many years, his wife, Peng Liyuan, a celebrated folk singer, was better known than him. They have four children and a rare informal photograph showed them standing smiling by a rock pool in a traditional Chinese garden. Since her husband rose to the top, Peng Liyuan has stopped performing, observing the convention that the wives of Chinese leaders stay in the background in keeping with the predominantly male composition of the leadership. Xi&apos;s appointment to the military commission last month completed a process begun at the last party congresses in 2007 which elected him to the supreme decision-making body, the standing committee of the politburo. He came in one place ahead of the man regarded as Hu Jintao&apos;s chosen successor, Li Keqiang. Xi was then appointed vice-president while Li became senior vice-premier \u2013 and therefore the putative prime minister in the leadership changes due in 2012-13. It was all very neat as the elite sought to avoid one of the pitfalls of one-party states, the succession issue that can lead to running warfare between rival contenders as happened after the death of Mao Zedong. But we have little idea of how Xi was chosen. It appears that he was the most broadly acceptable member of the new fifth generation of Chinese leaders, not just to the present standing committee but to big business, entrenched interest groups and the former party chief, Jiang Zemin. This would be a perpetuation of the consensus style of leadership which has evolved under Hu, in contrast to the individualistic rule of Mao and Deng Xiaoping. The man who will sit at the top of the power structure ruling 1.3 billion people in the world&apos;s second biggest economy was born in June, 1953, a native of Shaanxi province, a poor region of north-western China. His father, Xi Zhongxun, a long-time Communist, was deputy prime minister from 1959 to 1962 but fell foul of the Cultural Revolution started by Mao Zedong in 1966. His son was &quot;sent down&quot; to the countryside for his father&apos;s alleged sins. The young man was also refused membership of the party while China went through 10 years of turmoil at the hands of Mao, the Red Guards and the Gang of Four. However, the family fortunes perked up when Deng Xiaoping won the power struggle set off by Mao&apos;s death in 1976. Xi Zhongxun was appointed governor of Guangdong province in southern China which spearheaded the market-led economic policies launched by Deng at the end of 1978. Xi implemented the first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Shenzhen, which grew from a fishing village across the border from Hong Kong into a manufacturing hub housing millions of migrant workers. Among his proteges was Hu Jintao. In old age, the party veteran showed his independence of mind by arguing for wider reform and criticising the repression of the protests in 1989 that culminated in the bloodbath on Beijing on 4 June. This free speaking did not stop his son&apos;s rise. After finally gaining party membership in 1974, Xi Jinping studied at a top Beijing university, where he graduated from the school of humanities and social sciences, majoring in Marxist theory and ideological education. After doing a course in chemical engineering, he went to work in the general office of the state council \u2013 the equivalent of the government \u2013 and the central military commission. He worked his way up the party ranks in central China and went on to a succession of more senior jobs in Fujian province on the east coast. From there, he transferred to the neighbouring province of Zhenjiang, a hive of private manufacturing enterprises, where he worked with business and gained a reputation for fighting corruption. In 2007, he was catapulted to the mega-city of Shanghai after the party secretary there was ousted in a major political-corruption scandal. Xi&apos;s feet hardly had time to touch the ground before he was elevated to the politburo standing committee in 2007 and moved to Beijing. He was given political responsibility for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and for supervising Hong Kong as well as being entrusted with the politically important job of president of the party school, the highest institution training officials of the Communist party. As president-in-waiting, he has visited Australia, Germany, Japan and the Americas. According to people who met him on these trips, he was polished, interested in what he was shown and generally affable. However, in Mexico last year, he lashed out at &quot;a few foreigners, with full bellies, who have nothing better to do than try to point fingers at our country\u2026 China does not export revolution, hunger or poverty; nor does China cause you any headaches. What else do you want?&quot; That kind of sentiment chimes with the widespread pride felt in China at the economic record of the last three decades and the way the government&apos;s \u00a31.2 trillion rescue package has restored growth to 10%. But the new fifth generation of leaders will still have to grapple with huge remaining problems such as the need to find a more sustainable economic growth model, the growing wealth disparities, huge ecological devastation, corruption \u2013 and the fundamental political question of whether the Communist party can maintain its iron grip on power or whether political and legal reform is required if China is to live up to its potential. Little is known of how Xi would deal with such issues. He and the other &quot;princelings&quot; are generally linked to the coastal high-growth regions and have connections with big business. In western terms, they might be expected to sympathise with calls for political and legal reform, but there is no evidence of this. Indeed, contrary to the belief that economic liberalisation would lead to political liberalisation, a desire to preserve the privileges they have gained from growth may incline the elite and the middle class towards self-defensive conservativism. If Xi is a spokesperson for this group, he has shown no sign of being ready to loosen the reins. Last year, he took charge of a party department that clamped down on any putative signs of dissent, including websites. In May, he told officials and students they should study party theory and avoid &quot;empty words&quot; since &quot;unhealthy&quot; writing could harm efficiency. If his succession in 2012 does not appear in doubt, what nobody knows is how Xi will use his power. It may be that China&apos;s consensual leadership means it does not make a lot of difference who sits at the top of the party. The era of Mao and Deng is long gone.

It is understood that the prime minister plans to raise the case of Nobel peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo, serving an 11-year sentence for co-writing a call for democratic reforms. Four weeks ago, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights activism, a decision that incensed the Chinese government, which regards him as a criminal. While it is very rare for people to disappear in China, there has been international concern over human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, who has not been seen for months. Ai, creator of the &quot;sunflower seeds&quot; installation currently in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern , was himself due to be released from house arrest at midnight last night. Police restricted his movements last week after thousands of people accepted his invitation to a party at his condemned studio in Shanghai. In his first official visit to China, Cameron will hold a summit tomorrow with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao and President Hu Jintao, at which he is expected to focus on improving trade, but will also mention human rights issues. The five-day tour of the far east and it will culminate in a potentially tense showdown at the G20 summit in Korea. The scale of the visit beats Cameron&apos;s trip to India, an event that led to Downing Street feeling pressurised by the Chinese to field an equivalent size or larger delegation. Cameron will be accompanied by the chancellor, George Osborne, education secretary Michael Gove, the business secretary Vince Cable and the energy secretary Chris Huhne. Fifty business leaders, from companies ranging from Tesco to Rolls Royce will accompany Cameron, and also attend a China-UK Business summit with Chinese leaders. This makes it even bigger than the business delegation who went to India. William Hague, the foreign secretary, told the cabinet on Tuesday that China was expected to build 86 airports in the next five years, a small indication of growth and the business opportunities available.In a sign of what a bilateral deal is worth, Hu signed contracts worth \u00a38.6bn with the French during a state visit last week, covering 102 Airbus planes, as well a the telecoms and nuclear sectors. British officials point out that China is still a controlled economy and even in the case of private sector investment the umbrella of state officials are needed to get the go ahead to invest. The Chinese have warned the British not to raise human rights issues, but neither side intends to let the issue dominate what is supposed to be a visit focused on raising exports. Cameron may come under pressure from the Chinese to condemn the US Federal&apos;s reserve decision last Wednesday to buy $600bn worth of government bonds, in the hope that the cash injection can kickstart the US economy. The move weakens the dollar, making imports from China, a major trading partner, more expensive for US consumers. &quot;If the domestic policy is optimal policy for the United States alone, but at the same time it is not an optimal policy for the world, it may bring a lot of negative impact to the world,&quot; said China&apos;s Central Bank head Zhou Xiaochuan. Cui Tiankai, China&apos;s vice foreign minister, said the Federal Reserve had the right to take steps without consulting other countries beforehand, but added: &quot;They owe us some explanation.&quot;China has been under pressure to appreciate its currency against the dollar in order to let in more imports. British officials are playing down any great breakthrough on the issue of currency wars between China and the US at the G20 summit to be held in Korea on Thursday and Friday. &quot;It is more a case of managing the process&quot;, said one official. The officials also said the G20 was moving away from big dollar announcements designed to help the world&apos;s poor. The Koreans have been urging the G20 to look at an alternative approach based on approaches such as trade, investment and studying how other emerging economies - such as their own \u2013 have grown rapidly. The same officials, determined to lower expectations, also said they saw no prospect of a breakthrough over climate change saying the issue has been deferred to Cancun conference in a month&apos;s time. Chris Huhne is due to sign a number of bilateral deals on renewable energy technologies with China, the country most likely to add to global pollution as its industrialisation grows apace. Some blame China for the failure to agree a legally binding deal at Copenhagen. . In probably his main G20 initiative, Cameron is likely to press the case for a new world trade deal, arguing the room for manouvre around fiscal and monetary policy is becoming increasingly limited leaving trade as the best way to boost world demand. With Obama facing Presidential elections in two years, British officials see the next 12 months as the critical window of opportunity to secure a trade breathrough.

After a decade of struggle in the unforgiving world of Formula One, he finally captured the world championship last year. Yesterday he lost it, and his inability to defend his crown perhaps says something about the nation&apos;s attitude to winning. He certainly enjoyed his year as the reigning champion. Success had lifted the twin burdens of his own expectations and other people&apos;s scepticism from his shoulders, and as the season progressed he showed the same cheerful, relaxed, congenial countenance through fair weather and foul. But although he won two of the early rounds of the 2010 series with polished drives in Melbourne and Shanghai, and stayed in statistical contention for the title until yesterday afternoon in S\u00e3o Paulo, his genuine chance of winning back-to-back championships had evaporated long before the season approached its climax. He thinks he will be in a better position next year, having spent a season acclimatising himself to a new team. History, however, is against him. England has produced more than twice as many Formula One world champions \u2013 eight \u2013 as any other nation: next come Brazil and Finland with three, followed by Italy, Germany, Scotland, Austria and the USA (two), and lone representatives of Argentina, New Zealand, South Africa, France, Canada and Spain. Only one of those Englishmen, however, has managed to win two titles, a remarkable figure when you think that ever since Fangio won five championships in the early days, multiple victories have been a feature of Formula One. Michael Schumacher won seven, Alain Prost four, Jack Brabham, Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna three, Jim Clark, Mika Hakkinen and Fernando Alonso two. Graham Hill was the English exception, although it could be said that the second of his two titles, in 1968, came as a result of the death of Clark, his Scottish team-mate, early that season. Otherwise there have been single titles for Mike Hawthorn, John Surtees, James Hunt, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill, Lewis Hamilton and Button. Like Button, Hamilton would argue that he is on his way to joining the ranks of multiple winners, and in his case you would not bet against the proposition. But something seems to happen to the English when they have won the biggest prize of all, and not just in motor racing: they enjoy the experience too much, and then suffer a kind of prolonged sporting detumescence. The once-is-enough phenomenon is most noticeable in team games. There was the success of the 1966 World Cup, followed by a collapse to a not noticeably superior German team four years later and seemingly endless decades of disappointment. After the 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph came the bizarre progress to defeat in the 2007 final, and the subsequent fumbling by administrators and players alike. The 2005 Ashes triumph preceded the terrible hangover of a whitewash in the return series 18 months later. But individuals, including coaches, also suffer from the inability to prolong success. When Bradley Wiggins finished a fine fourth in the 2009 Tour de France, he was spoken of as a favourite for this year&apos;s race. He finished 24th. The admirable Lee Westwood recently dethroned Tiger Woods as the world&apos;s No 1 golfer but will he ever win the sequence of majors that would permit him to join the ranks of the greats? And would any other country have failed so conspicuously to make further serious use of the organisational talents of Clive Woodward, the architect of the triumph in Sydney in 2003? There are exceptions, of course, and perhaps they include Tom Daley, Jessica Ennis, Mark Cavendish (if a Manxman can be called English) and Rebecca Adlington. Maybe England&apos;s priorities are elsewhere. Drink the champagne, enjoy the parade to Trafalgar Square, pick up the MBE, and the future will take care of itself. All champions suffer as they climb towards the summit, even those who make it look effortless. The difference between the very good and the all-time great lies in what happens next. Why Ronaldo kept his shirt on in the heat of the night Spectators leaving Interlagos by the main gate yesterday evening could pause at a nearby outdoor caf\u00e9 and sip a caipirinha while watching a big screen on which the familiar figures of Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos were helping Corinthians to take the lead in the Brazilian championship with a 2-0 away win over S\u00e3o Paulo in the derby between the city&apos;s two big clubs. At 34, Ronaldo now boasts a girth so formidable that he was the only player not to remove his shirt at the end of a hot evening, having lasted the full 90 minutes after doing most of his work on the pitch from static positions. Roberto Carlos, three years older, looked just as fit as he did in the colours of Internazionale, Real Madrid and Brazil, although his overlapping sprints are no longer rocket-assisted and the ferocious menace has gone from his long-range free kicks. Presumably neither of them needs the money, and they certainly seemed to be enjoying themselves in what may be the last season for both. Corinthians&apos; second goal was scored by one Dentinho, a forward whose name is presumably inspired by the notable gap between his front teeth, a currently fashionable feature also to be seen on the likes of Vanessa Paradis, Lara Stone and Georgia Jagger. Smith takes the high road Bradley Smith, the 19-year-old Oxfordshire motorbike racer whose career has been followed by this column, won the 125cc Grand Prix of Valencia yesterday, a terrific way to finish his apprenticeship in the small-capacity category.

Except it&apos;s difficult to know what African, or western, means any more. A few minutes after I started\u00a0talking to the kora player, we realised we had both worked with the Berlin Philharmonic. And that was kind\u00a0of perfect. The world really was\u00a0connected.&quot; Sellars&apos;s work has always been linked to hot contemporary issues, whether he is updating Mozart into the Harlem drug economy, or creating new works about Richard Nixon, or Palestinian hijackings, with his long-term collaborator, John Adams. Currently preoccupied with issues of globalisation and international interconnectedness, he explodes with delight at the fact you can now, &quot;on a whim, fly to Shanghai and stay at the Hyatt&quot;. Contrast this to his first visit in the early 1980s when working with Adams on Nixon in China: back then, such a trip was &quot;a very, very big deal&quot;. Now aged 53, Sellars&apos;s trademark rapid-fire intensity and enthusiasm remains intact from his days as a wunderkind, as do the lurid shirts, the beads, that distinctive haircut and the hugs for anyone who comes within his orbit. His scattergun fluency is still punctuated by almost comically exaggerated displays of admiration or indignation: &quot;Puh-leeze!&quot; And there is plenty of indignation. Born in Pittsburgh, he was brought up a Christian Scientist, and has maintained a lifelong engagement not only with the Bible but the Qur&apos;an, as well as Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu texts \u2013 and his work has always been underpinned by a strong morality. He animatedly details the horrific economics of 21st-century slavery and talks about a project with the Slow Food movement in Italy that will reflect the plight of farmers worldwide. &quot;Not only chemical farming and GM food,&quot; he elaborates. &quot;Our interference \u2013 via the IMF and the World Bank \u2013 means that farming is virtually economically impossible anywhere right now. It is difficult to grow rice in Indonesia, for goodness sake. There&apos;s a huge suicide rate among farmers from India to Iowa. Something has gone very wrong. And that&apos;s why immigration is such a big deal. People simply can&apos;t stay where they are. We have made large parts of the world unliveable.&quot; Kafka&apos;s irradiated tightrope These issues, and others, inform his staging of Kafka Fragments, Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g&apos;s song cycle for soprano and violin, which receives its European premiere at the Barbican this week. The Hungarian composer&apos;s 1987 work comprises 40 short musical responses, ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes in length, to extracts from Kafka&apos;s letters, diaries and notebooks. &quot;The usual stuff,&quot; he guffaws. &quot;Kafkaesque crisis, intense self-loathing. But since I was a kid starting out, I&apos;ve tried to do work based on subject matter that is meaningful to people.&quot; The work follows his 2003 production of Antonin Artaud&apos;s For an End to the Judgement of God, staged as a Pentagon press conference about the Afghan war, in the Turbine Hall at London&apos;s Tate Modern. &quot;It looked very plausible,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;And if Artaud looks plausible, you know you are dealing with something fairly extreme. This piece is a companion, in that it features an American housewife watching that war on television.&quot; Soprano Dawn Upshaw, the housewife, will be accompanied by violinist Geoff Nuttall for the song cycle, which also includes images of mentally ill and homeless people, taken by David Michalek. &quot;I wanted to get at what comes home from large-scale and catastrophic expenditures. In the second world war, everyone knew there was a war on. Now, it is just part of the general hum and buzz. What&apos;s wonderful about Kafka is that he shows you ordinary life, but of course it&apos;s not ordinary at all. It is irradiated with everything you are not acknowledging. The insistence on ignoring that you are shaped like a cockroach. So when the appalling and outrageous and unthinkable is normal, it&apos;s time to look at what normal is,&quot; Sellars has Upshaw doing a day&apos;s housework: laundry, floor, dishes. &quot;It is no coincidence that Kafka is obsessed with cleanliness, this need to cleanse yourself because you feel tainted. That&apos;s how most of us feel today. How can we clean our spotted souls and how do you wash hands that are this dirty? And this is what classical music can deal with. Life of the soul stuff, where the political meets your own personal integrity.&quot; He describes Kurt\u00e1g&apos;s music as &quot;sort of anti-Wagner&quot;, in that instead of stretching across hours of orchestral grandeur, &quot;these stripped-down pieces can last 23 seconds, but in that time Kurt\u00e1g has 50 ideas. So the music moves at the speed of thought. It is only a violin and a soprano, but it is so dense and intricate to perform that daily life becomes a tightrope act.&quot; Hanging from a truck axle For him, classical music gains its power from its subject matter, not its style. &quot;Style is a fake issue brought to the fore by people who are trying to avoid content.&quot; He mentions, by way of example, timing indicators. &quot;Beethoven&apos;s metronome marks are not the main issue. Puh-leeze! This is a guy writing music when Napoleon is bombarding Vienna. This music is dealing with what that experience is. That is what classical music is about: these very powerful, in-the-line-of-fire experiences, which are eternal because there are plenty of places where people are in the line of fire today.&quot; Sellars&apos;s apparently evangelical levels of certainty about the theatre and the world have sometimes seen him castigated as too self-satisfied and his work as too glib. But it is worth remembering how innovative his 1980s updated Mozart\u2013Da Ponte series was; that his trilogy with Adams (Nixon in China, The Death of Kling- hoffer and Dr Atomic) has entered the mainstream repertoire; and that other productions, such as his 1996 contemporary totalitarian US setting of Handel&apos;s Theodora are widely regarded as classics. &quot;When we were making those early pieces, such as Nixon in China, it was the first time for a very long time that opera had been completely contemporary. Verdi, Mozart and Monteverdi were also about their moment, so it shouldn&apos;t have been a big deal. But it was. Now when you see an opera in modern dress, it is a cliche, but in the 80s and early 90s I was trying to make the specific case that opera was not the books you loved at college. It was not nostalgic or retrospective.&quot; Although he made his name with full-scale opera house productions, he now often works on a smaller scale. His most recent UK productions have been a staged clarinet concerto and a collaboration with video artist Bill Viola on an acclaimed version of Tristan und Isolde. What is the appeal of doing the Kurt\u00e1g as a smaller scale staged concert? &quot;This is all about getting to the core of something, the essence. The staged concert doesn&apos;t have a whole lot of stuff hanging around \u2013 it involves just a few elements that can be charged with meaning. &quot; The core concern here is a world where, because of war or famine, people are forced increasingly to move. &quot;People are willing to hang onto the axles of trucks to get from Kabul to London. In a previous era, it was recognised that refugees were a sign. You&apos;re meant to actually read the sign and respond. Not only should you welcome them on a humanitarian level, you should engage with their issues \u2013 because they are telling you about something going on that, if it continues, then no one will be safe.&quot; Sellars admits his stagings have often been characterised by &quot;whatever crazy or goofy thing is going on&quot;, but 30-odd years after he began his professional career, his focus has changed. &quot;Most of my stage work is actually invisible. The surface is just the surface, but what we&apos;re all really interested in is everything that is not the surface. It&apos;s just a woman doing the ironing, but because it is Kurt\u00e1g, and because it is Kafka, it is charged with a kind of spiritual energy and this woman equals all the kings and queens and armies in the world. So my work doesn&apos;t look much like it did 20 years ago. Things I did then are now done a lot by other people, so I don&apos;t need to do them myself. I don&apos;t have to make the case that opera is contemporary. I&apos;m free to fry other fish.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 2010.

As David Cameron tours the People&apos;s Republic over the next couple of days, planeloads of correspondents will solemnly intone that it&apos;s the new superpower on the block; the national success story of our times; soon to overtake even America as the world&apos;s biggest economy. When you hear these lines trotted out, I want you to do me a favour. I want you to think of a public toilet. Not just any public toilet, mind, but the world&apos;s biggest. It opened in the midwestern city of Chongqing a couple of years ago and boasts 1,000 stalls over four floors, all set in a porcelain palace with a giant replica sphinx on top. Many of the urinals are shaped like crocodile mouths; others resemble the Virgin Mary. And throughout there is piped music and rolling TV news. The authorities have even laid on what they describe as &quot;toilets for lovers&quot; (no, me neither). All entertaining enough. But the Giant Convenience of Chongqing also tells you something: in a major industrial metropolis (with four times the population of London) in the heart of what is apparently the world&apos;s next superpower, free public sanitation is so scarce that its provision is turned into a huge event. And that is part of a bigger picture in which \u2013 whatever Cameron and his entourage say \u2013 China is a lot poorer than is usually acknowledged and far less powerful, too. Of course, I know the statistics that say otherwise: an economy growing at 9% a year and a hoard of around $2.7tn in foreign currency. The world&apos;s second-largest economy, from virtually nowhere 30 years ago. Astonishing, of course \u2013 but China also has the world&apos;s biggest population. Split its national income per head and adjust for how much that will buy a Chinese person in their country and it amounts to just $6,240, an eighth of the American figure. Per person, the Dragon economy is about as prosperous as Namibia. Those numbers sit at odds with all those fashionable books bearing overblown titles such as When China Rules the World. But then so, too, do the events of the last couple of years. Cast your mind back to 2008, when food prices shot up and it was all apparently the fault of newly affluent China and India, with their desire for (gasp!) meat. Except then came a World Bank study that found three-quarters of the rise in food prices was down to George Bush&apos;s push for biofuels \u2013 in other words to burn crops for fuel. Far from being the drivers of higher food prices, India and China were innocent bystanders. And while wonks and commentators often talk of the global financial crisis as a catalyst in the decline of the west, viewed another way it actually confirms the supreme importance of the American economy. After all, it will be a long time, I suspect, before G20 leaders are having critical summits because of a sub-prime property crisis in Shanghai. Ironically, it&apos;s the same things that are usually greeted as signs of Chinese strength that should be interpreted as signals of weakness. Every time Beijing puts in a bid for an American computer company or a British bank, the business press talk of a Chinese takeover of the world economy. But in reality, what Beijing is doing is investing its money in foreign assets rather than investing in its domestic infrastructure. It&apos;s not just toilets and basic sanitation that are thin on the ground. So is an awful lot of essential infrastructure, such as hospitals and adequate schools in the country&apos;s vast hinterland. If a poor Chinese villager gets seriously ill it&apos;s a choice between treatment and penury \u2013 or dying. That&apos;s something often forgotten when we talk about the great global imbalance \u2013 where America and Britain borrow too much and the Chinese and the Middle East lend them money. This is money that could be used to help villagers in western China. And it&apos;s a big reason the Chinese economy has been called &quot;unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable&quot; \u2013 not by an American economist, but by China&apos;s premier Wen Jiabao. The Hong Kong-born political economist Ho-fung Hung goes further: he describes the communist state as &quot;America&apos;s head servant&quot;: reliant on the US to buy its exports and then to sell it dollar-based assets. &quot;As a country, it&apos;s trapped,&quot; he says. Those who reckon China&apos;s rise inevitably means a challenge to the dominance of the west need to think hard about that. The direct influence of Washington may be slightly diluted, but its indirect influence shows no sign of waning. Think about the leading powers&apos; response to the financial crisis of the last couple of years. Who was the leader who led the call for a new Bretton Woods? Not Hu Jintao, but Gordon Brown. Ahead of this week&apos;s G20 summit in Seoul, it&apos;s Washington&apos;s proposal for managing trade that is being discussed \u2013 not any alternative plan from an Asian capital. The great seers and commentators of our time will doubtless say that this is all to come. I hope so. But it takes an awful lot of squinting to see a country without adequate sanitation and so reliant on American trade, and declare confidently that this is the world&apos;s next superpower.", "tags": ["Psychology", "Science", "David Cameron", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-09T07:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/09/marks-and-spencer-foreign-expansion", "sentences": ["The top two targets for expansion are India and Shanghai in China, Bolland indicated this morning."], "title": "Marks & Spencer to revamp stores and push own brand", "article": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to spend \u00a3900m shaking up its UK operations and embarking on a fresh expansion overseas, including in China and India. Six months after taking office, chief executive Marc Bolland is unpicking some of the legacy of Sir Stuart Rose, the former executive chairman who leaves the company before the new year. Bolland, who joined from Morrisons, today announced plans for an aggressive international push that would significantly cut its exposure to the UK economy. Under Bolland&apos;s much-anticipated strategic review, M&amp;S will also increase its floor space within the UK and redesign existing outlets in an attempt to increase UK revenues by between \u00a31bn and \u00a31.5bn a year by 2014. &quot;The business is in good shape and we have strong foundations on which to build through evolution not revolution,&quot; Bolland said this morning. Bolland&apos;s review, carried out with management consultancy McKinsey, found that M&amp;S is failing to meet its potential in a number of key areas. It concluded that many customers find M&amp;S&apos;s stores hard to navigate, struggled to understand the differences between its clothing brands, and often shun its Home department. To address this, Bolland has decided to abandon the Portfolio clothing range \u2013 launched by Rose in 2008 \u2013 and will instead focus on the core M&amp;S brand. The group will also abandon selling technology products to focus on other homeware lines. Bolland pledged to improve M&amp;S&apos;s food offering, through a focus on &quot;fresh, speciality and convenience&quot; foods. The new M&amp;S boss has also decided to slash the number of branded food products on the M&amp;S shelves from 400 to just 100, only a year after expanding the range, which includes Marmite and PG Tips. &quot;Branded foods will play a role only where we cannot develop our own best in class M&amp;S alternatives,&quot; said the company, which also plans to add another 1,000 products to its food halls. The review concluded that M&amp;S has &quot;lagged the UK retail market on space growth&quot; over the last two years. Bolland&apos;s target is to put 95% of the population within a 30-minute drive of a full-size M&amp;S store by 2015, by adding 3% more floor space a year. The company will also open more Simply Food stores, less than two years after Rose decided to close 25 outlets when the UK economy hit trouble. M&amp;S&apos;s goal to become a more &quot;international retailer&quot; is also a reversal on its previous strategy, as the company had abruptly closed all its European stores in 2001. This time around, it plans to operate franchises in &quot;priority markets&quot;. The top two targets for expansion are India and Shanghai in China, Bolland indicated this morning. Online, M&amp;S will build a new website to handle e-commerce orders. However, while it hopes to nearly double its revenues from online wine, flower, and &quot;food to order&quot; transactions to \u00a3150m by 2014 it does not plan to offer its full food range online. M&amp;S has also decided not to renew its contract with Amazon, which currently runs its website, when it expires in 2013. All these changes will need a large increase in capital expenditure. Bolland has committed an extra \u00a3300m a year for the next three years, on top of M&amp;S&apos;s current budget of \u00a3550m. Shares in M&amp;S fell by 3% in early trading to 400.8p as the City digested the details of the plans. &quot;The main surprises, in our view, come in the specific plans regarding the UK strategy where a number of Sir Stuart Rose&apos;s initiatives are being reversed,&quot; commented Freddie George, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce. Tony Shiret, analyst at Credit Suisse, said that Bolland&apos;s review was &quot;a step in the right direction&quot;, but criticised the decision not to build a full online food service. M&amp;S also reported that like-for-like UK sales grew by 4.4% in the six months to 2 October, with pre-tax profits rising to \u00a3348.6m from \u00a3306.7m a year ago.", "tags": ["Marks & Spencer", "Retail industry", "Business", "Marc Bolland", "Supermarkets", "UK news", "Sir Stuart Rose"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-09T09:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/09/marks-and-spencer-review-nils-pratley", "sentences": ["His plan overseas \u2013 concentrate on India and Shanghai \u2013 seems perfectly sensible because success in both markets would provide decades of growth."], "title": "Marks & Spencer strategic review: Marc Bolland plays it safe on the home front", "article": "Marc Bolland seems a dull bird.

His predecessor as chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, Sir Stuart Rose, would not have inflicted such language on his audience. The heavy use of jargon illustrates the lack of ambition in Bolland&apos;s strategic plan. Take his aim to make M&amp;S &quot;a leading multi-channel retailer&quot; by 2013/14. This is defined as having sales of \u00a3800m to \u00a31bn in the UK from sources beyond the shops \u2013 for example, the website, the telephone and the collect-from-the-store facility. But Next, M&amp;S&apos;s smaller rival in clothing, last year scored sales of \u00a3873m from its Directory catalogue and website. Bolland&apos;s goal, then, is to spend three years getting to where Next already is. John Lewis, meanwhile, already makes more than 10% of its sales online. Or consider Bolland&apos;s &quot;Only at M&amp;S&quot; branding. This sounds like a reworking of the lauded &quot;Not just a chocolate pudding, but an M&amp;S chocolate pudding&quot; variations. There is no shame in rehashing winning advertising lines \u2013 just don&apos;t expect the customers to beat down the doors in the same style. Of course Bolland is not claiming to be a revolutionary. He starts from the premise that M&amp;S does not require major surgery and must instead build on the success of Rose&apos;s era. That is not unreasonable if you look at the bald numbers. Pre-tax profits were up 17% to \u00a3349m in the first half of the year and M&amp;S is certainly not in crisis \u2013 Rose threw \u00a33.4bn of capital expenditure at the stores during his five years at the helm. The worry, though, is that beneath the surface the market is gradually moving away from M&amp;S. Its customer base is concentrated among the 50-plus age group. That is an advantage when hard-pressed 20-somethings are scrimping to collect a deposit to buy a house. But M&amp;S may be storing up trouble for the future. M&amp;S&apos;s &quot;age problem&quot; \u2013 much debated in the City \u2013 wasn&apos;t acknowledged by Bolland. A strategy of steady-as-she-goes on the internet risks being overtaken by changing shopping habits. Bolland proved himself a talented retailer at Morrisons so it would plainly be wrong to underestimate him. There are many ways to prosper in retailing and running a tight ship is certainly one.

We have a proper chance for businesses from different sectors, from the young innovators to multinationals, both British and overseas, to work out together what can be delivered. We need dialogue between everyone to make sure we head down the right road. We need the right decisions made and the right pathways in place. Businesses and government need a platform to talk about the opportunities ahead and the policy framework for action and growth. Business needs its own Canc\u00fan. That is why the CBI is hosting a climate change summit on 17 November in London.  It will be a broad day. Before heading off to Mexico, Chris Huhne will be attending to lay out the government&apos;s plans and hear what is needed of him. The Indian environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, will explain what his country can do for businesses and what it needs from an international deal. The key people from industry, science, politics, from NGOs and more will come together. From telecoms to the auto industry, from building firms to energy suppliers, they will come together to decide how low-carbon opportunities are best harnessed and how to make sure they are a positive driver for growth. These are the people that will decide our future: the politicians that set the framework and the businesses that will actually deliver the change. Canc\u00fan is unlikely to achieve the change that we need. But that is politics. In business there is another story. I am optimistic that November 17 will be an agenda-setting day.

Bolland \u2013 lured from Morrisons on a \u00a315m pay deal \u2013 is dramatically scaling back an ambitious plan to compete head-on with the supermarkets by selling hundreds of branded groceries such as Marmite and Coca-Cola. He also axed the Portfolio &quot;fashion-for-fiftysomethings&quot; label launched last year. In another about-face the retailer will open more Simply Food stores \u2013 less than two years after Rose decided to close 25 outlets. And the backpedalling does not stop there: a push into selling household gadgets such as TVs and iPods \u2013 another of Rose&apos;s big ideas \u2013 has been ditched. Bolland was unwilling to put the boot into his predecessor today: &quot;The business is in good shape and we have strong foundations on which to build through evolution not revolution.&quot; Nonetheless that &quot;evolution&quot; comes with a hefty price tag. Bolland plans to spend an extra \u00a3300m a year for the next three years on livening up UK stores \u2013 which have only just had a \u00a33bn makeover under Rose \u2013 improving the website and embarking on a fresh wave of flag-planting in important new markets such as China and India. M&amp;S&apos;s goal now is to become an &quot;international retailer&quot; \u2013 also a reversal on a previous strategy, as the company abruptly closed all its European stores in 2001. This time around Bolland reckons India and Shanghai offer the biggest prizes. Bolland used specialist management consultants from McKinsey to come up with yesterday&apos;s grand plan. They concluded, among other things, that shoppers found it hard to navigate M&amp;S&apos;s stores. Bolland later tested 30 colleagues \u2013 giving them an hour to find five items. Only eight completed the task in time. Customers also struggled to understand the difference between the retailer&apos;s in-house clothing brands such as Per Una, Limited and Autograph. Bolland said his research also picked up that only one in five customers shopped in its homewares departments \u2013 making improving sales in that area another key focus. But his ambitions to make the homewares business punch its weight reminded analysts of M&amp;S&apos;s disastrous foray into opening dedicated &quot;Lifestore&quot; outlets, which were were nicknamed &quot;deathstore&quot; and shut down. Bolland now plans to make more of the core &quot;M&amp;S&quot; label \u2013 which in its heyday was famed for its innovation. In drawing up his plans he studied the M&amp;S archive and talked to surviving members of the founding families and concluded the brand &quot;should do things that other brands don&apos;t do&quot;. M&amp;S is credited with introducing the avocado to British shoppers, and he highlighted recent innovations such as waterproof suits made with its special &quot;Stormwear&quot; fabric and a rough textured pasta that &quot;soaks up sauce&quot;. &quot;It is very simple and it works,&quot; said Bolland of Stormwear. &quot;Why not do the same for chinos so you can wear them when you go to watch a football match?&quot; Today&apos;s strategic review was eagerly awaited by investors keen to know how Bolland plans to increase sales and profits at the retailer. Under Rose annual profits reached \u00a31bn in 2008, but the hangover caused by the recession means they will be around \u00a3700m this year. Bolland would make &quot;no promises&quot; on taking profits back to the heady heights of \u00a31bn but was confident his plans would add more than \u00a31bn of sales a year, taking turnover to over \u00a312bn by 2014. As it steps back from stocking other brands, M&amp;S is working on 1,000 more own-brand products for its food halls. But there is as yet no sign of a fully fledged internet grocery service. AnalysisFarewell to floral, puff-sleeved dresses  When you consider that Mary Portas, Alexandra Shulman and Madonna are all over the age of 45, you have to wonder what Marks &amp; Spencer was thinking when they launched their Portfolio range only two years ago for this age group. From its first collection, Portfolio got it horribly wrong. The announcement that the line is being discontinued comes as no surprise to those of us who looked at its initial offerings and despaired. There must be women who like wearing floral, polyester, puff-sleeved shift-dresses, but how many of them are there left? Portfolio managed to look frumpy on the rail and frumpy on its models. It can be a shock to see older women not shrouded under a cloak of social invisibility, but if you cannot flatter Marie Helvin, the range&apos;s model, you&apos;re not going to flatter anyone else. Older women have been driven out of fashion&apos;s main offerings because of their obsession with youth. For the past three years, it has been impossible to find sleeved dresses that don&apos;t terminate mid-thigh. If you have good legs and arms, show them; if you don&apos;t, cover them up. So Portfolio should have been a chance to cater for a discerning older market. Instead, it created curious oval necklines, tightly-banded puff sleeves which work best on children&apos;s party dresses, and a uniform hemline that finished on or above the knee on any woman above the national average height which is 5ft 3in. Too many of the clothes looked as though they belonged in Classic, the range for women who want the same pair of blue, elasticated-waist, crimplene trousers they bought 18 years ago and are enraged to discover they&apos;re no longer on sale. A mid-calf length denim skirt sold out immediately, demonstrating that there is always a market for clothes you can only normally find in jumble sales; the rest bore no relation to fashion trends, occupying a strange space in which a committee seemed to have decided what older women want by playing Chinese whispers with the outcome of a focus group. None of it worked. An opportunity lost. And who knows when some savvy retailer will try again?

To his credit, Mr Cameron at least seems to have a fairly clear foreign-policy strategy of his own, distinct from both the dangerous hubris of Tony Blair and the chronic short-termism of Gordon Brown. The strategy has three pillars. The first is to put trade at the heart of UK foreign policy. The second is to shift the focus eastwards towards Asia. The third is to be an unobtrusive major partner, neither absurdly hostile nor absurdly ambitious, in Europe and across the north Atlantic. To a great extent, this policy is the product of the circumstances in which Mr Cameron finds himself. It reflects the reality that the government&apos;s priorities are economic rather than military or geopolitical. It reflects the fact that the government is a coalition that wants, for domestic political reasons, to avoid internal ructions over Europe and to draw a line under Labour&apos;s wars. The policy is also a recognition of a shift in world economic power, headlined by the emergence of China, India and others as nations shaping the future, while the importance of the US and Europe declines. It implies an appreciation that the UK economy needs to be rebalanced in favour of the production of things we can sell abroad \u2014 easy to say, harder to do. Overall, it is a practical approach, which in many respects comes as a relief from the delusions and boastfulness of Labour, and which is likely to win public approval, if only because the public often prefers a quiet life. There is nothing wrong with pushing British business in a market as important as China \u2013 and Mr Cameron&apos;s visit comes in the wake of a successful UK presence at the 2010 Shanghai Expo. Nevertheless, the policy has a price. While trade is always more than merely a self-contained commercial policy, there is also more to foreign policy than trade \u2014 something that France, which last week announced its own much larger deals with China, would be the first to insist on. Common positions matter too, especially between Europeans, who have more influence acting together than independently. The visit to China comes in the week of a G20 in South Korea which, to be worthy of its billing as a world economic summit, will need more than bilaterals to address global imbalances and common action against protectionism. The greatest casualty of Mr Cameron&apos;s policy, however, is the fear that his voice \u2013 our voice \u2013 as a defender of human rights may be diminished. George Bush&apos;s reappearance in the public arena this week is a reminder of what the west has thrown away here. Today, we are told, Mr Cameron will take a gamble and urge his hosts to recognise that political freedom, the rule of law and a free press represent the best path to stablility and prosperity. That message will not be delivered directly to the country&apos;s leadership, of course \u2013 it will be made to an audience of students and is unlikely to be broadcast. But it certainly is an improvement on what we were expecting: a few muttered remarks in private at a banquet last night before quickly moving on to the next\u00a0business. In opposition, Mr Cameron and his party spoke out against China&apos;s consistently repressive record on freedom of speech and travel, the press and the rights of minorities, including Tibet. In the week when the imprisoned literary critic Liu Xiaobo is unable to collect his Nobel peace prize, in which Mr Liu&apos;s lawyer, Mo Shaoping, was crudely barred from travelling to London and in which the artist Ai Weiwei was put under house arrest \u2013 and these celebrated cases are only the tiny tip of the iceberg \u2013 Mr Cameron has shown he is prepared to take a tentative step towards speaking truth to power in Beijing.", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "China", "David Cameron", "UK news", "Politics", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-10T00:01:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/china-uk-trade-carbon-deals", "sentences": ["Tackling climate change The Fudan project will receive \u00a335 million over five years form the National and Shanghai governments, underlining the importance China is placing on tackling climate change."], "title": "Low carbon deals take centre stage as UK and China trade talks open", "article": "The biggest deal unveiled today was between Rolls-Royce and China Eastern Airlines, which signed an order worth $1.2 billion for Rolls-Royce to supply Trent 700 engines to power 16 Airbus A330 aircraft.

Its chief executive, Carl McPhail, has ordered two separate inquiries after an undercover Dispatches reporter found workers in a Leicester factory stitching clothes for a number of high street brands \u2013 including New Look, Sir Philip Green&apos;s BhS, Peacocks and Jane Norman \u2013 for as little as \u00a32.50 an hour, less than half the minimum wage. McPhail said the factory had already been blacklisted by the retailer, but it slipped through the net because one of its suppliers had used it as a subcontractor. &quot;We take this matter really seriously as we audit our supplier base,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t want products for New Look produced in this manner. In June we got all our suppliers together and restipulated our code of practice, which makes it clear nothing should be outsourced. I wouldn&apos;t say the system failed but we need to investigate and reflect on what happened.&quot; New Look, which is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative, has begun an internal inquiry and has also hired Ernst &amp; Young to carry out an independent review. It has also promised to make up the shortfall in the wages of the workers that stitched its garments. BhS is also investigating the matter. McPhail&apos;s comments came as the private equity-owned retailer, which in February was forced to delay plans to list on the stock exchange, reported a 5% decline in first-half profits to \u00a373.5m, compared with \u00a377.8m a year ago. UK like-for-like sales were down 4.5% in the six months to 25 September, in what was its worst performance in two years. McPhail said difficult market conditions were compounded by disruption caused by relocating its buying, merchandise and design teams from New Look&apos;s original base in Weymouth to its new London head office, which accounted for about half the sales decline. He said only two-thirds of the 300 head office staff had chosen to move to the capital, forcing it to recruit 100 new staff. Some had not learned the ropes as quickly as anticipated and as a result the retailer missed the boat on some summer fashion trends. &quot;It took a bit longer for them to settle into how New Look trades,&quot; said McPhail. &quot;We were late to get into wedges [sandals] and that caused a bit of a problem.&quot; New Look is a pioneer of so-called &quot;fast fashion&quot; with the entire range changing within a six to eight-week cycle. McPhail warned like-for-like sales were likely to remain subdued into 2011, with shopper numbers down against a backdrop of soaring cotton and freight costs. With more than 600 UK stores, New Look is the country&apos;s second-largest womenswear retailer, and McPhail echoed Next boss Simon Wolfson&apos;s warning that its price would rise by as much as 8% next year. New Look had planned to use its flotation to raise \u00a3650m, enabling it to reduce its \u00a31bn debts. The company said it was under no pressure to refinance as a result of the postponement, but is examining its capital structure with a view to paying off its more expensive loans.

Good. It&apos;s what chancellors of the exchequer are paid to do. The BBC itself helped him by leading its bulletins on the relatively trivial matter of the EU budget battle. The odd billion paid \u2013 or not paid \u2013 to Brussels won&apos;t matter much if the brown stuff hits the global fan in the next year or two, which it might as creeping trade protectionism and competitive currency devaluations make the recession up to now look relatively benign. In asserting that &quot;we&apos;re making steps in the right direction&quot;, Osborne cited progress on IMF reform that will give greater clout to emerging economic giants such as China, India and Brazil, provide stronger bank regulation and better mutual understanding of the need to avoid beggar-my-neighbour trade policies, and achieve better currency balances between creditor/exports and debtor/importers \u2013 notably China and the US. The upside is that all the players in Seoul have read the textbooks and know what they ought to do to avoid repeating the 1930s, which \u2013 I can&apos;t stress this enough \u2013 ended in world war as the default remedy for a crippling Great Depression.  In those days the US was the protectionist emerging giant, now it is the on-the-back-foot free trader while China plays the injured innocent while coining in the dollars \u2013 $2,000bn in its reserves \u2013 and keeping the renminbi artificially cheap. The downside is that they all think it&apos;s someone else&apos;s problem to deal with. The BBC&apos;s Nick Robinson quotes a Chinese official as saying to western negotiators: &quot;It&apos;s not quite clear why we have to take the medicine when you got sick.&quot; Dear, oh dear. It would be easy if we could dismiss such silly chatter as primitive Asian mercantilism \u2013 that 16th century form of economic nationalism that believes you can only truly prosper at my expense \u2013 which long since gave way to more sophisticated doctrines of free trade and comparative advantage. Unfortunately, the Germans \u2013 as European as you and me \u2013 take a similarly complacent view of their own huge trade surplus, second only to China&apos;s. Debtor countries \u2013 the people who buy German and Chinese goods \u2013 should put their own houses in order by exporting more and importing less, living within their means. Fine. But, as the Guardian&apos;s grim reports on the Irish economy underline this morning, when applied to Dublin consumers and Dublin restaurants it is a recipe for bankruptcy all round, China and Germany included. The Irish have attempted to retrench their way back to solvency by deep public spending cuts, only to find that the bond market \u2013 the people willing to buy Irish debt in euros \u2013 don&apos;t see any prospect of renewed growth. As a result they are therefore charging the Dublin ministry of finance 9% \u2013 as of yesterday \u2013 for the privilege of lending the cash. As Larry Elliott points out in today&apos;s Guardian, Dublin doesn&apos;t have to repay money until next summer, but it has cancelled a couple of bond auctions. Everyone is nervous. The eurozone rescued profligate and dishonest Greece (defrauding the EU&apos;s farm budget with claims that aerial photography proved bogus) at great cost to Angela Merkel&apos;s limited bank of political credit at home. She has since set up a permanent crisis resolution mechanism, but it is to be introduced next December \u2013 and could be overwhelmed. What if Ireland, Portugal or Italy \u2013 the zone&apos;s three weakest sisters \u2013 need a similar bailout? Merkel made plain overnight that next time she wants private investors to share the pain. In other words, no more European Union underwriting of profligate national budgets. Ireland bailed out its banks and is now contemplating selling them off to foreign investors. There is renewed talk of a sovereign debt default inside the eurozone: Portugal, perhaps, or Ireland. Some experts say it&apos;s not an if but a when \u2013 and that bringing in the IMF (as Britain did in less serious circumstances in 1976) may be the best solution to ease unbearable pain. Bankruptcy often is, but it&apos;s serious for states because the bankers have long memories. One of the past week&apos;s more interesting snippets of inside news therefore is that China \u2013 awash with all those US dollars \u2013 is sniffing around cash-strapped Portugal, offering to buy some of Lisbon&apos;s euro-denominated debt. Now why would Beijing do that, I wonder? Sheer kindness, diversifying its currency holdings \u2013 or a strategic toehold? We&apos;ll find out one day, perhaps even before those economists, officials and politicians who told us it was imperative to join the eurozone have got round to admitting they were wrong. We would have joined with a lower exchange rate and lower interest rates than suited our situation \u2013 and had an even bigger bubble than we did. Our situation is bad enough, but could have been much worse. Arghh ... All of which is a North Atlantic sideshow compared with the showdown between China and the US over their currencies. Washington has long suggested \u2013 not formally; that would be really serious \u2013 that Beijing is keeping the renminbi cheap to boost exports. Worse, it has suppressed domestic demand \u2013 Chinese citizens buying goods \u2013 in favour of investment, mostly at home, which Beijing hopes will maintain its political control and domestic stability \u2013 always prized by the Chinese state \u2013 by creating more jobs and more exports. All those dollars are piling up in China, except when the state goes on its version of a shopping spree, buying up key foreign firms. The US response has been to print more dollars in the name of quantitative easing \u2013 QEII as the next $600bn round is being called \u2013 to maintain liquidity by having the Federal Reserve buy US government debt. This is risky and controversial. The Republicans don&apos;t like it and nor do the Chinese or Germans: don&apos;t inflate your currency at our expense, they say. But the sensible Keynesian response to that is that their remedy \u2013 to follow Japan, Ireland (etc) into deflation \u2013 would be worse for everyone. And, if private banks won&apos;t lend, then the public authorities must step in. Both sides have valid points against each other. Both sides have made policy errors. But China, still playing the sulky global teenager, holds all those dollars while the US, the selfish middle-aged hippie in the drama, holds the key to what they will be worth. It is a Mexican stand-off in which we could all be hurt. On the radio this morning George Osborne held up the charming prospect of Chinese workers, a bit prosperous for the first time in their lives, being given the chance to &quot;start buying British products&quot;. Whiskey, insurance, fashion, aero-engines, pharmaceuticals, video-games and JK Rowlings, I expect; we do better than we tell ourselves.

That may be vulnerable in ways that OSs in the west aren&apos;t - particularly through the Android (or OMS, or China Mobile) Marketplace. Shanghai Daily reports that &quot;the &apos;zombie&apos; virus, hidden in a bogus anti-virus application, can send the phone user&apos;s SIM card information to hackers, who then remotely control the phone to send URL links, usually pay-per-click ads, in text messages to contacts in the user&apos;s address book.&quot; The first virus hit in September, according to Shanghai Daily&apos;s report of a report by the Chinese National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team Center, which is reported as saying that a further 10 have been identified since then. However this report does, on the surface, sound very similar to reports that surfaced in April, which said that a &quot;new mobile virus&quot; named &quot;MMS Bomber&quot; had run rampant in China, affecting millions of Chinese mobile phones. Beijing Business News said that the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China had alerted mobile users that the targets of the virus are mobile devices running the S60 3rd edition OS \u2013 mostly Nokia and Samsung smartphones. Unfortunately the CNCNERTTC&apos;s site is pretty unhelpful in English - some of the links don&apos;t go anywhere, or go to the wrong documents. The Chinese version (Google translated) doesn&apos;t seem to have anything specific about mobiles either - so it&apos;s hard to figure this out. So this seems to require a few things: (a) there are enough smartphone users in China for this to propagate among them (probably true: smartphones are more than 15% of sales in each quarter) (b) enough people with peers who have smartphones able to display and respond to URLs sent in texts (c) enough people using mobiles with the same OS that the virus can spread. It&apos;s not known whether the latest reports relate to Symbian S60-3e phones, or OMS.  Is it credible? If the antivirus package was free, perhaps; given the propensity of some people to download any old thing from open marketplaces, quite possibly. And China is a huge, huge market: 1m infected users would only be 0.2% of its users, which would translate to a tiny number here in the UK, for instance. Even so, we&apos;d like to see some clearer data about this.

Founded with a mere 53 members in July 1921 in Shanghai, it has now burgeoned to 78 million. Since 1949, it has been the ruling party in the new country it created, the People&apos;s Republic. In its nine decades of existence, two thirds of that in power, it has passed through the Japanese and then National assaults in the 1940s, self-inflicted economic implosion and mass starvation in the 1950s, and the internal purges of the cultural revolution from 1966, which almost decimated it. Today, as Richard McGregor rightly points out, it presides over one of the planet&apos;s great economies, making its mark on regional and global issues such as security and climate change, with not even the weakest organised political opposition at home. It has done this, McGregor shows, by controlling three crucial areas: information, the military (the People&apos;s Liberation Army still reports to the party, not to the government), and a vast, countrywide network of party-related organisations and positions that shadow the government. In order to stay in power, the CCP has turned its back on a history in which it had a predisposition to violence when in a tight spot. Now it has made a grand pact with the private sector, allowing entrepreneurs to flourish and large swaths of society to carry on without political interference. As long as no one talks of setting up competing political parties, this arrangement has worked well. The acceptance of a capitalist class is a mystery that McGregor spends much time explaining. No one really knows what proportion of Chinese GDP comes from the non-state sector, but it is significant. In 2001, the CCP leaders allowed businesspeople to join the party. Since then, as the economy has powered forward, they have become more embedded in the work that the CCP tries to do. Key parts of the business world, however, are still ruthlessly controlled. The heads of the top companies, largely in power or telecommunications sectors, are appointed by the party. The CCP&apos;s pragmatism, inculcated in it by Deng Xiaoping, is a thing to marvel at. Officials can tolerate a world in which Marxism lives side by side with cut-throat capitalism, in which it is glorious to grow rich, as long as you don&apos;t grow political, and in which a middle class has emerged free of most of the restive demands that have occurred in other societies moving from one-party rule to democracy. Democracy, from all the evidence in this book, is not only a long way off in modern China but would destroy a remarkable hybrid that is, at the moment at least, delivering. Not that things are problem-free. Corruption has ravaged the CCP in recent years. Control of all key appointments of power in the country means that the party is alone in being its own regulator. McGregor describes the rampant greed of many modern officials, but makes clear that even the cleanest, when they take up positions of power, have to balance meagre official wages of a few hundred pounds a month against bungs from businesspeople and others going into the millions. Few, if any, are immune. He profiles a Mr Ma, who starts his career with a high-minded refusal to take any backhanders, but who then descends into a world where his life is awash with money. Ma was only unusual in getting caught. With three successful prosecutions for every 100 embarked on, corruption for cadres is a low-risk, high-return game. This book is subtitled &quot;the secret world of China&apos;s communist leaders&quot;, but there are plenty of areas where even the hardest digging doesn&apos;t get far into the party&apos;s shadowy hinterland. Things are about to get worse. At the next major party congress in 2012, seven of the nine slots on the standing committee, the apex of power in modern China, will need to be filled with new faces. With no clear rules for how this is done, and no precedents, the CCP will have to undertake what McGregor argues is its biggest challenge \u2013 governance of itself. And one wonders whether the current period will be looked back as the party&apos;s golden era. The easy work of building a modern economy (and that was hard enough) has now been partially achieved. In the coming decade, the CCP is going to have to deal with rising social expectations, massive demographic problems (an ageing population) and huge environmental and energy problems. Its current political system has changed surprisingly little from half a century ago, when it was created. While it looks strong and impregnable today, and on McGregor&apos;s account is a formidable force holding Chinese society and statehood together, one cannot help sensing small signs of decay. The issue of the future is whether it will end in the same bloodshed and catastrophe in which it started, or whether the CCP will be able to come up with a unique structure that preserves its own interests, but allows Chinese society to modernise and develop.

Quite apart from the small likelihood of a pianist ever winning that competition here, the remarkable thing about Liu Wei is that he is no ordinary pianist: his arms were amputated after an accident at the age of 10, and he plays the instrument fluently with his feet. This is just the latest demonstration of China&apos;s extraordinary obsession with the piano: according to recent estimates, anywhere between 25 and 40 million Chinese children learn the instrument, inspired by the likes of crossover superstar Lang Lang, whose millions of CD sales must be keeping a flagging industry alive as he heads up &quot;A Sony Christmas Carol&quot;, a seasonal ad campaign to sell us TVs and hi-fi. Lang Lang is a phenomenon, a charismatic musician derided by some classical purists, but appealing to a vast new generation of listeners and players: in his steps comes Yundi Li, the young Sa Chen and other products of China&apos;s remarkable piano renaissance. Given the wealth of young talent now being trained there, China has the potential to lead the world in a new vision of classical music. But the story is not quite so simple. Last month I visited Beijing for a Sino-European summit during the Beijing music festival. It is clear that the devotion to the piano is partly the result of China&apos;s family limitation to one child, and the intense desire of parents to see their single offspring succeed as Lang Lang&apos;s parents did, sacrificing money and careers to set him on the path to stardom and riches. It&apos;s a completely individualistic approach to music-making, requiring hours of isolation and limited interaction with other musicians. The violin is played widely, too, taking the total of young people reported to be studying these instruments to as many as 60 million. But pianos and violins don&apos;t make an orchestra, and there are constant comments about the unevenness of provision, China having often failed to achieve the balanced youth orchestras one might expect from such a vast pool of talent. There is nothing in China to match the Venezuelan orchestral revolution. That would require a massive act of social will such as Venezuela made, to empower students to work in orchestras and perfect their skills communally. It could\u00a0yet happen, but it would require a seismic shift. The Beijing music festival is one of the most adventurous and inclusive events to be created in China in the years after the appalling treatment of the arts in the Cultural Revolution, when so many suffered and the country&apos;s long musical traditions were damaged. Its mixed diet of native and western concerts and operas is curated by the charismatic conductor Yu Long, who leads three of China&apos;s major orchestras. Those Chinese orchestras were heard at the festival accompanying new operas, the obligatory Lang Lang concert was included, and there was a strong representation of visitors from this country. Britain has (going back to Yehudi Menuhin and before) strong musical links with China; this year the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic played both Shostakovich and John Lennon there, and the Choir of King&apos;s College, Cambridge sang. Coinciding with this cultural melting pot, the China Arts Foundation, KT Wong Foundation and Phoenix TV invited cultural leaders from Europe to meet, and it seemed a good moment to assess the state of Europe-China cultural relations. David Cameron&apos;s high-profile visit to China, and the country&apos;s continuing human rights issues, raised again by the temporary house arrest of leading artist Ai Weiwei, have all highlighted the limits of creative freedom under which the arts operate even in China&apos;s unprecedented new openness. The days when Mao&apos;s wife, Jiang Qing, dominated musical taste in the country, sanctioning &quot;approved&quot; operas, have disappeared. She exerted an iron hold on the culture, preferring Beethoven&apos;s Sixth Symphony to his triumphalist Fifth, disliking Respighi&apos;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; when she found it was not just about pine trees. Yet, generally, politics still rules. Beijing has a vast new cultural centre just next door to Tiananmen Square, the National Centre for the Performing Arts, reached by an underground walkway under water, which houses in 217,000 square metres a luxuriously appointed opera house, concert hall and theatre all under one stunning glass dome. But because of local political tensions, the leading orchestra, the China Philharmonic, is not resident there and the programme is very limited. Yu Long&apos;s cultural exchanges in the Beijing music festival were much more adventurous. Three opera productions showed the different possibilities of interaction: one western masterpiece, Handel&apos;s Semele, designed, directed and reinterpreted by the Chinese artist Zhang Huan in a co-production with Brussels; one American-Chinese co-production of the traditional tale Madame White Snake, set to eclectic, accomplished music involving children&apos;s choirs and a counter-tenor, by the Chinese-American composer Zhou Long; and, finally, a lavish production of a new commission, Song of Farewell. This much more traditional opera, grandly designed and staged by Zeng Li, was planned as a co-commission with the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, but that collaboration was abandoned when the composer, Xiaogang Ye, was late finishing; the musical style could be generously described as Puccini-like. The Shanghai Symphony played with full command of this traditional idiom, as did the China Philharmonic for Zhou Long&apos;s opera. The co-sponsors of the summit, Phoenix TV, invited participants to take part in an online broadcast on cultural issues, with a potential audience of many millions. But there still seemed a tendency to regard new media as a potential threat to the classical arts. Addressing the summit, the UK scholar and broadcaster, and chairman of the creative industries group Made in China, Philip Dodd, pointed to the vast potential of the internet to offer cultural experiences in a new way to a young generation spread across a vast country. In contrast, the internet was seen by some Chinese as a distraction to the young, representing pop culture, games and trivia. It would be a huge irony if, in trying to become more prosperous, democratic and open (as a government official put it to John Humphreys on Radio 4&apos;s Today programme on Monday), China shirked the challenge of reinvigorating a new cultural renaissance by harnessing the potential of the new media. The energy, enthusiasm and commitment of its young people to music-making as a normal part of daily life is something that could be a huge inspiration here.

He added: &quot;Festival 2011 is no mere history lesson, it will be a heady three weeks of exquisite artistic exploration which I hope will intoxicate audiences.&quot; These debuts in Edinburgh by several of China&apos;s most prestigious arts companies have highlighted the increasing political significance of trade and diplomatic links with China for institutions such as the festival. Mills said the Chinese national ballet and Shanghai Peking opera productions were made possible by &quot;substantial&quot; financial support from China&apos;s government, which last week hosted a major UK trade mission led by David Cameron. Festival officials said that, coincidentally, Mills is in China as a guest of the country&apos;s culture ministry to give lectures on the importance of arts festivals for medium-sized cities, and to support a VisitBritain mission to boost Chinese tourism to the UK. Visits by Chinese tourists are expected to double by 2014, and Mills hopes that visitors to the London Olympics in 2012 and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014 will be persuaded to detour to see the Edinburgh festivals. These links underscore Mills&apos; increasing reliance on foreign sources to fund his programme as UK arts organisations face increasingly tight public and private sector spending.

Centuries of emigration was reversed with hundreds of thousands of workers flocking in from eastern Europe and beyond and former sons and daughters returning from abroad. It was booming and awash with cash. The average age of cars on the road in 2007 was just three years old. The country had the highest number of helicopters per capita in Europe, thanks to cheap finance which bankrolled 10 years of buccaneering property development at home and abroad.  Dublin quickly became a Little Dubai with shiny new office blocks, five-star hotels, wonderful statement buildings and a rash of apartment complexes. Elsewhere, the Irish made serious trophy acquisitions, buying up large swathes of Knightsbridge, Regent Street, Bond Street, Canary Wharf, Bucharest and Shanghai. The Irish had conquered the world. So when the financial crash came in 2008, it hit Ireland harder than most. The country&apos;s economy had been built around a property boom. Now it is close to bankruptcy. The weekend papers have been dominated by the country&apos;s fight against a Greek-style bailout from Europe and the IMF.  Yesterday, in the picturesque town of Kilkenny, experts from all over the world gathered to discuss the crisis at an economics festival. There was no sense that Ireland could survive without external help. &quot;The IMF is a bad word in Argentina and when it becomes a household name in Ireland, this is bad news,&quot; said the former economics minister of Argentina, Martin Lousteau. He warned that the biggest mistake Ireland could make would be to go bust and not do something to change the underlying causes of the crisis.  Put another way: &quot;It sounds like Ireland is drowning but all you are doing is describing the water not taking action.&quot; The words of London-based investment banker Vikas Nathas. Ireland is now on tenterhooks and the coming weeks which include a by-election, the unveiling of a four-year fiscal plan and a brutal budget in December, will be critical.  The government is deeply unpopular and morale is at rock bottom. And no wonder. It would truly be a sad day for a nation that has fought so hard for its independence back in 1916 to welcome what will be called an &quot;IMF Mission&quot;. Personally, it is also cause for reflection. I was one of the last batch of \u00e9migr\u00e9s leaving Dublin in 1987, and I have spent most of my working life in London, working at news organisations including the Guardian where I was launch editor of Mediaguardian.co.uk.  From afar, I watched my home country blossom into a place oozing with self-confidence and able to punch above its weight on the international markets. Now it is on its knees. And the country&apos;s twenty-somethings have little option but to emigrate. As Peter Casey, 26, told me last week: &quot;Why should we stay and pay for someone else&apos;s mess?&quot; It is an extraordinary tale and in this new blog we will track the latest developments as they unfold. Tomorrow, we will bring you more from Martin Lousteau, the former economics minister of Argentina. He recalls the financial catastrophe of 2001/2 which led to rioting, looting in supermarkets, six deaths and four presidents in one week.  Over the coming weeks, this blog we will also be looking at the human cost of the crisis \u2013 the emigration, the unemployment, the every day struggles of small business. We have two esteemed academics on board to help decipher the finances: Brian Lucey associate professor of finance at the Trinity College Dublin school of business and Stephen Kinsella,an economist at the University of Limerick. They will guest blog regularly, starting this Wednesday. We also have the secret diary of a businessman, aged 38 and a half. He was a Celtic Tiger success and made significant money from property.

One of the government&apos;s most senior ministers went on the attack at lunchtime today declaring unequivocally that Ireland does not need a bailout, and attacking the media speculatilon. He said continued misinterpretation of the facts was &quot;very damaging&quot; to the country. In an interview on RTE at lunchtime, minister for state for Europe, Dick Roche, said: &quot;It is not a just a question of national pride or being pig-headed, it would not be a good thing to go running to the IMF when there no need to do so. Ireland is well funded.&quot; But opposition spokesman Michael Noonan said he thought there was &quot;substance&quot; to the international stories. He said Europe is pushing agenda because the government had made such a &quot;fiasco&quot; of the bank crisis.

It&apos;s been a long wait, but Ghoul have grown a lot since self-releasing their debut mini-LP A Mouthful Of Gold in 2008.

Instead, they create cautious, almost fragile songs on their debut album, Leaves Leaves Fall Fall Rain Fall, that get under your skin. The featured single, A Stereotype, is a perfect example for this sound which is founded on jazzy rhythms and soulful voices, especially from Fabian Schuetze. A Forest will release a new, as-yet untitled EP in March. GREECE       MouxlalouloudaFilm (featuring Hildur Krist\u00edn) - Harmur Fuglsins       Harmur Fuglsins, an atmospheric song with cinematic aesthetics that effortlessly creates images of tender, hearth-side warmth, is the bewitching outcome of a collaboration infused by the strikingly contrasting geographical and artistic backgrounds of Film and R\u00f6kkurr\u00f3&apos;s Hildur Krist\u00edn Stef\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir. Curling around an eloquently subtle arrangement armed with guitars, delicate noises, pounding drums, sombre sonic textures, melodic synth lines and electronic facets and combined with the marvelous, ethereal vocal touches of Hildur brings out its tremendous beauty with every listen. ICELAND       I Love Icelandic MusicSykur - Rocketship       First we had Sykurmolarnir, known worldwide as The Sugarcubes. Now an Icelandic electronic trio of youngsters from Reykjavik goes under the alias Sykur (&quot;Sugar&quot;). Their shows are fun-filled, sexy and energetic and they collaborate with local rappers and pop and rock singers. Rocketship, which has guest vocals from \u00datid\u00far singer Rakel Mj\u00f6ll, is taken from Sykur&apos;s debut album Fr\u00e1b\u00e6rt E\u00f0a Fr\u00e1b\u00e6rt, which was released a year ago on the Icelandic Record Records label. INDIA       IndiecisionSulk Station - Contentment       Bangalore downtempo act Sulk Station define themselves as &quot;mellowdramatic pop&quot;, a term that captures the essence of their ambient soundscapes particularly well. The young duo&apos;s minimal yet stark productions are powered by vocalist Tanvi Rao&apos;s lazy delivery. Contentment grows from a Zero 7-esque drone to a swirling dance track which wouldn&apos;t be out of place at an EDM club downtown. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarBangkutaman - Ode Buat Kota       Ode Buat Kota, which means &quot;an ode to the city&quot;, is taken from Bangkutaman&apos;s latest concept album about hard life in Jakarta - the pollution, traffic, crime, house loans, etc. Their music is influenced by The Stone Roses, The Byrds and The Mamas &amp; The Papas. They are one of the most well-respected bands in Indonesia.  IRELAND       Nialler9Kasette - You Were More       Kasette consist of a trio of school friends who formed a music partnership while on a J-1 visa in Vancouver. They have just released their debut EP entitled A Mixed Tape which showcases the girls&apos; brand of chamber folk-pop. Simple and soft, Kasette&apos;s music is in its infancy but it&apos;s already lilting and lovely. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelDesert (featuring Joakim Broden) - Lament For Soldier&apos;s Glory: Order 227       Israel is comprised of many Russian-born people, some Jewish, some not. Lament For Soldier&apos;s Glory: Order 227 by Desert taps into Russian history, describing Stalin&apos;s cruel command that any soldier captured by the enemy was considered a traitor. Its haunting melodies and driving rhythms sonically depict pain and determination. And as all of Desert served (or are still serving) in the Israeli army, they know what it means to fight for survival. Vocalist Joakim Broden of Sweden&apos;s Sabaton (Nuclear Blast Records) lends his talents to the tale of war and blood. ITALY       PolaroidSybiann - Monsoon Breath       You don&apos;t really want to know where this is going to end up. Kraut, post-rock, noise, Liars, Deerhunter... it&apos;s a scary, puzzling orgy of sounds. The amazing debut album of this young band from the town of Ravenna will fire up the imagination of anyone who has the guts to listen to it. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaMovus - Al Filo Del Origen       Movus is a five-piece band from Guadalajara. Theirs is a very cinematic post-rock sound, filled with peaks and valleys of instrumental narratives. For their second album Maxa FireKeeper (produced by Jimmy LaValle from San Diego&apos;s The Album Leaf), they were inspired by the Huichol Indians&apos; myths: Maxa is a deer that guards the mystical fire of the universe. Al Filo Del Origen (translated as &quot;at the rim of the origin&quot;) is as epic as Explosions In The Sky and as evocative as a new soundtrack to the Dr Who sci-fi series. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamDaily Bread - About Birds And Bees       This raw trio from the north of the Netherlands label themselves as &quot;sexy garage dance&quot;. They&apos;re certainly sexy, glamming it up at times, banging out taut, fast, noisy grooves reminiscent of Franz Ferdinand or !!! - albeit with a female vocal on top. Particularly live, they&apos;re all about big beats, sweat and dancing. However, About Birds And Bees tunes into a summery Sixties garage-pop vibe instead. And they&apos;ve delightfully avoided any tweeness precedent by writing a deliciously poppy, organ-driven ode to the one-night stand. NEW ZEALAND       Counting The BeatDisasteradio - No Pulse       Disasteradio is Luke Rowell&apos;s one-man synthpop outfit. No Pulse comes from his second album Charisma. With this album, Disasteradio has shifted the balance a little more on to songs rather than sounds compared to past releases. The end result is an album with vocodered vocals and a crunchy new wave feel - part Devo, part Gary Numan and part computer game. Charisma is available on Bandcamp and you can watch the video for No Pulse on YouTube. NORWAY       EardrumsYoung Dreams - Young Dreams       Young Dreams is a Bergen-based collective who make beautiful pop with equal doses of tropical flavours and Phil Spector/Brian Wilson influences. The project started in 2009 and now has as many as 10 members, including profiled musicians such as Matias Tellez and Chris Holm. Young Dreams will release two 7&quot; singles in early 2011 and their debut album is in the making. They will also perform at the upcoming by:Larm festival. PERU       SoTBThe Satellite - El Sol       The Satellite began their activities as a band in 2006 with a slight tendency towards post-rock, fusion and experimentation, using any sound that was available. In 2008, with a consolidated style, they released their second EP, 124, which contains El Sol. The band is currently composing more musical pieces and looking forward to making a debut album which they hope will come out very soon. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Emmy Curl - Seafire And Its Waltz       Emmy Curl lives in a northeast Portuguese town and has studied classic guitar in a music conservatory. However, her songwriting and singing is closer to a mix of ethereal and alternative folk than to anything classical. Imagine a blend of Lisa Germano and Suzanne Vega. She is one of a number of promising unsigned Portuguese artists and is due to have her first European tour. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseThy Veils - The KnifeChild       Daniel Dorobantu comes from Timisoara and is the mastermind behind this beautiful experimental/ambient project. A bit dark and somehow persistent, Thy Veils&apos; music is that soundtrack you always wanted for your weird dreams. And if you have trouble dreaming, visit the official site, where a slideshow of the band&apos;s videos (The KnifeChild included) will help with the visuals. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopBwani Junction - Two Bridges       You should know fairly instantly whether Edinburgh&apos;s Bwani Junction are the band you&apos;ve been waiting for when I tell you that they sound like a cross between The Libertines and Vampire Weekend. They are unsigned but, given the buzz that surrounds them, probably won&apos;t be for much longer. Two Bridges is already a singalong anthem among their rapidly increasing fanbase. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...Nicholas Chim - Midnight       Nicholas Chim is a singer-songwriter who walks the thin line between being absolutely self-indulgent and giving every iota of emotion that he conveys through his music. What results is some of the most earnest songs that shine in their simplicity; yet, the complexity of his arrangements and lyrics come forth distilled and pure. Nicholas is in the middle of recording his second album, Forgiefan, but has kindly shared a contemplative, folksy offering from it entitled Midnight. He hopes you enjoy the music as much as he did writing it. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Merseystate - Jersey Girl       With a rock sound that has been compared to other stellar acts but is still uniquely their own comes Merseystate. They are the culmination of alternative rock at its best. Jersey Girl officially launched them on to the music scene last year. It&apos;s a deftly-crafted song that tugs at you then whirls into melodic pop euphoria. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKAutumn Vacation - Dreamy Even In Deception (Fooled But Dreamy)       Autumn Vacation showcases the songwriting skills of Bobby Chung - the mastermind behind former MAP artist Julia Hart - and the warm, addictive voice of Gyepy, who could previously be heard as the female vocalist of Broccoli, You Too? The duo recently put out a self-titled album full of what they hope to be perceived as thought-provoking easy listening, providing the same sense of peacefulness as strolling in a park. As lovely as anything else from the band, Dreamy Even In Deception is a light and sweet pop tune that is bound to make you crave more. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     Musikorner6pm - Letters Play       Formed in mystical Santiago de Compostela in 2003, 6pm are an electronic/indie duo that has found inspiration in ambient/shoegaze bands such as Sigur R\u00f3s, M\u00fam, Styrofoam or even The Postal Service. Letters Play, taken from their rather uknown last EP called Tape Worms, is certainly a breath of air in the Spanish ocean of indie music, where we rarely find inspiring ambient electronic tracks. 6pm are working on their sophomore album, set to be released sometime next year. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseJohan Hillblom - Sneak Preview       Sneak Preview by Johan Hillblom may be underproduced but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s amateurish. The trumpet solos are great, the odd beats cool, and Johan&apos;s crooning vocals clear and crisp. The lyrics are personal and clever without being pretentious. Examples include &quot;you should see the gallery in my cellphone, you look like an angel from every angle&quot; and &quot;once when I was drunk I accidentally poked you on Facebook, and what&apos;s worse you didn&apos;t poke back&quot;. If you are looking for the next Jens Lekman or Montt Mardi\u00e9 (or the next cast member of Glee for that matter), look no further. SWITZERLAND       78sThe Circle Brothers - Hands At The Steel       You say Nick Cave, I say Alban Ringli. Never heard of him? Alban Ringli is the singer of Swiss indie-folk outfit The Circle Brothers and he gives his two bandmates (who also happen to be his brothers) a special touch in a Nick Cave manner. They have just released their new record Love &amp; Disorder. It sounds gloomy and anxious but still has a gleam of hope. UNITED STATES     Flag of the USA     UNITED STATES: I Guess I&apos;m FloatingTV Girl - On Land       San Diegan dudes TV Girl know how to make one hell of a pop song. On Land is quickly becoming one of our favorites of the year, matching the earnestness of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah&apos;s debut with the hooks of MGMT&apos;s most memorable songs. Their debut EP is a free download on Bandcamp. Keep your eyes peeled for TV Girl in 2011, they&apos;re gonna dominate it. VENEZUELA     Flag of Venezuela     BarquisimentoMochuelo - La Reina Del Lugar       Venezuelan rock band Mochuelo are known for their electronic sounds and all of the members pour their influences into one unique concept. Their guitar distorsions, contagious rhythms and sweet female vocals saw this band walk away with first prize in the 2005 New Bands Festival.

His last play, The Schuman Plan, dealt with the European federal dream. His new one tackles both Formula One motor racing and Chinese political oppression. But, much as I admire Luscombe&apos;s audacity, the marriage of two such mighty topics tends to be of the shotgun variety. Luscombe&apos;s setting is Shanghai as the grand prix circus hits town. Initially, the focus is on Tyler, an ex-world champion, now facing a possible non-renewal of his contract by his corporate sponsors. Angrily refusing to take part in the qualifiers, Tyler goes on a trip round Shanghai with a star journalist, property developer and party loyalist, Zhi-hui, bitterly estranged from his family. At a Buddhist temple, Zhi-hui is accosted by one of his two sisters desperately seeking help for their sibling, who has been imprisoned for political protest and faces execution. The question is whether Tyler will use his position to help publicise a flagrant abuse of human rights. To his credit, Luscombe exposes the dodgy dealings of the Formula One world, where billionaire businessmen ruthlessly call the shots. He is also one of the few British dramatists to confront the fact that China, for all its embrace of a market economy, remains an oppressive, militaristic dictatorship. But, as if to counter the vast amount of information he has to unload, Luscombe has his characters talk in soundbites devoid of any subtext. &quot;I escape the past,&quot; the entrepreneurial Zhi-hui typically tells his sister, to which she indignantly replies: &quot;You concrete it over.&quot; Luscombe also strains to forge hidden links between the capitalist and communist systems by suggesting that both the downsliding Tyler and the upwardly mobile Zhi-hui are obsessed with status and crippled by guilt over the deaths of their fathers. But, even if the piece makes one&apos;s head spin with the amount of story it has to tell, the author&apos;s own production has a hectic vitality, and is well acted. Benedict Wong as the Shanghai journalist and Andres Williams as the mutinous driver capture the insecurity of two products of rival political systems. Emotionally, the real contrast lies between Lucy Sheen as Zhi-hui&apos;s impassioned lawyer sister and Lourdes Faberes as Tyler&apos;s glamorised, Chinese-born minder who has adjusted to the corporate world. But although the staging, dominated by Tim Meacock&apos;s vast Buddha, is impressive, there is matter enough for two plays, which, in the end, is precisely what Luscombe has\u00a0written.

In a volatile day&apos;s trading ahead of a key meeting of European finance ministers, the FTSE 100 lost 138.51 points or 2.38% to 5681.90, amid worries the financial problems in Ireland - and indeed Portugal and Greece - would spread to other European economies. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council said the survival of the eurozone itself was at stake if the crisis could not be resolved. However Ireland continued to insist a bailout by the EU was not inevitable. Meanwhile Greece also came under pressure as Austria hinted it may not pay its \u20ac190m contribution to an agreed aid package, saying Greece had failed to live up to its part of the deal. Jeremy Batstone-Carr of Charles Stanley said:  If [the funds due to Greece at the end of the month] are not received it is possible to speculate that the Greek government could run out of cash within 60 days. If that happens then the Greek government would have to shut down part or all of its operations and suspend interest and principle payments on its debt.  Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:  The FTSE took a whack today as it finally dawned on equity investors that Europe might be in a bit of a pickle. It&apos;s extraordinary that the sell-off has taken such a long time to materialise when the headlines have been riddled with increased concerns over the Ireland and Portugal issue.  Earlier news that Korea had raised its interest rates prompted talk that China might follow suit in an attempt to rein in rising inflation, sending Shanghai shares down 4% overnight. Such a move would dampen down demand for commodities, so mining shares were among the day&apos;s biggest fallers as base and precious metal prices tumbled. Kazakhmys closed 93p lower at \u00a314.21 while Antofagasta fell 79p to \u00a313.59. BHP Billiton lost 88p to \u00a323.18 as analysts at Credit Suisse speculated it could turn to the petroleum sector now its bid for Potash Corporation has failed, with US group Anadarko or Australia&apos;s Woodside seen as possible targets. The falls were not confined to London and Asia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 200 points or nearly 2% by the time the UK closed, while the CAC 40 in France fell 2.6% and the German Dax was 1.9% lower. A bigger than expected rise in UK inflation did little to help sentiment. Banks fell on worries about their exposure to Ireland. Analysts Andrew Lim and Kapilan Pillai at Matrix said Lloyds Banking Group&apos;s loans to the country totalled \u00a327bn, or 4% of its total book, while for Royal Bank of Scotland the figure was \u00a357.6bn, or 10%. Lloyds is 3.27p lower at 66.6p while RBS is down 1.46p at 40.86p. There were some bright spots. AstraZeneca added 12p to \u00a330.28 on speculation it could sell Astra Tech, a Swedish business which makes dental implants and medical devices for some $2bn. There was also talk it wanted to dispose of a US chain of centres for cancer outpatients for around $500m. Brian White at Shore Capital said:  If confirmed, AstraZeneca appears to be following in the footsteps of other major pharma companies which are seeking to benefit from asset disposals to boost their other operating income and cash generation. Residual cash is then available for 1) specific business needs 2) debt repayment 3) progressive dividend policy and 4) share repurchases. One could speculate that such a divestment process confirms the company&apos;s confidence in its pharmaceuticals business overall and a purity of focus. Given the higher margins generated by its pharma business, this could ultimately generate greater rewards.   A positive trading update lifted TalkTalk Telecom 8.9p to 153p, while Homeserve added 15.8p to 429.6p after a buy note on the home insurance group from UBS. The bank said:  We believe Homeserve is well-positioned for sustainable double-digit profit growth given the strong platform it has created. The US is the most cited example of this, but we see growth opportunities in Europe as well as in the UK, where it is implementing wide-ranging customer growth initiatives. Reflecting this growth potential, and following recent share price underperformance, we upgrade Homeserve to buy from neutral, and raise our price target to 510p from 450p.  Wellstream fell 14.5p to 740p after the oil services group said trading was in line with expectations, but gave no update on the previously announced bid approaches. Evolution Securities said:  Wellstream&apos;s confirmation that current trading is in line with expectations should be of little consequence to the market which is more interested in progress or lack of it, in the approaches made to the company. Brazil continues to perform well and Newcastle is improving in utilisation but from a low base. The backlog remains essentially static at \u00a3250m, compared to \u00a3246m at end June. Wellstream announced on September 29 that it had received a number of preliminary approaches and subsequently GE indicated on Oct 6th that it had had a 750p a share offer rejected and made no guarantee that it will take further action. There is no update today on possible offers. If the &quot;number of approaches&quot; for the company come to nothing, then the market may have to refocus on 2011 forecasts, where market expectations are for an 80% increase in earnings per share \u2013 which could be a big ask given the backlog remains essentially static.

The problem is, on his form over the past year, there is no way of telling from week to week which Murray is going to turn up. If it is the one who won the Shanghai Masters only a week after collapsing like a pricked balloon in the Beijing Open, Soderling is in for a serious test on the Scot&apos;s favourite surface. He similarly looked great in the early part of the Paris Masters, only to fall away against Ga\u00ebl Monfils, who went on to lose in the final. The draw, made in London today, pits Murray in a round-robin format against Soderling, who won in Bercy at the weekend to bump Murray down to No5 in the world rankings, Roger Federer and David Ferrer, who play the night match, brought forward 45 minutes for an 8pm start after complaints about late finishes making travel home last year a logistical nightmare at what is a superb venue in one of London&apos;s transport blindspots. On the other side of the draw, Novak Djokovic plays Tomas Berdych on Monday afternoon and the tournament comes truly to life in the evening when the world No1, Rafael Nadal, plays the late qualifier Andy Roddick. Although fans might have doubts about getting in and out of Greenwich on the south bank of the Thames, the players cannot wait to get there. This is the culmination of their season, the best eight players in the world dredging up the last surge of their gym-bred energy for bragging rights of the elite. &quot;It&apos;s an incredible atmosphere,&quot; Murray said on his website, &quot;a huge arena and it&apos;s one of the biggest competitions in tennis behind the grand slams, so I&apos;m really looking forward to it. The last couple of weeks weren&apos;t as good as I&apos;d have liked, although I actually won my first doubles competition with my brother [Jamie], which was cool. But playing in front of a home crowd is always great. It would be a big one psychologically to win, so I&apos;ll give it my best shot.&quot; Psychologically, Murray has veered between David Haye and Audley Harrison. If he can ignore the minor wrist niggle that surfaced in Paris, he has a great shot at winning this tournament. Nadal has injury problems of his own and Federer, while recovering lost ground in a frustrating season, is not the imposing threat he once was. The organisers say there will be no repeat of the communications fiasco that left spectators in the arena and watching at home in total confusion last year. &quot;We knew who had qualified,&quot; said the chief executive officer of the ATP International Group, Brad Drewett, &quot;but we didn&apos;t communicate it well. This year we will communicate the information a lot quicker.&quot; Murray is hoping it will be good news all the way to the final on Sunday week.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-16T19:44:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/nov/21/andy-murray-atp-finals", "sentences": ["We both played well in Shanghai [where Murray won again]."], "title": "Andy Murray overwhelms Robin Soderling with near-perfect performance", "article": "Andy Murray could not have made a more convincing start to the final tournament of a long and fascinating year. If he does to the rest of the field gathered on the south bank of the Thames what he did to Robin Soderling in an hour and 20 minutes today, Murray is a reasonable bet to win the ATP World Tour Finals and reclaim his No4 world ranking from the Swede. Murray won 6-2, 6-4, hitting heights he has touched fleetingly since losing in the final of the Australian Open against Roger Federer in January. And Federer&apos;s 6-1, 6-4 dismissal of the Spaniard David Ferrer suggests Murray&apos;s match against the Swiss on Tuesday will be no stroll by the river. The world No2 at times was as commanding as at any point in his long and recent pomp, although he admitted: &quot;Looking at the scoreline, it doesn&apos;t reflect how tough it was.&quot; Either way we are in for a treat. Federer will squash doubts about his revival at the end of an uneven season or Murray will get on a roll that may take him from here to a first grand slam title back at the scene of the crime in Melbourne. His 2010 campaign rolled and soared like some crazy fairground ride after that tear-filled defeat but Murray finds himself at an agreeable height. In the first set he was irresistible, in the second efficient. That is not a bad mix of skills in this company. &quot;I played very smart tennis,&quot; Murray said. &quot;Even when it was getting tough in the second set, with a lot of long rallies and I was on the defensive a lot, I stuck to my tactics. I had to do a lot of running.&quot; His third win over Soderling in five meetings saw him in imperious form on the slower indoor court at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. The low-bouncing surface clearly suits the under-cut backhand defensive shots that so unnerve aggressive opponents. Soderling, for one, was reduced to near impotence, then bamboozled by a consistently high degree of excellence coming at him over the net from all angles and heights. Murray served as well as he has done all season, powerfully down the middle of the court, with swirling away swing on the backhand, and got his second serve to kick venomously. &quot;The slice worked well, too,&quot; he said. &quot;I passed smart, didn&apos;t always go for the lines. I hit a lot down to his feet, made him play a lot of uncomfortable shots.&quot; It was near-perfect tennis, probably on a par with anything he produced in Melbourne \u2013 at least until undone by Federer. Soderling, the player of the moment after winning the Paris Masters in fine style last weekend (when he bumped Murray from 4 to 5 in the world rankings), was plainly off key. His serve wobbled from the first game to the last and, troubled by Murray&apos;s lethal accuracy, he came to the net with all the certainty of a child looking for sweets at a wedding. &quot;I just wasn&apos;t there,&quot; Soderling said. He was, in fact: he was everywhere Murray wanted him to be. There was a whole collection of memorable Murray shots in the first set; a running forehand for 0-30 in the third game, followed by a killer backhand for three break points that had Soderling reeling. When the Swede&apos;s second serve malfunctioned and he dropped serve, there was no coming back. Murray broke him again in the seventh game, forcing a limp forehand into the net from him at the end of a long, tough rally. He secured the set after 28 minutes with a delicate, viciously spinning drop shot that clung to the white line. Soderling came briefly to life in the second set but his second serve was now shredded and Murray moved in freely to dominate with scorching returns on either wing. Soderling had his only break point in the sixth game before Murray pulled out a 129mph ace. When Soderling hit long at 15-40 down in the 10th game, his agony was over. Murray is determined to leave London in the best possible shape before heading for the warmth of Miami next week. There he will recharge batteries that have occasionally run flat. Coincidentally or not, the ATP finally addressed the dilemma of burn-out by agreeing to add two weeks to the five-week break at the end of the season, starting in 2012. Federer will appreciate that. Fatherhood and age have dulled his edge ever so slightly but he cannot wait for another showdown with Murray. &quot;We both played well at the Australian,&quot; he said, &quot;then we played well in Toronto [where Murray won]. We both played well in Shanghai [where Murray won again]. Here it seems like we&apos;re both playing well.&quot; And then he added his trademark twist to the gullet: &quot;Only difference is I have the slam and the [ATP] 250, 500 and 1000.

Would Wilander, who coaches Sweden&apos;s Davis Cup team, or Becker, who has had talks with the Lawn Tennis Association about some vague involvement in British tennis, make a difference? More than likely. They are the big-time grand slam title winners of the past whom Murray has identified as the sort of person he wants to be tutored by for the rest of his career. He says he is tired of hiring and firing. The next coach should be the last one. So who else is there? Tim Henman? He can probably not be bothered. He plays a lot of golf and goes on a lot of holidays. In between he knocks out a bit of commentary at Wimbledon and tidies up at home before his wife, Lucy, gets home from another day&apos;s horse-riding. The idea of traipsing around the circuit with Andy (or anyone else, for that matter) cannot appeal much to a member of the British tennis aristocracy. John McEnroe? He is always about: in the commentary booth or on the senior circuit. He has often said he empathises with Murray, in style and temperament. But great players do not always make great coaches and he would be short-priced to lose his cool with Andy at some point. The Australian Darren Cahill was a front-runner for a while, but he too is a near full-time media man. As Rusedski pointed out in the Mirror a couple of days ago, Soderling has benefited greatly from a straight-talking mentor, Magnus Norman. Much good it did him yesterday. And Murray is not Soderling. He does not need leading, he needs nurturing. The best coach for him is probably someone who will listen rather than preach, a bit like Paul Annacone, who guides Federer now, and once helped Murray. Alex Corretja has survived Murray&apos;s coaching cull partly because he knows when to advise and when to listen. Annacone is similarly clever. He goes with the flow. If a client reckons he has come up with a strategy (as Federer did when he introduced more chipping and lobbing to his game this year), Annacone is the first to agree with him \u2013 even if it might have been his suggestion in the first place. Murray will not be pushed. &quot;If I&apos;m not improving, then I&apos;m not going to keep just trying to make it work without a coach,&quot; he said before the Paris Masters. &quot;I guess we&apos;ll have to wait and see. There are a lot of things I need to improve. Some weeks I felt great moving on the court; some weeks not so good.&quot; This week, so far: great.

The American was all over the Spaniard in the first set last night, 6-3, and looked to be in a good place to close him down in the second but lost it 7-6 on a tie-break. The closing chapter, 6-4 for Nadal, left Roddick spent and disillusioned. There are no certainties. For most of the year, Nadal has been the ruler of his universe; lately, his strong left shoulder had collapsed, maybe in keeping with his dodgy knees, a king of the court visibly disintegrating in front of us. Roddick had slipped in the rankings. It was his time to KO the champ, perhaps. But he had him on the ropes and blew it. Nadal goes through to the second round comforted that he can resist the impertinent challenges of mortals. And a sane gambler would be hard-pressed to bet against his winning this tournament. It has been a good week for icons. From Craven Cottage to the O2 Arena, the shambling, magical presence of a bearded and plump Diego Maradona hangs over London&apos;s sporting landscape, and nobody is feeling the buzz quite so much as Novak Djokovic. They have become firm friends down the years, swapping shirts from their respective sports, but met for the first time at the tennis. Djokovic could hardly contain his delight. Maradona, a tennis fan so committed he travelled to Moscow three years ago to support Argentina in the Davis Cup, might even inspire him to win this tournament, the Serbian said after spotting the great man in the crowd on his way to seeing off Tomas Berdych in straight sets. &quot;It made me nervous,&quot; Djokovic said. &quot;But just to have him as a supporter is an incredible honour and pleasure. Hopefully he can be my lucky charm.&quot; Support comes not just from the stars. Roger Federer will be in the odd yet familiar position today of having a disproportionate number of the 17,500 fans cheering him on against Andy Murray. The Swiss was recently voted the most popular player on the circuit for the eighth year in a row. Britain&apos;s No1, though, is not bothered. &quot;It&apos;s one of those things,&quot; he said of Federer&apos;s enduring love affair with tennis fans. They are in prime form for what should be a fascinating rematch of their Shanghai Masters final, which Murray won in probably the best of his eight victories over Federer. If the crowd go with Federer, it will do no more than concentrate the Scot&apos;s mind on the task. &quot;All the players would like to have all the support on their side,&quot; Murray said, &quot;but our job, as professional athletes, is to try to put the crowd out of our minds if things aren&apos;t going well.&quot; Focus is something Berdych seems to have lost since beating Djokovic in the semi-finals at Wimbledon this year. That victory and other impressive performances marked the Czech as one of the most dangerous opponents on the circuit. Djokovic lost in straight sets at Wimbledon, then rattled up 26 wins to three losses before their rematch yesterday, and this time he was brutally in control of his adversary in winning 6-3, 6-3 in just under an hour-and-a-half. &quot;I&apos;d be lying if I said [the pressure] didn&apos;t get to me,&quot; Berdych said of his losing debut in the end-of-season tournament. And he&apos;s got Nadal and Roddick to come.", "tags": ["ATP World Tour Finals", "Tennis", "Sport", "Rafael Nadal", "Andy Roddick"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-23T00:13:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/26/new-band-io-echo", "sentences": ["They&apos;ve got one called Shanghai Girls that not surprisingly isn&apos;t a million miles from Siouxsie&apos;s Hong Kong Garden, and another called Outsiders."], "title": "New band of the day \u2013 No 918: Io Echo", "article": "Hometown: Los Angeles.

Well, maybe it&apos;s the way we tell &apos;em, but we assumed if anything we&apos;d been too fawning, in the last week or so, towards Chad Valley, Niki and the Dove, Girl Unit, Zoo Kid, Patrick Kelleher, Selebrities, Treefight for Sunlight, Fantastic Mr Fox and Wretch 32. Apparently not \u2013 we&apos;ve been systematic in stemming the emergence of new talent and are generally guilty of making life more difficult for more young people than anyone this side of Nick Clegg.

Or it could just be Io Echo on the stereo. They&apos;ve got a rumbling, booming sound, see. In fact, it&apos;s almost onomatopoeic, reverberating with memories of goth bands past and hints of goth acts present. Their name may bring to your mind, in a Proustian rush, Echo and the Bunnymen, and that would be appropriate because Io Echo, like the Bunnymen before them, manage to write catchy pop songs and imbue them with a sense of darkness, of the murky and mystical, and a rhythmical, almost tribal, intensity. And you can quote us on that. There is also lots of echo \u2013 and delay and reverb \u2013 in their music. But as with Niki and the Dove, the female vocals add melody just when the noise becomes too strident. They&apos;re a good balance, are the Io Echo pair.

Well, of course they have (paging the legions of the dispossessed).

(C) Current bilateral cooperation on arms control, nonproliferation and export control is &quot;remarkable,&quot; MFA Department of Arms Control Director General Cheng Jingye told Staffdel Januzzi March 24. Nevertheless, there is a &quot;perception&quot; that the United States counts on China&apos;s support on nonproliferation issues but does not fully trust China as an equal partner. On Iran, China supports a dual approach which includes applying pressure via Security Council resolutions and focusing on the diplomatic front. China&apos;s cooperation with Iran on energy is unrelated to the Iran nuclear issue and Cheng &quot;can&apos;t imagine&quot; the consequences if Sinopec is sanctioned. On North Korea, Cheng urged the United States to find a creative resolution to the declaration issue. End Summary. 2. (C) Frank Januzzi and Puneet Talwar, staff members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met MFA Department of Arms Control Director General Cheng Jingye March 24 to discuss Chinese views on arms control, non-proliferation, Iran and North Korea. &quot;Remarkable&quot; Cooperation ------------------------ 3. (C) Arms control, export controls and nonproliferation all contribute to China&apos;s security, said Cheng. A decade ago, cooperation between China and the United States focused on certain cases, but today&apos;s level of cooperation on nonproliferation and arms control issues is &quot;remarkable,&quot; Cheng said. For example, China is actively involved in diplomatic negotiation efforts on North Korea and Iran. And in many areas of nonproliferation, said Cheng, the two countries see &quot;eye-to-eye.&quot; He referred to multilateral agreements such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Australia Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement and said that even if China is not a member of these various organizations, China has in place its own export control regime. For example, there is interagency coordination on sensitive exports as well as alleged proliferation cases raised by the United States. Cheng noted that while the pace of implementing arms control agreements has slowed in the past decade, China is prepared to move the disarmament conference forward within the United Nations framework. Equal Partners -------------- 4. (C) Cheng contended that there is a &quot;perception&quot; that the United States counts on China&apos;s support and cooperation on nonproliferation issues but does not fully trust or treat China as an equal partner. For example, in the 1990s, China was invited to join the MTCR and the Australia Group but declined to join. Currently, however, China is &quot;not welcome,&quot; despite expressing a willingness to join, Cheng said. China and the United States need to cooperate on a &quot;mutual, equal basis.&quot; Cheng also raised the issue of sanctions against China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC). CGWIC has been subject to sanctions for ten years without &quot;solid evidence,&quot; said Cheng. Over the past 3-4 years, CGWIC has restructured the company, changed its business model and prohibited contacts with countries of concern to the United States. Cheng expressed hope that the company would make progress during its March 20 meetings in Washington. Iran ---- 5. (C) Cheng said China and the United States share the same goal for Iran: no further proliferation of nuclear weapons. China makes this point very clearly to the international community and to Iran in the context of its private bilateral contacts. PRC Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told Iranian leaders during his November visit to Iran that China is opposed to proliferation in the Middle East. China supports the UNSCRs on Iran and the P5-plus-1 process, emphasized Cheng. After the release of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) and IAEA reports on Iran last year, there is a need for more diplomatic efforts, Cheng said. China supports a dual approach which includes applying pressure via UNSCRs and focusing on the diplomatic front. 6. (C) One of the dilemmas of the Iran nuclear issue is that despite three UNSCRs, Iran&apos;s capability to enrich uranium BEIJING 00001141 002 OF 002 continues to expand, Cheng underscored. China and other countries need to be &quot;creative&quot; in devising a proposal &quot;attractive&quot; to Iran. The international community must find a way to ensure its concerns about Iran&apos;s nuclear development are addressed and promote the peaceful development of nuclear energy, maintained Cheng. Cheng reasoned that if incentives do not work, then it will make applying pressure easier in the future because it shows that diplomacy was not effective. The P5-plus-1 meeting in Shanghai in April will allow the ministers to discuss strategy on next steps. Cheng noted that a recent proposal from the United Nations Association of the USA (UNA-USA) includes some interesting ideas and that his office is in the process of studying its proposal. Cheng said that Germany has put forward a proposal to &quot;refresh&quot; previous offers. China believes that the P5-plus-1 will need to offer new incentives to Iran. 7. (C) Iran might be more willing to offer a reciprocal positive gesture on the nuclear issue if it does not feel threatened by regime change, Cheng said. Regarding Iran&apos;s claim that it did not have a nuclear program prior to 2003, China is not in a position to comment without presentation of evidence and materials, Cheng said. China continues to urge Iran to cooperate with the IAEA and encourages the IAEA to play a greater role. Cheng also discussed possible incentives for Iran after international confidence is restored, including reinstatement as a non-nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) member, education cooperation, normalization of economic relations, etc. China-Iran Energy Cooperation ----------------------------- 8. (C) Regarding China-Iran energy cooperation, Cheng believes that there is a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; on the part of the United States. China has made clear its need for energy resources and has previously stated that its cooperation with Iran on energy has nothing to do with the Iran nuclear issue. China hopes that the U.S. Congress understands this point, said Cheng. Specifically, the threat of sanctions against Sinopec is a very serious issue, Cheng emphasized. Sinopec is very important to China and Cheng &quot;can&apos;t imagine&quot; the consequences if the company is sanctioned. Januzzi noted Cheng&apos;s concerns and said that he would pass this message to Washington. North Korea ----------- 9. (C) Januzzi recounted his meetings with DPRK counterparts during his five-day trip to North Korea and said that he encouraged them to provide a declaration. Cheng said that China does not have specific information on North Korea&apos;s alleged purchase of centrifuge technology and that China had received this information from the United States. He urged the United States to focus on the future and not to dwell on the past. The United States is not interested in delving into North Korea&apos;s past, Januzzi countered. The United States needs to have clarity on certain issues, however, in order to move forward. According to Cheng, PRC Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei urged the DPRK to take advantage of this unique opportunity. The resolution of the declaration issue will require some imagination and creativity, Cheng said. North Korea does not fully trust the United States and remains concerned about admitting to an activity it claims never existed, Cheng claimed. 10. (U) Staffdel Januzzi did not have an opportunity to clear this cable.

MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons and do not want North Korea to collapse. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad than a North Korea that has collapsed. MM Lee asked Deputy Chief of the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma&apos;s answer was that &quot;they can survive on their own.&quot; The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well &quot;go nuclear.&quot; MM Lee also offered views on the Chinese economy, Taiwan, Chinese leaders, and U.S.-China relations. End Summary. China and North Korea --------------------- 4. (S) Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on May 30 on the margins of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual international security forum held in Singapore. The Deputy Secretary used the meeting with MM Lee to stress the importance of Chinese cooperation in addressing the North Korea nuclear issue and to elicit MM Lee&apos;s views on China and North Korea. MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Chinese do not want North Korea, which China sees as a buffer state, to collapse. The ROK would take over in the North and China would face a U.S. presence at its border. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad for China than a North Korea that has collapsed, he stated. 5. (S) MM Lee said he asked Deputy Chief of the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma&apos;s Delphic answer was that &quot;they can survive on their own.&quot; MM Lee said he interpreted this as meaning that even if China cut off aid, the DPRK leadership would survive. This is a leadership that has already taken actions like killing ROK Cabinet Members in Burma and shooting down a KAL flight. If they lose power, they will end up facing justice at The Hague, like Milosevic. They have been so isolated for so long that they have no friends, not even Russia. They have not trusted China since the Chinese began cultivating ties with the ROK, given China&apos;s interest in attracting foreign investment, he said. The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee expressed worry about the effect on Iran if the DPRK persists. MM Lee said he believes the DPRK can be contained and will not proliferate, but Iran has very high ambitions, ties to Shiite communities outside Iran, and oil wealth. 6. (S) The Deputy Secretary noted that North Korea&apos;s decisions will have an impact in Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well &quot;go nuclear.&quot; The Chinese must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of Japan with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing North Korea as a buffer state. The Chinese take a long-term view and must think that within a few years the DPRK&apos;s current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership, with new thinking. But there will still be a North Korea, he said. 7. (S) MM Lee said he wishes the USG well in its efforts on North Korea, but he would be surprised if the North Koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons. They might give up a first-strike capacity, but they want nuclear weapons in case the USG decides to seek regime change. They are psychopathic types, with a &quot;flabby old chap&quot; for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation. MM Lee noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of Japanese occupation in Singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food, clothing and medicine. 8. (S) MM Lee said the ROK, after seeing what had happened with German unification, does not want immediate unification with the DPRK. There is &quot;nothing there&quot; in the DPRK, other than a military organization. Kim Jong-Il has already had a stroke. It is just a matter of time before he has another stroke. The next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather. He may not be prepared to see people die like flies. China is calculating all this. They have their best men on the job. They want to help the United States to advance common objectives. But they do not want the South to take over the North, MM Lee said. Chinese Economy --------------- 9. (C) Regarding the Chinese economy, MM Lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries, but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place. The Chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums, but when MM Lee visited Jiangsu Province on May 24, his impression was one of continued prosperity. Shanghai has been harder hit, with container port traffic down 30-35 percent, similar to the situation in Singapore. There is no sign of deep unrest in China. The Chinese are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth. The government is pumping resources into the economy, with a focus on developing Western China. Whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear, but China can certainly sustain these policies for at least a year, he said. 10. (C) MM Lee stated that in the absence of a social safety net in China, the Chinese savings rate is 55 percent, exceeding even Singapore&apos;s 50 percent level. Consumption accounts for only 35 percent of Chinese GDP, as opposed to 70 percent of U.S. GDP. The Chinese leadership may be loath to shift permanently to a more consumption-oriented economy, but the leadership will do so temporarily, if only to avoid unrest. 20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations. The government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition. The pragmatists are in charge. There is nothing Communist about it. They just want to preserve one party rule. The Deputy Secretary expressed concern that current Chinese policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform. MM Lee said this cannot be helped. China wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in Guangzhou in March when Hong Kong-connected enterprises suddenly shut down, he said. Taiwan ------ 11. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked MM Lee for his assessment of Taiwan. MM Lee said former President Chen Shui-bian had left Taiwan in a weak economic position, which had enabled President Ma Ying-Jeou to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with China. In Beijing, former President Jiang Zemin was wedded to his eight-point approach, but President Hu Jintao was more flexible. Jiang wanted to show he was a great man by solving the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, but Hu is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline. In Chinese domestic politics, Hu had wanted Vice Premier Li Keqiang from the Communist Youth League to emerge as his successor, not Vice President Xi Jinping, but Hu did his calculations and accepted Xi when it became clear that Xi had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership. Similarly, on Taiwan, Hu will be pragmatic. It does not matter to Hu if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30. The key is building links with Taiwan. As in the case of Hong Kong, if necessary the tap could be turned off, he said. 12. (C) In this context, MM Lee said, Hu could live with Ma&apos;s positions on the &apos;92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office. What mattered to Hu was that Taiwan not seek independence. If that happened, China has 1,000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the U.S. fleet at a distance. The implicit question for Taiwan&apos;s leaders is if that is what they want, MM Lee said. 13. (C) MM Lee stated that the alternative is Mainland investment in Taiwan stocks and property. The Mainland has already assured Hong Kong that it will help out economically. The Mainland has not said this to Taiwan, but the Mainland&apos;s Taiwan Affairs Director, Wang Yi, did urge Chinese companies to invest in Taiwan. In four years Taiwan&apos;s economy will pick up and Ma will win re-election. The DPP lacks strong potential candidates. Su Zhen-chang is promising, but seems unlikely to be able to win. Meanwhile, even the traditionally DPP-supporting farmers in Taiwan&apos;s South need China&apos;s market for vegetables and other products. Taiwan&apos;s continued participation in the World Health Assembly depends on Beijing. Beijing&apos;s calculation seems to be to prevent Taiwan independence in the near term, then bring Taiwan &quot;back to China,&quot; even if it takes 40 or 50 years. MM Lee said he is looking forward to visiting Fujian Province, where preparations are underway for a new southern economic area linked with Taiwan. Xi Jinping ---------- 14. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked if in the future a leader like Xi Jinping would continue the policies on Taiwan followed by Hu Jintao. MM Lee responded affirmatively. Xi is a princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated. When the party needed his talents, Xi was brought in as Shanghai Party Secretary. Xi is seen as a Jiang Zemin protege, but in another three and a half years Jiang&apos;s influence will be gone. The focus now is on maintaining the system. There are no more strongmen like Deng Xiaoping. Jiang did not like Hu, but could not stop him, because Hu had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes. Wang Qishan ----------- 15. (C) MM Lee said Vice Premier Wang Qishan, whom the MM saw in connection with celebrations in May of the 15th anniversary of Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park, is an exceptional talent, very assured and efficient. Wang handled SARS superbly when he was in Hainan. He excelled in coordinating the Beijing Olympics. Li Keqiang may not get the Premiership and the Party is looking for a way to keep Wang on past his 65th birthday until he is 70. MM Lee said he had met first Wang back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting. This time when they met, Wang told Lee he had reviewed the records of all Lee&apos;s meeting with Chinese leaders going back to the days of Deng Xiaoping to see how Lee&apos;s thinking had developed. Wang told Lee he respects him as a consistent man. China&apos;s Rise ------------ 16. (C) MM Lee said China is following an approach consistent with ideas in the Chinese television series &quot;The Rise of Great Powers.&quot; The mistake of Germany and Japan had been their effort to challenge the existing order. The Chinese are not stupid; they have avoided this mistake. China&apos;s economy has surpassed other countries, with the exceptions of Japan and the United States. Even with those two countries, the gap is closing, with China growing at seven-nine percent annually, versus two-three percent in the United States and Japan. Overall GDP, not GDP per capita, is what matters in terms of power. China has four times the population of the United States. China is active in Latin America, Africa, and in the Gulf. Within hours, everything that is discussed in ASEAN meetings is known in Beijing, given China&apos;s close ties with Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, he stated. 17. (C) MM Lee said China will not reach the American level in terms of military capabilities any time soon, but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter U.S. military power. China understands that its growth depends on imports, including energy, raw materials, and food. This is why China is working with South Africa on the China-Africa Development Fund. China also needs open sea lanes. Beijing is worried about its dependence on the Strait of Malacca and is moving to ease the dependence by means like a pipeline through Burma. Build Ties with Young Chinese ----------------------------- 18. (C) MM Lee said the best course for the United States on China is to build ties with China&apos;s young people. China&apos;s best and brightest want to study in the United States, with the UK as the next option, then Japan. While they are there, it is important that they be treated as equals, with the cultural support they may need as foreigners. Why not have International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs for China? Why not have Chinese cadets at West Point alongside Vietnamese cadets and Indian cadets? America&apos;s advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world, as in Silicon Valley. China still tends to try to keep the foreigners in Beijing and Shanghai. MM Lee noted that his own experience as a student in the UK had left him with an enduring fondness for the UK. When he spent two months at Harvard in 1968, an American professor had invited him home for Thanksgiving. This was not the sort of thing that happened in the UK, and Lee had realized he was dealing with a different civilization. In the future, China&apos;s leaders will have PhDs and MBAs from American universities, he predicted. 19. (U) The Deputy Secretary has cleared this message.

It includes verdicts on the first batch of revelations from a very eclectic cast of characters including: Sarah Palin; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Hillary Clinton, and a Today programme ding-dong between Sir Christopher Meyer and Alan Rusbridger.  7.34am: The rest of the British media wasn&apos;t that interested in WikiLeaks disclosures yesterday. But that&apos;s all changed today now that royalty is involved.       The Daily Mirror&apos;s front page describes Prince Andrew as the Duke of Yuk (left), the Sun calls him the Tirade Envoy.  The Daily Mail goes with Exposed: Andrew&apos;s 4-letter Tirade; and the Telegraph leads with &quot;Duke raged at &apos;idiocy&apos; of fraud inquiry&quot;  (though its web version of the story has slightly different headline). Inside the Telegraph devotes four news pages to following-up the WikiLeaks and Guardian disclosures, but its comment pages are sniffy about the exercise. &quot;The mass release of American diplomatic cables by the WikiLeaks website has, so far, generated a great deal of heat but not a lot of light,&quot; its editorial says. It also carries a scathing opinion piece from the former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, now chairman of the intelligence and security committee.   It is too early to say precisely what damage the WikiLeaks revelations will do. Many of us suspected that Arab leaders were even more alarmed than the West at the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. It does not surprise me that they would be supportive of a military attack if all other pressures fail. The fact that this is now public may bring home to the international community and, in particular, Russia and China, that the UN Security Council must agree very heavy sanctions and pressure on Iran if the whole Middle East is not going to be disrupted by conflict. But regardless of whether the spotlight of unauthorised publicity might, occasionally, help rather than hinder, the deliberate leaking of sensitive dispatches and diplomatic cables is highly damaging in what is already a very dangerous world.   8.07am: Most of the last night&apos;s BBC Newsnight programme was devoted to WikiLeaks.  It included some interesting comments on the Duke of York from Labour MP John Mann. He suggested that the Prince might have to resign as trade ambassador.  If these comments by Prince Andrew are accurate - and of course we don&apos;t know that yet - then clearly it&apos;s of public interest that they are out there, so that he can judge whether he is performing the role well and government can make that judgment as well. Prince Andrew will need to think through if he is actually carrying out this role to the best of his abilities.   8.43am: Former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind said China will be &quot;very very angry&quot; with the disclosures on China&apos;s possible new stance on North Korea. &quot;And rightly so,&quot; he told Today programme.      Malcolm Rifkind MP Photograph: Guardian    &quot;The tragedy of these WikiLeaks is that if China is contemplating a historic change in its attitude to North Korea and possibly support for reunification, this premature revelation ... will have put that back by years. That shows the damage that can be done by unauthorised leaks from private conversations.&quot;  He said the documents on Korea, and the cables yesterday about Saudi Arabia&apos;s desire to attack Iran, should only have been available to handful of senior officials. &quot;Clearly they [the Americans] lost control of the system,&quot; he said.  On Prince Andrew&apos;s comments Rifkind said they were &quot;very unwise remarks to make&quot;. But he said he should carry on as trade envoy. &quot;He is an extremely good trade representative. He has always been known to be a blunt speaker,&quot; he said.      Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    8.44am: Over to Tania Branigan in Beijing where Chinese officials have been making their first comments on the leaked cables.   Beijing called on the US to &quot;properly handle&quot; the emergence of the diplomatic cables, but sought to play down the issue in its first response to the release. Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a regular press briefing: &quot;We do not want to see any disturbance in China-US relations.&quot; But he declined to comment on any of the issues raised in the documents. Asked whether Beijing believed that North Korea had behaved &quot;like a spoilt child&quot; \u2013 as a senior official remarked, according to one of the cables - Hong replied: &quot;China takes note of the leaked reports. We hope the US side will properly handle the relevant issues. As for the content of the documents, we do not comment on that.&quot;    9.13am: The chairman of North Korea&apos;s Supreme People&apos;s Assembly, Choe Thae Bok, arrived in Beijing today for a five-day visit, according to AP. He was summoned by China to discuss the current tension in the peninsula after the North unleashed a fiery artillery barrage on a South Korean island. They have lots to talk about, but don&apos;t expect any leaked cables from that visit.  9.31am: The New York Times trawl for latest leaks reveals the extraordinary horse trading between the US and its allies over the fate of Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoners. Slovenia was promised more &quot;high-level attention&quot; if it helped with detainees; the Maldives said it would accept prisoners in return US help in getting IMF loans; and the Pacific nation Kiribati was offered $3m to take 17 Chinese detainees.  There&apos;s lots more including details a suggestion by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to implant electronic chips in the detainees.  9.55am: There&apos;s no mention of Ecuador in the haggling over Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoners. But according to Al Jazeera, Ecuador has offered residence to someone to another US problem - Julian Assange. &quot;We are ready to give him residence in Ecuador, with no problems and no conditions,&quot; Kintto Lucas, the deputy foreign minister, said.  &quot;We are going to invite him to come to Ecuador so he can freely present the information he possesses and all the documentation, not just over the internet but in a variety of public forums.&quot; There&apos;s more in Spanish on the Ecuador news site Ecuadorinmediato.com  10.15am: Pentagon papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg has defended the release of the cables.  Asked on CNN&apos;s Larry King show about Hillary Clinton&apos;s condemnation of the WikiLeaks, Ellsberg said &quot;There hasn&apos;t been a secretary of state who wouldn&apos;t have said exactly the same thing about the Pentagon papers.  &quot;I&apos;m sure in America they see Julian Assange as the most dangerous man. A truth teller is potentially very embarrassing.&quot; Saving diplomats embarrassment was not enough of an excuse to withhold the information, he said.  10.34am: Gordon Brown a made personal request to allow the hacker Gary McKinnon to serve a sentence in the UK, but the request was rejected by the US, the latest disclosure shows.     'Super hacker' Gary McKinnon    Here&apos;s the relevant document.  Louis Susman, the current US ambassador to London wrote: &quot;PM Brown, in a one-on-one meeting with the ambassador, proposed a deal: that McKinnon plead guilty, make a statement of contrition, but serve any sentence of incarceration in the UK. Brown cited deep public concern that McKinnon, with his medical condition, would commit suicide or suffer injury if imprisoned in a US facility.&quot; The ambassador says he sought to raise Brown&apos;s request in Washington with Obama&apos;s newly appointed attorney general, Eric Holder. But the plea got nowhere.   11.19am: NATO has joined the international condemnation of WikiLeaks after leaked cables revealed the European countries hosting US nuclear weapons. NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu described the disclosures as &quot;illegal and dangerous.&quot; One of cables revealed that US nuclear weapons still left in Europe are based in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Turkey. The four nations have been long suspected of hosting the warheads, but NATO and the governments involved have always refused to confirm this. If you haven&apos;t seen it this seems a good moment to look at Steve Bell&apos;s cartoon today. There&apos;s more on Bell brilliance on his noisy website.     Copyright \u00a9 Steve Bell 2010     11.34am: Downing Street just told lobby journalists that the government&apos;s position on the extradition of Gary McKinnon has not changed. We don&apos;t quite know what its position is - the Cameron government has failed to announce whether or not it will comply with continued US demands to hand over McKinnon after he hacked into their government computers.  12.01pm: Time for a summary:      \u2022 The latest released cables show that US spurned British attempts to allow the computer hacker Gary McKinnon to serve sentence in UK. McKinnon&apos;s mother is appearing before the home affairs select committee.\u2022 Malcolm Rifkind, former foreign secretary and chairman of the intelligence and security committee, said the leaks could scupper China&apos;s apparent support for a reunified Korea. Speaking on the Today programme he also described Prince Andrew&apos;s rude comments about journalists, the French and fraud investigators as &quot;very unwise remarks to make&quot;.\u2022 In an interview with Forbes magazine Wikileaks founder Julian Assange revealed that his next target for documents disclosures will be a large US bank. &quot;A major American bank will suddenly find itself turned inside out,&quot; it said.\u2022 In its first comments on the leaks, China called on the US to &quot;properly handle&quot; the emergence of the cables. Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a regular press briefing: &quot;We do not want to see any disturbance in China-US relations.&quot; (8.44am)  12.11pm: Janis Sharp, Gary McKinnon&apos;s mother, said she was &quot;very surprised and very pleased&quot; to hear that Gordon Brown had tried to bargain with the Americans in an attempt to avoid his extradition.  &quot;I wish I had known about that, because he [Brown] would have been given credit for it,&quot; she told the home affairs select committee.  She also criticised the Americans for refusing to budge. &quot;They know this is a difficult decision for this government and yet they did not want to give leeway,&quot; she said. &quot;The fact that people at the top are so intransigent, I find difficult to understand... I believe America wants Gary as an example of computer crime.&quot;       12.20pm: Our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis reports on the reaction in France, where Le Monde has been poring over the cables.  Le Monde is preparing to release documents relating to France in the coming days. The paper said these will give US view of Paris&apos;s anti-terrorism policy, Washington&apos;s interpretation of the suburb riots of 2005 and France-US relations. Today the paper&apos;s website has explored French negotiations over taking former Guant\u00e1namo Bay bay detainees. It says Sarkozy&apos;s government was keen to make a gesture to help the Obama administration in order to improve Paris-Washington relations. But the French media, left and right, today slammed the publication by the Guardian and others of the US embassy cables. The right-wing Le Figaro, close to the French government, ran an editorial entitled &quot;The tyranny of transparency&quot; saying: &quot;The massive diffusion of secret documents belonging to American diplomacy is an act of malice, about which it would be very na\u00efve to rejoice.&quot; The left-wing Lib\u00e9ration warned that &quot;in a world of violent conflict&quot;, states had a &quot;right&quot; to their secrets, adding that the private positions so-far revealed were little different from what the governments were saying in public. The Socialist party was as critical of the leaks as Sarkozy&apos;s right-wing UMP party. The socialist Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis complained of &quot;the tyranny of transparency with no limits&quot; . Socialist spokesman Beno\u00eet Hamon said he was &quot;not really in favour&quot; of the publication of the cables.  Josselin de Rohan, the UMP head of the foreign affairs commission in the French senate, said the publication was &quot;very serious&quot; and raised questions of blackmail and voluntary disinformation: &quot;I think we&apos;ve gone over the boundary here of what&apos;s possible in the domain of information.&quot;  Francois Baroin, budget minister and government spokesman, told Europe1 radio, &quot;I always thought a transparent society would be a totalitarian society.&quot; He said Sarkozy thought the leaks were &quot;irresponsible to the last degree&quot;.    12.32pm: Saeed Kamali Dehghan has more on the Iranian reaction to the cables.        In Iran the release of the cables has been overshadowed by the assassination of two nuclear scientists. But today opposition websites started covering the leaks more widely.  The disclosure in a 2009 diplomatic cable that the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has terminal cancer has attracted attention. Nikahang Kowsar, a prominent Iranian cartoonist, based in Canada, suggested that Hashemi Rafsanjani, an influential Iranian cleric thought to be sympathetic to the opposition, could be his successor. Rafsanjani is dipicted sitting on a egg timer next to an ailing Khamenei. Another cartoon by Kowsar picks up the view of the Saudi Arabia&apos;s King Abdullah that Ahmadinejad is the head of a snake that needs cutting off.  The foreign-based Iranian opposition websites have also focused on the revelations that Iranian parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, was aware of rape and sexual assaults in Kahrizak detention centre in the aftermath of Iran&apos;s disputed election in 2009.  Yesterday, Ahmadinejad dismissed the leaks as part of US psychological warfare. It was a theme taken up today by Iran&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast. IRNA, Iran&apos;s state news agency, quoted him saying &quot;As the president stated yesterday, this action is very dubious and it should not be taken seriously.&quot;  He added: &quot;They [Wikileaks cables] were revealed in order to create quarrels between countries, they want to create an Iranophobia between nations.&quot;  12.56pm: WikiLeaks says its website is being subjected to another distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack. A similar claim on Sunday set a number of hares running, but it turned out to be the work of one hacker called Jester or the3j35t3r, according to the Tech site Mashable.  1.09pm: Business secretary Vince Cable has chirped on the Prince Andrew front. He said anti-corruption policy is &quot;not a matter&quot; for the Duke of York and he should stop talking about it. Speaking to Sky News Cable said it would be &quot;helpful&quot; if he the prince steered clear of policy issues. &quot;But his contribution is a very positive one and I want to encourage him to continue to make it,&quot; he diplomatically added.  1.27pm: The German magazine Der Spiegel provided a teaser of what some of the documents will say about Kenya. &quot;Viewed through the eyes of the US diplomats, entire states -Kenya for example - appear as mires of corruption,&quot; it said. It added: &quot;Almost every single sentence in the embassy reports speaks with disdain of the government of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga.&quot; Alfred Mutua, Kenyan government spokesman, delivered an angry response. &quot;If what is reported is true, it is totally malicious, and a total misrepresentation of our country,&quot; he told a press conference, recorded by Capital FM Kenya.  &quot;True friends should tell you the truth all the time and should not tell you that everything is OK on one hand, and on the other say the opposite.&quot; The spokesman also revealed that the US government had apologised.              1.51pm: There&apos;s been more response to Gordon Brown&apos;s failed bargaining with the Americans over Gary McKinnon. Shami Chakrabarti, of Liberty, said:   While it is to Brown&apos;s credit that he pleaded with the US on behalf of Gary McKinnon, [Tony] Blair&apos;s shame is that the rights of people in Britain were signed away and left to special secret pleadings instead of law. No one should be sent anywhere without evidence in a local court and where justice and mercy suggest dealing with them at home.  Former home secretary David Blunkett told the home affairs select committee that he knew about Brown&apos;s appeal to the US at the time.  I remember discussing it with (current Justice Secretary) Ken Clarke in a private meeting that it would be a really good idea for this case not to end up being a political football. Although the [extradition] treaty itself is not responsible for the immediate removal of Gary... there was an issue for senior politicians to make representations.   2.08pm: Two US foreign affairs commentators Eli Lake, from the Washington Times and Daniel Drezner, from Foreign Policy, launch into a lively discussion about the disclosures on Bloggingheads TV. Lake says the cables reveal that Arab leaders are much more bullish about Iran than Israel. They go on to discuss whether suspected leaker Bradley Manning is a traitor or whistle blower. Drezner says that journalists are better at handling this kind of information than Julian Assange.       2.16pm: The US embassy cables story gets the bizarre news animation treatment from Taiwan&apos;s NMA. Taste alert: it includes Uncle Sam taking biometrical details from a UN official in a toilet bowl. And Messrs Sarkozy, Putin, and Gaddafi are not spared.              3.03pm: This is handy - a country guide to the main WikiLeaks revelations, from Reuters. It is likely to get fuller over the next few days.  3.21pm: The American Shanghai-based writer Adam Minter seizes on a tantalising looking cable suggestion corruption in China. It claims that a payment of $10,000 was offered to secure the support of premier Wen Jiabao for a mining contract for a North Korean copper mine.  But Minter says the cable reveals more about US diplomatic ignorance than corrupt practices in China.   Now, you don&apos;t need to know anything about graft in China, much less world leaders, or Wen Jiabao, to know that $10,000 not only wouldn&apos;t get the job done, it&apos;d be viewed as an insult and an automatic disqualification from this any other mining contract. So I&apos;m going to go out on a limb here: there&apos;s simply no way that happened. None. Zero. Zilch. Now, is it possible that Wen has a &quot;relationship&quot; with Wanxiang? Sure. But not the one described in the cable. And this gets to something that I think is going to become increasingly, uncomfortably obvious as more and more of these cables are released: US State Department employees in overseas posts often don&apos;t know very much about the countries in which they&apos;re posted  .  3.25pm: Blimey: Chinese officials have confirmed to Simon Tisdall that China does want to see an &quot;independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula&quot;. So much for Malcolm Rifkind&apos;s fear that the Chinese would row back on that one.      That&apos;s it from me. The charming Richard Adams is about to breeze in from Washington.       3.40pm: Thank you Matthew and good morning from a damp Washington, where the US&apos;s bloggers and other media are still transitioning from their knee-jerk &quot;this is old news&quot; response to deciding that there is in fact some hot stuff amongst the cables. The Washington Post&apos;s neo-conservative leader writers today dismiss the cables as &quot;embarrassing to their authors or subjects, but otherwise harmless&quot;, and save their attention for how the leak happened in the first place:  Of course there must not be firewalls that prevent senior intelligence analysts and their bosses from seeing and sharing sensitive information. That does not mean a troubled 22-year-old in Baghdad should have access to secret State Department cables from all over the world. Surely there is a way to create a system that can do the former while preventing the latter.   3.58pm: Former senator Rick Santorum \u2013 best known for his ferocious opposition to homosexuality \u2013 is one of the dozens of Republicans who fancy being president \u2013 and he used a trip to New Hampshire, the birthplace of presidential ambition, to denounce WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange:  &quot;We haven&apos;t gone after this guy, we haven&apos;t tried to prosecute him, we haven&apos;t gotten our allies to go out and lock this guy up and bring him up on terrorism charges. What he&apos;s doing is terrorism, in my opinion.&quot;   4.05pm: From one pole of US politics (Santorum) to another: Noam Chomsky, speaking to Democracy Now!, says that while the cables reveal Arab leaders urging the United States to attack Iran, opinion polls in the region tell a different story:  What this reveals is the profound hatred for democracy on the part of our political leadership.  The Democracy Now! site reminds us that back in 1971, Chomsky helped whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg release the Pentagon Papers \u2013 and Ellsberg popped up on television last night to defend WikiLeaks, as mentioned below at 10.15am.  4.26pm: While there&apos;s a lot of talk about the damage these cables might do, NBC&apos;s Michael Isikoff has highlighted a case where the leaked information will be used as &quot;a recruiting and propaganda tool&quot; by al-Qaida. This is the revelation that the Yemeni government covered up the American role in missile strikes that killed 41 civilians, including 14 women and 21 children. Isikoff reports:  &quot;President Saleh&apos;s comments will be translated and used over and over again by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as a recruiting and propaganda tool,&quot; Gregory Johnsen, a leading U.S. expert on the terror organization&apos;s Yemeni affiliate, told NBC on Monday. &quot;His statements and those of his top ministers of deceiving and lying to the Yemeni public and parliament \u2026 fit seamlessly into a narrative that AQAP has been peddling in Yemen for years. This is something AQAP will take immediate and lasting advantage of.&quot;   Isikof also points out that Amnesty International issued a report on the bombing earlier this year, with evidence of US involvement that has now been proved beyond doubt, thanks to the leak of the cables.             4.42pm: Meanwhile, former president Jimmy Carter popped up on MSNBC last night to dispute Hillary Clinton&apos;s claim that the US embassy cables had hurt international diplomacy:  &quot;I don&apos;t agree with Secretary Clinton that it&apos;s that significant it has torn up the fabric for our diplomacy,&quot; Carter said. &quot;In the future, there&apos;s going to be a lot more caution as leaders send them dispatches into the State Department and as our own ambassadors send reports back into the State Department if they suspect that their words might be revealed.&quot;   5pm: The US right is egging each other on into making ever more audacious demands about what the US government should do to both WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. Here&apos;s the latest from neo-con and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol:  Why can&apos;t we act forcefully against WikiLeaks? Why can&apos;t we use our various assets to harass, snatch or neutralize Julian Assange and his collaborators, wherever they are? Why can&apos;t we disrupt and destroy WikiLeaks in both cyberspace and physical space, to the extent possible? Why can&apos;t we warn others of repercussions from assisting this criminal enterprise hostile to the United States?   5.24pm: Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security advisor under Jimmy Carter, is more concerned about the US embassy cables than his old boss. Speaking to PBS News, Brzezinski also sees more sinister forces at work than just a leak coming from one member of the armed forces, and suggests a larger conspiracy theory:  It&apos;s, rather, a question of whether WikiLeaks are being manipulated by interested parties that want to either complicate our relationship with other governments or want to undermine some governments, because some of these items that are being emphasized and have surfaced are very pointed. And I wonder whether, in fact, there aren&apos;t some operations internationally, intelligence services, that are feeding stuff to WikiLeaks, because it is a unique opportunity to embarrass us, to embarrass our position, but also to undermine our relations with particular governments.   5.40pm: Yesterday the Washington Post&apos;s editor Marcus Brauchli was heard complaining that his newspaper wasn&apos;t offered a first look at the US embassy cables by WikiLeaks \u2013 and today the paper devotes more than four pages of broadsheet to the topic, and this media analysis of who got what and when.       5.49pm: My colleague Ewen MacAskill has unearthed this nugget from the files of cables \u2013 praise from a US ambassador for Moazzam Begg, the former British Guant\u00e1namo detainee, in an ironic turn of events:  Cynthia Stroum, ambassador to Luxembourg, acknowledges the irony of lavishing praise on Begg, who was alleged by the US to have been an instructor at an al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan. In a cable labelled &quot;To Hell and Back: Gitmo ex-detainee stumps in Luxembourg&quot;, Stroum wrote that Begg was &quot;barnstorming&quot; through Europe. In January this year, he met the Luxembourg government and spoke at a public meeting. &quot;Mr Begg is doing our work for us and his articulate, reasoned presentation makes for a convincing argument. It is ironic that after four years of imprisonment and alleged torture Moazzam Begg is delivering the same demarche to GOL [the government of Luxembourg] as we are: please consider accepting GTMO detainees for resettlement.&quot;  If ever there was a sign of how ludicrous the US policy towards Guant\u00e1namo has been, this is it.      Google China's former headquarters in Beijing. Photograph: Vincent Thian/AP    6.04pm: Now this is interesting: it&apos;s reported by Computerworld that China has blocked internet access to WikiLeaks&apos; US embassy cables:  Access to the WikiLeak&apos;s Cablegate page, as well as certain Chinese language news articles covering the topic, have been blocked in the country since Monday. Other articles from the Chinese press that are accessible on the web appear to only concern the US response.  The main issue is likely to be the revelation that the Chinese government was involved with the hack on Goggle&apos;s servers.      Martin Chulov    6.20pm: The Guardian&apos;s Martin Chulov is in Baghdad and reports from there on the delayed reaction to the US leaks: After a day&apos;s silence, Iraq has just responded to the US embassy cables. The leaks gave the Government a lot to reflect on \u2013 especially about the establishment&apos;s links to Iran and about how much influence the US has in vetting Iranian visitors. Prime Minister Nour al-Maliki felt the blowtorch of the Saudis and Americans in the cables, especially about his links to Tehran. But it was left to Foreign Minister, Hoshyer Zebari, a Washington chum, to defend the Government&apos;s honour. Zebari denied that Iraq hands the name of would-be Iranian visitors to the Americans before granting visas, saying their own spooks do the vetting themselves. He also downplayed the influence of the Kaiser S\u00f6ze of the Middle East, Qassem Suleimani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guards&apos; al-Quds force, claiming he is just a regular guy. (Iraqi MPs have been known to tremble at the mention of the man). That should keep the neighbours happy.  6.34pm: Fast Company gives us a &quot;word cloud&quot; of one tranche of the cables:     US embassy cables word cloud from Fast Company    Kit Eaton of Fast Company writes:  Guess what word is most on the minds of US diplomats in 2010? Yup \u2013 Iran. &quot;Iranian&quot; is prominent in the mix too as is &quot;nuclear,&quot; which should explain the interest. Fascinatingly &quot;Turkey&quot; is more prominent than &quot;Afghanistan,&quot; possibly due to the country&apos;s key location in supporting US and Nato operations in both theaters of conflict.   6.53pm: Historian James Mann writes in the New Republic that the US embassy cable leaks won&apos;t be the death of diplomacy:  So, while the cables released by Wikileaks will give new meaning to the words &quot;modern history,&quot; and, while we now know more than we ever did before about the State Department&apos;s recent diplomacy, it&apos;s also worth remembering that State Department cables don&apos;t contain everything. And, yes, there will still be secrets in the future.        7.22pm: Incoming news from the Guardian&apos;s David Leigh, with cables showing that American and British diplomats fear Pakistan&apos;s nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists, aided by members of the Pakistan government, or lead to a devastating nuclear exchange with India:  The latest cache of US embassy cables released by WikiLeaks contains warnings that Pakistan is rapidly building its nuclear stockpile despite the country&apos;s growing instability and &quot;pending economic catastrophe&quot;.   7.32pm: Those wanting to hear more from the Guardian&apos;s David Leigh \u2013 such as Prince Andrew \u2013 can listen to David&apos;s appearance on Democracy Now!, in which he says there&apos;s much, much more to come.  7.50pm: In a slight change of pace, the Washington City Paper&apos;s Moe Tkacik has been closely following the WikiLeaks saga and is interested in how much US press coverage has been on the issues raised by the content of the leaks, and how much is about the flotsam surrounding it:  But before the latest document dump it appeared that a grand total of three stories, comprising 4108 words of the 35,662 words of 2010 [Washington] Post stories about which Wikileaks was the primary focus, actually required anything approaching a close read of any of the Wikileaked documents.   8.06pm: Perhaps the best piece of media analysis of the US embassy cable release has come from Politico&apos;s Keach Hagey, a must-read if you are interested in the nuts and bolts:  Such collaboration by major media organizations across international borders \u2014 both in agreeing to work together in publishing the material and in agreeing what material should be kept out \u2014 is new for journalism. &quot;I know of no international efforts like this, a global kind of collaboration,&quot; said Mark Feldstein, a professor at George Washington University&apos;s School of Media and Public Affairs... &quot;It&apos;s unprecedented and to be commended. The volume of the material that WikiLeaks obtained is unprecedented, so to tackle a subject this complicated is going to take more resources. And just as everything else has gone global \u2013 crime and multinational corporations \u2013 so we are starting to see the beginning of a more global investigative journalism,&quot; he said.   8.21pm: The Associated Press reports that the State Department has pulled out the plug between its classified information network and the rest of the government to avoid any more Wikileaking:  Reeling from disclosures of sensitive diplomatic messages, the State Department has disconnected access to its files from the US government&apos;s classified computer network. The move dramatically reduces the number of employees inside the government who can see important diplomatic messages. A State Department spokesman, PJ Crowley, said the decision was temporary, at least until workers correct what he called &quot;weaknesses in the system that have become evident because of this leak.&quot;       Julian Assange speaks at a press conference in London, September 2010. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images    8.49pm: Time magazine has an interview with the man of the hour, Julian Assange \u2013 and promises to post audio soon. &quot;Speaking over Skype from an undisclosed location on Tuesday,&quot; Time reports, &quot;the WikiLeaks founder was replying to a question by Time Managing Editor Richard Stengel over the diplomatic cable dump Assange&apos;s organization began loosing on the world over the weekend.&quot; Here&apos;s the version Time has posted so far:  Assange said that all the documents were redacted &quot;carefully.&quot; &quot;They are all reviewed and they&apos;re all redacted either by us or by the newspapers concerned,&quot; he said. He added that &quot;we have formally asked the State Department for assistance with that. That request was formally rejected.&quot; Asked what his &quot;moral calculus&quot; is to justify publishing the leaks and whether he considered what he was doing to be &quot;civil disobedience,&quot; Assange said, &quot;Not at all. This organization practices civil obedience, that is, we are an organization that tries to make the world more civil and act against abusive organizations that are pushing it in the opposite direction.&quot;   9.06pm: The Economist is mildly revising its snotty tone over the value of WikiLeaks. Its blogger MS writes:  I think WikiLeaks is an important organisation that&apos;s doing something the world needs. But like other human-rights and humanitarian organisations, such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders and the International Committee of the Red Cross, it needs to lay down some clear, public ethical guidelines about how and why it does what it does. And it needs to bring in a board of directors of people from a wide range of countries, backgrounds and institutions to review the organisation&apos;s conduct on ethical and other grounds.  Yes, a board of directors. That&apos;ll do it. MS ends by asking: &quot;Who&apos;s WikiLeaks? Besides Mr Assange, I don&apos;t know, and they&apos;re not really telling. Do you know? If so, start a wiki about it.&quot; (You mean, like this one?)  9.29pm: The New York Times&apos;s Mark Mazzetti has a cracking piece of embassy cable showing Blackwater&apos;s attempts to get into the pirate-fighting business:  In late 2008, Blackwater Worldwide, already under fire because of accusations of abuses by its security guards in Iraq and Afghanistan, reconfigured a 183-foot oceanographic research vessel into a pirate-hunting ship for hire and then began looking for business from shipping companies seeking protection from Somali pirates. The company&apos;s chief executive officer, Erik Prince, was planning a trip to Djibouti for a promotional event in March 2009, and Blackwater was hoping that the American Embassy there would help out, according to a secret State Department cable.        9.43pm: Micah Sifry (@Mlsif) tweets about an engaging cable from Kazakhstan, where a group of powerful oil executives talk with the US ambassador about corruption, and make a good point:  &quot;If Goldman Sachs executives can make $50 million a year and then run America&apos;s economy in Washington, what&apos;s so different about what we do?&apos; they ask.&quot;   10pm: Lots of new articles coming down the pipeline, any moment now.  10.05pm: Dave Weigel, blogging at Slate, looks at how Republican politicians are using WikiLeaks to indulge their spy-thriller fantasies.  As Republicans come into power, they&apos;re going to explore what can be done. They can&apos;t do much. But let&apos;s be honest. The quest to find some way to define Assange&apos;s group as terrorists is not about fighting terrorism. It&apos;s about indulging the fantasy, well put by Cornell law professor William Jacobson, of Assange being hunted down like a Robert Ludlum villain and possibly &quot;killed while resisting arrest.&quot;   10.18pm: Prince Andrew \u2013 or the Duke of WikiLeaks as he is officially known \u2013 appears again, thanks to the Guardian&apos;s Rob Evans and David Leigh, in this new article:  Prince Andrew used his royal position to demand a special briefing from the Serious Fraud Office weeks before launching a tirade against the agency&apos;s &quot;idiotic&quot; investigators at a lunch with businessmen in Kyrgyzstan.... Soon after, believing he was speaking in private to a group of sympathetic British businessmen, he appeared to condone bribery, and scorned the work of the SFO&apos;s anti-corruption investigators in investigating the Saudi royal family.   10.25pm: This just in: Interpol issues wanted notice for Julian Assange.  Assange&apos;s details were also added to Interpol&apos;s worldwide wanted list. Dated 30 November, the entry reads: &quot;sex crimes&quot; and says the warrant has been issued by the international public prosecution office in Gothenburg, Sweden. &quot;If you have any information contact your national or local police.&quot; It reads: &quot;Wanted: Assange, Julian Paul,&quot; and gives his birthplace as Townsville, Australia.  Here&apos;s a link to the Interpol notice.      Bank of England governor Mervyn King: Cameron and Osborne lacked experience. Photograph: Andrew Winning/Reuters    11.01pm: Here&apos;s the story we&apos;ve been waiting for, and it&apos;s dynamite: the embassy cables reveal that Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, told the US ambassador he thought David Cameron and George Osborne were inexperienced and pushed them hard for spending cuts:  The head of the Bank of England privately criticised David Cameron and George Osborne for their lack of experience, the lack of depth in their inner circle and their tendency to think about issues only in terms of their electoral impact, according to leaked US embassy cables. Mervyn King told the US ambassador, Louis Susman, he had held private meetings with the two Conservative politicians before the election to urge them to draw up a detailed plan to reduce the deficit.   11.14pm: The Guardian&apos;s latest from the US embassy cables also reveal some fascinating facts about British politics:  Internal Tory polling found Osborne lacked gravitas with the public, partly due to his &quot;high-pitched vocal delivery&quot;. As a result, Cameron, not Osborne, made the special address on the economic crisis to the party conference in the autumn of 2008.

The same might sometimes be said about architecture. A decade or so ago, I was on a bus heading north from Shenzen to Guangzhou in southern China when, half asleep, I looked out of the steamed-up windows and saw what seemed to be the Palace of Westminster. I asked the bus driver to stop, which he kindly did. I rubbed my eyes. It was a block of newly built concrete flats tricked up to look like Barry and Pugin&apos;s neo-Gothic masterpiece, complete with clock tower. What I found out later, from architects in Guangzhou, was that a number of Chinese practices employed students to scan images of famous buildings, old and new, into their design software and build them afresh. The results were comic-book versions of buildings from Europe and the United States dotted across the new map of capitalist China. Ten years makes a big difference. In last week&apos;s Building magazine (paywall), David Matthews reports on a form of copying that has far more serious implications \u2013 not just for the art of architecture, but its practice, business and profession. Matthews reveals that at least two prominent British practices have been hit by a wave of identity theft at the hands of Chinese impostors, which have cloned their websites and submitted bids for building projects under their names. Broadway Malyan, a firm with offices in 13 cities worldwide including Shanghai, is one such practice. Aedas, which has offices in Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai and Shenyang, is the victim of a similar fraud. &quot;We had a company that took the trouble of registering in the UK,&quot; says David Roberts, the chief executive of Aedas in Asia. &quot;They took information from our website and bid for projects. They had been submitting bids mainly for government projects before we found out.&quot; While Aedas was able to close its doppelganger down through Beijing courts, Roberts said his company had been unable to track down those responsible. Given the international nature of the most prestigious and lucrative construction projects, and the success British practices enjoy globally, such scams may well be the tip of a digital iceberg. To date, the thieves appear to have targeted large, global practices working on a wide range of commercial and infrastructure projects from hotels and office blocks to sports arenas and entire districts of new Chinese cities. But will the web pirates begin to raid British practices with a higher design profile? If Aedas and Broadway Maylan, why not Foster and Partners and Zaha Hadid? It might be argued that architects have forever borrowed from one another, and even produced copybooks for others to follow. But this latest development moves beyond flattery into criminality.

Henman, 36, today plays Goran Ivanisevic for the first time since their memorable Wimbledon semi-final in 2001, when the Croat won over three rain-interrupted days. &quot;He&apos;s got all the shots,&quot; Henman said, commenting on Murray&apos;s remarkable match against Rafael Nadal on Saturday, a three-set defeat in the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals. &quot;You look at the tournaments he has won this year in Shanghai and in Toronto and his performances to get to the final in Australia; he was proactive and he made things happen. &quot;He&apos;s not being reckless and making a lot of unforced errors; he&apos;s looking to make his opponent do the running and sometimes when it gets tight he gets a little bit reactive. He stands a little bit further behind the baseline and he gives his opponents more opportunity to play. &quot;But he knows when he plays Nadal he has to be aggressive because he knows Nadal is going to be hitting him off the court \u2013 so he plays aggressively and has some great matches. &quot;I&apos;d like to see him do that against the lesser players because, if he does, it&apos;s going to become second nature when he has to step up against [Roger] Federer, Nadal or [Novak] Djokovic. &quot;But I think he appreciates that. He&apos;s certainly improving as a player \u2013 so fingers crossed he takes that in to 2011.&quot; Ivanisevic agreed that Murray is good enough to win a major. &quot;He&apos;s beaten all the top guys before, so he&apos;s proven himself there,&quot; the Croat said. &quot;He played one unbelievable match in the US Open semis against Nadal [in 2008] and then he didn&apos;t play a great match in the final against Federer. &quot;So, if I were his coach I&apos;d want him to be a little bit more aggressive. First of all, his second serve is not that good; it&apos;s a little bit short.

Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose government defeated the separatist Tamil Tigers last year amid humanitarian protests about the treatment of civilians trapped in the war zone, is due to speak at the Oxford Union on Thursday. The visit comes as Tamil supporters claim to have acquired a video showing a former Tamil Tiger colonel being interrogated by Sri Lankan forces. His family allege he was killed after surrendering. Rajapaksa is also expected to meet the defence secretary, Liam Fox. Last year the UK revoked a number of arms exports licences to Sri Lanka in response to the conflict. The Sri Lankan head of state&apos;s visit, postponed from last month, is likely to trigger mass protests. Tamil demonstrators were at Heathrow airport for his arrival on Monday evening; more are expected in Oxford later this week. Last year thousands of Tamils blockaded Parliament Square in Westminster for several weeks to draw attention to the fighting in Sri Lanka. The freezing weather may reduce the numbers involved this time. There are estimated to be as many as 300,000 people of Tamil descent in the UK. Sen Kandiah, founder of the British Tamil Forum, an umbrella group representing Tamils in the UK, told the Guardian: &quot;We have been working on an arrest warrant for some time. We have instructed a prominent legal firm and have spoken to former lord chancellors. &quot;We know that at least 40,000 civilians were killed at the end of the war. This man was the commander in chief and he&apos;s coming to speak to the Oxford Union. He should face a proper trial.&quot; Another Tamil activist, Suren Surendiran, said that if Rajapaksa had immunity as head of state then arrest warrants would be sought against military members of his entourage. Graham Williamson of the civil rights group Act Now has called for a boycott campaign of Sri Lankan goods. The UK accepts universal jurisdiction for war crimes offences, meaning that those accused of atrocities can be arrested in Britain wherever the offence was allegedly committed. But the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, announced in the summer that the legislation would be amended so that any prosecutions would require the assent of the director of public prosecutions. That would effectively stop the private actions brought against visiting foreign officials that have deterred visits by Israeli officials. A similar tactic was used when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister against the former Chilean president, General Augusto Pinochet. He was arrested and held under house arrest on charges of crimes against humanity, before being released on health grounds without being charged. Last month David Cameron endorsed calls for an independent investigation into the end of the Sri Lankan civil war in 2009. He told the Commons: &quot;Everyone has read the papers and seen the TV footage, but we need an independent investigation&quot; to work out whether there had been human rights abuses. A spokesman for the public relations firm Bell Pottinger, which represents Rajapaksa, denied that he had cancelled his trip to the UK last month becuse of fears that he might face an arrest warrant. &quot;He had to give a keynote speech at the UN,&quot; the spokesman said, &quot;and visit Shanghai. He had a busy international schedule. He&apos;s here now to speak to the Oxford Union.&quot; Rajapaksa last spoke at the Oxford Union in 2008. His second visit tomorrow, according to his spokesperson, will mean that he is the first serving head of state to address the union twice. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has established a three-man committee to investigate ways of dealing with the war crime allegations. A spokesman for Fox said: &quot;Dr Fox will be meeting President Rajapaksa in a private capacity.

China is a tough negotiator, and we can once again see it expressing concern about its core issues, including developed country mitigation commitments, technology transfer and the adequacy of financing. But as we look to negotiating positions, it is also worth stepping back for a minute to reflect on what China is doing domestically and how China&apos;s efforts to promote energy efficiency and low carbon technologies can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. China&apos;s commitments for emissions control over the next decade \u2013 its 40-45% carbon intensity reduction target by 2020, as well as forestry and renewable energy goals \u2013 are not contingent on the international negotiations or on commitments by any other country. China bound its commitment domestically through a State Council decision even before last year&apos;s Copenhagen meeting, and it has said that the 40-45% carbon intensity reduction target will also be incorporated into its 12th Five Year Plan to be adopted by its National People&apos;s Congress in March 2011. The Five Year Plan is the key tool for directing policy at all levels of government. In the past year China has been moving forward on domestic policy implementation, and key developments include:  Reforming the Renewable Energy Law to address problems with how new sources are added to the grid by funding more rural grid development and reinforcing fines on grid companies that don&apos;t purchase renewables as required. Adding new requirements to improve energy intensity performance. China&apos;s goal for the 11th Five Year Plan (2006-end 2010) is a 20% reduction in energy intensity. This has proven a challenge, especially because of China&apos;s massive stimulus plan after the global economic downturn. During 2010 the Chinese government has responded by increasing the number of companies under rigorous energy efficiency plans, shutting down additional inefficient plants and equipment, and giving local governments new targets for energy efficiency, among other programs. Major improvements in energy efficient transportation, including the world&apos;s largest high-speed rail program and new construction of both subway lines and bus rapid transit systems in dozens of cities. By next year it will be possible to travel the over 800 miles from Beijing to Shanghai by rail in 4 hours or about 200 miles per hour, as compared with 12 hours now. That means that China has made rail genuinely competitive with much more carbon-intensive air travel. Improvement in energy efficiency standards in areas ranging from industry to buildings to appliances. Standard-setting doesn&apos;t get the kind of attention that carbon markets and negotiations do, but it is the true nuts and bolts of improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Investing in clean technology. China continues to invest heavily in wind, solar and nuclear power, as well as in experiments in carbon capture and storage. China is widely expected to soon overtake the United States in total installed wind capacity. Exploring new policy options, including carbon taxes and carbon markets. China already uses a range of policy instruments to control the growth of greenhouse gases, including targets and quotas (from goals for renewable and nuclear energy, to the energy/carbon intensity goals), standards, and financial support for new technologies. It is now looking at new market-based mechanisms. It is widely expected that there will be experiments with these new approaches during the 12th Five Year Plan period, 2011 \u2013 end of 2015, although most do not expect to see them as early as 2011. Increasing the political support for climate policy . China&apos;s Communist Party Plenum included a full paragraph supporting climate policy. While the statement did not break new ground in terms of policy concepts, it raised the political profile of climate policy in a country where local governments pay close attention to the central government&apos;s political priorities.   Improving its own measurement and information systems. Despite the contentiousness of international discussions about measurement, there is broad political consensus within China that measurement and reporting are crucial for ensuring domestic goals are met. The Party Plenum document lists improving these systems among the climate policies needed, and in fact the Chinese government has been working on these systems over the past year as it gets ready for its new Five Year Plan goals. What is even more striking is that we are now hearing demands for better systems not just from the central government officials charged with monitoring local performance, but from the localities that want to ensure they get credit for the changes they make. I attended a UK-sponsored seminar of central and local officials with climate responsibilities and local officials said, we know what to do, we want to make sure that it is measured properly so we get credit. This reflects a real change in local awareness both of the policies, but also of what they can do and creates bottom-up pressure for these improvements in monitoring.  So in arriving at Cancun, China would appear to have quite a bit to offer, and yet it often ends up appearing defensive. Part of the reason is illustrated in the discussion posted by the China Dialogue Beijing Office Director Meng Si on November 29. Meng interviews China&apos;s Climate Minister Xie Zhenhua, who speaks frankly about China&apos;s growing understanding of the importance of transparency, but also about his frustration in getting China&apos;s message out into the press. All sides of the climate debate seem to understand the importance of transparency, and Xie showed interest in using that to help resolve issues surrounding measuring and reporting. One point to keep in mind is that greater transparency is also needed on accounting for developed country emissions reductions and on the financial support to be given to developing countries. My WRI colleagues suggest new approaches to these issues in two new papers on accounting and climate finance.", "tags": ["Environment", "Canc\u00fan climate change conference 2010 | COP16", "Global climate talks", "China", "Climate change", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-01T16:31:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/dec/02/cancun-climate-change-summit-pacific-island-nauru", "sentences": ["New research has shown that the rapid loss of ice sheets could contribute to an increase in sea level of more than a meter, which would put New York, London, Shanghai and many other coastal cities at risk of severe flooding."], "title": "For us in the Pacific, the Canc\u00fan climate summit is about survival | Marcus Stephen", "article": "Last year, heads of state from the world&apos;s largest economies gathered at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen to show solidarity with their counterparts from smaller, more vulnerable countries in the face of the largest environmental crisis in history. The failure of the negotiations to produce a legally binding treaty, coupled with shifting domestic politics, have kept the same leaders away from this year&apos;s meeting in Canc\u00fan, lest they be associated with another breakdown in talks or accused of not putting their own country&apos;s problems first. But while climate change may have become politically inconvenient in the past year for some, the threat it poses to the world is no less real. And for few people is the danger so great as it is for the citizens of Pacific island nations. For this reason, several heads of state from our region will personally take part in the Mexico negotiations \u2013 to ensure that our interests are fairly represented and to remind the world that, for us, action on climate change is not simply a matter of politics, but of survival. The countries in our region are spread across thousands of square miles in the Pacific and include hundreds of small islands and coral atolls. The region is home to more than 8 million people, 600 distinct languages, and some of the most biologically diverse marine ecosystems in the world. As with other small island states, our low-lying terrain, remote geography, vulnerability to storms, and dependence on natural resources have made the impacts of climate change all the more severe. For example, the combination of rising seas and intensifying weather events has led to coastal erosion and the intrusion of saltwater into agricultural land and our increasingly scarce fresh water supplies. At sea, ocean acidification and coral bleaching have degraded fisheries and threaten our tourism economy. Even more concerning, a steady rise in sea level has put some of our members&apos; islands at risk of complete inundation. Hundreds of people from Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, and other parts of our region have already been forcefully displaced due to climate-related impacts, making them among the world&apos;s first climate refugees and raising a number of previously unimaginable questions: If our homes are swallowed by the sea, where would we go? What country will we belong too? Who will own our fish and undersea resources? These dilemmas are by no means isolated to the Pacific. New research has shown that the rapid loss of ice sheets could contribute to an increase in sea level of more than a meter, which would put New York, London, Shanghai and many other coastal cities at risk of severe flooding. The International Organisation for Migration has said that rising seas could lead to as many as 200 million climate-impact related refugees worldwide by 2050. So what can we achieve in Canc\u00fan? In spite of the low expectations that have been set for the meeting, we can still take a step toward reaching an agreement that helps protect millions of people in low-lying countries if progress is made in the following areas. First, governments must preserve the international character of climate change policymaking. At Copenhagen, some governments began lobbying for a system that would replace an internationally binding agreement with a patchwork of domestic regulations and enforcement regimes. Such a proposal would disenfranchise the voices of millions of people most at risk from climate change and undermine the multilateral approach that is the cornerstone of international relations. Second, the emission reduction targets proposed at Copenhagen are not nearly sufficient to prevent severe climate impacts to low-lying and coastal areas. We have joined other island states and vulnerable countries throughout Africa, Asia and the Americas in calling for emission reductions designed to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees, the level scientists say is needed to significantly reduce the risk to our islands and surrounding reefs and atolls. Third, the international community should use this opportunity to establish readily accessible sources of funding specifically dedicated to help vulnerable communities such as ours adapt to the unavoidable consequences of climate change. It is critical that this support be additional to previous commitments to international development aid and administered according to the highest standards of fairness and transparency. The predicament facing the Pacific&apos;s low-lying states, though seemingly far removed from the world&apos;s largest cities and capitals, is in fact just the earliest manifestation of a crisis shared the world over. A failure to do what is necessary to protect us now will eventually doom all of humanity to a similar fate.", "tags": ["Canc\u00fan climate change conference 2010 | COP16", "Nauru", "Climate change", "Mexico", "United Nations", "Global climate talks", "Environmental sustainability", "Environment", "World news", "Vanuatu", "Papua New Guinea", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-02T06:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/dec/02/liam-tancock", "sentences": ["Olympic countdown November 2010 Training camp in Florida 5 March 2011 World Championship trials, Manchester 16 July 2011 World Championships, Shanghai 3 March 2012 British Championships, which will double up as Great Britain&apos;s Olympic trials July 2012 Great Britain team&apos;s pre-Olympics training camp, Edinburgh Olympic Games 2012 venue The Aquatics Centre in the south-east corner of the Olympic Park in Stratford will hold 17,500 spectators for the swimming events In numbers 3,032 The number of followers Liam Tancock has on Twitter 1904 The year the men&apos;s 100m backstroke became an Olympic event, although it was measured in yards then so it was technically 91.44m."], "title": "Liam Tancock | One hundred hopefuls for 2012", "article": "Progress towards 2012 &quot;Personally I&apos;m on target, everything has been going really well.

I will take what I have learned to London and not only pass it on to the other swimmers but take it on myself as well. That knowledge is crucial, it&apos;s priceless and words cannot explain the experience. &quot;To come away from the Commonwealth Games in Delhi with four medals was fantastic. I have only got one main meet, at the World Championships, before the Olympics, so Delhi was important and it was great to go up against the best guys in the world and beat them. I just love to race, I&apos;m a racer! &quot;I don&apos;t look at there being extra pressure at London in 2012, I look at it as an exciting time. We have got an idea of what it could be like \u2013 at the World Swimming Championships in Manchester in 2008 the crowd was chanting our names and that was with 8,000 people. I imagine the crowd at the Olympics will be double that. It&apos;s unheard of.&quot; Biography Born 7 May 1985, Exeter Educated St Luke&apos;s High School, Exeter and Loughborough University Learned to swim Exeter City swimming club Club Loughborough University Favourite film The Shawshank Redemption Favourite food Spaghetti bolognese Interests outside swimming I love going to events and seeing stuff live.

He believes police were worried he would go to next Friday&apos;s Nobel peace prize ceremony for jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo , although he had already told them he would not attend. Activists, friends and supporters of the imprisoned writer have been put under house arrest or increased surveillance or prevented from travelling abroad since the announcement of the award. Ai was waiting at the boarding gate, intending to catch a flight to Seoul today , when a border official told him there had been a &quot;technical problem&quot; and she needed to see his passport, he said. &quot;I said: &apos;Please tell me the truth \u2013 you are preventing me from going abroad.&apos; She laughed and said &apos;Yes&apos;,&quot; he added. &quot;They gave me a written note saying my acts might affect national security so they were stopping me from going out. &quot;It was definitely about this ceremony next week. I had already explained I was busy and was not interested in attending, but of course they wouldn&apos;t listen. I think they have become not trusting of anyone.&quot; Ai has frequently fallen foul of the authorities for his public criticism of the government and political activism. Last month he was placed under house arrest after planning a mass party to mark the forced demolition of his studio in Shanghai. He said he had been planning to visit several countries, going to Korea to plan for a biennale that he will be directing before flying to Berlin for a meeting and on to Denmark to see the location for a show. &quot;So they saved me a lot of trouble,&quot; he added. &quot;I don&apos;t feel angry at all.

Today foreign ministry spokesman Jiang Yu told a regular press briefing: &quot;The Norwegian government expressed their open support [for the prize]. It is difficult to maintain friendly relations with Norway as in the past.&quot; A Nobel official announced last month that the prize would probably not be handed out at the ceremony because China was unlikely to let any of Liu&apos;s close relatives attend. It is thought that it would be the first time the prize had not been presented since 1936, when journalist Carl von Ossietzky was stopped from leaving Nazi Germany to accept it.

BEIJING 1672 B. BEIJING 1760Classified By: AMBASSADOR CLARK T. RANDT, JR., REASONS 1.4 B AND D. 1. (C) Summary. Zhejiang Province Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping, a contender to succeed President Hu Jintao in 2012/2013, describes Zhejiang as a driving force behind national economic growth. Zhejiang ranks high for income, low for income disparities, and makes substantial contributions to migrant worker employment and transfer payments of fiscal revenue to the Central Government. Xi dismissed concerns about overheating, noting that the faster his province grows, the greater the amount of revenues that the province will transfer to the Central Government. Those revenues also support economic development in comparatively poor regions in Central and Western China. Provincial party and government officials are regularly informed of citizens&apos; complaints and plan to address recurring concerns about education, affordable housing and healthcare. The provincial Communist Party is committed to building the legal underpinnings of China&apos;s socialist market economy. National People&apos;s Congress passage of the Property Law will be beneficial to building China&apos;s market economy and to Zhejiang. Unification of corporate tax rates will be a great benefit to Zhejiang companies while not deterring new foreign investment. Xi expressed satisfaction with his May 2006 visit to the United States. He is a fan of Hollywood World War II movies and criticizes Chinese moviemakers for neglecting values they should promote. His frank and friendly dinner discussion with the Ambassador included several comparisons that Xi made to other provinces where other leading contenders now hold leadership roles, comparisons in which Zhejiang looks better. End Summary. Booming Zhejiang Is a National Economic Leader --------------------------------------------- - 2. (C) At a March 11 dinner hosted by the Ambassador at his residence, Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi Jinping responded to a series of questions about Zhejiang Provincial economic performance with an impressive array of data and interesting observations. Zhejiang Province&apos;s exports surpassed USD 100 billion in 2006, an increase of 31 percent over 2005, Xi said. Sixty percent of those 2006 exports were from private enterprises, and the 2006 rate of increase of exports for those private enterprises amounted to 40 percent. While unable to provide an immediate savings rate figure for Zhejiang residents, Xi asserted that most Zhejiang residents have more than enough money to cover expenses for basic needs. Prudential savings nonetheless remain high in recognition of the incomplete nature of China&apos;s social security system and to prepare for possible future consumption items such as health care. While a small proportion of the province&apos;s population remains near poverty and requires assistance from government, perhaps 20 percent of Zhejiang&apos;s approximately 50 million residents are high income earners within the Chinese context. They don&apos;t know how to spend all their money, Xi said. China&apos;s stock markets are not mature and thus hold risks unattractive to many Chinese, and the investment fund industry is likewise immature and unattractive. The Ambassador interjected that Treasury Secretary Paulson had discussed China&apos;s capital markets and financial sector reform in a speech in Shanghai just three days earlier and presented a Chinese text of Secretary Paulson&apos;s speech to Secretary Xi. SIPDIS 3. (C) In their search for money-making opportunities and wealth preservation strategies, Xi continued, many rich Chinese cannot find proper outlets for their cash. This helps feed illegal financial activities, such as deceptive claims on the Internet and private but illegal banks and investment funds that claim to pay higher interest rates than are generally available in China. The Chinese Government and the Chinese people place high hopes that the bilateral dialogue mechanism established through the Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) can help solve some practical problems in China&apos;s financial sectors. Secretary Xi said he hopes that Secretary Paulson and the Ambassador will play important SIPDIS roles in the SED as it moves forward. Xi added that he hopes the United States Congress will show enough patience to allow Secretary Paulson sufficient time to solve some of these SIPDIS problems. 4. (C) Secretary Xi proudly and easily rolled off numerous BEIJING 00001840 002 OF 007 Zhejiang provincial economic data. Provincial GDP increased 13.6 percent in 2006, with per capita GDP now USD 4,000 -- well, USD 3,975 to be exact, he clarified. Only Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shandong have greater provincial GDPs, and on a per capita GDP basis, Zhejiang ranks first among all provinces and only lags the centrally administered cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin in this regard. Per capita GDP in the provincial capital of Hangzhou is now about USD 6000 and in the port city of Ningbo now about USD 6500. Zhejiang ranks first in the nation in fiscal revenue and per capita disposable income, too. 5. (C) Zhejiang gets to keep about half of the fiscal revenue collected in the province, with about half sent to the Central Government. In 2006, Zhejiang collected 256 billion renminbi in fiscal revenue (90 percent in taxes, 10 percent in items not clearly identified in Xi&apos;s comments), of which 130 billion RMB was retained for local uses. Furthermore, fiscal revenue data do not include other funds available to the government, such as government investment funds, social security funds, or tariffs collected by Customs officials at Zhejiang ports of entry (the latter funds go directly to the Central Government, Xi added). Xi said that income for all levels of government generated from all sources in Zhejiang in 2006 was probably near 500 billion RMB. Dismissive of Overheating Concerns ---------------------------------- 6. (C) The Ambassador asked whether Central Government officials are concerned about possible economic overheating in Zhejiang. Secretary Xi replied that the faster Zhejiang grows, the more revenue the Central Government receives. It is Zhejiang&apos;s hope that the Central Government will keep the share of provincial fiscal revenue that Zhejiang must send to the Central Government stable. The Ministry of Finance is considering raising that share, a possibility which Xi opposes. Making the cake bigger (i.e., growing Zhejiang&apos;s economy) will make their piece bigger, too (i.e., a fixed percentage of a larger whole will bring an increase in absolute value of funds transferred to the Central Government). Many cities in Eastern China are concerned about this issue. Xi hopes that Finance Minister Jin Renqing will not think about or act upon this possible increase in revenue sharing burden. Shouldering Burdens of Central and Western China --------------------------------------------- --- 7. (C) Another issue about which Zhejiang officials are very concerned is the gap in income and economic development levels between the wealthier East Coast regions and China&apos;s Central and Western regions. Some of the fiscal revenue generated in Zhejiang is allocated to assigned counties and communities elsewhere in China, including some of the highest altitude administrative units in Xizang (Tibet) and Xinjiang, the Fuling area of Chongqing Municipality, two impoverished areas in Sichuan Province (one of which is Nanchong) and certain Miao ethnic minority areas of Guizhou. Some of these destinations in Western China can themselves only raise 10 - 30 percent of their annual local government expenditures, while in assigned areas in Central China that proportion may increase to 50 percent. Transfer payments to local governments in Central and Western China actually come in part from provincial contributions, Xi underscored, lessening the burden of the Central Government. While Zhejiang sends about 50 percent of its fiscal revenue to the Center, Shanghai must contribute an even higher share, about 65 percent. An Important Destination for Migrant Workers -------------------------------------------- 8. (C) Zhejiang makes two other important contributions to the national economy. First, Zhejiang hosts China&apos;s second largest population of migrant workers, 14 .5 million. Only Guangdong hosts more. The ratio of Zhejiang&apos;s permanent residents (about 50 million) to migrants is a little over 3:1. Zhejiang thus makes an important contribution to addressing China&apos;s employment challenges. There is a cost with having so many migrant workers, since 65 percent of issues requiring Public Security attention (i.e., crimes) are caused by migrant workers. Xi clarified that migrant workers are defined as those who stay for work purposes for less than four months. Those who stay for more than four months in a BEIJING 00001840 003 OF 007 locale are counted as residents. Furthermore, in the large number of migrant workers seeking work in Zhejiang are a great many who come to this comparatively rich province from less affluent other provinces and cities. Xi contrasted his large number of provincial outsiders with the situation in Jiangsu Province, where, he said, many of the migrants are persons from north of the Yangtze who are seeking employment in locations south of the Yangtze, still in their own home province. An Important Contributor to Economic Development Elsewhere --------------------------------------------- ------------- 9. (C) The other important economic contribution by Zhejiang is the role of 4.4 million businesspersons from Zhejiang are working outside the province elsewhere in China. Xi said Central Government data does not report the economic impact of these businesspersons. While there is little foreign direct investment in Central and Western China, including little from the United States, there is considerable investment and business activity in those regions by Zhejiang businesspersons. Those 4.4 million extra-provincial Zhejiang businesspersons generate another nearly one trillion RMB more in GDP nationwide - nearly as much as the province. Another 1 million Zhejiang businesspersons live overseas, often building international business links. So one must recognize that Zhejiang has been a driver of the whole nation&apos;s economic growth. 10. (C) Nearly all other provinces have sent delegations to Zhejiang to study the province&apos;s experience and success. In recent days, delegations from Xinjiang, Sichuan and Jiangxi had scheduled upcoming appointments to visit and study Zhejiang, bringing large delegations that will include county-level Communist Party secretaries. Secretary Xi quoted Jiangxi Provincial Party Secretary Meng Jianzhu as saying he and others have much to learn from Zhejiang&apos;s development path. The experiences of coastal cities such as Shenzhen and Shanghai that are destinations for high levels of foreign investment are not suitable development models. Income Gap and Urbanization Rate -------------------------------- 11. (C) The Ambassador inquired about income disparities within Zhejiang Province. Zhejiang has the second lowest provincial urban/rural income ratio in the nation, at 2.45:1. Jiangsu is first, at 2.1:1, while the national average is 3.3:1. However, Zhejiang&apos;s ratio may increase slightly, due to faster income growth for urban residents (10.9 percent in 2006) than for rural residents (9.3 percent in 2006). While the ratio may worsen slightly, Xi said, the important fact to recognize is that income levels are rising significantly in Zhejiang regardless of being a city dweller or rural resident. Zhejiang&apos;s population is now about 56 percent urbanized. With respect to income of urban residents, Zhejiang has ranked first in China for the last six years. With respect to income of rural residents, Zhejiang has ranked first for the last 22 years. Xi again volunteered a comparison between Zhejiang and Jiangsu. Jiangsu&apos;s total average income is less than that of Zhejiang, and the highest income level in Jiangsu, in the city of Suzhou, is only at the level of the average income level for the whole of Zhejiang Province. The average income level in Zhejiang&apos;s capital of Hangzhou, however, is about the same as the average income level in Shanghai. 12. (C) Zhejiang has maintained these remarkable results because it is an economy of the grassroots -- the common people choose their own development paths, Xi continued. Zhejiang is an economy of counties and towns (implying not being a province with a heavy hand of central economic decision making). Of the top 100 most affluent counties in China (criteria for ranking not clearly explained by Xi), 30 of Zhejiang&apos;s total 60 counties are among them. At the township level, 268 Zhejiang towns rank in the top 1000 towns in China. Of Zhejiang&apos;s total nine provincial-level municipalities, seven rank in China&apos;s top 100, and the other two are ranked between 101 and 110. Hearing from the Grassroots Level --------------------------------- 13. (C) The Ambassador asked how provincial party and government officials hear from the citizenry and what are the BEIJING 00001840 004 OF 007 most frequent concerns or complaints directed to Zhejiang officials. Secretary Xi said provincial officials have many sources of information, many of them designed by Provincial Party Secretary General Li Qiang, to whom Xi turned for comment. Mr. Li explained that the major source of news on the views of the citizenry remains letters. About 150,000 letters were delivered to Zhejiang offices last year. The provincial government website provides a link for submission of e-mails from the public. Party Secretary Xi and provincial government leaders from the Governor on down often lead delegations to the counties to listen to the voices of the citizens. Provincial officials spend more than 100 days per year conducting research with specific industries or in different areas of the province to gather firsthand information. Government officials can also submit information to Xi at any time. Media reports on provincial developments are an additional source of news. The provincial Communist Party itself also gathers information from the public. So, the Provincial Party Secretary has uninterrupted access to the views of the general public, Li concluded. Concerns about Education, Housing and Health Care Common --------------------------------------------- ----------- 14. (C) Zhejiang residents are most concerned about three basic issues: education, affordable housing, and health care, Secretary Xi said. The government must take a realistic attitude in addressing these concerns. While not all concerns can or should be addressed fully - for instance, not every child in the cities and in the countryside will matriculate to the highest ranked universities -- the government should act to ensure that all children receive an education, people have basic affordable housing, and all residents have access to at least basic medical care. Zhejiang is doing a good job in all these respects, Xi asserted, even leading the whole country. While China has a per capita GDP level of about USD 1000, Zhejiang is already at about USD 4000. This leads to higher expectations for the work of provincial officials and party leaders. So new proposals will be forthcoming on how to improve the lives of Zhejiang residents. Officials&apos; Work Styles Another Common Concern --------------------------------------------- 15. (C) Another area in which dissatisfaction has been expressed regards the working style of government and party officials, Xi added. We will make energetic efforts to improve on this score. Surely the situation will improve in the long term but there is a long way to go. With 70 million persons holding membership in the Communist Party of China, it should not be surprising that several thousand may be problem cases. However, the complaint letters from the people show the people still have faith in the Party and hope the Party will solve such problems within the Party. For the present, the people will not take to the streets to complain about officials&apos; work styles. While there are many problem makers in the Party, the Party also counts among its members the elite of society. Crime and Wastefulness, Too --------------------------- 16. (C) Secretary Xi briefly mentioned crime and government waste as other topics of public complaint. He did not elaborate any further on crime, but noted that once basic needs for food and clothing have been met, some officials have become wasteful in their use of administrative resources, seeking extravagance in their lifestyles. More guidance from the government is needed in such cases, in Xi&apos;s view. He closed his comments on this topic by recalling that China is a big country, with a population exceeding one billion persons. When you multiply something by more than one billion, you get a big number; but if you divide something, like GDP, by more than one billion, you get a small result. Deng Xiaoping was right in observing that China is still at a primary stage of development. Expectations for This National People&apos;s Congress Session --------------------------------------------- ----------- 17. (C) Shanghai Consul General Jarrett, noting the important role of the private sector in the Zhejiang economy, asked Secretary Xi about the current meeting of the National BEIJING 00001840 005 OF 007 People&apos;s Congress and expected passage of a Property Law. Is there any dissent against the proposed law in Zhejiang? What will the law mean for Zhejiang? Xi expects that the NPC will enact the Property Law during the current session. Discussion of a Property Law began in the sixth NPC, about twenty years ago. Now is the right time to enact the law, passage is needed to support the legal regime of China&apos;s socialist market economy. The Property Law will equally protect state-owned, collectively-owned assets and private properties. The law should also protect against stripping of assets from state-owned enterprises and protect the general public&apos;s growing holdings of private property. In the past, China gave lip service to property protection, with the destruction of property in the Cultural Revolution being an example. Private property plays a leading role in Zhejiang&apos;s economic development, so nearly everyone in Zhejiang agrees with passage of the Property Law. With property protection in place, Chinese can gain even more wealth. 18. (C) Another measure to be passed in this NPC session will unify corporate taxation rates for foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises. Chinese companies will see their tax rates decline from 33 percent to 25 percent, while FIEs will have a five-year transitional period as their tax holidays are phased out and their tax rates climb to 25 percent. Tax unification is very good news for Zhejiang companies, Secretary Xi said. For example, the Ningbo manufacturer (heard as Ningbo Ya Ge Er) of the suit he wore to dinner has told Xi that the reduction of his corporate tax rate will save his company 40 million RMB per year. Because foreign investors who are newcomers to China consider more than just the corporate tax rate in selecting overseas investment destinations, the increased tax rate should not significantly hurt them, Xi asserted. Rule of Law in Zhejiang Province -------------------------------- 19. (C) The Ambassador asked for Secretary Xi&apos;s views on the development and implementation of rule of law in Zhejiang. Xi replied that the Party Provincial Committee has proposed in 2006 to build Zhejiang into a province ruled by law. Laws are a basis for the socialist market economy. Provincial officials will promote public awareness of laws and do their best to enhance enforcement of laws. The Provincial People&apos;s Congress will cobine laws as passed at the national level by the NPC with Zhejiang&apos;s local conditions. The government and the Party will promote rule of law. A provincial working group on rule of law has been established, and Li Qiang is Director General of that working group. Local laws should accord with central laws. Zhejiang can provide some pioneering efforts in rule of law for the whole country. Xi&apos;s 2006 Visit to the United States ------------------------------------ 20. (C) The Ambassador asked Secretary Xi for details of his May 2006 visit to the United States and whether he had had opportunity to exchange views with members of Congress while in Washington. Xi indeed had met with members of Congress, and found those he met with quite friendly towards China. One member described himself or herself as formerly quite anti-China but his/her views had begun to shift. Xi and his delegation had been worried that Falun Gong practitioners might pose a threat during their visit, and accordingly had some security assistants accompany them on their visit. All had proceeded smoothly with no encounters with the Falun Gong. Xi said he and other Chinese officials are not worried or annoyed by noise or protests during visits but are worried about the legal consequences and burdens if served papers as part of stateside legal actions. 21. (C) The May 2006 trip had proven fruitful for Zhejiang, Secretary Xi continued, with several important contracts SIPDIS signed that only more recently or even in the near future will be implemented. Among those agreements is one involving Federal Express, which will have ceremonies at the Hangzhou (Zhejiang Province&apos;s capital) airport for the construction or opening of a new distribution center. Citibank decided to accelerate plans to establish a branch in Hangzhou. Xi has written to China Banking Regulatory Chairman Liu Mingkang to urge accelerated processing of that application and, while expressing confidence the application will be approved soon, Xi commented to his colleagues that additional lobbying may BEIJING 00001840 006 OF 007 be in order. The Ambassador thanked Xi for his support to Motorola for that company&apos;s production plans in Hangzhou. Motorola is doing well in Hangzhou, with Hangzhou&apos;s sales revenue nearing 45 billion renminbi (over USD 5 billion) in 2006, just slightly less than Motorola sales revenue generated at its Tianjin facilities. Hangzhou sales revenue will surely eclipse Tianjin sales revenue in 2007. Finally, the 2006 visit to the United States had included commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of sister state relations between Zhejiang and New Jersey. A New Jersey university decided to set up a branch campus in Wenzhou in Zhejiang, a plan already approved by all relevant provincial authorities but still awaiting approval by the central Ministry of Education. A WWII Hollywood Movie Aficionado --------------------------------- 22. (C) The Ambassador also asked Secretary Xi about his recent movie viewing, recalling that Xi had told him in their meeting one year ago that he had recently seen and tremendously enjoyed &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; Had Secretary Xi seen other recent American movies that he had enjoyed? Xi replied that he already owns the &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; DVD, but hopes to view it during the Lunar New Year holidays had gone unfulfilled. He had seen and enjoyed &quot;The Departed.&quot; Xi said he particularly likes Hollywood movies about World War II and hopes Hollywood will continue to make them. Hollywood makes those movies well, and such Hollywood movies are grand and truthful. Americans have a clear outlook on values and clearly demarcate between good and evil. In American movies, good usually prevails. In contrast, &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower,&quot; a recently popular Chinese movie directed by Zhang Yimou and starring Gong Li (she of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; movie stardom) had been confusing to Xi. Some Chinese moviemakers neglect values they should promote. 23. (C) America is a powerful nation in terms of culture because Americans say what they should say, Xi elaborated. Too many Chinese moviemakers cater to foreigners&apos; interests or preconceptions, sometimes vulgarly so. He criticized Zhang Yimou by name as well as the kungfu action movie genre. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;Wu Ji&quot; and imperial palace intrigues -- all are the same, talking about bad things in imperial palaces. Most are not nominated for Oscars or other awards, so to some extent it can be said that such movies are not worth very much. The Ambassador noted that a Chinese film about HIV/AIDS orphans had just garnered the Oscar for best short documentary. Xi expressed awareness of the movie, noting that the director is a female overseas Chinese (but Xi never said whether he had seen that documentary). Xi recalled that a low cost, very good Chinese movie by the director Jia Zhangke had recently won a Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival. Returning to &quot;Flags of Our Fathers,&quot; Xi said he had come to understand that the flag raising on Iwo Jima did not mark the end of the battle. The Japanese were still in holes and caves and the battle continued. He expressed particular admiration for WWII movies set in the Pacific theater of operations and expressed a strong desire to visit Guadalcanal. 24. (C) Many Chinese had died in the Anti-Japanese War (as WWII is most often referred to in Mainland China). The last one to two decades have been a period of historical importance, with peace and rapid economic development. China should use this opportunity to focus on improving the living conditions of the people. Xi noted some earlier but brief periods of peace and economic development in China, referring to two emperors&apos; reigns in the Han Dynasty, the reign of the first emperor in the Tang Dynasty, and the consecutive reigns of Emperors Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong in the Ming Dynasty. It was a crime that such periods did not last longer. The current period of peace and rapid economic development should be extended as long as possible. Comment ------- 25. (C) Secretary Xi, regarded by many Embassy contacts to be one of the three leading contenders to succeed President Hu Jintao in 2012/2013 as Communist Party Chairman and President of China, certainly exhibited an easy and proficient familiarity with his relatively prosperous province&apos;s economic data and development strengths. Comparisons to Jiangsu Province and reference to Henan were BEIJING 00001840 007 OF 007 perhaps inevitable for an official with the strong ambitions he reportedly holds. The other two leading contenders to succeed President Hu are Li Yuanchao (Ambassador&apos;s March 8 dinner reported ref A), current Party Secretary in Jiangsu, and Li Keqiang, past Party Secretary in Henan (Ambassador&apos;s March 12 dinner reported ref B).

Randt. Reasons 1.4 (b/d) 1. (C) January 1, 2009, marked the 30th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People&apos;s Republic of China. This anniversary followed the PRC commemoration of roughly 30 years of China&apos;s &quot;reform and opening&quot; policy under Deng Xiaoping, which led to China&apos;s staggering economic growth. 2. (C) Thirty years ago, China was just emerging from the nightmare of the Cultural Revolution and 30 years of fratricidal misrule. China&apos;s economy was crippled by years of disastrous policies like the Great Leap Forward. The population was coming to terms with the world&apos;s most draconian population controls enacted in 1976 after decades of Maoist state-subsidies encouraging large families. Chinese foreign relations tended to be more influenced by ideological yardsticks than economic links since China had very few commercial links with the outside world. In 1979, Chinese urbanites on average made the equivalent of five dollars per month. 3. (C) Just as no one in 1979 would have predicted that China would become the United States&apos; most important relationship in thirty years, no one today can predict with certainty where our relations with Beijing will be thirty years hence. However, given the current significance of the bilateral relationship and the risk of missing opportunities to jointly address ongoing and predictable future challenges, below we look at trends currently affecting China with an eye to how those trends might affect relations. Several issues leap out, including China&apos; insatiable resource needs, our growing economic interdependence, China&apos;s rapid military modernization, a surge in Chinese nationalism, China&apos;s demographic challenges, and the PRC&apos;s increasing influence and confidence on the world stage. 4. (C) China has been plagued over the millennia by unforeseen events that devastated formerly prosperous regimes. Mongol invasion, the Black Death, uncountable peasant uprisings, warlords, tax revolts, communist dictatorship, colonialism, famine, earthquakes and other plagues were largely unforeseen by the China watchers of the past. This report focuses generally on more optimistic projections. Given China&apos;s history, however, the United States should also gird itself for the possibility that China will fall short of today&apos;s mostly sanguine forecasts. Resource Consumption -------------------- 5. (C) Popular and scholarly works in recent years highlight China&apos;s growing demand for natural resources and the possible impact that China&apos;s pursuit of resources will have on its foreign policy. Since economic reforms began in the late 1970s, industrial and exchange rate policies have fueled investment in resource-intensive heavy industries in China&apos;s coastal region, which currently account for approximately 55 percent of the country&apos;s total energy consumption today. A construction boom over the past decade has also stimulated growth in heavy industries. China is now a leading steel producer and currently accounts for 50 percent of the world&apos;s annual cement production. Reflecting China&apos;s emphasis on resource-intensive industries, China&apos;s energy utilization rate grew faster than its GDP between 2002 and 2006. In 1990, China consumed 27 quadrillion British Thermal Units (BTUs) of energy, accounting for 7.8 percent of global consumption. In 2006, it consumed 68.6 quadrillion BTUs or 15.6 percent of the global total. According to U.S. Department of Energy statistics, by 2030 China will account for 145.5 quadrillion BTUs or 20.7 percent of global energy consumption. 6. (C) China&apos;s oil demand has grown substantially over the last 30 years. In 1980, China consumed 1.7 million barrels of oil per day, almost all of which was produced domestically. In 2006, China consumed 7.4 million barrels per day, second only to the United States. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China&apos;s oil consumption will reach 16.5 million barrels per day in 2030. More than two thirds of the increased demand will come from the BEIJING 00000022 002 OF 007 transport sector as vehicle ownership rates rise. China became a net importer of oil in 1993, and it now relies on imports to meet a growing portion of its fossil fuel needs. The IEA forecasts that China&apos;s oil import dependence will rise from 50 percent this year to 80 percent by 2030, as domestic oil production peaks early in the next decade. To strengthen the country&apos;s future energy security, the Chinese Government has adopted a &quot;go out&quot; policy that encourages national oil companies (NOCs) to acquire equity stakes in foreign oil and gas production. Today, state-owned Chinese oil giants CNPC/PetroChina, CNOOC, and Sinopec can be found in Sudan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, Angola, and the Caspian Basin. 7. (C) China has also increased its reliance on imported minerals, and many analysts have attributed the global commodities boom of recent years in part to China&apos;s growing demand. Between 1980 and 2006, China became the world&apos;s largest consumer of iron, copper and aluminum. Chinese conglomerates are ubiquitous in sub-Saharan Africa exploiting mineral wealth there, and Chinese multinationals have significant investments in Australian mineral and uranium production. 8. (C) China&apos;s reliance on coal has come at an appalling environmental cost. This year, China surpassed the United States in carbon emissions, and it will soon become the world&apos;s biggest energy consumer. Between now and 2030, the IEA estimates, China will need to add 1,312 gigawatts of power generating capacity, more than the total current installed capacity in the United States. Coal-fired power generation, a major source of air pollution, accounts for approximately 78 percent of China&apos;s total electricity supply, and it will likely remain the predominant fuel in electricity generation for at least the next 20 years. Analysts predict that domestic coal production will peak in the next 15 to 25 years. China already became a net importer of coal in 2007, and coal imports are expected to grow in the coming decades to meet growing demand in China&apos;s coastal provinces. 9. (C) The Chinese Government recognizes the need to reduce dependence on coal, and it is pursuing policies to diversify its energy mix. China is already the largest producer of renewable energy in the world, with major investments in large-scale hydro and wind power projects. Nuclear and natural gas power will also account for a greater proportion of energy production, but under current projections, efforts to diversify China&apos;s energy mix will not have a large enough impact to curb greenhouse gas emissions growth. 10. (C) China&apos;s energy intensive growth has also had tragic consequences for public health. By most measurements, at least half of the world&apos;s most polluted major cities are in China. Rural residents, in particular farmers, have been affected by water pollution and dwindling water supplies, which are frequently redirected for industrial use. Respiratory disease, water-borne illness and tainted food scares are facts of modern life in the country. According to a recent WHO study, diseases caused by indoor and outdoor air pollution kill 656,000 Chinese citizens every year. Another 95,600 deaths are attributed annually to polluted drinking water. 11. (C) China&apos;s increasing reliance on imported natural resources has foreign policy ramifications and provides opportunities for the United States. A China that is increasingly dependent on Middle Eastern oil might be more likely to support policies that do not destabilize the Middle East. Take Iran, for instance. We have long been frustrated that China has resisted (with Russia) tough sanctions aimed at curbing Iran&apos;s nuclear program. In the future, a China increasingly dependent on foreign energy supplies may recalculate the risk a nuclear Iran would pose to the greater Persian Gulf region&apos;s capacity to export oil. 12. (C) Another opportunity presented by China&apos;s increasing resource consumption is in the joint development of technological responses to reduce carbon emissions and to diminish the public health impact of industrial growth. Scientific publications around the world conclude that the projected rate of global energy and natural resource BEIJING 00000022 003 OF 007 consumption is unsustainable. Experts warn that we must find alternative forms of energy in order to avert calamities posed by global climate change. International efforts to develop and significantly utilize renewable energy, clean up our shared global environment, and conserve our remaining raw materials will not be effective without meaningful Chinese participation. As the world&apos;s preeminent technological power and as a leader in multilateral energy and scientific organizations, the United States is in a unique position to work with China to overcome these challenges. Economic Interdependence and Chinese Demographics --------------------------------------------- ---- 13. (C) In the next fifteen years, while China&apos;s overall population is predicted to stabilize, its urban population will likely grow to almost 1 billion, an increase (of 300 million people) equal to the entire current population of the United States. China plans to build 20,000 to 50,000 new skyscrapers over the next two decades -- as many as ten New York cities. More than 170 Chinese cities will need mass transit systems by 2025, more than twice the number now present in all of Europe. China is now surpassing Germany as the world&apos;s third largest economy and is projected to overtake Japan within the next five years. By the end of the next thirty years, China&apos;s economy could rival the United States in overall scale (although its per capita income will likely only be one quarter of the United States&apos;). 14. (C) Behind these outward symbols of success will be an increasingly complicated economic picture. Since 1979, by reversing the misguided economic policies of the Mao era, liberalizing labor markets and prices, opening to foreign investment, and taking advantage of the West&apos;s consumer-driven policies, China has maintained fast growth. However, the set of circumstances that allowed such impressive growth rates will no longer exist in the future. 15. (C) Many speculate that China has reached the limit to easy productivity gains by rationalizing the state-planned economy. The Economist Intelligence Unit expects China&apos;s annual growth to slow from around 10 percent in the last 30 years to 4.5 percent by 2020. After 2015 when the labor force peaks as a share of the population, labor costs will rise faster. This will increasingly make other countries like India and Vietnam more attractive for labor-intensive investment. In addition, workers will have to support a growing number of retirees. Early retirement ages combined with the urban one-child limits creates the so-called &quot;4-2-1&quot; social dilemma: each worker will have to support four grandparents, two parents and one child. Savings rates will start falling as the elderly draw down their retirement funds. 16. (C) China will have to manage an economy increasingly dependent on domestic consumption and service industries for growth. Already, urbanites are buying 1,000 new cars per day, making China the world&apos;s largest Internet and luxury goods market, and traveling abroad in growing numbers. By 2025, China will have the world&apos;s largest middle class, and China will likely have completed the transition from the majority rural population of today to a majority urban population. These consumers of tomorrow will likely flock to products from around the world as their North American, European and Japanese counterparts do today, providing new opportunities for American business. If incomes continue to grow, it is likely that the Chinese middle class will react like educated urbanites in other countries by exerting pressure on the Government to improve its dismal performance on environmental protection, food and product safety. We are already seeing increased public activism over such issues today. 17. (C) China will face a challenge in the next thirty years encouraging this urban consumption while dealing with the social equality issues inherent in a rural population where over 200 million people still live on less than a dollar a day. China will also have to find a way to improve the lot of between 150 and 230 million migrant workers who today must leave their children and aging parents behind in their home villages to travel to the industrial centers of the BEIJING 00000022 004 OF 007 relatively developed coastal regions to work in factories or on construction projects. 18. (C) With China&apos;s phenomenal growth has come increased economic interdependence. This will likely increase, although some of the less-balanced elements of China&apos;s economic interactions should be mitigated. Rising consumption rates should work to lower China&apos;s trade surplus as well as its overabundance of foreign exchange reserves. More assets controlled by corporations and individuals, as opposed to the government, will diversify outward investment, reducing political control by Beijing, but also the utility of political suasion for U.S. policymakers interested in effecting the flow of capital to international hotspots. Chinese Nationalism and Confidence on the International Stage --------------------------------------------- ---------------- 19. (C) As one of two main pillars of post-Mao Chinese Communist Party rule (the other being sustained economic growth), Chinese nationalism is growing and should be monitored closely. As witnessed during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Chinese are increasingly proud of the tremendous strides their country has made in recent years. More and more young people see China as having &quot;arrived&quot; and might possess the confidence and willingness to assume the responsibilities of a major power. However, as was evident during protests over the 1999 mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the 2004 protests over Japanese textbooks, and more recently the anti-France diatribes that followed the roughing-up of a disabled Olympic torch bearer in Paris by Free Tibet supporters, this nationalism can also lead to jingoism. Chinese leaders of a system with few outlets to express political sentiments are faced with trying to give vent to the occasional uprising of nationalistic anger without letting it get out of hand or allowing it to focus on the failings of the central leadership. 20. (C) With notable exceptions like Zhou Enlai, Chinese foreign policy practitioners thirty years ago had little practical experience dealing with the West. Since then, Chinese diplomats and subject matter experts are increasingly well-educated, well-traveled and well-respected. Chinese diplomats at international fora such as the UN and the WTO have become adept at using procedural rules to attain diplomatic or commercial ends. This trend will likely continue in the coming decades, increasing the likelihood of American decision makers finding more able adversaries when we disagree on issues, but also more able partners where we can agree to jointly tackle a problem of mutual concern such as nonproliferation, alternative energy or pandemic influenza. 21. (C) While still reluctant to claim China is a global leader, Chinese officials are gradually gaining confidence as a regional power. By the end of the next 30 years, China should no longer be able to portray itself as the representative of lesser developed countries. This does not mean that it will necessarily identify with the more developed, mainly Western countries; it well might choose to pursue some uniquely Chinese path. In the coming 30 years, a U.S. President might be involved in negotiations with a Chinese leader seeking to reshape global financial institutions like the IMF or the WTO or establish rival institutions for non-Western countries in order to mitigate domestic Chinese concerns. Even so, China&apos;s growing position as a nation increasingly distinct from the less-developed world may expand our common interests and make it easier for the United States to convince China to act like a responsible global stakeholder. 22. (C) Foreign assistance coordination is another area of opportunity. China is rapidly ramping up its global economic presence, not only via resource extraction ventures and cheap exports, but increasingly via direct investment and assistance. This investment and assistance are welcome in most less-developed countries, whether in Africa or Southeast Asia, and particularly in countries where China&apos;s longstanding policy of &quot;no strings attached no political interference&quot; appeals to democratically-challenged dictators BEIJING 00000022 005 OF 007 and kleptocrats. However, China is already facing blowback as a result of its more cavalier approach to issues that more scrupulous donors have wrestled with for decades. Scant attention paid to worker safety, job opportunities for local people, environmental protection, and political legitimacy has had negative consequences for China on multiple occasions, from a tarnished international image and being used as a political whipping boy by opposition groups in democratic countries to unpaid loans, expropriated investments, and even the deaths of Chinese expatriates. As a result, China is beginning to understand the merits of international assistance standards not for altruistic reasons, but for achieving China&apos;s own bottom-line imperatives of a more secure international position and better-protected economic interests in third countries. This realization, coupled with China&apos;s growing economic clout on the world stage, make it quite possible that, in the next 30 years, China will come to be identified by the average citizen in less developed countries not as &quot;one of us&quot; but as &quot;one of them.&quot; 23. (C) In all likelihood, a new-found (if still somewhat grudging) PRC interest in internationally accepted donor principles such as transparency, good governance, environmental and labor protections, and corporate social responsibility will have matured in 30 years&apos; time, making China a reliable partner for the United States, other donor countries, and international organizations in alleviating poverty, developing infrastructure, improving education and fighting infectious disease. And as one of the world&apos;s premier economic powers, China can be expected to have all but discarded its over-worn and outdated &quot;non-interference&quot; rhetoric in the face of massive Chinese investment assets and other economic interests abroad. 24. (C) As evidenced by Chinese policies toward pariah states like Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma and Iran, China is still willing to put its need for markets and raw materials above the need to promote internationally accepted norms of behavior. However, the possible secession of southern Sudan (where much of the country&apos;s oil is found) from the repressive Khartoum-based Bashir regime, the erratic treatment of foreign economic interests in Zimbabwe by Robert Mugabe, the dangers to regional safety and stability posed by Burma&apos;s dysfunctional military junta, and the threat to China&apos;s energy security that a nuclear-armed Iran would represent have given Beijing cause to re-calibrate its previously uncritical stance toward these international outlaws. If China&apos;s integration into global economic and security structures continues apace, we would expect its tolerance for these sorts of disruptive players to decrease proportionately. 25. (C) China&apos;s work in the Six-Party Talks and the Shanghai Cooperative Organization may provide guidance as to how to accelerate this trend. China plays a leading and often responsible and constructive role in both of these multilateral groups. Future U.S. policy-makers might usefully consider additional international mechanisms that include both U.S. and Chinese membership such as the proposed Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism that may grow out of the Six-Party Talks. The Chinese themselves have suggested a Six-Party Talks-like grouping to address the Iran nuclear issue, perhaps a P5-plus-1-plus-Iran. In the future, we may wish to consider the United States joining the East Asia Summit (EAS). 26. (C) Likewise, as the Chinese economy takes up a larger portion of the global economy, it inevitably will become increasingly affected by the decisions of international economic and financial institutions. Similarly, China&apos;s economic decisions will have global implications, and its cooperation will become essential to solving global-scale problems. Drawing China constructively into regional and global economic and environmental dialogues and institutions will be essential. More and more experts see the utility of establishing an Asia-Pacific G-8, to include China, Japan, and the United States plus India, Australia, Indonesia, South Korea and Russia; others say the time is ripe to include China as a member of a G-9. Giving China a greater voice is seen as a way to encourage China to assume a larger burden in BEIJING 00000022 006 OF 007 supporting the international economic and financial system. Role of the Military -------------------- 27. (C) The disparate possibilities exist that in the coming decades the PLA will evolve into a major competitor, maintain only a regional presence or become a partner capable of joining us and others to address peacekeeping, peace-enforcing, humanitarian relief and disaster mitigation roles around the world. China may be content to remain only a regional power, but Deng Xiaoping&apos;s maxim urging China to hide its capabilities while biding its time should caution us against predicting that the PLA&apos;s long-term objectives are modest. In the years to come, our defense experts will need to closely monitor China&apos;s contingency plans and we will need to use every diplomatic and strategic tool we have to prevent intimidating moves toward Taiwan. In the coming years, Chinese defense capabilities will continue to improve. The PLA thirty years from today will likely have sophisticated anti-satellite weapons, state-of-the-art aircraft, aircraft carriers and an ability to project force into strategic sea lanes. 28. (C) Thirty years ago the PLA was a bloated political organization with antiquated equipment and tactics. Today, the PLA is leaner and is becoming a modern force. Chinese military and paramilitary units have participated in UN-sponsored peacekeeping missions in East Timor, Kosovo, Haiti and Africa. In December 2008, for the first time, the PLA Navy deployed beyond the immediate waters surrounding the country to participate in anything beyond a goodwill tour to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa. It is likely that China will continue to support UN-sponsored PKOs, and if the piracy expedition is successful, China might follow up with expeditions to future piracy hotspots such as the Strait of Malacca or elsewhere. 29. (C) Over the past thirty years, Chinese officials have come to begrudgingly acknowledge the benefits to East Asia resulting from the U.S. military presence in the Pacific, especially the extent that a U.S. presence in the Pacific is an alternative to a more robust Japanese military presence. A peaceful resolution of the threat posed by North Korea might cause China to call for an end to the U.S. base presence on the Korean Peninsula. Perceived threats to China&apos;s security posed by Japan&apos;s participation in missile defense or by future high-tech U.S. military technologies might cause tomorrow&apos;s Chinese leaders to change their assessment and to exert economic pressures on U.S. allies like Thailand or the Philippines to choose between Beijing and Washington. 30. (C) Whatever the state of our future relations with China, we will need to understand more about the Chinese military. Multilateral training and exercises are constructive ways to promote understanding and develop joint capabilities that could be used in real-life situations. In the coming years, the Chinese may be called upon to participate in regional peacekeeping and humanitarian relief exercises. Some of these could be handled under UN auspices, but others could be bilateral or multilateral. For instance, Cobra Gold, which is held every year in Thailand, is America&apos;s foremost military exercise in Asia. It has a peacekeeping component and since the December 2004 tsunami in Indian Ocean has included a humanitarian relief element. With proper buy-in by the Pentagon and PACOM, we could create a program to engage the PLA more directly both with our military and with friendly militaries in the region. Modest efforts at expanding search and rescue capabilities on the high seas, developing common forensic techniques for use in mass casualty events, conducting exercises with PLA units tasked with responding to civil nuclear emergencies, or table-top exercises for U.S. and Chinese junior officers could be steps that promote trust with little risk. At the same time, more frequent, regularly scheduled high-level reciprocal visits between Chinese and U.S. security officials might eventually lead to a constructive strategic security policy dialogue on nonproliferation, counterterrorism and other issues. BEIJING 00000022 007 OF 007 Taiwan and Human Rights ------------------------ 31. (C) Taiwan was the most vexing issue holding up the establishment of relations 30 years ago and remains the toughest issue for U.S.-China relations despite significant improvement in cross-Strait relations since the election of Taiwan President Ma. It will remain a delicate topic for the foreseeable future. We should continue to support Taiwan and Mainland efforts to reduce tension by increasing Taiwan&apos;s &quot;international space&quot; and reducing the Mainland&apos;s military build-up across from Taiwan. 32. (C) Thirty years ago, the Chinese state interfered in virtually every aspect of its citizens&apos; lives. An individual&apos;s work unit provided housing, education, medical care and a burial plot. Reeducation sessions and thought reform were common, churches and temples were closed, and average citizens had little access to the outside world. Today, Chinese have far greater ability to travel, read foreign media and worship. Nonetheless, the overall human rights situation falls well short of international norms. Today, China&apos;s growing cadre of well-educated urbanites generally avoids politics and seems more interested in fashion and consumerism than in ideology; after all, outside-the-box political thinking, much less activism, remains dangerous. However, any number of factors in the future ranging from rising unemployment among recent college graduates, or growing discontent over the income divide separating rich urbanites from poor peasants, to discontent among the mass of migrant workers could lead to unrest and increased political activism. The Chinese Government still responds with brutal force to any social, religious, political or ideological movement it perceives as a potential threat. Chinese political leaders&apos; occasional nods toward the need for political reform and increased democracy suggest a realization that the current one-party authoritarianism has its weak points, but do not promise sufficient relaxation of party control to create a more dynamically stable polity in the long term. 33. (C) While the U.S. model of democracy is not the only example of a tolerant open society, we should continue to push for the expansion of individual freedoms, respect for the rule of law and the establishment of a truly free and independent judiciary and press as being necessities for a thriving, modern society and, as such, in China&apos;s own interests. Someday, China will realize political reform. When that day comes, we will want to be remembered by Chinese for having helped China to advance.

Forden. Rea sons 1.4 (b/d). SUMMARY ------- 1. (C) While the 2008 first round of the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD) was a &quot;bloody disaster,&quot; the second meeting, held in London May 11, 2009, produced &quot;decent results,&quot; according to UK Embassy Econoff Tamsin Rees, who coordinated the UK Embassy&apos;s contributions to the event. Rees said that while EFD1 was marred by a protocol-driven, scripted exchange, EFD2 featured more dialogue, and benefited from substantive working-level exchanges in advance of the ministerial meeting on touchy topics like market access. Rees said key deliverables from EFD2 include a fast track patent program for green technologies, a bank assurance pilot project permitting Standard Life to establish an insurance business in China, and commitment to another round of the successful China-Africa Dialogue. (The full outcomes list is in paragraph nine.) Still, protocol snafus dogged EFD2, such as when various British Ministers came and left throughout the day. Rees added that the UK also earlier assembled its Ambassadors to the United States, France, Moscow, the United Nations, and the European Union for a Strategic Dialogue meeting with State Councilor Dai Bingguo, which featured a good off-the-record discussion on Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and some trade topics. End Summary. What Worked Well at the Second EFD -- Lessons for SnED --------------------------------------------- --------- 2. (SBU) Rees attributed the greater success of EFD2 to more open discussion, better preparation, a good atmosphere, and senior buy-in on the UK side. She said more free discussion had made a &quot;massive difference.&quot; The format limited the length of interventions to three minutes each. She said the UK had initially pushed for a two minute limit. There were 45-minute &quot;free discussion blocks&quot; on three key topics, which resulted in a 30-40 minute talk on trade and investment, a topic that China had initially resisted even including on the agenda, she said. In the end, Rees described Chinese delegation head Vice Premier Wang Qishan as &quot;very vocal&quot; and willing to talk off the cuff. She added that China was very interested in comments by the Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority on financial regulation. 3. (SBU) Rees added that an earlier series of working-level meetings contributed to the dialogue at the ministerial. Despite China&apos;s initial unwillingness to negotiate -- or even discuss -- some matters, the British were able to overcome this resistance by really pressing the Chinese. For example, the UK kept pushing for a &quot;joint statement&quot; to the press rather than the pre-prepared one preferred by the Chinese. Ultimately, British persistence meant the parties agreed on a statement which was much closer to the one the UK had envisioned. China also initially refused to discuss market access, but in the plenary lead-up the UK told China that they felt China was not taking the issue seriously. As a result, MOFCOM assembled 12 Chinese agencies for a half-day meeting with the UK Ambassador to discuss market access. At first, China agreed on six market access-related deliverables, but backed out the next day, likely over concern about making the concessions public, Rees assessed. 4. (SBU) Rees added that the setting of the meeting also facilitated an open conversation. The parties met in London&apos;s elegant Lancaster House, which is adjacent to Buckingham Palace. The UK offered China its own secretariat room. Chinese participants were free to enter and leave the facility as they pleased. Vice Premier Wang even had a room with a terrace and garden, allowing him to smoke between sessions. BEIJING 00001582 002 OF 005 5. (C) In contrast, Rees said EFD1 was a &quot;disaster&quot; and a &quot;protocol-driven waste of time.&quot; She lamented that a certain Chancellor, who came to Beijing from the World Bank-IMF Spring meetings in Washington &quot;was not engaged, was not sure why he was doing the event or what the goal was, and did not understand why the meeting had been upgraded from the existing financial dialogue.&quot; She added that he arrived in Beijing and &quot;decided he hated the press statement&quot; and wanted it re-written overnight. Charm Offensive, or Just Plain Offensive? ----------------------------------------- 6. (C) Nonetheless, EFD2 had a couple hiccups. Most notably, UK Ministers who were scheduled to participate decided at the last minute that they could not commit for the whole day, and instead came and left at various sessions, while the Chinese delegation stayed for the whole event. Rees admitted that it may have been a mistake to wait until the night before the event to inform the Chinese delegation of this change in format. 7. (C) She added that the Dalai Lama had transited the UK days before the event, that the UK had refused a visa to a Chinese violinist who was scheduled to perform at the Bank of China 80th anniversary dinner, which Vice Premier Wang attended, and that Wang claimed he is allergic to alcohol while the UK had planned a whiskey dinner. She added that the latter issue confused the UK side because the former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority had said he used to go drinking together with Wang. Dialogue Deliverables: Tiptoeing Forward... -------------------------------------------- 8. (SBU) The UK and China left EFD2 with a list of policy outcomes -- some substantive, some vague and nominal. Rees complained about the &quot;unwillingness on the part of the Chinese MFA to negotiate on anything.&quot; The parties split the plenary into four sessions within which they developed policy outcomes: Supporting Economic Growth and Welfare; Financial Stability and Capital Market Development; Supporting Green Growth through Bilateral Energy and Environment Cooperation; and Trade and Investment. Rees highlighted the following (the complete list is attached in para nine): - Climate: China insisted on couching everything climate-related in vague language, like &quot;the two sides will share expertise.&quot; China called the topic &quot;very sensitive&quot; and deleted all references to &quot;carbon markets,&quot; saying this was &quot;inconvenient to discuss.&quot; Rees speculated that China may want to refrain from making concessions to the UK as it prepares for multilateral climate talks in Copenhagen. - IPR: In addition to fast track patent licenses for green technology, Rees said there were additional IPR-related outcomes which were not included in the public announcement. - Africa: China agreed to propose a date for another round of the UK-China Africa Dialogue. In the last meeting, which Rees called a success, the UK delivered an assessment on the wider impact of Chinese investment in Africa. - Bank assurance pilot: China agreed to allow the UK&apos;s Standard Life to establish an insurance subsidiary and the UK agreed to permit Hainan Bank to do the same. Rees added that Wang Qishan&apos;s support on this was invaluable because coordination between the China Insurance Regulatory Commission and China Bank Regulatory Commission on this issue, which cut across their portfolios, had been a &quot;nightmare.&quot; - Financial sector: The parties agreed to allow UK firms to list in Shanghai and Chinese firms to list in London, which BEIJING 00001582 003 OF 005 Rees noted China had already previously agreed to do at the EFD1, but had failed to implement. Separate UK-China Foreign Policy Dialogue ----------------------------------------- 8. (SBU) Rees added that the UK also conducts a Strategic Dialogue with Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo. The UK lead is Simon McDonald, Prime Minister Brown&apos;s lead foreign policy advisor. At the most recent meeting in Beijing, McDonald assembled UK ambassadors to the United States, France, Moscow, the United Nations, and the European Union for an off-the-record, open walk-through with Chinese officials on key third country issues, like Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as some trade concerns. Text of EFD2 Outcomes Document ------------------------------ 9. (SBU) UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue II Policy Outcomes Session I: Supporting economic growth and welfare 1. We agreed the importance of safeguarding development in low income countries during the economic slowdown. We reaffirmed our commitment to meeting the Millennium Development Goals. China appreciates UK,s commitment to achieve the 0.7 percent ODA/GNI target at an earlier date. China and UK will make every effort to contribute to achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals through their respective channels. We also confirmed our support for a substantial increase in lending of at least $l00bn by the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), including to low-income countries, and will work to ensure that all MDBs have the appropriate capital. 2. We agreed that a crucial element of the global response is the role played by the international financial institutions. Following agreements reached at the London Summit, we reaffirmed our commitment to providing additional resources to the IMF. We also reiterated our commitment to reform the IMF. We agreed that the IMF,s governance structure must reflect changing weights in the world economy. We urge IMF and the World Bank to expedite governance structure reform, work out explicit timetable and roadmap, so as to complete the next review of quotas of IMF by January 2011 and agree on voice and representation reform of the World Bank by the 2010 Spring Meetings. 3. UK will consult and exchange views with China on the Department for International Development,s policies on development. 4. As part of the UK,s G20 Chair year, China and the South Africans will co-host the Financing for Development workshop under the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting. 5. UK and China agree to jointly draft a new M0U between the UK Department for Work and Pensions and the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security; Session II: Financial Stability and Capital Market Development 6. UK and China re-iterate their commitment to continue to take actions to reform the regulation of the financial sector as agreed in the London Summit communiqu, in line with the principles of strengthening transparency and accountability, enhancing sound regulation, promoting integrity in financial markets and reinforcing international cooperation. 7. UK and China agree to build on current regulatory exchange BEIJING 00001582 004 OF 005 and cooperation between their respective financial regulatory authorities (FSA, CBRC, CSRC and CIRC), including discussions between relevant parties on steps following China,s accession to the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 8. FSA and CIRC have exchanged letters on mutual cooperation; 9. Both sides will continue to support qualified Chinese companies to list on the London Stock Exchange through various listing routes, and work together swiftly to progress this. 10. China and UK agree to expand financial sector technical collaboration and exchange programme agreed by Vice-Premier Wang and Chancellor at the First EFD, specifically to focus on: -- Financial stability issues, including international financial sector standards; -- Capital market development covering equities and bond markets, product innovation and risk management; -- SME financing; -- Investor education; -- Insurance and private pensions; -- Asset management; -- Collaboration opportunities between the relevant parties of China and the UK-based International Centre for Financial Regulation. 11. China agrees to allow qualified foreign companies, including UK companies to list on its stock exchange through issuing shares or depository receipts in accordance with relevant prudential regulations; Session III: Supporting Green Growth through Bilateral Energy and Environment Cooperation 12. China and the UK commit to deepen cooperation on sustainable cities, as agreed under the Sustainable Cities Initiative MOU, through the pilots in Wuhan and Chongqing; 13. China and UK agree to conduct exchanges and cooperation on nuclear energy and offshore wind power development and construction, on implementing a quota system on renewable energy, and on improving industrial policies and management mechanism of renewable energy. 14. UK and China agree to share experiences on the role of economic ministries and other agencies in promoting green growth. 15.UK and China agree to discuss the possibility of fast-tracking green patents as a way to promote faster development of green technology. Session IV: Trade and Investment 16. We agree to follow up our commitment to support trade finance at the London Summit, and strongly support the IFC to establish the Global Trade Liquidity Pool, The UK has agreed to commit contributions up to 300m towards phase 1 of the initiative. China has purchased US$1.5 billion placement bonds to support the trade finance programme of the IFC. 17. We agree to work together to expand our bilateral trade in particular in aerospace, environmental protection, biological technology, pharmaceuticals electronics and advanced engineering. 18. UK reaffirms its support for China,s market economy status at as early a date as possible and will continue to play a constructive role to encourage EU recognition; BEIJING 00001582 005 OF 005 19. We are in full agreement on the advantages of maintaining free trade and the multi-lateral trading system. We must remain committed to the principles set out at the London Summit to reject all forms of protectionism, underpin prosperity and refrain from erecting new barriers to investment or trade. Both sides commit to continuing close cooperation, locking in of the consensus and outcomes achieved so far in the Doha round negotiations, to achieve a comprehensive and balanced conclusion of the negotiation at an early date. This would send a good signal of how the international community can work together to boost global prosperity and meet our development goals. 20. Both sides recognize the constructive role that sovereign wealth funds can play in stabilizing the world economy, and boosting global demand. The UK and China remain committed to open markets for investments, including those from Sovereign Wealth Funds. 21.China and the UK agree to take advantage of the Joint Economic and Trade Commission to explore effective ways to achieve the bilateral trade target and to enrich EFD Outcomes. 22. China and UK will actively implement the MOU on strengthening trade and investment cooperation in Chinese regional cities between the Ministry of Commerce of China and the Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the China-Britain Business Council of the UK, including in the mid-west of and the north east of China, so as to enhance the trade and investment cooperation between the two countries. 23. UK and China agree to discuss emerging ideas for how to create international model framework agreements for collaborative R&amp;D projects promoting further co-operation on innovation and technology projects and addressing technology transfer obstacles.

Huntsman for reasons 1.4 (b), (d) and (e). 1.(C) SUMMARY. We face a challenging year ahead in U.S.-China relations. Ten percent U.S. unemployment coupled with our huge trade deficit with China, China,s increasing use of industrial policies to restrict market access, and an undervalued RMB, will bring greater tension to bilateral ties. The Google case adds fuel to the fire. In this context, it is critical that we find ways to better advance our bilateral economic policy. This will require sustained, focused interaction on a daily basis with the Chinese, but also serious thinking about what can best be accomplished in the run-up to and at key meetings like the S&amp;ED and JCCT. We need to find ways to keep the relationship positive, but even more important to ensure the American worker, in particular, reaps the benefits of our bilateral economic engagement. 2.(C) We offer below some ideas on how we can move ahead on a concerted, targeted U.S. effort to boost U.S. job-creating exports of goods and services to China as well as increased job-creating Chinese investment and tourism to the United States. While we will continue to aggressively negotiate removal of Chinese barriers, we will need as well to get Chinese buy-in to several job-boosting initiatives. There are even things we can do ourselves unilaterally. Taken together, measures would include: - expanding sector-specific public private partnerships, - offering SMEs China-specific support, - building or retooling existing export promotion mechanisms, - making educational offerings in the U.S. more attractive (and in the process giving new generations of Chinese a reason for wanting to be in the U.S. market), - increasing pull factors for Chinese tourism to and investment in the U.S., and - enhancing the use of the Internet and other electronic means of communication in Chinese. 3.(C) We are aware that in a resource constrained environment, some of these will cost money, but we judge that the benefits will outweigh the costs and have a significant job-creating component. Some suggestions may be more palatable than others, and costs will vary widely, but we emphasize again that the potential benefits of each are substantial. Of course we need to do a better job in helping Americans understand that the China trade relationship can actually be a good story for U.S. jobs and pay dividends far beyond the trade sector. One final note: we accent the positive here in terms of what we can do but we certainly do not neglect that the continuing need to use available trade remedies and WTO consistent retaliatory action to ensure fairness and transparency. END SUMMARY. A ROUGH YEAR AHEAD, BUT OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENORMOUS --------------------------------------------- ----- 4.(C) Whereas 2009 was a year to build the U.S.-China relationship, 2010 will be a year that tests it. Strong Chinese economic and export growth coupled with an artificially undervalued RMB will further heighten focus on our huge trade deficit with China. Widespread perceptions that China,s industrial policies are rolling back market access add to the overall sense that China plays unfairly in the global marketplace. Other emerging issues, like Google,s problems and new rules on indigenous innovation, create a drumbeat of bad news stories for firms seeking to do BEIJING 00000231 002 OF 007 business in China. And as backdrop, the Chinese continue to signal intense displeasure with U.S. positions on issues from the Dalai Lama to Taiwan arms sales and Internet freedom, which they then cite as reasons why they may not cooperate with the U.S. on other issues. 5.(C) Yet, with ten percent U.S. unemployment, more than ever before we must ensure that our relations with China continue to pay real dividends -- especially in creating jobs for Americans. China is the world,s fastest growing major economy and should be providing opportunities for U.S. goods and services exports. Chinese companies, thanks to government-backed loans, monopolies and preferential treatment, are awash in cash and should be a source for investment in the U.S. economy -- investment that would help maintain and create jobs in the U.S. And, China,s rapidly growing middle and upper classes, while still only representing a fraction of its population, measure many tens of millions. They should provide an enormous pool of potential consumers of U.S. goods and services as well as tourism and education in the U.S. 6.(C) Virtually every major U.S. company has a presence in China. They recognize the potential and are trying hard to work around the obstacles to market access that China erects. For many of them, China was their sole profit-center during last year,s global economic downturn. However, for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are the engine of job creation in the United States, exporting to or doing business in China is still a daunting prospect. Overt market access barriers and regulatory constraints at the national and sub-national level increasingly and blatantly tilt the playing field to Chinese companies&apos; advantage. Chinese policies make it difficult to succeed in its market unless you establish a local presence, including production, something for which SMEs generally have neither the capital nor expertise. The opacity of China,s legal and regulatory systems and widespread official corruption also serve as barriers to U.S. businesses -- especially SMEs -- seeking to export to, or invest in, China. The lack of effective IPR protection, import-substitution policies, standards discriminate against foreign products and create obstacles to licensing of technology, and central and provincial/local government incentives to &quot;buy local,&quot; additionally skew the playing field against foreign firms. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN: PERCEPTIONS OF U.S. DISINCENTIVES TO TRAVEL, INVESTMENT --------------------------------------------- - 7.(C) Many in China perceive the U.S. as &quot;closed&quot; to Chinese and Chinese companies. Chinese businesspersons looking at investment opportunities around the globe are confused and intimidated by the different investment regulations and promotional activities in the fifty U.S. states. Businesspersons, potential tourists and students remain confused by U.S. visa regulations and, particularly in contrasting them with those of our competitors in Japan and Europe, perceive them as more restrictive than they actually are, even seeing them as &quot;hostile&quot; to Chinese travelers. Many Chinese and some U.S. firms complain that U.S. export controls are out-dated and costing us business as Chinese buyers travel to Europe to buy the same goods or services they cannot buy from American suppliers. JOB-BOOSTING APPROACHES: PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ------------------------------------------- 8.(C) There are no easy solutions to many of these challenges. However, we offer a range of possible initiatives and policy measures for interagency consideration that could help advance our efforts to maximize job-creating benefits from our relations with China. The proposals we BEIJING 00000231 003 OF 007 offer below include ones that would require Chinese buy in as well as some that the U.S. could initiate unilaterally. They are not exhaustive nor are they intended to substitute for continued aggressive negotiation of market access, but instead are meant to provide additional complementary actions to enhance our economic relations and achieve greater benefits for the American people. WIELDING STICKS --------------- 9.(C) Recent issues related to indigenous innovation, express delivery and on-line music content, for example, underscore that USG complaints about discriminatory policies - absent a credible threat of retaliatory action or other leverage -- are falling on increasingly deaf Chinese ears. China,s relatively strong economic position in the wake of the global financial crisis has intensified that trend. As has Chinese hubris that it can call the shots and determine the playbook under which it operates without disclosing the same to foreign firms. While WTO dispute settlement has worked well when applied, many of the problems we face in China,s market do not fall within WTO disciplines. We may want to consider ways to toughen up our talking points and enhance the use -- or perception of likely use -- of other real &quot;sticks&quot; in order to achieve market opening, job-creating objectives. This will require some consideration of just how much disruption in our economic relations we are willing to countenance if we must carry through on threats. -- HIGHLIGHT TO CHINESE POSSIBLE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION on hot-button issues like Renminbi valuation and carbon tariffs on Chinese imports. -- EMPHASIZE THAT CHINA,S INDUSTRIAL AND EXPORT-PROMOTION POLICIES WILL PROVOKE 421 CASES to be filed and positively considered. -- COORDINATE CHINA-DIRECTED TRADE AND ECONOMIC POLICY IN BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL SETTINGS with the EU and other trading partners, especially in Southeast Asia, that face similar challenges with China. -- CONTINUE TO PURSUE AS APPROPRIATE WTO CASES, with emphasis on sectors most closely tied to U.S. jobs. Consider possibility of using lower &quot;probable victory&quot; standard in deciding whether to initiate such cases. FOCUS OUR ENGAGEMENT ON JOBS ----------------------------- 10.(C) Given current U.S. unemployment levels we suggest the interagency prioritize our objectives over the next year on those areas most likely to create jobs in the U.S. In particular, we suggest: -- AN OVERARCHING FOCUS ON OPENING CHINESE MARKETS TO EXPORTS OF U.S. SERVICES in all of the key U.S.-China bilateral economic fora in 2010, including the S&amp;ED and JCCT. For example, a strong push to eliminate joint venture requirements in select services sectors could be negotiated in exchange for a Chinese-sought concession. -- PRIORITIZE OUR &quot;ASKS&quot; OF CHINA ON GOODS SECTORS THAT HAVE HIGHEST JOB-CREATION POTENTIAL AND STRONG CHINESE GROWTH POTENTIAL, and intensify our advocacy in these areas through the methods outlined below. BANG FOR THE BUCK: INCREASE AND DIVERSIFY EXPORT PROMOTION --------------------------------------------- 11.(C) Since 2005, very conservative estimates show that BEIJING 00000231 004 OF 007 U.S. exports of goods to China created 285,000 jobs in the United States. In that same period, every dollar of funding for export promotion activities facilitated an average of USD 617 in exports to China. While many of the programs listed below would require either a shift in or new funding, those investments would quickly payoff. To increase U.S. exports to China in the near and medium term, it is essential that we expand and enhance existing export promotion programs, including: -- EXPAND SECTOR-SPECIFIC PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. For example, the highly successful Aviation Cooperation Program, or ACP, was founded with support from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA). It now has over 40 corporate members, sponsored training for over 100 Chinese aviation professionals, and has introduced U.S. firms and technology throughout China,s aviation industry and regulatory structure. USG participation has helped U.S. firms build relationships with local officials that are crucial to doing business here. Likewise, an Energy Cooperation Program was established in 2009 along these same lines and healthcare is a strong candidate for immediate consideration for a similar new partnership. -- OFFER SMEs INCENTIVES TO TEST NEW MARKETS HERE. Japan, Korea, and Germany offer SMEs loans or subsidies to offset costs of travel, trade show participation, market entry, and business matchmaking. They help companies develop procurement strategies to be more price competitive. Such measures are currently proscribed under the U.S. system. -- TELL THE STATES WE ARE READY TO HELP: Present at Annual Governor&apos;s Association meeting and other state venues on Mission services to help their states connect to counterparts in China. -- ESTABLISH FEDERAL AND/OR STATE-LEVEL INCUBATOR PROGRAMS, which help companies during market entry by Leveraging public-private partnerships to support new exporters. The German government partners with the German Chamber of Commerce in supporting the German Center Beijing. For start-up companies, the Center offers office space, conference facilities, in-depth counseling and practical advice from lawyers, accountants and market and sales professionals. In-house service providers assist German companies with a full range of services helping them compete. By developing public-private partnerships that join business expertise and government assistance, the USG could offer comparable one-stop service to U.S. companies to help level the playing field with competitors. -- DUPLICATE THE &quot;COOPERATOR&quot; PROGRAMS of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) in other sectors. FAS spends $25 million annually on cooperator programs in China to help companies create, expand and maintain long-term export markets for U.S. agricultural products. Those funds are matched by industry. TDA funds might help. -- FURTHER EXPAND FCS ACTIVITY IN CHINA, one of the most effective ways to spur export promotion. This will have a big bang for the buck in terms of across-the-board commercial outreach. -- FUND THE HIRING OF FCS EXPORT-PROMOTION CONTRACTORS IN THE 14 CHINESE SECOND-TIER CITIES that have been identified by Commerce as having the best U.S. export opportunities (these 14 cities, each of which has a population in excess of one million, currently receive 53% of all U.S. exports to China). -- CAPITALIZE ON CHINESE OUTWARD DIRECT INVESTMENT TO THIRD COUNTRIES. For example, the Embassy could organize match-making events to introduce U.S. upstream design and managerial services firms to Chinese design/build firms that BEIJING 00000231 005 OF 007 have contracts for infrastructure projects using PRC concessional loans in Asia, Africa and Latin America. -- SEEK TO REDUCE U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS ON SALES OF JOB-CREATING TECHNOLOGIES that are readily available from our allied competitors (semiconductors manufacturing equipment, microwave chambers, composite prepregs). We know that there is an ongoing discuss about export controls in the U.S. and well recognize the national security implications of how we view export controls. ENCOURAGE CHINESE INVESTMENT IN THE U.S. ---------------------------------------- 12.(C) Apart from misperceptions of an unwelcoming political Environment and periodic complaints that key high tech investments are denied routinely due to CFIUS concerns, Chinese companies view the U.S. economy as an attractive investment destination. Dispelling harmful myths and actively promoting direct Chinese investment would help us capture a larger share of China,s rapidly growing ODI levels (PRC ODI to the world roughly doubled from $27 billion in 2007 to $56 billion in 2008), which in turn would create more U.S. jobs. In this regard, the following steps should be considered: -- THE INTERNET. We should create many more Chinese language websites that are directed at key secondary and tertiary cities in China. The more we facilitate access to information about American business opportunities -- whether through a national database or enhanced state and local databases -- the better. We believe thinking local, start-ups and grassroots first is the preferable way to go in using the Internet -- ENHANCE THE ADMINISTRATION&apos;S INVEST IN AMERICA PROGRAM. Other countries have national promotion programs that work with Chinese companies to help them identify industry clusters or target locations based on their criteria. -- DIRECT FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT STATE INVESTMENT-SPONSORED BUYING OR INVESTMENT MISSIONS originating in China. -- ADD INVESTMENT PROMOTION TO THE AGENDA OF VISITING CABINET AND OTHER HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS (conduct roundtables with influential Chinese business leaders who could move substantial investment to the United States). -- CONDUCT A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN to erase misperceptions about the scope of CFIUS restraints, including use of existing bilateral fora like the S&amp;ED, Investment Forum, and JCCT and &quot;investment missions&quot; to provincial capitals and second-tier cities. -- EXTEND THE VALIDITY OF U.S. B-1/B-2 visas for Chinese travelers. EXPANDING TOURISM AND EDUCATIONAL TRAVEL ---------------------------------------- 13.(C) A fundamental Chinese misperception that our doors are closed constrains growth in Chinese travel to the U.S. across a wide range of categories, as does the confusing diversity of state-level programs on tourism and education. A rich and sustained effort to overcome these factors could pay rapid and substantial job-creating dividends. We need to create a buzz in the street that travel to America for business for other reasons is actually pretty easy. And that traveling in America is generally easy and without restrictions. We propose the U.S. consider: -- ESTABLISH A CHINA-SPECIFIC TRAVEL AND TOURISM AUTHORITY. BEIJING 00000231 006 OF 007 A national body to encourage the rapidly growing pool of Chinese tourists to spend leisure time in the U.S. could accelerate growth in individual travel and boost group travel. Local U.S. tourism offices need help understanding what attracts Chinese visitors. -- DUPLICATE IN OTHER FIRST-TIER CHINESE CITIES THE NATIONAL TOURISM ASSOCIATION (NTA) program office that was created in DOC,s Shanghai Commercial Center (NTA received a supporting Market Cooperator Grant). -- INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF OUTREACH PROGRAMS to educate Chinese public on the visa process, including intense public diplomacy through media channels. The more visitors, the more money they will spend and we enhanced &quot;see America&quot; program will create good service sector related jobs in the travel and tourism industry. -- SEEK TO EXTEND VISA RECIPROCITY FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS IN ALL VISA CATEGORIES. The Embassy has just negotiated the extension of visa reciprocity for select categories to five years. Expanding this to all visa categories would dramatically help promote U.S. openness to legitimate travel. (By contrast, U.S. visa reciprocity with Thailand is ten years.) -- EXPAND STATE,S EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS INITIATIVES to provide student advising and enhance student mobility between the U.S. and China as well as to support American universities, professional and technical training efforts to bring more Chinese adult students to the United States for training. It is notable that the number of Chinese in the United States for non-university education has nearly doubled in the last few years, demonstrating that U.S. education services are sought by Chinese and are an industry in which jobs could be created. -- EXPAND FEDERAL DIRECTION AND SUPPORT TO PROMOTE community and state college recruitment of Chinese graduate and undergraduate students. -- WORK TO CHANGE CHINESE PERCEPTIONS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF UNIVERSITY RANKINGS and promote enrollment in a broader range of U.S. institutions. DANGLING CARROTS ---------------- 14.(C) Where China is already seeking assistance from us or encouraging investment, we should capitalize on that interest for job promotion. For example: -- ADVERTISE MORE EFFECTIVELY FOREIGN-FRIENDLY INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA, especially those that are already with PRC encouragement and which are tied to follow-on U.S. goods exports (current examples include mining and logistics management). -- IDENTIFY AND REDUCE USG-CREATED BARRIERS TO GROWTH IN THOSE SECTORS WITH THE MOST POTENTIAL IN CHINA. Green technologies is the most potent example. U.S. subsidies to R&amp;D in green technologies, specifically solar panels, expire biannually. That unpredictability stymies long-term R&amp;D by U.S. companies in the field, a detriment to their competitiveness in the industry. Establishing a long-term program for R&amp;D would increase U.S. competitiveness. -- LEVERAGE CHINESE INTEREST IN TECHNICAL EXCHANGES WITH EPA, FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES to extract specific commitments on expanded market opportunities for U.S.-based services in related fields, consistent with U.S. health and safety interests.

(SBU) The following cable provides information on security, public diplomacy, political, and consular activities related to the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Games as of 08/10/2008. 2. (U) The interagency USG Joint Operations Center (JOC) can be contacted on a 24-hour basis at the following numbers: - JOC Direct Line: 011-86-010-6532-6966. - U.S. Embassy Beijing: 011-86-010-6532-3431, JOC extension 6200. - JOC fax: 011-86-010-6532-4763. - STE and fax: 011-86-010-6532-5163. KEY ISSUES ---------- 3. (SBU) In what appears to be a random act of violence, the U.S. Embassy has confirmed that three U.S. citizens and their Chinese guide were attacked at Beijing,s Drum Tower by a knife-wielding assailant on 08/09/2008 (ref. a). One of the Americans, Todd Bachman, was killed and his wife, Barbara Bachman, was taken to Peking Union Hospital where she currently remains in &quot;serious but stable&quot; condition. The third American, Elisabeth Bachman McCutcheon--the daughter of the two victims and the wife of the U.S. Men,s Indoor Volleyball team coach Hugh McCutcheon--was not injured but spent the night in the hospital. The Bachmans, two other daughters are scheduled to arrive in Beijing on 08/10/2008 at 2135 hours on a Northwest flight. They will be met by U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) representatives and an Embassy officer. White House and Embassy doctors continue to provide assistance to the family at the hospital. On 08/09/2008, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei visited the hospital to express deep sympathy to the U.S. Government and the relatives of the victims. The U.S. Ambassador to China also visited the hospital and conveyed President Bush&apos;s heartfelt condolences. President Bush has praised China&apos;s leadership for its quick response to the deadly attack. 4. (SBU) The perpetrator, identified as Chinese citizen Tang Yongming, appears to have acted alone and leaped to his death after the attack; he was reportedly 47 years old and from Zhejiang Province. At this time there is no known motive, nor is there any indication that the attack was related to the victims, nationality or Olympic affiliation. According to China,s official state media, Tang was unemployed but had no criminal record. Chinese law enforcement officials are investigating the incident in BEIJING 00003067 002 OF 005 cooperation with their U.S. counterparts and the U.S. Embassy will provide updates to the USOC security office as they are received from the Chinese. SECURITY ISSUES ----------------- 5. (S/REL to USA, FVEY) Threats: Olympics Possible Target for East Turkestan Groups: Tearline information indicates that, &quot;According to a Chinese intelligence officer in early July 2008, al-Qa&apos;ida second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahiri has tasked former East Turkestan terrorists to travel to China to conduct terrorist attacks at the Olympics. Potential targets include: the U.S. President and Secretary of State; the UK Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary; the Olympics opening and closing ceremonies; the cities of Shanghai and Hong Kong; Olympic programs; and VIP tourists. The terrorists are apparently bomb-making experts and may carry micro bomb-making material in plastic products, jewelry, and crystal ornaments across the border with them. According to the Chinese intelligence officer, al-Qa&apos;ida and East Turkestan terrorist groups would have different targets, with East Turkestan groups primarily targeting Olympic facilities and landmarks and not targeting U.S. VIPs or the U.S. Embassy.&quot; The same source previously cited information from July indicating a threat to the U.S. and Afghan Presidents during the Olympics Opening Ceremony (ref. b). [Source removed] 6. (S/NF) Europe-Based Uighur on Possible Attacks in China: The Albanian State Intelligence Service on 08/06/2008 provided information indicating that the two people arrested in connection with the 08/04/2008 attack against police in Kashgar, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, were not connected to the East Turkestan Islamic Party (ETIP), although ETIP supported the action. This information was reportedly obtained from an ethnic Uighur claiming first-hand access, who also stated that such incidents would continue to occur in China, especially before and during the 2008 Olympic Games. [Source removed] 7. (SBU) Incidents: Violence in Kuqa, Xinjiang: According to Xinhua, China&apos;s state media agency, several explosions occurred on 08/10/2008 in the town of Kuqa in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region; witnesses report seeing flashes of fire and hearing sporadic gunshots after the explosions. Chinese Internet press (sohu.com) has reported that two people threw explosives at a police station and another site, injuring three, and that five &quot;lawless persons&quot; were shot BEIJING 00003067 003 OF 005 dead on the spot. Police and military have reportedly sealed off the area. An individual who answered a U.S. Embassy Officer&apos;s phone call to Kuqa County People&apos;s Hospital declined to comment on whether the attacks had taken place but said no foreigners were injured. The local Public Security Bureau (PSB) also told the Embassy that no foreigners were involved in any way. Kuqa is located 427 kilometers from the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi and is approximately 2600 kilometers from Beijing. An attack against police in the Xinjiang city of Kashgar left 16 dead and 16 injured on 08/04/2008; Chinese authorities have claimed that incident was an act of terrorism. 8. (SBU) False Fire Alarm: On the evening of 08/09/2008, the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) representative in the JOC was notified that guests at the J.W. Marriott hotel in Beijing were evacuated afte a technician working on an electrical panel accidentally set off the fire alarm. Guests were allowed to return to their rooms after it was determined that the alarm had been sounded in error. 9. (SBU) Olympic Protests: Pro-Tibetan Protesters Removed from China: Advocates for Tibetan independence continue to be detained and deported on the same day by Chinese officials in response to their ongoing campaign of well-organized protests in Beijing. These protesters, along with those detained in earlier Tibet-related demonstrations, all appear to be part of &quot;Team Tibet,&quot; in which &quot;Students for a Free Tibet&quot; (SFT) and other Tibetan advocacy groups have orchestrated a series of actions to unfurl banners and fly Tibetan flags in public areas in Beijing and elsewhere. In cases involving U.S. citizens, the U.S. Embassy has first learned of all three incidents from XXXXXXXXXXXX. To date, the following pro-Tibet incidents--reported by the same caller--have occurred in Beijing: 08/09/2008--Five persons, including three Americans, detained at Tiananmen Square; American citizens deported to Los Angeles and Hong Kong. 08/08/2008--Three Americans detained at the National Stadium (&quot;Bird&apos;s Nest&quot;) before the Olympic opening ceremony; deported to Los Angeles. 08/06/2008--Four persons, including two Americans, detained near the National Stadium (&quot;Bird,s Nest&quot;); American citizens deported to Los Angeles. 10. (SBU) Hong Kong Protests: According to various media reports, at least six protesters were removed from the Sha Tin Olympic Equestrian venue in Hong Kong in reaction to separate incidents during the dressage competition on BEIJING 00003067 004 OF 005 08/09/2008. Among the six were reportedly two American citizens belonging to the &quot;Students for a Free Tibet&quot; organization. All protesters attempted to display either Tibetan flags or banners calling for an end to human rights abuses in China and were escorted from the arena by venue security. In one incident, the demonstrator refused to leave and was forcibly removed from the area. SECURITY OPERATIONS ------------------- 11. (SBU) Olympic Venues Protected by Infrared Wall: According to a report in Beijing Zhongguo Xinwen She, more than 400 infrared poles have been installed around the central zone of the Olympic Games, forming an &quot;infrared protective wall&quot; at the &quot;Bird&apos;s Nest&quot; National Stadium, the Water Cube Aquatic Center, and other important Olympic competition venues. The devices alert security when a human body breaks the infrared barrier. The Olympic Village, Main Media Center, and other facilities are protected by a wider infrared screen formed by a total of 2,002 infrared poles. 12. (SBU) Shenyang Security Update: According to the Regional Security Officer (RSO) in Shenyang, as of 08/10/2008 security is at the highest levels seen to date in the general vicinity of the Olympic stadium, the Marvelot and Sheraton hotels, and the Riverside Garden residential complex. Chinese SWAT team members have been observed patrolling on every block and Peoples Armed Police (PAP) squads are present at two block intervals along main streets. In addition, groups of Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers wearing their Olympic sweat suits have congregated at major intersections, where traffic police officers have augmented or replaced regular crossing guards. Police officers are also located in the lobbies of buildings at Riverside Garden, which is home to U.S., Korean, and Japanese diplomats, as well as to a wide variety of other foreign nationals. PSB vans with several occupants have been stationed at each entrance to the community. VIPS ---- 13. (SBU) The USG Delegation to the Opening Ceremony--headed by the President of the United States--remains in Beijing; the Delegation is expected to depart the city as scheduled on 08/11/2008.

(SBU) Air Quality: The UK Telegraph reports that the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology ordered its European partners in a Beijing air-quality monitoring effort to close down a website (already restricted to password holders) that on 08/08/2008 reported an air pollution index (API) of 101-150 in the area of Beijing in which the Olympic Green is located. The Chinese Government reported an API of 95 that day, which is under the 100 API which the government deems as acceptable air quality. Subscribers to the website received an email on 08/08/2008 saying the site would no longer be accessible, even by password. The e-mail reportedly stated the sponsors were &quot;very sorry to have to let you know that at the request of our Chinese partners in this project we are unable to provide public access to the Beijing Air Quality forecasts during the Olympic Games period.&quot; Christine McHugh, a researcher with the company, was quoted as saying its partner, the Ministry of Science and Technology, had given no reason for the order to close the website. 17. (U) Georgian Athletes Will Remain: Despite rumors that Georgian Olympic athletes were going to withdraw from the Games to protest Russia&apos;s military actions in Georgia, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has announced that they will remain in Beijing until the completion of the Olympics. According to Tbilisi&apos;s Kavkas Press, the Georgian athletes reversed their decision on departure only after President Saakashvili asked them to stay to show their strength on the Olympic stage.

Randt, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). Summary ------- 1. (C) As Beijing prepares to host the Olympic Games in August 2008, the city is taking a number of measures to lessen air pollution, Beijing Mayor Wang Qishan told the Ambassador over dinner on August 29, calling this month&apos;s four-day experiment in which half the city&apos;s cars were taken off the road &quot;a success.&quot; The city will complete two new subway lines and an airport monorail in time for the Games and will embark on an ambitious plan to dramatically expand the city&apos;s subway system by 2015. Security and meeting exacting International Olympic Committee (IOC) specifications for venues are other challenges Beijing faces in getting ready for the Games. The Mayor was sanguine about the city&apos;s real estate market, dismissing concerns over a bubble. Wang lamented that his job as mayor has been grueling, commenting that in his four-and-a-half-year tenure, he has not taken a single vacation. Wang denied rumors reported in the Western press that he is in store for a promotion at this fall&apos;s 17th Party Congress, claiming that he plans to remain as Mayor through at least early 2009. End Summary. A Friendly Dinner ----------------- 2. (C) Ambassador and Mrs. Randt hosted Beijing Mayor Wang Qishan and his wife for dinner on August 29 to thank the Mayor for his assistance in the city&apos;s making road improvements and supplying permanent power to the New Embassy Compound. The Mayor discussed at length the challenges he faces in governing Beijing, particularly as it prepares to host the Summer 2008 Olympic Games, and dismissed rumors that he might be transferred out of Beijing this fall. Mayor Wang&apos;s Future: No Plans to Move ------------------------------------- 3. (C) Responding to gossip reported by Reuters in April that he might be appointed Guangdong Province Party Secretary and promoted to the Politburo at this fall&apos;s 17th Party Congress, Mayor Wang said he &quot;had not heard&quot; any such rumor and planned to be Mayor through the August 2008 Olympic Games. In fact, Wang said, his intention is to &quot;pass the Olympic torch&quot; to Mayor Ken Livingstone of London, which will host the next summer Olympic Games after Beijing, in January 2009. Olympics Challenges: Pollution, Transport, Security, Specs --------------------------------------------- ------------- 4. (C) Mayor Wang described a number of challenges Beijing faces in hosting the Olympic Games. First and foremost is dealing with air pollution. This month&apos;s four-day experiment in which half of Beijing&apos;s cars were kept off the roads based on odd and even license plate numbers was a success, Wang asserted. The experiment brought traffic volume down to 2002 levels, resulting in much smoother traffic patterns. Given that traffic in the city in 2002 was heavily congested, the experiment&apos;s success demonstrates that the city has constructed a large number of new roads in the last five years. Moreover, although he was hesitant to say that Beijing enjoyed blue skies during the four-day period, taking cars off the road did in fact result in much improved air quality. (Note: Per reftel, while the test improved traffic congestion, published pollution data was less conclusive on the amount of reduced pollution attributable to the car-ban. Emissions experts doubted the usefulness of such a short-term test to produce accurate conclusions.) The city will also bring online five new, clean gas-fired power plants in time for the Games, Wang continued. By that point, Capital Iron and Steel Works, a significant polluter, will have gone to a &quot;minimal&quot; production schedule, the Mayor explained. 5. (C) Turning to Beijing&apos;s public transportation system, Mayor Wang said the city has 140 kilometers of subway, but by May 2008 two new subway lines will be completed, including a line that runs north from city hall to the main Olympic Games site. The capital&apos;s new airport monorail will also be finished in time for the Games. Looking beyond the Olympics, the Mayor described a long-term plan to expand the city&apos;s subway lines to 5,000 kilometers by 2015, to include satellite parking lots near subway stations around the city perimeter designed to increase dramatically residents&apos; use of public transportation. 6. (C) Security is another challenge, Wang said, commenting BEIJING 00005705 002 OF 002 that he greatly appreciates international cooperation on security for the Games. Meeting the &quot;very strict&quot; IOC specifications for Olympics venues was another significant issue. An example, the Mayor related, is the sand used for the beach volleyball site in the city&apos;s Chaoyang district, which has to meet exacting requirements for purity and softness. In the end, Beijing had to bring in sand all the way from Hainan Island in order to meet IOC specifications. (Note: Independently we understand the amount necessary is 17,000 tons.) Real Estate Demand Booming -------------------------- 7. (C) Mayor Wang was sanguine about the health of the city&apos;s real estate market and dismissed concerns over a bubble, claiming that demand for real estate in China&apos;s capital is growing. Although he expressed concern about the global impact of the subprime mortgage problem, he said he is not worried about the value of the city&apos;s real estate, since very little is purchased for the purpose of speculation. For example, the city&apos;s financial district is already completely booked up. Newcomer financial institutions like Deutsche Bank have had to locate their headquarters elsewhere, such as in the Chaoyang district in Deutsche Bank&apos;s case, as there is no room remaining for them to build in the financial district. Every major successful company in China, both domestic and international, must have a headquarters in Beijing. For example, Bao Gang steel company of Shanghai, China&apos;s largest, is building a new headquarters on Chang&apos;an Avenue in the center of Beijing. The city has 140 million square meters of internal building space and is adding an additional 30 million square meters per year. Beijing has a &quot;long way to go&quot; to meet the high demand for real estate and office space, Mayor Wang confidently declared. It&apos;s Hard Being Mayor --------------------- 8. (C) Though optimistic about his city&apos;s future, Wang lamented that his job as mayor has been grueling. As the city&apos;s leader, he has to understand and be able to respond to every issue the city faces, day and night. Consequently, he confided, in his four and one-half years as mayor, he has not taken a single vacation.

But this four-month-old cub might still have had good reason to apply his paws to the dark circles of his face to check his eyes weren&apos;t deceiving him. Despite resembling a particularly feverish ursine nightmare \u2014 or surreal TV show \u2014 these photographs, taken last week in Sichuan province, China, document the latest efforts to safeguard the endangered animal. The cub, which was born to a captive mother over the summer at the Hetaoping Research and Conservation Centre for the Giant Panda, in Wolong nature reserve, is being prepared for a life in the wild. If all goes to plan the animal, who weighs just over 8kg (18lb), will be the first such panda to go back to its natural habitat. To ensure the environment is as free as possible from human contact and influence, researchers at the centre slip into their panda suits when physical examinations are called for. Staff are also using hidden cameras to monitor their charge&apos;s progress. What the young panda, said to be doing well, made of his kidnap by odd creatures in fancy dress is anyone&apos;s guess. But the expression in his eyes as his two ersatz parents lean over him (right) suggests he might have had a fair idea of what was going on. The panda houses at Wolong were destroyed by the 7.9-magnitude earthquake that tore through Sichuan province in May 2008, killing 90,000 people and leaving millions homeless. Four members of Wolong&apos;s staff died, and the traumatised pandas had to be nursed back to health with hugs, games and copious quantities of bamboo. A \u00a0new centre, which is costing 1.3bn yuan (\u00a3124m), is under construction about six miles from Wolong&apos;s former panda breeding centre. The breeding programme has some innovative methods, which include showing pandas wildlife DVDs to help them learn about sex and rearing young. Ten pandas born at the centre after the quake were taken to Shanghai in January for the city&apos;s World Expo. Only about 1,600 pandas live in the wild, mostly in south-west Sichuan.

Around 470,000 15-year-olds across the world sat a numeracy, literacy and science test last year, the results of which inform the latest Pisa study by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) is highly respected across the globe, and enables politicians and policy-makers to assess how different countries&apos; education systems compare. It shows the UK&apos;s reputation as one of the world&apos;s best for education is at risk, and has tumbled several places since 2006. The UK is ranked 25th for reading, 28th for maths and 16th for science. In 2006, when 57 countries were included in the study, it was placed 17th, 24th and 14th respectively. Poland has stretched ahead of the UK in maths, while Norway is now ranked higher in reading and maths. Andreas Shleicher, head of the Pisa programme, said the picture for the UK was &quot;stagnant at best&quot;. &quot;Many other countries have seen quite significant improvement,&quot; he added. The UK performs at about average in reading and maths for countries within the OECD. It is slightly above average in science. In reading, the UK&apos;s average score is 494, compared with an OECD average of 493. In maths, our score is 492 and in science 514. The OECD averages are 496 and 501 respectively. Countries and partnership economies outside the OECD are also included in the study. The highest performing region across all the tests is Shanghai-China, with a mean score of 556 \u2013 far higher than any other. The second highest scoring is Korea, with 539, with Finland coming third at 536. The UK government has made it clear it has been inspired by the Finnish education system in its proposed reforms of schools in England. The UK spends \u00a354,000 per student, while Germany and Hungary achieve a similar performance for \u00a340,000 and \u00a328,000, the study found. Only seven other OECD countries spend more per student than the UK. The UK spends an average sum on secondary school teachers, but our teachers work longer hours than the average across the OECD. The study found that in the UK, the gap between boys and girls was bigger in maths than it was for most other countries. Boys were 20 points ahead of girls. Within the UK, there is little difference in the performance of 15-year-olds who attend a school in a town or city and their peers who go to a school in the countryside. This is not the case in many countries, such as Hungary, where those living in rural areas are two years behind their urban peers. Students of Pakistani descent perform better in the UK than they do in many other countries, the researchers found, taking socio-economic factors into account. The UK has a greater variation in reading standards, which are attributed to class differences, than almost every other country in the OECD. The proportion of students from poor homes who achieve higher than expected scores is lower in the UK than across the OECD on average. Just 24% of UK students perform better than would be expected given their background. The OECD average is 31%. In Finland, Japan and China, 40% of students from poor homes exceed expectations. In reading, the UK score was similar to Hungary&apos;s but below that of Japan, the US, France and Germany \u2013 18% of UK teenagers did not reach the basic reading level, which is in line with the OECD average. In the UK, slightly higher than average proportions of students reach a very high level in science \u2013 1.9%, compared with an OECD average of 1.1%. The UK has the 14th highest share of students who were not born in the country, and is one of only a few countries where richer pupils have more teachers than poorer ones. Only in Israel, Slovenia, Turkey and the US is this also the case. Parental expectations are higher in the UK than in most OECD countries and our provision of after-school clubs is better. Michael Gove, the education secretary, said he was daunted &quot;by the scale of the challenge&quot;. &quot;Other countries have been improving rapidly and despite the massive investment over the last 13 years, we haven&apos;t been improving at the rate we should have been. We are not getting value for money and we&apos;ve got to ensure we do better.&quot; He said that other regions and nations had succeeded in &quot;closing the gap&quot;. &quot;They have made opportunity more equal, democratised access to knowledge and placed an uncompromised emphasis on higher standards all at the same time.&quot; Andy Burnham, Labour&apos;s shadow education secretary, said that English schools were better today than they were in the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;We should build on this strong foundation to keep driving up standards so they are on a par with the best in the world.&quot; Top countries in the Pisa study (Shanghai-China) Korea Finland Hong Kong-China Singapore Canada New Zealand Japan Australia Netherlands Belgium Norway Estonia Switzerland Poland Iceland United States Liechtenstein Sweden Germany Ireland France Chinese Taipei Denmark United Kingdom", "tags": ["Schools", "Numeracy", "Mathematics", "Literacy", "Science", "Education", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-07T10:56:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/08/global-flotations-on-course-to-beat-record", "sentences": ["The biggest initial public offer (IPO) of new shares so far in 2010 was in Hong Kong and Shanghai, where Agricultural Bank of China raised $22.1bn, making it the biggest float in history."], "title": "Asian boom fuels record year for floats", "article": "The amount raised in stockmarket flotations around the world this year is expected to break the 2007 record of $300bn (\u00a3190bn), according to research from accountants Ernst &amp; Young.

In the UK, the change of government, uncertainty over budget cuts and fears of a double dip recession have put off scores of companies from listing on the London Stock Exchange. The biggest initial public offer (IPO) of new shares so far in 2010 was in Hong Kong and Shanghai, where Agricultural Bank of China raised $22.1bn, making it the biggest float in history. Agricultural was closely followed by AIA, an offshoot of American insurer AIG, which collected over $20bn after its IPO in Hong Kong. E&amp;Y says that in the first 11 months of this year, 1,199 companies have raised $255bn ($94.6bn, 2009) with Chinese firms accounting for more than 45% of the value. David Wilkinson, UK IPO leader at E&amp;Y said: &quot;The IPO market reflects the twin-track global economy with Europe and the US trailing Asia, where GDP is racing ahead. I think next year will be a similar story, with perhaps more action from Latin America, especially Brazil. South America has recovered less quickly from the recession than China and India, but is now rebounding strongly.&quot; In the UK, 50 companies listed in London during the first 11 months of this year, up from seven in the whole of 2009, raising $10bn. But the year began badly with turbulent markets persuading the private equity owners of Travelport, Merlin Entertainment and New Look to pull their IPO plans in February. Supergroup, the pharmacy chain, Essar Energy and Barrick Gold have been rare British success stories as their shares today trade at a premium to their IPO offer prices. The same cannot be said of Ocado, the online retailer, whose stock price has bombed. Gartmore, the troubled fund manager has seen its share price dive since it floated at the end of 2009. Promethean (educational technology) and Betfair (online gambling) have also performed badly since floating in 2010. Wilkinson said: &quot;I am afraid it hasn&apos;t been a great year for the UK; shares in only four or five newly floated UK companies are today trading above the price at which they sold their shares to the public, so it&apos;s quite a sorry affair. We expected a much brighter picture back in January.&quot; He was reluctant to make predictions for the British IPO market in 2011, beyond saying there is &quot;a pipeline of companies waiting to list their shares, but if investors demand knockdown prices, firms may conclude now is not the time to sell.&quot; E&amp;Y says in the emerging markets, there is still everything to play for with a large number of firms earmarked for privatisation in 2011 and 2012, particularly financial institutions, commodities groups and industrial firms. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 December 2010.

I&apos;ve thought long and hard about this selection, and have had to leave out some brilliant contenders \u2013 Mark Power&apos;s The Sound of Two Songs and Todd Hido&apos;s A Road Divided spring immediately to mind \u2013 but that&apos;s the nature of lists like this one. Feel free to offer your own suggestions below the line. 1. Outside Inside by Bruce Davidson, Steidl, \u00a3220 This three-volume retrospective covers 50 years of Davidson&apos;s life as a documentary photographer. It includes the Brooklyn Gang series from 1959, which remains a landmark of youth-culture reportage, as well as striking images of the early civil-rights struggle in the American deep south. In the 70s, Davidson began chronicling what he called &quot;worlds within worlds&quot;, producing the groundbreaking East 100th Street series, which focused on a single block in New York&apos;s East Harlem. All human life is here, reflected though the lens of a photographer who once described himself as &quot;an outsider on the inside&quot;.     A shot from Bruce Davidson's Outside Inside. Photograph: Bruce Davidson    2. Before Colour by William Eggleston, Steidl, \u00a340 A selection of Eggleston&apos;s early black-and-white photography, which provides an intriguing record of the birth of one of the defining visual styles of the last 50 years. The photographer&apos;s wilfully skewed way of seeing was there even before he discovered the power of colour, as these strange and wonderful monochrome shots attest. An oddly familiar glimpse of an American south Eggleston would go on to redefine in the most dramatic way. 3. Grimaces of the Weary Village by Rimaldas Viksraitis, White Space, \u00a325 Viksraitis&apos;s photographs capture village life in his native Lithuania in all its surreal and sometimes sordid intensity. The 55-year-old disabled photographer travels through the countryside on his bicycle, recording the widespread decline after the local farming system&apos;s collapse. He cites Fellini as a prime influence but there is a darker, stranger vision at work here. &quot;Slightly insane and wonderfully surreal&quot; is how Martin Parr puts it. 4. New Topographics by Various, Steidl, \u00a344 In 1975 the New Topograhics group exhibition, curated by William Jenkins in New York, redefined landscape photography. Thirty years on, the stark, almost mundane photographs of Lewis Baltz, Stephen Shore, Robert Adams, Frank Gohlke, Nicholas Nixon and Bernd and Hilla Becher remain incredibly influential, as I argued earlier this year. This austerely beautiful book of images of the &quot;man-altered landscape&quot; of America and Germany is a testament to the enduring power of a cool and detached collective vision. 5. Kanaval by Leah Gordon, Souljazz, \u00a339.99 Gordon spent almost 15 years taking photographs of the annual pre-Lenten carnival in Jacmel for her book Kanaval: Vodou, Politics and Revolution on the Streets of Haiti. She captures the stock characters of the carnival tradition in all their exaggerated and often disturbing grotesqueness. Her portraits exude a sense of quiet stillness that amplifies the surreal nature of an event merging Vodou imagery and political satire. Dramatic and disturbing. 6. The Jazz Loft Project by Sam Stephenson, Random House, \u00a325 From 1957 to 1965, W Eugene Smith took an estimated 40,000 photographs of the jazz scene in and around a rundown loft at 821 Sixth Avenue in New York City. The building was his home, his studio and, to an extent, his world. It was also became the home of the Jazz Loft, a rehearsal and performance space that attracted Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans, as well as their retinue of musicians, hangers-on, dealers, girlfriends, visiting writers and photographers and various colourful characters from the city&apos;s demimonde. Sam Stephenson&apos;s book is a work of social archaeology and a testament to the artists whose music caught all the tumult and excitement of a fast-changing America.

Contraband by Taryn Simon, Steidl, \u00a340 Taryn Simon is best known for her strange and wonderful book An American Index of the Hidden and Familiar, in which she documented the unseen government, industrial and religious sites of her native country. Now comes this inventory of contraband items seized by customs at John F Kennedy international airport in New York over a single year. It&apos;s not a new idea \u2013 Checked Baggage by Christien Meindertsma does much the same with items retained by security after 9/11 \u2013 but it is an intriguing book that will make you wonder at the ingenuity of those who illegally import ostrich eggs and cow manure tooth-powder, as well as those who smuggle fake Louis Vuitton bags. 8. A Million Shillings by Alix Fazzina, Trolley Books Fazzina won this year&apos;s Nansen Refugee award from the UNHCR for the 10 years she has spent documenting the plight of the displaced in Kosovo, Angola, Sierra Leone and beyond. This book tracks migrants from war-torn Somalia who risk all to cross the Gulf of Aden in search of a better life. A heartbreaking and inspiring work of often intimate photographs that is almost novelistic in its narrative approach. 9. Yangtze \u2013 The Long River by Nadav Kander, Hatje Cantz, \u00a355 For two years, Kander followed the course of the Yangtze along its banks from Shanghai to the rural Qinghai Province in the extreme west, a journey of 4,100 miles. He won the 2009 prix Pictet for the photographs collected here, which, according to Kander, reflect the unease he felt while travelling through a country that &quot;feels both at the beginning of a new era and at odds with itself&quot;. A contemplative look at the new China and at a river whose banks are home to more people than live in the entire US. 10. See You Soon by Maxwell Anderson, Bemojake/Self Publish, Be Happy, \u00a320 It feels important to include a book that reflects the best elements of the small but burgeoning self-publishing industry. Maxwell Anderson&apos;s See You Soon is a &quot;photographic love letter&quot; to his Japanese girlfriend, tracking their relationship from distance to intimacy to departure. A beautifully intimate work \u2013 the visual equivalent, perhaps, of one of those coy, lovelorn early songs by Orange Juice.", "tags": ["Photography", "William Eggleston", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-10T14:14:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/dec/11/real-dubai-stopover-trading-post", "sentences": ["The location has changed over the years: in the 1950s it was Aden, in the 1920s Shanghai, before that Constantinople or Alexandria."], "title": "The other side of Dubai", "article": "There is a curse that strikes terror into the most intrepid traveller&apos;s heart. A hoodoo so poisonous that steely-eyed explorers turn to quivering jelly, and veterans of the toughest journeys on earth beg for their mummies. One simply whispers in their ear the dreaded incantation, &quot;Dubai stopover&quot;. Then you see the panic in their eyes: nightmare visions of being trapped in glittering shopping malls where simpering salesmen in Pringle golf cardies whisper: &quot;This way, my friend, the Katie Price perfumes await \u2026&quot; I thought I knew what I was letting myself in for when I accepted this, the toughest assignment of all: the search for a genuinely satisfying travel experience in the air-conditioned consumerist wastelands of Dubai. The truth is, I had no idea how things might turn out. The evening ride in from the airport was ominous: the streets full of shiny new cars, nobody on foot, immaculate lawns lifted straight from the covers of golfing magazines. At that prestigious haven of consumerism, the Dubai Mall, I wandered past the vast aquarium where sharks as sleek and muscular as Toyota Land Cruisers drifted along a few feet from the crowds of shoppers. Locals were visible (though much in the minority): the ladies wearing Versace sunglasses over their veils, the men in long white dishdasha, ready for desert life, Allah forbid that it should ever resume. This was everything I had expected. I strolled out on to the plaza beside the Burj al-Khalifa, at 828m the world&apos;s tallest building, then stood on a pastiche of the Rialto bridge to watch a synchronised fountain display set to Puccini. People of a hundred nations watched from the outdoor restaurants and bistros. The Indians did not fight the Pakistanis; the Iranians and Afghans did not clash with the Americans; the British did not fight with whoever the Americans told them to, or throw up in the gutter. Everything in Dubai seemed to be smart and shiny and perfect, like a gorgeous showroom super-car. Behind the engine grilles of this growling Ferrari, however, throbs the raw power of a Honda Civic. There is no inebriated laughter, no boorish behaviour, no graffiti, not even a token Coca-Cola can bobbing in the broad shimmering lagoons at the foot of the Burj. This was like a fresh, pure draught of safe, undemanding anodyne pleasure: Arabia Victoriana.     Dubai fruit and veg market. Photograph: Kevin Rushby for the Guardian    Dropped back at the hotel, I began to panic. Maybe Dubai is exactly what it says on the tin, I reasoned. Maybe there is no &quot;other&quot; Dubai, and beyond the facade of floodlit international brand names lies only a lifeless, empty desert. A drive the following day to &quot;the mountains&quot; did a little to assuage my fears. For a start, I was surprised to discover that Dubai has mountains that are not composed entirely of plastic bottles. The trip also involved the unusual step of passing through a second country \u2013 Oman \u2013 before arriving at Hatta, an enclave of Dubai that contains the original village of the Dubaian royal family. Out here, among the occasional grove of date palms, you won&apos;t find a Dubaian farmer \u2013 they are all Pakistanis, impoverished Sindis brought in to tend the artesian wells. Neither does Hatta old village contain any genuine Dubai folk, although there were a couple of stuffed soldiers pretending to defend the old mud fort. I rode back feeling glum. It was my hotel that gave me hope at that moment of crisis. The Orient Guest House is an unusual place in the Dubai scheme of things. Although heavily restored, it is at heart a merchant&apos;s house of the 19th century, a place of cool courtyards and breezy wind towers. Here Persian traders came to settle in 1894 after the local emir, Sheikh Maktoum, had the bright idea of making his sleepy saltwater creek a tax-free haven. (Ever since, trade has been Dubai&apos;s lifeblood, rather than oil, which makes up less than a tenth of GDP.) All around are other, similarly restored, old houses, some now museums, some spectacularly romantic restaurants such as Bastakiah Nights (bastakiah.com). Saeed al-Mulla, who runs that particular restaurant, was determined to prove to me that this sliver of Dubaian heritage was neither fake, nor dead. We walked through to the creek, a waterway about as wide as the Thames at Tower Bridge. It looked busy on the far shore and lights moved out on the water. He led me to an open courtyard where men were playing cards and dominos while smoking hookah pipes. &quot;This spot has been a local meeting place for hundreds of years \u2013 a kind of parliament \u2013 where the men discuss important issues.&quot; We sat with them, chatting. One told me how the area was saved. &quot;The houses were beautiful but dilapidated,&quot; he said, &quot;and the government wanted to knock them down. It was Prince Charles, on a royal tour, who pointed out that the old wind towers and coral architecture were worthy of preservation.&quot; That seemed like a point in Dubai&apos;s favour to me. After all, it&apos;s seldom that ageing unemployed tourists have such a profound impact on local planning procedures. But what about living traditions, I wondered. Impressive though these mud-walled buildings are, there were no Persian merchants piling up their camels and dhows with silks and spices. &quot;Go over the creek,&quot; said Saeed. &quot;Take a shared water taxi, an abra, from the jetty up there.&quot; He waved airily down the waterfront. &quot;Cross to the Deira side and look around. I don&apos;t think you&apos;re going to be disappointed.&quot;     Dubai sailor in ship's hold. Photograph: Kevin Rushby for the Guardian    It was past 10pm, but along the waterfront and in the lanes behind, the hustle and bustle showed no sign of abating. I had wandered into the cloth market, a warren of small shops filled with bolts of vividly colourful textiles, and a cacophony of languages and dialects. A Chinese trader was shouting in Urdu at an Iranian buyer; an Indian family were negotiating in English for slippers from Lahore; a Russian couple were haggling with a Kashmiri over an outrageous belly-dancing outfit. I drank coconut-water at a stall and then jumped on an abra, a flat-decked wooden boat with a central bench seat where up to 20 passengers sit. They depart when full, chugging across the dark choppy water, dodging ornamental tourist dhows and less well-lit working vessels. The number of the latter took me by surprise: big old booms and buggalows with stacks of ornate decks, hand-painted in sky blues and whites. As I jumped off the abra on the Deira side, I could see hundreds of these wooden ships tied three and four deep along the creek, all hand-built from vast tropical timbers on the beaches of Gujarat and Sind. And on the quayside was stacked tons of cargo: secondhand cars, oil barrels, boxes of shirts, milk powder, cooking oil, even a pallet of Nutella. Stevedores were busily loading the ships by hand, ferrying boxes on their shoulders, or using small cranes and nets. It was now past 11pm, but things were in full swing. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; I called up to one sailor. &quot;Somalia.&quot; &quot;Aren&apos;t you afraid of pirates?&quot; He laughed. They were an Indian crew from Surat, making handsome profits supplying a country that is lost to &quot;normal&quot; merchant shipping. &quot;It takes 15 days from Dubai,&quot; he shouted down to me. &quot;And we stay on the ship when we reach Mogadishu. Six days to unload, then we come back.&quot; For a mile up the quayside, all the way past the National Bank of Dubai, I\u00a0heard the same story. Somalia. But then the boats got smaller, less well-kept, and the sailors looked more wiry and piratical. This proved to be the Iranian section: boats taking the shorter voyage across the Persian Gulf. At this point I turned back, heading for home and bed. I was excited though. Maybe Dubai had something completely unexpected to offer: a waterfront of unique interest, a living museum of Indian Ocean maritime trade. Jumping off the abra on the Bur Dubai side, I got in a taxi. The driver was Indian and had been in Dubai for 20 years. &quot;The creek was not always so busy,&quot; he told me. &quot;Five years ago, you would have not seen any of these wooden ships.&quot; The Somali crisis, it seems, has unexpectedly made profitable what appeared a dying maritime tradition. Next afternoon I was back, talking my way on board some of the ships, drinking tea with the captains, the nakhodas. Unlike a modern container ship whose bridge resembles that of the USS Enterprise rather than a boat, these had just a wheel and a compass. &quot;We know the route,&quot; laughed one captain when I asked about GPS and radar. &quot;Do you take passengers?&quot; I asked, unable to resist the fantasy of joining the voyage. He shook his head. &quot;Maybe another boat \u2013 we are cargo only.&quot; Instead of the dubious pleasure of a 15-day all-inclusive voyage to Somalia, I signed up for a &quot;dhow dinner cruise&quot; \u2013 not quite so adventurous, but better food. Thanks to all the ships, the cruise was totally fascinating, chugging slowly past the entire fleet before swinging around in the harbour mouth where Creek meets Persian Gulf.     Sailors relaxing on dhow on Deira quayside, Dubai. Photograph: Kevin Rushby for the Guardian    After disembarking back in Deira, I\u00a0wandered into the souks that stretch back from the quayside: the spice market where every rare ingredient from the entire Indian Ocean littoral is lined up: South African rooibos, vanilla from the Comoros, indigo from Bangladesh, and hundreds more. Soon spices gave way to gold, then to clothes, tools, electronics and watches. There were simple restaurants too \u2013 places where you could get a Keralan thali dinner for just over a pound. I wandered into a shop and ended up buying an alarm clock that sings the call-to-prayer, then headed for the fish market. This remarkable institution is well worth a visit, even if you don&apos;t have access to a kitchen. Every species of the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean is on display: bonito, kingfish, tuna and sardines were familiar, but not the strange crabs, the metre-long swordfish lookalike, the gargantuan sharks laid out in the car park outside. Next door was fruit and veg, equally fascinating. Sellers hand out samples: &quot;Try these \u2013 very good Saudi dates!&quot; &quot;You like figs? These are Syrian.&quot; &quot;Have\u00a0one of these tiny, sweet bananas \u2013 from India.&quot; In the corner was a workers&apos; cafe, a gem of an eating house where fried fish and rice with salad and drinks came to less than \u00a33. The man at the next table was Indian \u2013 45% of Dubai&apos;s residents are \u2013 and I asked if he liked the place. He nodded. &quot;Yes, I love it.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I make money. I meet people from all over the world. It&apos;s peaceful and there&apos;s very little crime.&quot; &quot;Will you ever go home?&quot; &quot;This is home.&quot; Which is a problem, perhaps, for the future, because those millions of guest workers who have started to like this place are all on impermanent work visas. &quot;What about you?&quot; asked the man, staring at me over a cup of sweet, Indian-style milky tea. &quot;Do you like Dubai?&quot; And to my own astonishment, without hesitating, I\u00a0answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; Walking back through Deira&apos;s souks later that night, the streets filled with Africans, Arabs, Asians and a handful of Europeans, I realised that I had not found the &quot;alternative&quot; Dubai that I had set out to find. Far from it. What I had discovered was the real Dubai, the ageless trading entrepot where Orient and Occident meet. The location has changed over the years: in the 1950s it was Aden, in the 1920s Shanghai, before that Constantinople or Alexandria. But for now, without a shadow of doubt, that colourful vibrant role belongs to Dubai, and for that reason alone it is a place worthy of a traveller&apos;s interest. Next time, when I hear those words, Dubai stopover, I\u00a0will smile in expectation. \u2022 Arabian Adventures (arabian-adventures.com) offers half-day city tours from \u00a325pp, Up the Wadi (Hatta tour) from \u00a355 and Dhow cruise with dinner on the creek from \u00a325.

The idea had been growing for a while: enterprising young architects and students building short-lived cafes and lidos in neglected locations. This year, business and PR cottoned on. Pop-ups popped up everywhere, selling watches, healthy drinks, art, and yet more watches. A pop-up restaurant was built on the roof of the future Westfield Stratford City shopping mall, to make the place look less corporate. There will be pop-up Tescos at this rate. In 2011, in other words, the idea will seem chewed-up and overworked, but the best of this year&apos;s crop was Cineroleum, an ex-petrol station turned into a temporary cinema in Clerkenwell, London. This preserved the pioneer spirit of the pop-up and provided the year&apos;s best spatial experience: at the end of each show the curtains enclosing the seating would rise, and the audience would find themselves watching the street. Part of the charm of the pop-up is the distraction it provides from the darker, more confusing world of big permanent buildings. Here we find London skyscrapers, conceived in the boom, rising from the ground as if everything was just fine: the concrete core of Renzo Piano&apos;s Shard, going up above London Bridge station, is now Britain&apos;s tallest building. Elsewhere, things are less cheery: regeneration projects stalled, new home building stagnant. The quality of what is built or proposed is miserable. The coalition government has added to the confusion by ripping up existing planning structures in the name of localism, without putting anything very convincing in its place. The likely outcome is paralysis, punctuated with some very big mistakes. The government, depressingly, chose to blame the wrong people for the extravagance of schools built under Labour&apos;s monstrous private finance initiative. Rather than the financiers and consultants who are ripping off the state, they went for architects, usually the most conscientious and worst-rewarded of the people involved.

D&apos;you mean you&apos;re the best golfer on this planet?&apos; \u2013 and, when someone says &apos;planet&apos;, it seems even bigger than the world \u2013 so I said: &apos;Yes, I am.&apos;&quot; Westwood beams. There are a few stories of how the news of being No1 really sank in. The reality \u2013 after 17 years as a pro golfer and never having won a major \u2013 was hard to accept. Andrew &quot;Chubby&quot; Chandler, Westwood&apos;s charismatic agent, friend and drinking partner in a circle of associates of which Freddie Flintoff is also a member, says he thinks the moment came on a flight back from that tournament in Shanghai last month. A stewardess, who knew nothing about golf, approached Westwood to say he had a lovely tan. She asked what he had been up to and he said: &quot;Playing a bit of golf.&quot; She said: &quot;Are you any good?&quot; Westwood thought about what to say for a few seconds and then smiled. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;m the best in the world.&quot; Being the best in the world has been on Westwood&apos;s mind ever since he was a child. He remembers writing it down on his career advice forms at school. Ambition? &quot;To be the best in the world.&quot; Competitiveness was instilled in him by his father, a maths teacher, who turned every occasion \u2013 from marks out of 10 for diving into a pool on holiday to playing cards \u2013 into a competition. Westwood started playing golf only at 13 but it instantly became another obsession to master. &quot;Listen, everything I did in my childhood was competitive. Everything we did my dad made it into a game to win. We used to drive my mum nuts. Even doing times tables round the dinner table, I&apos;d have to rattle them off quick \u2013 because he was a maths teacher, you know, he&apos;d be shouting them out. And my mum used to sit there thinking \u2013 she tells me now \u2013 &apos;God, I hope he doesn&apos;t ask me one.&apos;&quot; Westwood is the same with his own children. &quot;I&apos;ve had my son crying sometimes, he says, &apos;You never let me win!&apos; But there&apos;s no point because it doesn&apos;t mean anything. The satisfaction you get when you finally beat your dad is amazing, that rush of adrenaline.&quot; He says it took eight years before he finally beat his dad at arm wrestling, aged 16. He pumps his fist. &quot;Yes! Done it!&quot; For a man to whom being the best means everything, it is difficult to imagine how hard failure must have hit him when he tumbled down the world rankings from a high of No4 during 2000 to an all-time low of 266 in 2002, when he finished the year at 181. He nods, remembering, and the warmth in his face disappears. &quot;I went through a slump seven or eight years ago and at that point, if I&apos;d have sat there and stared into a mirror, I would have thought, &apos;Maybe I&apos;ll never be the best now,&apos; because I couldn&apos;t see any light at the end of any tunnels or anything like that. I really lost complete form. I was always striving to improve and get it back but you never know if it will happen.&quot; Westwood, 37, does not like talking about that &quot;slump&quot; now but for everyone else it is what makes his story so remarkable. The day before this interview Rory McIlroy, the 21-year-old rookie with a close relationship to Westwood, had said that, if there was one question he could ask the world No1, it would be: &apos;How did you manage to turn your life around?&apos; It seems surprising that McIlroy has not already heard the answer to this from a man who has been, through their mutual friend Darren Clarke, an unofficial mentor to the youngster. Westwood, though, will not tell anybody the secrets of how he did it. &quot;Do you want my answer?&quot; he says, then leans forward, suddenly very intense. There is an unfamiliar edge to his voice, a tone that is a million miles away from the chirpy chappy who buys mashed potato in the supermarket and does drunken karaoke on holiday with his mates. A hardness creeps into his face and it hints at the story of a man who hit rock bottom and found it to be an ugly place. &quot;I was very, very ruthless and honest with myself,&quot; he says, eyes wide. &quot;And I would never, ever, tell anyone else what I did until I&apos;ve finished my career. Because I&apos;m trying to beat them every week and that&apos;s the ruthlessness coming out again. So I would never give an edge away.&quot; He folds his arms. &quot;I know how I turned it round but I wouldn&apos;t tell anybody. Because it&apos;s a life experience I&apos;ve been through that not many people have. And why give that kind of information away? Golf is a very selfish and ruthless sport.&quot; The unanswered question hangs in the air. Was it a specific technique? Some kind of psychology? Westwood grins. &quot;It&apos;s many different things, it wasn&apos;t just one thing. You can&apos;t click your fingers, it&apos;s not something you can buy or bottle but there&apos;s definitely a process to it all. Yeah.&quot; Who else knows the secret? &quot;Nobody.&quot; Not even your father? &quot;Nobody.&quot; Not even your wife? &quot;No.&quot; Westwood mulls this over a bit longer. &quot;I think later in life, when I finish my career, I could probably write a good book, a good read for everybody and put everything in there.&quot; While becoming world No1 has not turned Westwood into a brash celebrity, it has changed him in the sense that he feels a strong sense of responsibility to fulfil the duties of a public figure. In the past he was more concerned with being a private person, someone who \u2013 journalists told him \u2014 &quot;always put up a guarded front&quot;. All that has changed with his introduction to twitter. Despite having sworn that he would never join, Westwood now tweets throughout the day. &quot;Oh, I am totally addicted,&quot; he says, laughing. &quot;I think it&apos;s great for taking the mickey out of people and it&apos;s also great for helping the public to see what kind of person you are. In golf people get the impression, &apos;Oh he&apos;s a robot, he never smiles, he&apos;s just a golfer under a hat&apos; \u2013 that kind of thing. They never really get to know the person behind the golfer, so it&apos;s a good way of doing that.&quot; What changed his mind? &quot;I just thought maybe now I&apos;m world No1 people should know a bit more about me.&quot; Westwood has taken to it like a duck to water, competing with Flintoff for the title of Britain&apos;s favourite fat sportsman, winding up Tiger Woods, dreaming about sausage butties and getting on the beers. But he has also expressed more serious views, his self-described &apos;rant&apos; about McIlroy losing out to Rickie Fowler in the US PGA&apos;s Rookie of the Year award causing controversy, as he accused the American tour of &quot;protectionism&quot; and having a voting system akin to Fifa&apos;s. Many public figures would be tempted to backtrack over such a sensitive issue but Westwood stands by what he wrote. &quot;I&apos;d only put on there what I believe to be true. I wasn&apos;t putting anything on there to get a rise out of anybody, it&apos;s just something I felt very strongly about. People will say, yeah, rookie of the year, it doesn&apos;t mean anything, but it&apos;s quite a big accolade and you only get one chance to win it. If you&apos;ve had as good a year as Rory&apos;s had \u2026 I&apos;m sorry, you just have to put achievements up against each other and vote with your head rather than your heart on who&apos;s had the better year.&quot; Westwood says the decision is indicative of a bigger problem in golf \u2013 the &quot;us and them&quot; mentality between the US and the European tour. &quot;There was another agenda and another meaning behind what I actually put on twitter,&quot; he says, voicing his concerns over the future of the sport. &quot;And I think if, as world No1, I&apos;m not qualified to say something like that and be taken seriously, then who is?&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 14 December 2010.

His greatest contribution to political life in Taiwan was during the 1970s and 80s, when he occupied key positions in the ruling nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) party, and in the reformist government under Lee&apos;s great political mentor, President Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek. Lee was born on the mainland, in Hubei province, central China, and was educated at Fudan University in Shanghai, where he studied law, and then, in the late 1940s, at Columbia University, New York. On the defeat of the nationalists by the communists in 1949, he moved to Taiwan island, where the Republic of China continued in power. The mass movement of so many mainlanders to Taiwan, while it ensured the survival of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, came at a high price for the native Taiwanese, whose initial opposition to such a huge inward migration was met with brutal suppression. In his early career in the KMT government, Lee served as head of the China Youth Corps and Chair of the National Youth Commission. Later, he was the first president of the National Sun Yat-Sen University. It was only in the 1970s that Chiang, elevated to be president three years before his father&apos;s death, realised that Taiwan&apos;s loss of its seat at the UN in 1971 to the People&apos;s Republic of China, and its international isolation, meant that its political structures needed to be strengthened. Lee articulated these new objectives, in a speech for which he was criticised by hardliners in the KMT, as pushing for democracy and promoting freedom of the press. Over the next two decades, these aims would be achieved. As director general of the Organisation Department, in charge of key personnel appointments in the KMT (1972-77), Lee oversaw a large influx of native Taiwanese into prominent party positions, in a quest to increase its legitimacy to a population who still regarded the KMT as a political organisation for outsiders. Some of those he helped in their early career, such as Lien Chen, were to enjoy distinguished careers \u2013 Lien stood in the presidential election against Chen Shui-bian in 2004, and now serves as the emeritus president of the KMT. A riot against accusations of vote-rigging in Chung-li city in 1977, for which he took responsibility, ended this period of Lee&apos;s career. He returned in 1984 as minister of education during the critical final phase of Chiang&apos;s period as president, when some of the most significant moves were made towards creating a full democracy and allowing the lifting of martial law and organisation of genuinely independent . Lee lifted a number of restrictions on the activities of students, and was part of the group that supported Taiwan-born Lee Teng-hui when he became president after Chiang&apos;s death in 1988. His reward for this was to be appointed premier, and head of government, for a year until 1990. Disagreements with Lee Teng-hui led to Lee&apos;s departure from office. During the next two decades, he maintained a low profile as a more conservative member of the KMT. Taiwan progressed towards democracy far more quickly than many expected, holding its first genuinely competitive elections in 1996, and seeing the transfer of power from the KMT to the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) in 2000 and 2004. Power returned to the KMT in 2008. Lee is survived by four children. Two of them, Diane Lee and Lee Ching-hua, are legislators and public figures in Taiwan.  \u2022 Lee Huan, politician, born 24 September 1917; died 2 December 2010", "tags": ["Taiwan", "China", "Politics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-12T18:06:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/73307", "sentences": ["Apart from the general conversation, the minister apologized for previous mil-mil relations that didn&apos;t meet expectations; harped repeatedly on NATO, Georgia, and Saakashvili; and asserted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization must become a military bloc to face down NATO.", "(C) Khairulloyev volunteered that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has to develop to become a military bloc &quot;with one-third of the world&apos;s population&quot; to face down NATO."], "title": "US embassy cables: Alcohol-sodden lunch helped US-Tajik military relations", "article": "Tuesday, 01 August 2006, 12:12C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 DUSHANBE 001464 SIPDIS SIPDIS STATE FOR SCA/CEN, EUR/RUS, EUR/CARC, PM, S/P EO 12958 DECL: 8/1/2016 TAGS PGOV, PREL, MARR, GG, RS, TI SUBJECT: OLD-GUARD TAJIK MINISTER OF DEFENSE OBSESSES ON NATO, GEORGIADUSHANBE 00001464 001.2 OF 002CLASSIFIED BY: Richard E. Hoagland, Ambassador, Embassy Dushanbe, State Department. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: The Ambassador endured a three-hour-plus one-on-one lunch August 1 with Tajikistan&apos;s Minister of Defense Sherali Khairulloyev. Apart from the general conversation, the minister apologized for previous mil-mil relations that didn&apos;t meet expectations; harped repeatedly on NATO, Georgia, and Saakashvili; and asserted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization must become a military bloc to face down NATO. By the end of the alcohol-sodden lunch, the minister was slurring and unsteady on his feet. We suspect President Rahmonov ordered the minister to host this farewell lunch. While it was rather unusual in many respects, we believe it helped place another brick in the wall of U.S.-Tajikistan military relations. END SUMMARY 2. (C) Defense Minister Khairulloyev apologized several times for &quot;misunderstandings and missed opportunities&quot; in the past in U.S.-Tajik military relations. He asserted repeatedly that he expects an increasingly smooth and productive relationship. He said he has come to understand Tajikistan must have a number of equal partners, not just one [Russia], if it is to propser. 3. (C) Minister Khairulloyev returned several times to NATO and Georgia. He repeatedly asked, &quot;Why does NATO want a country like Georgia? Even the Warsaw Pact didn&apos;t subsume losers!&quot; He asked if NATO will improve Georgia&apos;s &quot;hopeless&quot; economy. He asked why the United States &quot;indulges the adolescent&quot; President Saakashvili. The only possibly explanation, he asserted, is to &quot;stick your finger in Moscow&apos;s eye.&quot; He added, &quot;When Stalin created the Georgian Socialist Republic, he threw in Abkhazia and South Ossetia because Georgians on their own were a &apos;fly speck.&apos; Without Abhkazia and South Ossetia,&quot; he alleged, &quot;Georgia has no hope of existing.&quot; 4. (C) Khairulloyev volunteered that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has to develop to become a military bloc &quot;with one-third of the world&apos;s population&quot; to face down NATO. The Ambassador asked why Russia and the former Soviet republics view NATO as an enemy. Khairulloyev hoisted himself up and declared, &quot;When the Warsaw Bloc disintergrated, of course a new bloc emerged for world domination. That&apos;s the historical dialectic. It&apos;s now time to confront NATO.&quot; COLOR 5. (C) This lunch took place in Minister Khairulloyev&apos;s private dining room off his recently renovated private office. He emphasized that he seldom receives guests in his private office and, especially, that only one other ambassador had ever dined in his private dining room - former Russian Ambassador Maksim Peshkov. 6. (C) The Ambassador lost track of the toasts after the tenth. His shot-glass held vodka. The minister&apos;s high-ball glass was kept filled with un-cut Scotch. Late into the lunch, the minister was slurring badly and was not walking a straight line. Nevertheless, as the Ambassador kept attempting a gracious retreat, the Minister insisted on showing him &quot;secret rooms&quot; in the ministry. Each &quot;secret room&quot; was merely another public conference room with a large fresh flower display and - again and again - another round of toasts set out. COMMENT 6. (C) This bizarre event was curious, because U.S.-Tajik military relations have incrementally been improving, especially with the National Guard, but also with the Russia-centric Ministry of Defense. Khairulloyev continues to make clear he DUSHANBE 00001464 002.2 OF 002 serves at the pleasure of President Rahmonov and may be replaced after the November presidential election. Although this drunk-fest is how many old-guard former Soviets do mutual business, it was most unusual for an American guest. It was, to a degree, a mark of respect. We would not be surprised if President Rahmonov had ordered Khairulloyev to &quot;do something for the departing Ambassador,&quot; and we rather wonder if this may have been a sort of valedictory by an old-guard security minister who suspects his days of service are numbered. Whatever, we were pleased to have drunk Khairulloyev well under the table. END COMMENT.

From Walter Raleigh robbing Spanish galleons through the Empire to the rise of the turbo-charged gambling banks, 400 years of history tells us that deep in the DNA of the British there is a propeller forcing us to forsake planning in favour of dodging and weaving to make our way in the world. It is a version of Anglo Saxon capitalism that successive governments have relied on to pay the bills and is one that Labour largely sanctioned during its 13 years in government. With just a moment&apos;s hesitation during the financial crisis, the Tories and Liberal Democrats appear hellbent on keeping the faith. Trade unionists and leftwing intellectuals admire France&apos;s more corporatist bent that eschews risk. They extol the way Germans make long-term plans and use resources efficiently and bow to the family-friendly Swedes. If only we could be more continental, we could be happier and probably richer. But those who despair of the short-termist, borrow to spend, live-for-today attitude must battle against deep roots that reach back to Raleigh and beyond and make many of us get-rich-quick entrepreneurs and sometimes amoral spivs. Of course, every country has its spivs, and British companies are no more or less likely to bribe their way to winning export contracts than French of German ones, but in asking how we deal with the financial problems we face today \u2013 our debts, the eurozone&apos;s debts, the rise of China and India \u2013 we should understand that our political and business elite believe in mining traditional British attributes to get ahead. It is why, for instance, the government&apos;s banking commission is likely to be ignored, even if it comes up with radical plans to break up or hamper the big four high street clearers. London&apos;s success is key, is the Treasury view, ably supported by the foreign office. The capital&apos;s bankers may be glorified spivs, but we need them to maintain a respectable balance of trade and not be swept aside in the next stage of globalised capitalism. These bankers wine and dine on Russian and Uzbek billions, much of it looted and untaxed and have allowed the Square Mile to become known as the money-laundering capital of the world. Yet setting aside the fraudulent practices, the City became expert at re-packaging and selling other countries&apos; debts along with countless other off-balance sheet activities in the world we now call shadow banking. Vince Cable \u2013 once a sane voice on banking \u2013 will probably be given the verbal equivalent of waterboarding between now and the commission report date to persuade him that our traditional route to riches cannot be cut off by what amounts to liberal posturing. Ed Balls, the former Labour City minister, was a realist when he told the bankers they had his government&apos;s 100% support. He has been widely criticised, along with his chancellor Gordon Brown, for praising the City when it needed shackling. Yet, at the time the Treasury considered there was no other way to pay the bills for the most basic investment and better welfare provision without letting private debt balloon and the City drink champagne. The privatisations of the 1980s morphed into the demutualisations of the 1990s and were succeeded by the PFI and private equity deals of the last decade. Somehow we must come up with another scam or two to fund the next 10 years. Brown, tapping into that British character again, also promoted entrepreneurs. His backbenchers were uneasy and unions complained about the tax breaks. But he can take some of the credit for recent surveys showing more people have adopted the status of entrepreneur coming out of this recession than in either the 1980s or 1990s. The number of single person companies and self-employed has boomed. Last week&apos;s trade figures showed the low pound was not only boosting exports to our traditional trading partners, but further afield, albeit from a low base. In their analysis, the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club said: &quot;The geographical breakdown of UK exports shows some interesting trends. We are already seeing signs that UK firms are looking outside of their traditional markets, with exports to China up 38.6% on a year earlier in the three months to October. What are we selling to our new trading partners? Some of it is Rolls Royce engines and other highly engineered manufactured goods, but mostly we are generating profit from banking, legal and accountancy services. Allied to the figures, a six-month lobbying campaign by the major banks has forced the coalition government to recognise that Britain needs its big banks. How else can we compete in the market for selling stuff people don&apos;t need at sky high prices? Sadly, the Germans have given tacit support to this line of argument. Berlin has decided it cannot rely on the manufacturing sector to generate enough surplus profit for welfare and investment when the Indians and Chinese already have vast reserves to invest in hi-tech processes and as yet little welfare to sustain. To maintain the German welfare state, Angela Merkel believes, they must allow their banks to get bigger. Only a fortnight ago, Deutsche Bank spent \u20ac9bn (\u00a37.5) on its lesser known rival Postbank. Regulators waived through the deal despite concerns that the \u20ac9bn was vital capital needed to protect against another financial crisis. Deutsche Bank argued that Postbank&apos;s several million deposit accounts would give it the necessary ballast and generate profit at the same time. At the moment, like its UK rivals, Deutsche makes 80% of its profits from investment banking. The risks, its chief executive said in a frank interview, need to be spread among a wider deposit base. Big banks need to get bigger to survive, not smaller. It is an argument not lost on the UK Treasury. Osborne is ready to override all attempts to hamper our banks. He has already begun, effectively ditching the Walker review, which demanded greater transparency on pay and bonuses. Arguments put forward by the Treasury select committee for more competition in the UK banking industry, which are likely to follow the unapologetic performance of Lloyds boss Eric Daniels last week, will also be rebuffed by Osborne. There is a genuine push to re-balance the economy towards manufacturing and exporting. And there are examples of positive risk taking by many of our small and medium-sized companies. An interesting survey by the online Chinese supermarket Alibaba.com, which is like an eBay for business buyers, found that among western nations British firms were the biggest sellers on the site. Whereas most western companies simply log on to access cheap Chinese goods and basic materials such as rolled steel or copper wire, British firms are increasingly selling via Alibaba direct to businesses in Chongking and Shanghai. We may not be selling cars to the Chinese like the Germans, but the newfound love of cosmetics among Chinese women, much of which they refuse to buy internally for fear of contamination and poor quality, is one instance of a new market throwing up rich avenues for profit. While there are restrictions on foreign companies inside China, there are few regulations on what companies sell into China and how they sell it. The concern is that rather than build great and long lasting businesses, it will be seen as another get-rich-quick scheme. Partly it is the Anglo Saxon way, partly it is the looming likelihood that Britain&apos;s favourable exchange rate will erode whenever our recovery gets under way and the main advantage exports have today will disappear. The point of looking back and tracing how our brand of capitalism operates is to find realistic ways of moderating its behaviour. Promoting the positive aspects of our trading instincts, and tempering them to be more ethical and worker friendly, is more realistic than trying to adopt the more centralised, corporatist capitalism that governs France, Germany and Sweden.", "tags": ["Economics", "Banking", "Business", "Vince Cable", "Politics", "China", "Ed Balls", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-13T00:03:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/13/chile-miners-visit-manchester-united", "sentences": ["Other global events include the display of one of the rescue&apos;s spare capsules at the Shanghai Expo."], "title": "Manchester United play host to Chilean miners", "article": "They came, they had a kickabout and they cheered \u2013 and the crowd at Old Trafford cheered back when the Chilean miners at the centre of this year&apos;s dramatic rescue were guests of honour at Old Trafford last night.

The album is available to download for free at Compacto.REC, a netlabel focused on independent Brazilian music. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicOlenka &amp; The Autumn Lovers - Sparrow       Olenka &amp; The Autumn Lovers&apos; newest album, And Now We Sing, is just about the finest folk-pop album you could ever ask for. It brilliantly blends together Eastern European-tinged folk, smoky jazz, country and a variety of other elements to create an album that&apos;s easily one of the best to come out in 2010. Sparrow showcases Olenka&apos;s Eastern European roots. CHILE       Super 45Los Nadieh - Lisa y llanamente       Los Nadieh are members of Potoco Discos, the independent label that houses Como Asesinar a Felipes (an excellent jazz trio with a DJ and MC), who proclaim to play &quot;the other kind of rap&quot;. That claim also defines the approach of this band from Valpara\u00edso, homesickly looking at the harbour city but showing their feelings by experimenting with the formal structures of hip hop. This scorn for risk is reflected on Desde El \u00daltimo Lugar, their debut, backed up by local heavyweight Foex (ex-member of FDA and a contributor to the increasingly successful Ana Tijoux). CHINA       WooozyRainbow Danger Club - Neighbors On The Rooftops       With riveting, epic melodies that soar and patter along majestically, the Rainbow Danger Club manage to effortlessly skirt the line between beauty and ugliness, light and dark, innocence and depravity. One of the greatest bands to emerge from the Shanghai music scene lately, they never cease to amaze audiences with their grandiose musicality and adeptness at crafting songs that don&apos;t seem to leave your head. Their debut EP, The New Atlantis, is not to be missed. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaCapzula - Lo Dejamos Asi       Capzula have been the surprise of 2010 in the pop/rock scene of Colombia thanks to their popular single Rock. Big things are expected of them in 2011 and their new single Lo Dejamos Asi clearly shows they can rise to that responsibility. DENMARK       All ScandinavianSleep Party People - A Dark God Heart       In late November, Danish label Vuf released the sixth in their renowned series of compilations titled The Vuf Compilation #6 - Back To Nature, sporting 12 tracks by established and upcoming Danish and Swedish artists, half working in alternative pop/rock and half in electronica. Among them is critically acclaimed one-man dreampop act Sleep Party People aka Brian Batz, whose hauntingly beautiful B-side A Dark God Heart is the final Danish MAP track of 2010. If you crave more, the compilation is available for free download here. ESTONIA       PopopMultiphonic Rodent - Printsess &amp; Page       Multiphonic Rodent is the nom de plume of multi-instrumentalist composer Erkki H\u00f5be. Mainly known as the founder member of Opium Flirt, he has been doing home recordings since 2005 and playing live as a one-man big band on guitars, percussion, keys and wind instruments since 2008. His multi-layered style is influenced by classical minimalism, avant-garde jazz and psychedelic rock, to name a few stylistic origins. FINLAND       GlueThe Friend - New Berlin Wall       The Friend play melodic indie-rock music to make people dance, or, in their own words, they play &quot;songs that are brisk, atmospheric, playful, three-and-a-half-minutes-long compact packages&quot;. Take a listen to their first single, New Berlin Wall, while we wait for their first full-length to be released early next year. GERMANY       BlogparteiDizzy Errol - Pride       Dizzy Errol is the one and only Turkish beatnik in Germany. His name perfectly describes his fuzzy, straightforward sound. Pride is the most powerful song on the album Motherlamp from 2010. Dizzy Errol is part of the artist collective Kamerakino, who recently released a compilation named Infant Munich Hits Rock Bottom, which is quite a nice sample of the city&apos;s underground music. GREECE       MouxlalouloudaAbbie Gale - Terry Torry A List       Abbie Gale&apos;s third studio album, No Inspiration, an impressive addition to their catalogue, showcases a sweeping collection of 11 songs that are at once riveting, dreamy and sonically lush, swelling and tranquil. Gripping melodies are embellished with whirling arrangements, spirited outbursts and Evira&apos;s wide-ranging, emotive, splendidly affecting vocals. Terry Torry A List feels simultaneously familiar and challenging. It&apos;s a compelling, intricate song in which to lose yourself. It gets under the skin and unfurls its majesty from the first play. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaN\u00f3ra - Opin Fyrir Mor\u00f0i       N\u00f3ra started in a dark garage on the west side of Reykjav\u00edk. In 2006, brother and sister Egill and Au\u00f0ur, along with their friend Hrafn, started as a trio. In 2008, the band became a quintet when Bragi and Frank joined. They play honey-glazed indie-pop influenced by Radiohead, Bob Dylan, TV On The Radio, The Mars Volta, The Pixies, Roy Orbison and Neil Young. Opin Fyrir Mor\u00f0i is taken from their debut album, Er Einhver A\u00f0 Hlusta? (&quot;Is Anyone Listening?&quot;), which was released in early summer. INDIA       IndiecisionTempo Tantrick - Psychoblabber       Tempo Tantrick is a trip hop duo from Bangalore. Their sound palette ranges from downtempo to pulsing EDM that finds a likely home in clubs open to both electronica and experimental. Psychoblabber falls squarely in the latter end of the Tempo Tantrick soundscape. The track features an irresistible, throbbing refrain reminiscent of Shiny Toy Guns. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarKelelawar Malam - Suara Kegelapan       Kelelawar Malam means &quot;Night Bat&quot;; Suara Kegelapan means &quot;Voice of Darkness&quot;. The band name and song title already set a hint of horror, and their lyrics were written as though they were intended for horror B-movie scripts, with old Indonesian villages as the setting. The music is heavily influenced by The Misfits.  IRELAND       Nialler9James Vincent McMorrow - If I Had A Boat       Having captivated Ireland with his falsetto folk ballads, McMorrow has signed to Vagrant Records in the US. A self-titled EP is currently acquainting itself with international ears and here&apos;s your chance to do the same. If I Had A Boat is the first song from the EP and a perfect introduction to McMorrow&apos;s oaky timbre. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelWinterhorde - The Tenth Wave       Winterhorde is a blacker than the blackest black metal band from the north of Israel. Unfortunately, Israel&apos;s north is pretty black right now itself with hundreds of acres of forest destroyed by the largest fire in the country&apos;s history with a death toll of over 40. In any case, Winterhorde&apos;s sonic path twists from symphonic melodies to sheer straight-up metal intensity, melding these two extremes with elegance and professionalism. Winterhorde will freeze your soul with its echoes of longing, darkness and unrelenting desperation. Good stuff created in a classic vein. ITALY       Polaroid(m+a) - (we)       Michele and Alessandro (hence the name of the band) are two young, talented boys from the town of Forl\u00ec. That&apos;s more or less all I know about this project. But then there are these amazing sounds: gloomy glitch electronica with a warm acoustic heart and a cool touch of fresh pop which goes from Radiohead to Plaid via Hot Chip, if you need some kind of weird recipe. This is a song from their incoming second album but you can download their first one for free at their website. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaTroker - Planeta Terror       Guadalajara-based &apos;jazz vinyl&apos; band Troker was formed in 2005 by six conservative musicians and has developed into a powerful, danceable and naughty funk-rock sound - a groovy horn section, violent drums, a sexy piano and spicy scratches that make the turntables work as a roll &apos;n&apos; roll instrument through a jazz-based structure. Planeta Terror is one of the delightfully sour tracks from their second album El Rey Del Camino. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamThe Benelux - Pet Needs Friends (Bear remix)       This Amsterdam indie quartet are fresh, frisky and dancefloor flammable. There are certainly retro guitar-pop elements at play here, such as their saucy bursts of swaggering guitar jangle. But any hints of classic garage rock are mixed with quirky synths and fun, big beat grooves. So much so that their Girl Singer EP is topped off with remixes by NON Records labelmates Palmbomen and Bear. The tracks lend themselves perfectly to dance-friendly interpretations - Soulwax come to mind in this sense - which is why we&apos;ve chosen the Bear remix of Pet Needs Friends as a party-starting introduction. NEW ZEALAND       Counting The BeatPikachunes - Nervous       Miles Loveless&apos; commanding baritone strides atop his lofty synth lines and unrepentant drum machine tracks, riding a dance wave like that of LCD Soundsystem. On the bedroom producer&apos;s song Nervous, a Knight Rider-esque bassline cavorts with a floating, flutey synth that comes in with Loveless&apos;s emotionless, almost monotone voice providing a laconic environment for his social awkwardness to shine. Pikachunes released his debut self-titled album on Lil&apos; Chief Records last month, and he has a great video for the song Shout It Out. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceUno M\u00f8ller - Your Quiet Little House       Singer-songwriter Uno M\u00f8ller plays beautiful minimalistic pop with just the sound of his fragile voice coupled with the playful tones of an acoustic guitar. His debut album was released a few months ago on the British label Lazy Acre Records. He&apos;s also a part of Team Me, a promising band that has been praised both in and outside Norway. They&apos;ve been booked to play at \u00d8yafestivalen and by:Larm next year, but let&apos;s hope Uno has more time for his solo project too. PERU       SoTBKid Solano - Solano Swing       Think of a perfect party in a place where night is eternal and the collective dancing turns everyone into a jumping mass. Now imagine the perfect song to accompany those moments and the result would be something like Solano Swing. Make space in your record collection for the amazing lounge/breakbeat of Kid Solano. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Minta &amp; The Brook Trout - Large Amounts       Minta is Francisca Cortes\u00e3o - a talented singer, musician and composer who has been in other bands and works as a session and live musician. The Brook Trout are Mariana Ricardo, Manuel Dordio and Jos\u00e9 Vil\u00e3o, friends of Minta who collaborated on her first album, Minta &amp; The Brook Trout. Minta&apos;s sound will please fans of the likes of Beth Orton or Belle &amp; Sebastian. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseMakunouchi Bento - Anchorshaped Siren       Makunouchi Bento is an experimental project with influences from musique concr\u00e8te to IDM. Their lunchbox has many more surprises than anyone could imagine. There are two main directions in their sound - the use of electronic gadgets (Spectrum, C64, Amiga, Atari) and sampling as the key for a haunting cinematic atmosphere. This could easily be the soundtrack of a David Lynch film or a rainy, gray Romanian December afternoon. Their album, Swim\u00e9, can be downloaded for free from Bandcamp. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopRachel Sermanni - Eggshells       Rachel Sermanni is a talent worth swooning over. The 19-year-old from the Highlands cites her idols as Joni Mitchell and Eva Cassidy, which makes perfect sense when you find yourself enchanted by her pure, fragile vocals and poetic lyrics. A star in the making for sure. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...The Lard Brothers - Wish You&apos;ll Never Leave Time (Ownself Remix)       The Lard Brothers have carved a niche for themselves remixing and reworking songs by other Singaporean bands, sometimes roping in outside collaborators in the process. Their approach ensures their work isn&apos;t so much a rehash of existing material as it is a means of bringing the music community together, and giving us a fresh take on Singaporean music. Their latest release, the Bonsai Warriors EP, stays on the same track but fittingly leaves room at the end for a remix of themselves, a glorious uplifting on their 2008 original. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Reburn - Outta My Mind       Reburn is a five-piece alternative rock band whose mix of catchy beats and a quirky feel has seen them rise to the forefront of the local scene. Outta My Mind encompasses the band&apos;s sound, which is distinctly British-influenced with its polished tone and a slight indie edge. Reburn&apos;s motto is that the band was brought to life for no reason other than to make &quot;music for pleasure&quot; and that they do. Stylishly so. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKImage - Empty Universe       Female singer-songwriter Image has already been active for more than a decade, but it wasn&apos;t until fall this year that she presented her first digital EP, Metaphoricalizing. Determined to make music of veracity, Image combines both acoustic and electronic elements when giving life to the folk ethos she wishes to express. Empty Universe is the main track off Metaphoricalizing and will be recorded in an English version for her upcoming first CD album. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerOdio Par\u00eds - Ya No Existes       We don&apos;t have any reason to hate Paris, but apparently this five-piece band from Barcelona does. Odio Par\u00eds, who have supported The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, are influenced by shoegaze legends The Jesus And Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine, but they also take inspiration from Spain&apos;s biggest indie band, Los Planetas. Ya No Existes, their first single, is living proof of that as it recreates the characteristic distortion of the Andalusians&apos; early releases. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseLe Days - Ring Baby Ring       Le Days (aka Daniel Hedin) has announced the upcoming release of a debut album titled Dead People On Tape. The predominant instrument may be an acoustic guitar but this is by no means folk music. It&apos;s a disturbing blend of over the top emo and confessional rock \u00e0 la Jeff Buckley. The first single in all its tormented glory namedrops Judas, curses violently and lays its heart on its proverbial sleeve. SWITZERLAND       78sThe Bianca Story - Coming Home       You thought Switzerland was neutral? It&apos;s not. We&apos;re totally asking you to take sides with our quest to bring better music to the world. Our weapon of mass seduction: The Bianca Story, a five-piece from Basel. Their sound is best described as &quot;pop taken seriously&quot; - you get the catchy tunes but with added layers of depth. Their latest single, Coming Home, is an appetizer to their second album due for release in 2011. UNITED STATES     Flag of the USA     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingPainted Palms - All Of Us       San Francisco&apos;s Painted Palms aren&apos;t the first experimental pop band to take cues from Animal Collective, but they&apos;re perhaps the most unique of the bunch. Combining a wild assortment of genres from Afro-pop to krautrock to electro-pop, the tracks on their debut Canopy EP (free download here) are equally addictive as they are artful, bringing a smile to even the most jaded of listeners. VENEZUELA       BarquisimentoViniloversus - Ruleta Rusa       Viniloversus started rocking Caracas in 2004, both live and on record. One of the many reasons for their unique sound is the presence of two bassists in the band. Impeccable performances and sharp, strong notes hit the audience like thunder in their shows. Ruleta Rusa is taken from their Latin Grammy-nominated latest album Si No Nos Mata.", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Indie", "Music", "Culture", "Blogging", "Media", "Dubstep", "Electronic music"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-15T11:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2010/dec/16/britebill-ireland-funding", "sentences": ["Announcing series a funding of \u20ac1.2 today, chief executive Alan Coleman said the plans were to expand from eight staff in Ireland and five developers in Shanghai today to as many as 25 staff within 12 months."], "title": "Dublin's brite:bill scores \u20ac1.2m for web-friendly accounts tool", "article": "Anyone who has made any attempt to manage their bills and online accounts in one place will know how hard that is, and how many clicks it takes deep inside a site to access all the information you need - let alone pulling that out to try and centralise your finances. brite:bill, which launched in January this year, is the perfect example of clean and efficient technology disrupting a outdated market. It&apos;s trying to address that problem for consumers, and it&apos;s tackling the problem from the inside out by striking deals with utilities and telecoms firms as well as banks.        The back end of most traditional billing systems are based on old and very cumbersome enterprise software that delivers itemised bills often in PDF form, or similarly closed and incompatible systems. brite:bill initially began by focusing on tools for consumers, not unlike Mint.com, that would let users pull in data from their electricity, gas, phone and bank accounts to manage them more efficiently. As they developed the business they realised the best way to make money from their technology would instead be to white label that to companies themselves. Announcing series a funding of \u20ac1.2 today, chief executive Alan Coleman said the plans were to expand from eight staff in Ireland and five developers in Shanghai today to as many as 25 staff within 12 months. Marketing and expansion in the UK and Europe will be key, and brite:bill is already making in-roads in the US. &quot;The whole thing is about user experience. Firms have traditionally been constrained by their billing engines, but we try to create a more interactive and dynamic experience,&quot; said Coleman. &quot;We felt the best way to monetise the technology was to provide that technology to brands, rather than be a consumer brand ourselves.&quot; The \u20ac1.2m investment was made by the Ulster Bank Diageo Venture Fund, managed by NCB. Seed funding of \u20ac400k came from Enterprise Ireland, as well as family and friends. This time next year Coleman said brite:bill is aiming for seven-figure revenues. The competition is two part: account management systems like Mint.com, and on the enterprise side stalwarts like Pitney Bowes and Oracle. Handing over your online finances might seem risky, but Mint et al have been building a solid userbase for at least three years now - very aware that their businesses are defined by the strength of their security. brite:bill&apos;s approach is less high profile, licensing their technology behind the scenes.

The new Waterloo East Theatre has as its first Christmas show, Striking 12 (SE1, to 2 Jan), a quirky, musical retelling of Hans Christian Andersen&apos;s The Little Match Girl by indie trio GrooveLily, with a score of jazz, rock and showtunes. More showtunes in a revival of Salad Days \u2013 Julian Slade&apos;s sunny, nostalgia musical from 1954 performed by T\u00eate \u00e0 T\u00eate at the Riverside Studios (W6, to 6 Feb). This is the show that set Cameron Mackintosh on the path to being a theatre impresario. Here it has Sam Harrison, recently seen in Avenue Q, in the lead. Another reminder of more elegant times past can be seen in Sincerely No\u00ebl, at the same venue until Thursday 23 Dec, in which Alistair McGowan and Charlotte Page perform a tribute to No\u00ebl Coward in word and song. There&apos;s plenty more for younger ones, of course, and beauties and beasts abound. The National is staging Beauty And The Beast (SE1, to 5 Jan), devised by top director Katie Mitchell, while the Unicorn Theatre for children also offers an innovative take on the same story (SE1, to 23 Jan). These are not to be confused with Beasts And Beauties (Hampstead Theatre, NW3, to 31 Dec), a show by poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy that adapts eight dark and dangerous fairytales \u2013 Bluebeard, the Emperor&apos;s New Clothes and a goat who poos gold all feature \u2013 from across Europe. Look out, too, for retro TV favourite Bagpuss, the cloth cat who makes his stage debut at Soho Theatre (W1, to 9 Jan), and a Roald Dahl offering, George&apos;s Marvellous Medicine from The Birmingham Stage Company, at the Bloomsbury Theatre, WC1 (to 23 Jan). For an interactive experience for six- to 11-year-olds, the BAC has The Great Escape (A Borrower&apos;s Tale), in which children join a secret agency to take part in a mission around the winding Victorian venue in search of clues of the tiny people (SW11, to 31 Dec). Mark Cook A Christmas Carol, Salford     A Christmas Carol.    The Library Theatre may have lost its old home in St Peter&apos;s Square, but it will be getting a new one to be shared with the excellent Cornerhouse, a reminder in these cash-strapped times that forward-thinking councils such as Manchester realise the importance of the arts to local life. Meanwhile in its temporary Lowry set-up, the company turns its attention to Dickens&apos;s popular story. It&apos;s hardly an original choice but there&apos;s every hope that in the hands of Rachel O&apos;Riordan \u2013 who directed Grimm Tales for the Library last year \u2013 that this will be considerably more than humbug. O&apos;Riordan&apos;s own Christmases future include a move to Perth Theatre, where she has been appointed artistic director. Lowry, to 8 Jan  Lyn Gardner Rapunzel, Or The Magic Pig, Oxford     Rapunzel. Photograph: Peter Wolfes    The car park of the Mini Plant in Oxford may not sound like the most promising place for a Christmas show, but there is something genuinely magical about the antique Mirror Tent where Creation Theatre company stages its annual Christmas show. Just walking inside feels like entering a fairytale, and that&apos;s what the company is offering in Annie Siddons&apos;s high-spirited version of Rapunzel. Originally commissioned and staged by Kneehigh, it uniquely features a pig, and its script gets to the dark heart of a story about children&apos;s need to grow up and away from their parents, and the damage done when parents try to wall them up. So this should offer a great deal more than the average panto experience. Mirror Tent @ Mini Plant, to 15 Jan  LG Boing! Bristol     Boing! Photograph: Farrows Creative    Bristol Old Vic&apos;s main-house family show is Helen Edmundson&apos;s new adaptation of Swallows And Amazons, but the youngest members of the family should be well catered for by this latest piece for the over-threes from the superb Travelling Light. A collaboration with Champloo Dance, it&apos;s almost certainly the first time that anybody has produced a full-on piece of breakdance theatre for three-year-olds. Conjuring all the excitement of Christmas Eve when everybody, too excited to sleep, would rather jump on the beds and pillow-fight, it should offer a novel dance theatre experience which lives up to its name. Bristol Old Vic, to 9 Jan LG A Child&apos;s Christmas In Wales, Mold     A Child\u2019s Christmas In Wales.    Clwyd Theatr Cymru offers two choices this Christmas: traditional rock&apos;n&apos;roll panto or Tim Baker&apos;s adaptation of Dylan Thomas&apos;s seasonal tale. So it&apos;s either off to China for Aladdin and a party in Old Shanghai (to 29 Jan), or an evocation of the Christmases of Thomas&apos;s childhood in a small seaside town. Even on the page, Thomas&apos;s account of snowy days and nights, carol-singing, aunties serving port and parsnip wine, and the postman delivering presents is full of atmosphere, and it should make for a magical piece of family theatre. And for children, it will certainly offer a glimpse of how a family Christmas used to be celebrated in Wales. Clwyd Theatr Cymru, to 8 Jan  LG David Copperfield, Bolton     David Copperfield.    Audiences will be demanding more of Bolton trainee director, Elizabeth Newman, who makes a fine debut with Deborah McAndrew&apos;s adaptation of Dickens. The Octagon, which had a big hit with Dickens in its 2009 Christmas production of Oliver Twist, has had an excellent year, and ends it as the most revitalised regional theatre in the country under the stewardship of David Thacker \u2013 this imaginative production demonstrates just why. McAndrew&apos;s script treats the progress of young David Copperfield from orphan to manhood as he makes his way in the world and discovers love as a tale of loss in which early childhood experience leaves its mark on the grown man. It&apos;s a show that proves that Christmas entertainment can also be unexpectedly meaty and satisfying drama. Octagon Theatre, to 15 Jan LG The Snow Queen, Edinburgh     The Snow Queen.    Scotland has a strong pantomime tradition, but it also produces some terrific plays for children through the work of companies such as Tag, Visible Fictions and Catherine Wheels, and playwrights such as David Greig. Stuart Paterson has been a favourite with both Dundee Rep and the Royal Lyceum, which is staging Paterson&apos;s version Hans Christian Anderson&apos;s tale. The Lyceum is currently in the middle of its Season Of Love, and that&apos;s a very good description of this story in which Gerda sets out to save her best friend Kay, whose heart has been turned to ice by the wicked Snow Queen.

Reconciliation between Germany and China ---------------------------------------- 3. (C) Germany and China, whose relations had soured in the wake of Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s September 23 meeting with the Dalai Lama, began to thaw when German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier met Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi at the Annapolis Conference November 26-27. At that meeting, Yang suggested an exchange of letters to clarify Germany&apos;s position on China, Taiwan and the one China policy. In its letter, Germany reaffirmed its positions that &quot;Taiwan and Tibet are integral parts of China,&quot; that Germany does not support separatism and opposes the Taiwan referendum on UN membership. The German letter also stated that Sino-German relations are founded on &quot;mutual respect, equality and a concern for each other&apos;s key international interests.&quot; China asked the German government to consider additions to the letter, but the Germans refused. In its letter of acknowledgement, China added a &quot;confirmation&quot; regarding German non-interference in China&apos;s internal affairs, which the German letter had not mentioned. Given the delicate nature of the situation, however, the German Government decided not to argue the point. At a later meeting with Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Hongbo, German Ambassador Schaefer said the German Chancellor can and will meet &quot;whomever she wants, whenever she wants.&quot; German Ambassador Schaefer noted that different countries have received different treatment following their leaders&apos; meetings with the Dalai Lama. He said the United States escaped virtually unscathed while the Austrian Ambassador to this day remains &quot;a pariah,&quot; unable to meet even a Director General at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. German Vice-Chancellor Visit ---------------------------- 4. (C) German Foreign Minister Steinmeier will come to China in his capacity as Vice-Chancellor May 17-19 to visit Chongqing as part of a series of visits with the theme &quot;Better Cities, Better Life.&quot; The visit will feature workshops on the environment and sustainable development, cultural exchanges including rock music concerts to attract a relatively young audience and professional training. The first such visit was held in Nanjing last October. The German and French Ambassadors both noted that the Mayor and the Executive Deputy Mayor of Chongqing are impressive and independent-minded. German Minister of the Environment Visit ---------------------------------------- 5. (C) German Minister of the Environment Sigmar Gabriel will visit China January 30-February 1 beginning in Guangzhou and continuing to Beijing. Topics of the visit will include nuclear safety and electronic waste. Ambassador Schaefer noted that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has become considerably more difficult to work with, particularly since Chen Deming moved to the Ministry of Commerce. Germans On P5-plus-1, Iranian Banks BEIJING 00000332 002.2 OF 003 ----------------------------------- 6. (C) German Ambassador Schaefer said that from the German point of view, the P5-plus-1 (P3-plus-3) meeting in Berlin was &quot;good,&quot; as it showed cohesion among the six parties, who demonstrated a continued willingness to negotiate if Iran stops enrichment activities. The new UNSC resolution will be a combination of UNSC resolutions 1737 and 1747 with added elements that will send a clear signal to the people of Iran in advance of upcoming elections that the Iranian government is &quot;going in the wrong direction.&quot; Germany has implemented effective new rules for banks that deal with Iran, Schaefer said. The rules are not full sanctions, but a &quot;name and shame practice&quot; that requires increased supervision for banks that deal with Iran. As a result of these rules, Schaefer claimed that no German banks are willing to conduct business with Iranian banks and even Chinese and Russian banks have increased their supervision of Iranian dealings. UK Prime Minister Brown Visit ----------------------------- 7. (C) UK Ambassador Ehrman said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Chinese President Hu Jintao and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao share an interest in economic growth, health and education, which provided a basis for good personal interaction. Brown and Wen struck such a good relationship that when Brown&apos;s visit continued in Shanghai, Wen accompanied him, despite not having prior plans to do so. During the visit, both sides agreed to hold an Economic and Financial Dialogue at the Vice Premier-level and the UK invited the Chinese Sovereign Wealth Fund, the China Investment Corporation, to establish an office in London, provided the fund remains transparent and commercially-motivated. During his time in Shanghai, Brown also confirmed British participation in the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. Brown and Wen also discussed Burma. Brown urged China to press the Burmese regime to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to hold weekly meetings with her associates. Accomplishments During the Brown Visit -------------------------------------- 8. (C) During Brown&apos;s visit, the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the city of Dongtan (near Shanghai) on creating a sustainable city. Dongtan is a model environmental city with a goal of zero carbon emissions. The British MOU established, inter alia, a &quot;virtual academy&quot; on sustainability with a large number of British and Chinese universities. The UK signed a second MOU with the city of Wuhan, also on sustainable development. During Brown&apos;s visit, the two countries agreed to redouble joint efforts to reach the benchmarks of the UN&apos;s Millennium Development Goals. The British also established a regular exchange program to allow young Chinese politicians to visit Britain. Finally, British pharmaceutical companies agreed to establish health programs in China. UK-China Dialogue on International Organizations --------------------------------------------- --- 9. (C) Wen and Brown agreed that UN should increase the number of taskforces dedicated to Peacekeeping and Reconstruction. Brown shared the view that the World Bank should concentrate more on environmental protection and that the IMF should play a watchdog role and seek to increase transparency. After a pause, Wen conceded that increased stability was worth the difficulties that come with transparency. UK-China Entrepreneurs Lunch ---------------------------- 10. (C) Brown&apos;s party included 30 high-ranking business people, as well as 250-300 other representatives from British businesses, who met with Chinese counterparts. Approximately 30 Chinese and British entrepreneurs, including British billionaire Richard Branson met at a lunch devoted to &quot;What Makes a Good Entrepreneur?&quot; The Chinese participants criticized British entrepreneurs as being &quot;overeducated, too conservative, lacking passion for entrepreneurship and too afraid of failure.&quot; Branson agreed that British entrepreneurs are overeducated and that schooling does not prepare one for entering the business world. The Chinese also criticized their own system as inadequate to prepare people for entrepreneurship. High-Level Visits To and From Britain ------------------------------------- 11. (C) British Foreign Minister David Miliband will visit China for six days beginning February 26. His trip will include stops in Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling will visit China in mid-April. In BEIJING 00000332 003.2 OF 003 February, State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan will visit Britain as a part of a cultural festival called &quot;China Now!&quot; He is head of the Chinese delegation to the bilateral U.K.-Sino Task Force, chaired by Alistair Darling on the U.K. side. Fukuda&apos;s Successful Visit ------------------------- 12. (C) Japanese Ambassador Miyamoto said that Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda received a warm welcome during his visit to China December 27-30. Fukuda had defended good Sino-Japanese relations while serving as the Chief Cabinet Minister under Koizumi, and the Chinese Government had promised that his visit would be a success. Parliamentary problems kept Fukuda from arranging his visit until the last moment, but the trip nonetheless went smoothly. Deeper Meaning to Fukuda&apos;s Beijing University Speech --------------------------------------------- ------- 13. (C) Fukuda&apos;s speech at Beijing University was the highlight of his visit, Miyamoto said. During the speech, Fukuda noted that China and Japan are both big enough to play major roles in international relations; however, cooperation between the two is necessary for each to do so. Fukuda&apos;s visit to Qufu, the birthplace of Confucius, aimed to send a signal to Japanese audiences concerning the shared cultural heritage of Japan and China. Before the visit, the Chinese had asked Fukuda to make a statement on Taiwan, but given the physical proximity of Taiwan to Japan, Fukuda had been unwilling to do so. The Japanese Embassy, among others, had been thus been surprised when during his visit Fukuda made a voluntary statement that Japan would not support a Taiwan referendum on UN membership if it led Taiwan to &quot;take unilateral action to change the status quo.&quot; French High-Level Visitors -------------------------- 14. (C) French Ambassador Ladsous reported that the French Government had followed up in several ways after President Sarkozy&apos;s successful November 25-27 visit. French officials had made visits concerning nuclear energy, emerging diseases and secure biological laboratories for extremely infectious diseases. France also plans a large law enforcement delegation including the Director General of Police, the Head of the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (the French Counterintelligence Unit), the Chief of the Border Police, and the Chief of the Judiciary Police. These visitors will discuss Olympic security, counternarcotics, organized crime, and police training. Currently, Chinese police undergo training in France, and the French Government is also considering sending trainers to China. In April, former French Presidents Valery Giscard d&apos;Estaing and Jacques Chirac plan to visit, as well as Prime Minister Francois Fillon and President of the French Senate Christian Poncelet. The French will also hold their strategic dialogue later this year, with a sub-dialogue on South America. French President Nicolas Sarkozy (along with other European leaders) will also visit China in October to attend the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit. Olympics Attendees ------------------ 15. (C) Princess Anne will represent the UK at the 2008 Olympics Opening Ceremony. Prime Minister Brown will attend the Closing Ceremony, to receive the handoff for the 2012 Olympics. French President Sarkozy will attend the Opening Ceremony, Prime Minister Fillon will attend the Closing Ceremony and Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner will attend the Paralympics. Japanese Crown Prince Naruhito is considering attending the opening ceremonies. Other Issues ------------ 16. (C) Ambassador Miyamoto noted that the Japanese Government is sponsoring over 4,000 young people as part of a Japanese-Sino youth exchange. The French and German Ambassadors noted their governments had sponsored &quot;millions&quot; of young people in exchanges with China over the years. The French and German Ambassadors also both noted an increase in Chinese purchases of lower quality pig meat, such as offal.", "tags": ["World news", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "Richard Branson", "Education", "Entrepreneurs", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-20T21:30:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/225968", "sentences": ["Russia said the UN had the key role in counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan and encouraged NATO, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan to also work with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization."], "title": "US embassy cables: Taliban using opium stocks like savings nest egg", "article": "Friday, 18 September 2009, 16:51C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 USNATO 000397 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 09/18/2019 TAGS SNAR, MOPS, NATO, PREL, AF SUBJECT: THE 2009 AFGHANISTAN OPIUM SURVEY: UNODC COSTA BRIEFS NATO AND PARTNER NATIONSClassified By: A/Political Advisor A.&quot;Hoot&quot; Baez. Reasons: 1.4 (b) AND (d). 1.(C/REL ISAF) BEGIN SUMMARY: On September 18 the Executive Director of the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Antonio Maria Costa, briefed at NATO Headquarters the results of the 2009 Afghanistan Opium Survey. Opium cultivation trends reported were positive overall and showcased a major decline in opium cultivation in Afghanistan by 22 percent in 2009, the lowest in 15 years. Costa described Afghanistan as having a southern opium problem not an Afghanistan opium problem. The report found that nearly 99 percent of all opium production took place in the south. All other provinces in Afghanistan produced only 1 percent of the country&apos;s total opium in 2009. The UK and U.S. support to Helmand Governor Mangal&apos;s three-pronged &quot;food zone&quot; project was illustrated as a successful initiative promoting licit farming in the South. Costa said the World Food Program should buy wheat at the higher price in Afghanistan instead of Pakistan, as it would have a greater positive impact on the Afghan economy. Eradication mechanisms were reported to have minimal affects and accounted for only 3 percent to 4 percent in cutting opium cultivation. END SUMMARY 2.(C/REL ISAF) In a September 18 briefing at NATO Headquarters, UNODC&apos;s Executive Director Costa said development was the driving factor to reduce opium cultivation. When pressed by Italy, the Netherlands, and Russia on what more ISAF could do to aid Afghanistan in trying to control the drug problem, Costa responded that development was key. Costa said that ISAF counternarcotics operations did play a role and were a reinforcing trend, but not as strong as the severity of the insurgency and it coercing effects on farmers to grow illicit crops. The economic situation was reported as the most important driving factor when farmers considered if they would grow poppy. Poverty Not the Issue --------------------- 3. (C/REL ISAF) The Netherlands asked if poverty was the driving factor for farmers to cultivate opium. Costa said that even though Afghanistan was among the most impoverished countries in the world, poverty was not the main factor. Costa said abandoning opium cultivation does not produce a humanitarian crisis. He said market forces caused a shift in opium prices and could easily influence farmers to grow licit crops if high market prices and revenue could be gained from them. Law Enforcement and Military Strikes Having An Impact --------------------------------------------- -------- 4. (C/REL ISAF) Costa said that the most powerful motivating factors driving farmers away from opium cultivation were effective law enforcement, NATO strikes, and measures by the Afghan government to destroy crops. He said farmers acknowledged that opium was more profitable than licit crops. On the other hand, he said farmers also feared law enforcement retaliation for growing it and, thus, actually viewed it as less profitable overall. Costa said this was a USNATO 00000397 002 OF 004 new report finding and said law enforcement retaliation was more of a driving factor not to grow opium than eradication. High cultivation trends were linked to the insurgency presence, particularly in areas with an absence of Afghan governance structures and security stability. In Costa&apos;s view, counternarcotics operations by NATO and Afghan forces alone or jointly was making an impact and causing farmers to think twice. Opium Stocks Remain High ------------------------ 5. (C/REL ISAF) Costa said that Afghanistan has 12,400 tons of opium stocks because it produces more than the world consumes. Costa believes the insurgency is withholding these stocks from the market and treating them like &quot;savings accounts.&quot; He said the stocks pose a serious threat as it could be used to finance the insurgency. Costa encouraged intelligence organizations to keep focus on the storage and movement of Afghanistan&apos;s opium stocks. Buy Wheat In Afghanistan, not Pakistan -------------------------------------- 6.(C/REL ISAF) Costa encouraged the World Food Program (WFP) to buy wheat in Afghanistan instead of Pakistan. He said the WFP had a policy to buy food for all humanitarian donations at the lowest price and understood that the total cost to buy wheat in Pakistan and transport it to Afghanistan was 14 percent lower than the cost of only buying wheat in Afghanistan. However, Costa said that if the WFP bought the wheat at the higher price in Afghanistan it would have a greater positive impact on the Afghan economy. He said if the WFP bought the wheat in Afghan markets, it would increase the demand for wheat in the Afghan economy, higher demand meant higher prices, and would, therefore, raise wheat&apos;s market price and revenue for Afghan farmers. Costa acknowledged that the quality of wheat in Afghanistan was low as a result of disease, high humidity, and pest contamination in low-quality storage facilities, but encouraged the World Bank to actively engage in increasing Afghanistan&apos;s wheat quality through its rural development initiatives. Infrastructure Important; &quot;Food Zones&quot; Ground Breaking --------------------------------------------- --------- 7. (C/REL ISAF) Costa said Afghanistan also needs better economic and agricultural infrastructure. In Costa&apos;s view, counternarcotics was not only about seizing opium supply and using kinetic force to protect the population from the insurgency&apos;s coercions, but also building better transport systems and storage facilities for farmers to access markets with licit crops. Costa praised the UK and U.S. financial and technical support of Helmand&apos;s &quot;food zone&quot; initiative, touting it as &quot;ground breaking.&quot; Helmand province experienced a 33 percent decline in opium cultivation in 2009 according to the UNODC report. Costa said that good governance and a committed provincial governor who didn&apos;t threaten farmers to not grow poppy, but, instead, convinced them through anti-poppy awareness campaigns, wheat seed distribution, and effective law enforcement activities, with USNATO 00000397 003 OF 004 eradication, show-cased the initiative as successful. He encouraged spreading the initiative in other provinces and said it would help other provinces remain poppy free. Development Key, Not Eradication -------------------------------- 8.(C/REL ISAF) Costa did highlight Afghan National Security Force and International Assistance Force operations as having a destabilizing effect on the narco-insurgency link but said development was the key factor to overcome cultivation. Eradication mechanisms were reported to have minimal affects and accounted for only 3 percent to 4 percent in cutting opium cultivation. Costa Positive On Triangle Initiative ------------------------------------- 9. (C/REL ISAF) In response to the UK&apos;s question on how the Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan&apos;s triangular initiative complimented counternarcotics efforts, Costa spoke very favorably about the initiative. He cited the triangular initiative&apos;s Counternarcotics Cell in Tehran as being composed of Afghan, Pakistani, and Iranian officials with six total locations -- three of which have been set up in the past few months. He said the Cell was heavily supported by Canada. He commented that the Cell was more symbolic than operationally effective at this point, displaying a good working relationship on intelligence sharing between the three countries historically known to be at odds. Drug-Taliban Links ------------------ 10.(C/REL ISAF) Costa responded to Sweden&apos;s question on which parts of the insurgency are gaining the most from narcotics profits by pointing to operations in southern Afghanistan. He said that there was evidence of emerging narco-cartels along Afghanistan&apos;s southern border that are linked to the Taliban. Costa said that the UNODC interviews those who have been recently released by the Taliban for an inside view into insurgency activities. He said many former Taliban detainees said that their sleeping bags were often bags of opium. Costa said the interviews yielded information that many narcotics transactions and transport activities occurred during the night. Costa said there was a grey area between those apart of the insurgency for the ideological aspects and those involved because of the financial gains of the black market narcotics industry. In the north, Costa said there was evidence within the last 12 to 18 months of new narcotics networks by the insurgency. Costa also mentioned that Afghanistan had a political drug cartel, but did not go into details. Tajikistan Can Do More ---------------------- 11. (C/REL ISAF) He also cited far too little evidence of opium seizures in Tajikistan coming from Afghanistan. Costa attributed the ineffectiveness of Tajikistan&apos;s police forces to interdict transiting opium supplies to low police USNATO 00000397 004 OF 004 salaries, a lack of motivation, and adequate equipment. What More Can Be Done --------------------- 12. (C/REL ISAF) When the Netherlands, Russia, and Italy asked what more ISAF could do to stem opium cultivation, Costa responded that in addition to development the regional neighbors should get more involved. Russia said the UN had the key role in counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan and encouraged NATO, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan to also work with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Costa also said that the international community had to fight drug addiction and H.I.V infection and other health related issues as a result of Afghanistan&apos;s drug trade. Costa said there should be a focus on transiting routes along the silk road and through central Asia to Russia. He also said a greater number of NATO strikes on high value targets would be helpful in the counternarcotics campaign. Costa said there were 380 UNODC observers in Afghanistan who were not intelligence personnel and it was very easy for them to identify opium markets, labs, people, and shipping routes. 13. (C/REL ISAF) Costa encouraged all nations to contribute names of all known narco-traffickers to the 1735 U.N. Security Council list. To date, Costa said there are no names on the list. Identifying the narco-traffickers would allow countries to place a ban on their travel, seize their assets, and establish pre-conditions for their extradition. All efforts would contribute to the international community&apos;s fight against drugs. Participation ------------- 14. (C/REL ISAF) A large number of non-NATO countries were invited to the briefing, including: Afghanistan, Russia, NATO&apos;s Central Asian partners, Australia, and Sweden.

Of this 2030 net water demand, about 50% will be for agriculture, 32% for industry, and 18% for domestic use - leaving a daunting 24% supply gap. This projected shortfall puts agriculture, industry, and domestic demand on a collision course. Exacerbating the problem further are uncertainties in the scale and scope of climate impacts on the water supply, the increasing unusability of water for agriculture due to industrial\u00a0pollution, and the growing water intensity of a manufacturing economy powered largely by coal. Industry v agriculture It is industry that will be responsible for most of the growth in water demand between now and 2030. Currently, industrial water use accounts for only 23% of the water mix, with a large percentage of that water being used to operate and cool China&apos;s rapidly growing coal energy infrastructure. The increase in the industrial portion of the overall water mix from 23% currently to 32% by 2030 will be driven to a large extent by increases in coal-fueled energy to power economic growth. In China, 21% of available fresh water is already unusable for agriculture due to pollution, and rising. This will create a growing tension between industry and agriculture. China&apos;s bread basket consists of seven northern provinces: Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Beijing, Tianjin. These regions produce 25% of China&apos;s grain. In recent years, drought increases in these dry regions have adversely impacted agricultural output more than all other environmental disasters combined. Compounding this is the rise of industrial water pollution.  For the Chinese government, this will mean tough policy choices, and difficult trade-offs. Already, countries south of China are complaining that Chinese dams are reducing water supply to the almost 70 million non-Chinese individuals dependant on south east Asian river deltas for subsistence agriculture. Domestic water shortages are also becoming more commonplace. Currently, over 65% of Chinese cities suffer from domestic water shortage. For example, Beijing consumed 3.11 billion cubic meters of water last year, despite a local supply of only 2.18 billion cubic meters, and this year was melting snow and importing water (from neighbouring drought stricken Hebei) to help offset demand. Paying for water Despite shortages, Chinese consumers are resistant to rising water prices. In the face of already moderate inflation, many fear that increases in commercial water prices will push up the cost of other goods, and that residential water prices will unfairly increase the cost of living for individuals at the margins of poverty. According to The Economist, 2009 water price increases by several municipalities - including Beijing and Shanghai and during a period of slowing deflation - led to civic outrage, with one Chinese newspaper claiming that further price increases could act as a &quot;powder keg&quot; for civil unrest. In November, China&apos;s water ministry responded to growing scarcity concerns by foreshadowing a series of coming water policies. Sun Xuetao, director general of the ministry&apos;s Water Resource Management department announced that by 2015 net water usage would be capped at 620 billion cubic meters (not coincidentally equal to net supply). Sun also announced that China would achieve a 30% improvement in water efficiency per $1500 of industrial activity, large scale improvements in irrigation efficiency within agriculture, and significant reductions in lake and river pollution - over the same period. For now, all bets are on technology to close the gap. Though significant price increases, currently constrained by inflationary fears in China&apos;s fast growth economy, can&apos;t be ruled out. Scarcity and waste Water scarcity will mean different things to different industrial sectors in different regions. Thermal coal power will be common to all regions, and is expected to make up 31% of industrial water usage in 2030, powering a significant portion of most industries. Yet non-energy water usage in textiles (10%), paper (7%), steel (5%), food and beverage (7%), chemicals (3%), coal and oil extraction (2%), and manufacturing (15%) will make up an additional combined 49% of industrial water usage by 2030. All industries will be under increasing pressure to constrain their water and water-heavy energy usage. Industries favourable to the economic use of clean energy are likely to gain competitive advantages. Water scarcity and pollution will increase pressure to improve waste water treatment. Currently, large amounts of industrial contaminants are being put into China&apos;s water supply.  Water scarcity and the emerging policy response to it will increase the cost of doing business in China. Smart companies will move fast to position themselves for technological advantage, access to clean energy, avoidance of reputational risk, and preparedness for policy change.

Barely a month seems to go by without Cable comparing others, or being compared himself, to something or someone related to it. In September, the Liberal Democrat minister was accused (implausibly) of being some sort of quasi-Marxist after making some mildly critical remarks about capitalism in a speech. In 2007, Cable made his memorable quip about Gordon Brown having undergone a &quot;remarkable transformation ... from Stalin to Mr Bean&quot;. While having his own Mr Bean moment, revealed this week, Cable was at it again. This time it was Mao. In criticising the speed at which the government was attempting change, Cable said: &quot;There is a kind of Maoist revolution happening in a lot of areas like the health service, local government, reform, all this kind of stuff, which is in danger of getting out of control. We are trying to do too many things, actually.&quot; This follows his remarks in November, when Cable, responding to criticism that this reform was ill-thought-out and moving too quickly without adequate consultation, said the coalition&apos;s abolition of regional development agencies (RDAs) and their replacement with local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) was &quot;a little Maoist and chaotic&quot;. The sense of the analogy seems to rest on the idea that the practice of Maoism was shambolic and driven forward by a dogmatic sort of zeal rather than by any more measured and well-planned approach. Is this a fair assessment of Maoism \u2013 or, indeed, of coalition policy? What, in fact, was Maoism? Maoism had two major distinguishing characteristics \u2013 one relating to revolutionary strategy and the other relating to domestic policy. The first of these was guerrilla war waged by peasant armies in the countryside. The second was a voluntarist conception of social transformation in which a highly mobilised population could fundamentally change society through sheer determination and force of will. Both of these features combined putative, proclaimed commitment to democratic popular power on the one hand with what was often brutal, bureaucratic and authoritarian practice in reality. The elitist and authoritarian brutality of the Chinese Communist party (CCP) under Mao was greatly informed by material conditions in China at the time, but the authoritarianism of state policy under Mao was also deeply conditioned by the nature, and lasting effects, of its guerrilla strategy. At first, communist strategy in China took the form of mass working class struggle in industrialised, urban centres. In 1927, in fact, a proletarian uprising took charge of Shanghai. But shortly afterwards communists were forced to flee to the countryside when the nationalist Kuomintang, which had come to power, turned on them, executing thousands. It was in rural China, among a peasant population, that Mao developed a new strategy suited to these circumstances \u2013 building peasant armies to fight a protracted guerrilla war. Mao was a brilliant and ruthless military strategist. His armies were eventually victorious and the CCP took control of China in 1949. Years of guerrilla war, however, had brutalised the Chinese population and certainly brutalised the communists. The guerrilla campaign transformed the CCP into a heavily militarised and authoritarian body in which the most ruthless figures had come to dominate. In addition, China was poor and industrially underdeveloped, and its people were mostly illiterate peasants with no experience of democratic politics. All of this profoundly affected the nature of Maoism in power. Mao&apos;s primary aim was to modernise and industrialise China as quickly as possible and \u2013 like Stalin in Russia \u2013 to condense this process, which had taken many decades, even centuries, in western Europe, into a few short years. As in Russia, this came at immense human cost. China&apos;s greatest economic resource was its large population, and Mao set about drawing upon this in inventive ways, but with little concern for human suffering. His rule was marked by bold political and social initiatives. These included collectivisation of agriculture, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Many of these were dressed up in the language of democratic popular involvement, but in reality these policies were largely driven from the top, and mass mobilisation depended just as much on fear on the part of ordinary Chinese people as it did on genuine enthusiasm. Furthermore, it is impossible to understand these measures without reference to elite bureaucratic manoeuvring among CCP leaders. The Cultural Revolution, in particular, was set in motion by Mao as part of a cynical attempt to outflank his enemies in the bureaucracy. Many tens of millions died under Mao&apos;s rule. Many of these deaths were brought about by the famine that resulted from the disaster of the Great Leap Forward. It&apos;s worth saying that, if Mao can be held responsible for these deaths from starvation (which I agree he should be), Victorian British colonial authorities can be held responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of Indians from famine as a result of economic reforms imposed by Britain in the 1870s and 1880s. Further, there are grounds, arguably, for holding those who preside over the global economy today at least partly responsible for the 50,000 deaths from poverty-related causes (22,000 of them children) that occur every day. If rich countries were as committed to poverty eradication as they are to propping up financial markets, these deaths could be prevented quite easily. Still, there was something particularly atrocious about Mao&apos;s apparent complete indifference to the many millions of lives his rule snuffed out. In view of the above, there is, perhaps, something rather obscene about Cable&apos;s analogy. Nevertheless, despite the great gulf between, say, the Cultural Revolution on the one hand and the abolition of, say, RDAs on the other, Cable has, perhaps, put his finger on something. There are some interesting parallels. First, this is a government driven by dogma \u2013 free market dogma. Second, there is a certain reckless glee in the coalition ranks in relation to the social upheaval their reforms will unleash \u2013 the Conservative MP for Grantham and Stamford recently welcomed the prospect of &quot;chaos&quot; as local government is cut back. Third, like Maoism, the coalition dresses up its reforms in the language of popular empowerment (the &quot;big society&quot; being the most obvious example), although the practical effects of these reforms are likely to be anything but democratically empowering. Cameron&apos;s invocation of ideas such as decentralisation and democratisation serves as rhetorical and ideological cover for cost-cutting and the dismantling of public services. There will be no &quot;big society&quot; \u2013 only cutbacks and the privatisation of services formerly provided for the public good. Finally, this is, in an important sense, a class-struggle government \u2013 one acting consciously and directly on behalf of the rich. The role performed by the government in conditions of economic crisis is, all too often, to shift the costs of that crisis on to the poor and least well-off. The last government bailed out a banking system on the verge of collapse. Now this one is demanding that the rest of us pay for it, and is setting about that task with great enthusiasm.

The People&apos;s Bank of China raised the main lending rate by 25 basis points to 5.81% over the weekend after inflation hit a 28-month high of 5.1% in November. Analysts said a spending boom that has pushed up property values and triggered a surge in commodity prices had left the Beijing authorities with little choice but to raise rates. The move follows a series of anti-inflationary measures by the Chinese leadership that so far have done little to reduce fears of runaway inflation. &quot;This demonstrates how determined the government is to control inflation,&quot; said Wang Qing, a Hong Kong-based economist with Morgan Stanley. &quot;Interest rates on medium and long-term loans are adjusted by banks at the beginning of every year so by raising rates now, this will have a much greater tightening effect than it would have in January.&quot; Wang said he expects three more interest-rate adjustments of 25 basis points each in the first half of next year. However, officials prefer direct measures to calm demand, fearing high interest rates will attract &quot;hot money&quot;. China has already cracked down on speculation in commodities on its three main exchanges, in Shanghai, Dalian and Zhengzhou. State-owned mining companies have been told to freeze prices for 2011, while increasing production to stabilise spot prices. The government, which threatened last month to introduce price controls, has also told several flour companies not to raise prices and increase wheat supplies, including offering subsidies to some flour processors to encourage them to meet demand. Imports of meat, sugar, oil and other staples are also likely to increase next year, according to state officials, to meet demand and calm inflation. Banks were also told earlier this year to increase the proportion of deposits they must hold in reserve with the central bank to restrict lending, mainly on speculative building projects. A further six hikes in deposits are expected this year, with banks forced to put aside record amounts of capital with the central bank by the end of 2011.

I walked alone over this gigantic field of more than a million handpainted porcelain seeds. I wrote that, &quot;Ai&apos;s field of sunflower seeds is both contemplative and barbed. Generous in spirit, everyone can get it. But will they? It will have a huge audience, one that might see it as no more than an entertaining spectacle and treat it like a day at the beach. Sunflower Seeds is contingent, oddly moving and beautiful. It&apos;s like quicksand.&quot; I gave it an unprecedented five stars. The quicksand turned into a dust-cloud, and days after it opened, Tate Modern prevented access. You can now only look at it, from a distance, sombre in winter light, inert. It is a work that demands that you walk on it \u2013 that you feel it. This is the classic story of the gallery both as midwife, helping the artist give birth to a work, and as its castrator. The artist is deeply disappointed, and so am I. A porcelain expert told me that it was unlikely that the dust came from the porcelain itself, and was more likely to be the dust picked up from the air; from the bodies that had come in contact with it. Why doesn&apos;t Tate Modern just dampen the seeds to keep the dust down, or limit access? No, it closed it, citing health and saftety issues. Maybe Tate has another agenda, and wants to put an end to unrestrained interaction with Unilever projects. On 5 November, the authorities in China announced that Ai&apos;s Shanghai studio was to be demolished, while in Beijing he was placed under house arrest after it was announced that he planned to hold a party in Shanghai to &quot;celebrate&quot; the studio&apos;s loss.

US crude fell to $90.96 (\u00a358.90) as traders digested the implications of the surprise rate rise announced by China on Christmas Day while the Dow Jones industrial average and stock markets in Europe and Asia also slipped back. Earlier, oil had reached a 26-month high as the first widespread blizzards of the winter hit the north-east of America, a heavy oil-consuming region. Oil prices have climbed 35% since this year&apos;s low in May, driven by the combination of a weakened US dollar and unusually cold weather in Europe. However, concerns that China may have to increase interest rates further to choke off soaring demand and the threat of inflation put a brake on the rally. China, the world&apos;s second-biggest oil burner after the US, raised interest rates 25 basis points to 5.81% on Saturday \u2013 the second time in just over two months it has resorted to increasing borrowing costs to control inflation, which reached 5.1% in November. Markets had expected the rate rise but the timing came as a surprise. When China last raised interest rates in mid-October, oil fell 4%. Unusually, premier Wen Jiabao made a radio broadcast to calm fears that food prices, already up 11% this year, will continue to climb. Wen claimed the government had taken important steps to cap prices and restrain inflation in 2011. Analysts said it was becoming clear that officials were determined to cool a rapidly overheating Chinese economy. &quot;What it does show is that China is serious when it says 2011 is going to be the year of prudent fiscal policy,&quot; said Olivier Jakob, of analysts Petromatrix. &quot;Further Chinese interest rate hikes will now be expected for 2011.&quot; Stock markets around the world slipped today in response to the news from China, although trading was light as the holiday period continued in many countries. After reaching a year high last week, the Dow dropped 0.21% to 11,549 while in European trade, France&apos;s CAC 40 fell 1.2% and Germany&apos;s DAX was down 1.4%. Shares in European carmakers bore the brunt of the falls after an announcement last week by Beijing that it was introducing new measures to limit new car registrations to tackle congestion there in the Chinese capital. Daimler, Peugeot, Porsche, BMW and Volkswagen, which have all benefited from China&apos;s increase in vehicle ownership, fell between 2.1% and 5.6%. &quot;They may do the same in other cities in China, and it will hurt German makes like Daimler,&quot; said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt. &quot;Banks are also suffering with the China rate hike and it looks as if Portugal will be forced to accept the IMF and EU rescue package.&quot; &quot;In the long run, this is going to be healthy for the Chinese economy, but the instinctive market reaction is that this is going to be bad for global demand, giving investors a reason to sell off equities,&quot; said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. &quot;An increase in interest rates is no good to the market, and it comes amid deep concerns of more interest rate rises early next year,&quot; said Liu Kan, an analyst at Guoyuan Securities in Shanghai. The threat of rising inflation fuelled by oil prices is also a worry for policymakers at the Bank of England and for the chancellor, George Osborne. Inflation in the UK stands at 3.3%, stubbornly above the Bank&apos;s 2% target. A growing number of experts believe that, with tax rises planned for the new year, it could rise further and make a first rise in interest rates for more than two years necessary. Other analysts predicted that the rally in commodity prices seen in recent months had further to run. Mark Pervan, senior commodities analyst at ANZ, said: &quot;This certainly doesn&apos;t spell the end of the commodities boom or the strong China story. It&apos;s a smart move that may have caught the market off guard.&quot; Commodities began to rise strongly several months ago, coinciding with the wider financial markets rally in the wake of US quantitative easing that weakened the dollar. A weaker dollar stokes buying in dollar-denominated commodities, such as oil, because they become relatively cheaper for holders of other currencies. Any real increase in demand and a subsequent drop in inventories could persuade oil producers&apos; group Opec to increase production, but earlier this month ministers left existing output targets unchanged. Ministers have said they would not increase output if a price rally were based on speculation rather than fundamentals of supply and demand. Arab members of Opec met at the weekend in Cairo, when Kuwait&apos;s oil minister said the global economy could withstand an oil price of $100 a barrel. Other exporters indicated Opec might decide against increasing output throughout 2011 as the market was well supplied.", "tags": ["China", "Economics", "Global economy", "Business", "Oil", "Commodities", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-27T21:26:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/29/ipo-flotations-london-stock-market", "sentences": ["The amount of activity in London is muted when compared with booming financial centres such as Hong Kong and Shanghai."], "title": "London Stock Exchange flotations soar but overall cash-raising declines", "article": "The number of new flotations on the London stock market soared by more than 500% during 2010 but there was a huge decline in overall cash-raising amid gloom over a sluggish western economy. More than \u00a310bn was raised through initial public offerings (IPOs), though many of the 89 companies involved were based overseas and the numbers were modest compared with those seen before the banking crisis. It was also a fraction of the global figure which is expected to reach \u00a3190bn thanks to a huge surge in activity around China and the rest of Asia. The overall amount raised in London in the past 12 months was \u00a323.8bn, down from \u00a377.4bn during 2009 and \u00a366.7bn for the year before that. Among the local companies floating in London was online grocer, Ocado, and SuperGroup, the owner of fashion brand Superdry. The biggest single cash-raising was done by foreign firms such as Essar Energy of India which took \u00a31.3bn. &quot;We have seen a rejuvenation in the IPO market during 2010,&quot; said Tracey Pierce, director of equity primary markets at the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Group, which oversees the market. &quot;Whilst last year our markets supported a significant amount of fundraising through further issues, 2010 injected some very positive signs of life into the new issues market, including a number of major wins for London,&quot; she added. The LSE was particularly pleased that it had attracted high profile listings from India, Russia, and the Middle East but there was little comment on the slump in overall cash raising or the fact that some stock-listings had struggled badly. The price of winning an IPO for Ocado was to slash the starting price and yet shares in the company, whose vans are seen on most high streets, continue to trade below its float price. The same is true of Betfair, the online sports betting operator which floated to great fanfare at \u00a313 a share in October Overall \u00a39bn was raised through 46 IPOs on the main London market while almost \u00a31bn was obtained through similar moves on the junior Aim market. The \u00a39bn raised on the main market compared with more than \u00a320bn in 2007 and in 2006 but the overall money-raising figure of \u00a323.8bn this year compared with \u00a329bn for 2007 and \u00a336bn the year before that. Officials from the London Stock Exchange were loth to comment on the reduction in the amount of total cash-raising undertaken during 2010 except to blame &quot;ongoing market conditions.&quot; The general trading position for stocks and shares over the last 12 months has been relatively good with the FTSE-100 index of top shares on track for a rise of 11% year on year. The same index hit 6,000 points last week \u2013 its highest level since June 2008. But companies have been wary of engaging in secondary cash raising while growth prospects in many sectors remain uncertain. The Aim market showed smaller firms more positive with the total amount raised in 2010 up 12% on 2009. The amount of activity in London is muted when compared with booming financial centres such as Hong Kong and Shanghai. Agricultural Bank of China raised $22bn (\u00a314bn) over there recently \u2013 the biggest float in history. Accountant Ernst &amp; Young, has predicted Europe and the US will continue to trail Asia when it comes to wider economic performance and IPO activity in 2011. But the LSE remains optimistic. Pierce said: &quot;We believe that these new [2010] floats are just the beginning of a growing, healthy, long term pipeline of issuers, looking to join our markets.
